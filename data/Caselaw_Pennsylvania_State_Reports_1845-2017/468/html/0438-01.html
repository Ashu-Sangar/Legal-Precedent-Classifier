On Wednesday, August 1, 1962, police responding to an emergency call, arrived at the W. T. Grant store located in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and discovered in the basement of the store the fatally wounded bodies of two employees, a Mr. Donald Atwood and a Mrs. Shirley Rechel. Both had been shot with a .22 caliber revolver several times. Upstairs, in the manager’s office, police found the door to the safe open and its contents missing. Mr. Atwood was the store’s office manager and Mrs. Rechel was his secretary.</p>

Although Vogel was on vacation from work, police investigation revealed that he had <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>been seen in the store earlier that day by a customer and was also seen by other people interviewed. Upon learning that Vogel had left later that afternoon with his wife and child on a car trip to Canada, Pennsylvania police sent out a teletype bulletin which was picked up by Canadian border authorities. Appellant was arrested in Ontario and returned to this jurisdiction after waiving extradition. Pursuant to a search warrant, officials discovered money and other items missing from the Grant store in the trunk of appellant’s car.</p>

    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[161,1052,1157,1131]]]'>The Commonwealth sought to prove through the testimony of a variety of witnesses that the appellant planned the robbery of the Grant store well in advance of August 1; that he knew Grant’s was closed to customer business regularly on Wednesday afternoons; that he was heavily in debt; that he deliberately lied to his ex-wife on the morning of August 1 as to the reason he was going into town; and that he planned to leave with his family for Canada immediately upon returning home on the afternoon of August 1 in order to avoid involvement in any police investigation of the crime. Appellant’s ex-wife testified that he had warned her not to go near the trunk of the car on that Wednesday afternoon, giving the false excuse that she might overturn and damage a borrowed outboard motor he had placed in the trunk. In fact, there was no outboard motor in the trunk at all. Moreover, there was testimony given to the effect that appellant hated Atwood, his superior, and a pathologist further testified that powder burns around the bullet wound in Atwood’s forehead indicated a killing at very close range.</p>

Two of the doctors’ professional contact with appellant began as early as August of 1962. The third psychiatrist examined Vogel first in 1968.

In support of this position, appellant cites <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s argument, however, misperceives the focus of attention placed by this Court in reviewing <em>Embry, </em>a case where we were concerned with the sufficiency of the evidence on the record to sustain a guilty verdict rather than whether or not the pathologist’s testimony in that case was admissible. <em>Commonwealth v.

In contrast, appellant notes the eminent qualifications of the doctors who testified on his behalf. Heavily stressed is the fact that two of the doctors had personally interviewed the appellant as early as August of 1962 and had closely followed appellant’s case from thereafter.

Dr. Schwartz’s rebuttal testimony, although perhaps less weighty than had this witness formed his medical opinion after personally interviewing the appellant, buttressed the prosecution’s position that appellant had the ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions and was able to comprehend right from wrong in the commission of the crime and hence should be held to bear the consequences. <em>See Commonwealth v.
