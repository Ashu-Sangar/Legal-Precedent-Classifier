Section 5503(a) contains four subsections each setting forth a distinct type of conduct which, if engaged in with the intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, constitutes the offense of disorderly conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> When these <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>subsections of § 5503(a) are read into § 5502, a dispersal order is properly issued under § 5502 only if three or more persons are intentionally engaged in conduct which satisfies any one of the four definitional components of § 5503(a). It follows, then, that the constitutionality of § 5502 depends upon the constitutionality of the incorporated subsections of § 5503(a). These distinct definitional subsections, however, present disparate constitutional questions. For example, two of these definitions could give rise to colorable claims that enforcement of the subsections could infringe on the exercise of the public’s First Amendment freedoms, <em>e. g., </em>“making unreasonable noise” § 5503(a) (2); “use of obscene language” § 5503(a)(3). On the other hand, the enforcement of the other two definitional subsections seemingly would not involve First Amendment problems, <em>e. g. </em>“engaging in tumultuous behavior”. § 5503(a)(1). Because the record does not indicate which of these four subsections appellees are charged with violating, we cannot know which of these constitutional problems is posed by this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

My Brother Roberts’ suggestion that we may reach the merits at this juncture is not responsive to the fact that the four definitional subsections of § 5503(a) are separate and distinct. The First Amendment analysis he would have this Court undertake would be warranted only if appellees’ indictment for violating § 5502 was predicated on conduct which is defined as disorderly by § 5503(a)(2) or (a)(3).

If a colorable claim is asserted that enforcement of a statute would infringe upon the exercise of protected First Amendment activity by the public, then a facial attack upon the statute may be proper. While the overbreadth and vagueness theories upon which appellees rely have distinct constitutional bases, they serve a common function when advanced to challenge a statutory provision which colorably infringes upon the public’s exercise of First Amendment freedoms. The vice which both theories attack is an impermissible chilling effect on conduct which may be protected. Whether that effect is generated by statutory terms which, while definite, are too broad in sweep, or by statutory terms the sweep of which is unknown because the terms are too imprecise, the infringement on First Amendment freedoms is the same; members of the public are forced to risk criminal prosecution in order to engage in activity which may be protected by the First Amendment. The public’s interest in guarding against such infringements is sufficiently important that any defendant may challenge the constitutionality of the language of the statute as it might be applied to the public at large, notwithstanding that his own actual conduct may not be protected by the First Amendment. As a consequence, a statute which is challenged on First Amendment overbreadth or vagueness grounds may be scrutinized by a court on its face, not in light of its application in the particular case before the court.</p>

This is so because when a statute, by its terms, regulates first amendment freedoms there is a significant threat that the rights will be impinged either through direct proscription which the actor cannot anticipate by looking at the terms of the statute, or through a chilling effect because the actor will be less likely to exercise his rights for fear he will run afoul of a proscription whose dimensions are uncertain. When first amendment rights become intertwined with a statute whose language is vague there exists a constitutional issue which the court must resolve without deciding if the facts of the incident involved give the challenger standing. The mere fact that one is prosecuted under a statute which regulates conduct arguably within the ambit of the first amendment and whose terms are open to imprecise interpretation is sufficient to give the challenger standing to attack the statute as facially vague.</p>

General Construction Co., </em><a href="/us/269/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="269 U.S. 385" data-case-ids="186255" data-case-paths="/us/269/0385-01">269 U.S. 385</a>, 391, <a href="/us/269/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="269 U.S. 385" data-case-ids="186255" data-case-paths="/us/269/0385-01">46 S.Ct. 126</a>, 127, <a href="/us/269/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="269 U.S. 385" data-case-ids="186255" data-case-paths="/us/269/0385-01">70 L.Ed. 322</a>, 328 (1926). As such, this Court should declare Section 5502 unconstitu+tional on vagueness grounds.</p>
    <p id="b330-9" data-blocks='[["BL_330.10",330,[252,1763,1152,590]],["BL_331.1",331,[151,321,1153,804]]]'>Under Section 5502, a person is guilty of a crime if he or she fails to obey a police dispersal order given when “three or more persons are participating in a course of disorderly conduct which causes or may reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.” By proscribing any conduct which “causes or may reasonably be expected to cause serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarm,” the statute fails to establish a specific definition of illegal activity and provides law enforcement officials with nothing more than a subjective test for making arrests. <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>Indeed, the statute is unclear and presently without benefit of our judicial clarification. What is “serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarm”? Those are all value words which depend entirely upon the personal views of each of us. What constitutes annoyance to one person is not always annoyance to another. Nor does inconvenience mean the same to all. For instance the sounds of a parade, or even the parade itself, may cause great public inconvenience to many, while at the same time be a source of pleasure to others. Therefore, since Section 5502 fails to give notice as to what acts are criminal and does not set standards to guide law enforcement officials in performing their duties, I would declare the statute unconstitutional, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
    <p id="Ab-" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[147,1154,1156,968]]]'>The majority, however, declines from ruling on the constitutionality of Section 5502 because of the lack of any facts in the record on which to apply appellees’ claim of vagueness. I disagree. A facial attack on a statute is indeed proper if the scope of the statute is so broad that it could be read as restricting or forbidding conduct which is protected by the First Amendment. <em>See Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em><a href="/us/415/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="415 U.S. 130" data-case-ids="6172554" data-case-paths="/us/415/0130-01">415 U.S. 130</a>, <a href="/us/415/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="415 U.S. 130" data-case-ids="6172554" data-case-paths="/us/415/0130-01">94 S.Ct. 970</a>, <a href="/us/415/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="415 U.S. 130" data-case-ids="6172554" data-case-paths="/us/415/0130-01">39 L.

Section 5502, as it now stands, without a narrowing interpretation by this Court, is certainly “capable of reaching expression sheltered by the First Amendment.” <em>Smith v. Goguen, </em><a href="/us/415/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="415 U.S. 566" data-case-ids="6178884" data-case-paths="/us/415/0566-01">415 U.S. at 573</a>, 94 S.Ct. at 1247, 39 L.Ed.2d at 612. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that appellees’ conduct might not fall within the boundaries of the First Amendment’s protection, Section 5502 can be scrutinized on its face.</p>
