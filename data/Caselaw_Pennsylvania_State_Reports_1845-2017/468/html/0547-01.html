Brooks, was tried before a judge and jury and, after four days of trial, was found guilty of murder in the first degree, aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime, and criminal conspiracy. Post-verdict motions were denied on January 31, 1975, and sentence of life imprisonment was imposed for the murder conviction. Maximum sentences, to be served concurrently, were imposed for the other offenses. The murder conviction was appealed directly to this Court; the other convictions, which were appealed to the Superior Court, were transferred here.</p>

While at the scene of the crime, Detective O’Brien received information from witnesses to the shooting, and other young people in the area, that the “Cedar Street gang” was responsible, and that this gang had been involved in several similar incidents in the past few weeks. Detective O’Brien then began to patrol the area looking for suspects, and “ . . . tried to cultivate more information.” (N.T.Supp. 5). At approximately 11:30 p. m., December 10, 1973, approximately three hours after the shooting, Detective O’Brien received information from police headquarters that an anonymous phone caller had stated that “Brooks from Baltimore Avenue was one of the persons responsible for this shooting.” Detective O’Brien also received information that several persons responsible for the shooting were in a bar located at Rogers Street and Baltimore Avenue. The source of this information does not appear on the record. At approximately 12:45 a. m., December 11, 1973, while patrolling near the intersection of Rogers Street and Christian <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>Street (near the location of the bar named by the anonymous caller) in an effort to locate members of the Cedar Street <em>gang </em>and obtain information Detective O’Brien stopped appellant who was walking on the street to ask him some questions. The detective’s intent in questioning appellant was to ascertain the validity of the anonymous telephone tip, and to ascertain the identity of “Brooks from Baltimore Avenue.” At this time the detective did not know appellant’s identity. In fact, he knew nothing about appellant but suspected that the person walking along the street might be a Cedar Street gang member. Detective O’Brien asked appellant his name and was told “Richard Brooks.” The detective then asked appellant where he lived, and upon hearing that appellant lived on Baltimore Avenue, placed appellant under arrest. Appellant was then taken to the police administration building, arriving there at approximately 1:20 a. m., December 11, 1973. He was given standard <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and indicated his desire to give a statement. At that time he admitted driving a car similar to the one used in the shooting, but denied any complicity in the act. This interview ended at 2:05 a. m. During the course of this interview appellant also indicated he would consent to a polygraph examination. Appellant was eventually taken to the polygraph examination room and was seen by the polygraph examiner at approximately 2:55 a. m. The polygraph examiner spoke with appellant concerning the facts surrounding the polygraph examination from 3:05 a. m., until 3:50 a. m. At 3:50 a. m., prior to the giving of the actual polygraph examination, appellant admitted to the polygraph examiner that he had been involved in the shooting, and gave certain details as to the events of the preceding evening. Subsequently, appellant also gave detectives the key to his apartment where a .22 caliber rifle was found and confiscated. This statement, and the rifle along with testimony from the medical examiner that decedent died as <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>a result of a gunshot wound of the chest, and that a .22 caliber bullet with markings similar to test bullets fired from appellant’s rifle had been removed from the deceased’s body, was introduced into evidence at appellant’s trial.</p>

Almost six weeks later the police received an anonymous phone call from a youth who said that one of the participants in that robbery was named “Primo’ and that ‘Primo’ lived in a certain area of Philadelphia. Two days later, appellant, George Betrand, a juvenile, known to the police as ‘Primo’, was arrested without a warrant. He was taken immediately to the station house and placed in a locked interrogation room where he remained for approximately two hours. A detective subsequently arrived and advised him of his rights by reading from the standard police interrogation card. After approximately one-half hour of questioning, appellant gave an oral statement admitting his involvement in the robbery.”</blockquote>

I agree with the majority that appellant was arrested on the basis of an uncorroborated tip by an unidentified informant whose reliability was never established.
