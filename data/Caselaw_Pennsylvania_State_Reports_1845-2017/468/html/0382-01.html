      <p id="b453-7" data-blocks='[["BL_453.7",453,[240,1926,1112,411]]]'>The Board contends that reinstatement proceedings involve “allegations of misconduct by ... an attorney,” and thus are covered by the express language of the rule. The context in which this language appears, however, strongly suggests that Rule 17-23 is directed exclusively towards the initial disciplinary proceedings. The confidentiality provisions of the rule are closely tied into and limited by the entry by this Court of an order for the imposition of public discipline. As such an order can only issue upon a review of a disciplinary proceeding, it is reasonable to assume that Rule 17-23 was not intended to apply in other instances.</p>

Because Mr. Gerber’s letter of resignation was prompted by a conviction for a crime, petitioners argue that the instant proceeding is one predicated on that conviction and, for that reason, should be made public. Petitioner’s argument is bottomed on the provision in Rule 17-23, <em>supra </em>n. 5, which excepts from its confidentiality protections investigations predicated on a conviction for a crime. Petitioner’s argument, however, misperceives the nature of the reinstatement proceedings. While the egregiousness of a disbarred lawyer’s offense certainly has a bearing on whether reinstatement is warranted, nonetheless the main thrust of the proceeding is whether the disciplined attorney is now morally fit and technically competent to engage in the practice of law. See ABA Committee on Evaluation of Disciplinary Enforcement, Problems and Recommendations in Disciplinary Enforcement 150-155 (1970). The proceedings are not predicated upon the conviction of a crime as that term is used in Rule 17-23.</p>

The majority fails to recognize the lesson taught by experience: that openness in public affairs is the foundation of a free society. I dissent.</p>

      <p id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[185,1810,1147,378]]]'> The majority incorrectly relies on <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/465/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="465 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1712696" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0104-01">465 Pa. 104</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="465 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1712696" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0104-01">348 A.2d 376</a> (1975), and ABA Committee on Evaluation of Disciplinary Enforcement, Problems and Recommendations in Disciplinary Enforcement 139 (1970) (“Clark Report”). (See majority opinion, supra at 781 n. 7.) Both of these discuss the privacy interests of practicing attorneys facing disciplinary charges. Here, respondent is not an attorney in good standing but rather one who has been disbarred and is seeking reinstatement. <em>McLaughlin </em>and the Clark Report therefore do not support the majority’s position.</p>

See <em>McLaughlin v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </em>supra at 119, 120 n. 1, <a href="/pa/465/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="465 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1712696" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0104-01">348 A.2d at </a><a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a><a href="/pa/465/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="465 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1712696" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0104-01">383</a>, 384 n. 1 (dissenting opinion of Roberts, J.). As a result, the majority did not examine that record and denied the public access to important public business. Nothing could be more unwise and contrary to the public interest than the majority’s continued approval of secrecy in court proceedings involving public business.</p>
