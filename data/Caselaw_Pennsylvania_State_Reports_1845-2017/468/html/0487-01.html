The proprietor died a week later as a result of gunshot wounds received during the robbery. Appellant, a sixteen year old with an I.Q. of 70, was first contacted by Reading police at approximately 4:00 p. m., on November 7, when Officer Charles Hymon stopped appellant on the street. Hymon, who was investigating a gun incident unrelated to this case, asked appellant whether he was carrying a weapon. Appellant stated that he was unarmed. Hymon requested appellant to accompany him to the officer’s home, which was nearby. Apparently, numerous other neighborhood residents joined the two and a discussion ensued in front of Hymon’s home concerning a recent neighborhood fight.</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[150,1297,1159,526]]]'>Hymon decided that he needed assistance in handling what he described as a “neighborhood squabble” and called city hall. Uniformed police arrived at the scene shortly thereafter, and several people, including appellant, were then transported by police car to the police station for questioning. Hymon stated at the suppression hearing that, in his view, appellant had committed no crime in the officer’s presence and that appellant had not been placed under arrest prior to being taken to city hall.</p>

Marmarou testified that, after being given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, appellant admitted his involvement in numerous armed robberies in the city. Orlando testified that he told appellant that the police suspected him of being involved in the robbery-murder that is the subject of this appeal. At approximately 6:00 p. m., appellant admitted that he did participate in the crime but denied that he had either entered the store or shot the victim.</p>
