That same evening, Detective Porter, twice went to appellee’s home in an attempt to question him concerning the stabbing. Appellee was not home and Porter left word with his mother asking that appellee come to Police Headquarters for questioning. On October 6, appellee went to the Headquarters and after questioning was released. Two days later, appellee was taken to Headquarters by police officers for a second round of questioning.

Beatty was interviewed a second time and gave a four page statement which he read and signed. This statement stated that Beatty had witnessed Dickerson stab Askew and corroborated portions of other information Porter had in his possession.

Judge Stout also characterized the statements of the three witnesses who had heard that Dickerson had stabbed Askew as neighborhood gossip. This we do not dispute; these statements were clearly hearsay. However, hearsay evidence is considered valid information in testing probable cause to arrest. <em>Draper v.

The majority states that the four cases relied on by the suppression court do not support its result because “they are not factually similar to the instant case.” However, it fails to recognize the distinct procedural posture of this case. In all four of those cases, this Court reversed a suppression court’s determination that probable cause existed. <em>Commonweath </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em><a href="/pa/460/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="460 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="482818" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0498-01">460 Pa. 498</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="460 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="482818" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0498-01">333 A.2d 883</a> (1975); <em>Commonwealth v.

In each case this Court applied the limited standard of appellate review, accepting all of the Commonwealth’s evidence, including the credibility of its witnesses, as true. The same benefit accorded the Commonwealth’s evidence in those cases must be given to appellant’s evidence here. The majority’s analysis effectively denies appellant the same evidentiary benefit afforded the Commonwealth when it successfully opposes a defense motion to suppress evidence.</p>

This witness concluded that appellant was responsible for the killing because a girl in the neighborhood, who did not see the killing, blamed it on the appellant, and because he did not answer when the witness asked him if he was responsible. It does not follow that because hearsay is admissible at suppression hearings that the reliability of these statements is conclusively established. Nor is the trial court required to adopt the same inferences as the witness. The record adequately supports the trial court’s finding that this highly dubious testimony was not sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause. When the majority relies on this testimony to overturn the suppression order it ignores the proper scope of appellate review and substitutes its findings of fact for those of the trial court.</p>
