Newbauer, Incorporated (Newbauer, Inc.) and its president and sole shareholder, William H. Newbauer (Newbauer) by College Watercolor Group, Inc. (Watercolor, Inc). In one of the appeals, No. 281 January Term, 1974, Newbauer, Inc., and Newbauer appeal from the order of the trial court which (1) enjoined Newbauer, Inc., and Newbauer from utilizing appellee’s trade secrets involving water color reproductions, (2) awarded damages to Watercolor, Inc., because its trademark had been improperly used, (8) ordered Newbauer, Inc., and Newbauer to pay to Watercolor, Inc., monies due as the result of the sale of watercolor products, and (4) rescinded a contract for the sale by Watercolor, Inc., of original watercolors to Newbauer. In the second appeal at No. 546 January Term, 1974, Newbauer, Inc., and Newbauer appeal from an order dissolving a preliminary injunction bond filed by Watercolor, Inc., when the trial court issued a preliminary injunction which was later modified. In the third appeal, No. 296 January Term, 1974, Watercolor, Inc., appeals from the trial court’s order modifying its earlier order holding Newbauer, Inc., and Newbauer in contempt for violating a preliminary injunction.</p>

It also held appellants jointly and severally liable to the appellee for the sum of $36,040 owed to appellee as a result of sales of appellee’s product through appellant Newbauer, Inc.

Since 1968, the appellee has been marketing these reproductions under the properly registered trademark “Gray’s” Watercolors.</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[141,471,1150,532]]]'>In October, 1971, appellant Newbauer, met the appellee’s president, Paul D. McConaughy, at a banking convention. This meeting led to an arrangement whereby appellant, Newbauer, Inc., was to sell the appellee’s reproductions in a five-state area. The agreement called for Newbauer, Inc., to receive a commission for each reproduction and frame sold through its efforts. The billing of financial institutions was to be done by Newbauer, Inc., and the proceeds were to be turned over to the appellee.</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[145,1028,1152,859]]]'>Throughout the life of the agreement, appellant, Newbauer, acting for his corporation, Newbauer, Inc., conducted a vigorous campaign on behalf of appellee’s product. During the latter part of 1971 and the first quarter of 1972, he succeeded in generating a large volume of sales of promotional campaigns to financial institutions. At certain times, the appellee was unable to produce enough reproductions to meet the demand generated by the sales campaign. In late February, 1972, Newbauer brought his financial advisor, Thomas Kelly, to appellee’s plant in order to evaluate the efficiency of the production methods and to suggest improvements. At this time certain of the confidential techniques utilized by the appellee were disclosed to both Newbauer and Kelly. Kelly later made a second visit to appellee’s plant in the company of Frederick Dello, an artist.</p>
    <p id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.7",177,[148,1914,1150,424]],["BL_178.1",178,[261,295,1150,259]]]'>Shortly thereafter, Newbauer asked Dello to devise a method for reproducing watercolor paintings and in March, 1972, Dello became an employee of Newbauer, Inc. At approximately the same time Kelly was commissioned by Newbauer to develop a process for the mass production of watercolors. In mid April, 1972, Newbauer and Dello visited the home and studio of Ernest Walden, appellee’s artist. At that time they both saw <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>the appellee’s process in the studio. A few days later, Newbauer asked Walden to leave appellee’s employ and come to work for him, but Walden refused. Newbauer also asked one of his own employees to spy on the appellee, but the spying was never carried out.</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[253,585,1156,969]]]'>Newbauer also entered into a personal contract to purchase sixty-three (63) original watercolor paintings from the appellee. At the time this contract was made, Newbauer told appellee’s president, Paul D. Mc-Conaughy, that he wanted the paintings for his own private satisfaction and for tax purposes. The parties agreed that delivery would not be made until the “programs” for which the paintings were done had been completed. Prior to the completion of the “programs” Newbauer appeared at the appellee’s studio, knowing Mc-Conaughy would be away visiting the Bank of Delaware because of certain complaints from that customer. Newbauer told the chief supervisor that he needed the original paintings in order to compare them to the copies because of complaints from the Bank of Delaware. He took fifty-four (54) originals which he then used to reproduce copies. These copies were passed off as the appellee’s product, including the use of the trademark “Gray’s.”</p>
    <p id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.6",178,[245,1593,1156,533]]]'>During the life of the agreement appellant Newbauer became a minor shareholder in the appellee corporation. Subsequently, he expressed an interest in increasing his holding and insisted that appellee’s president sell him a controlling interest in the corporation. Unless Mc-Conaughy assented, Newbauer threatened to have Newbauer, Inc., refuse to pay appellee $36,000 that was owing to it from sales of promotional campaigns. The parties have stipulated that this money is owed by appellant, Newbauer, Inc., to the appellee, Watercolor, Inc.</p>

Appellants’ attorney, however, was present at all times. This procedure was not objected to at trial and was, in fact, agreed upon by the parties. Consequently, appellants have waived any objections to the in camera procedure by failing to raise them at trial. <em>Dilliplaine v.

    <p id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[143,720,1157,910]]]'> Appellants next contend that because all of the witnesses who testified concerning the uniqueness of appellee’s process had some interest in the appellee corporation, their testimony, absent corroboration from an independent source, is insufficient to establish a trade secret. A witness, however, who has an interest in the proceedings is not incompetent to testify. Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, § 4, 28 P.S. § 314; <em>Anderson v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., </em><a href="/pa/423/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="423 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1903152" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0550-01">423 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20A.2d%20548" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="225 A.2d 548">225 A.2d 548</a> (1967). A witness’s interest may be considered when judging his credibility but that interest does not render one incompetent to testify. The appellee’s witnesses testified to all the elements of a trade secret as set forth in <em>Van Products Co. v. General Welding and Fabricating Co., </em><a href="/pa/419/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="419 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1896850" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0248-01">419 Pa. 248</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="213 A.2d 769">213 A.2d 769</a> (1965), and that testimony properly supports the trial court’s conclusion that the appellee possessed a trade secret.</p>

In <em>Van Products, </em>supra, the Court held that before one is entitled to claim legal protection for a trade secret it must in fact be maintained as a secret. Appellants argue that the appellee’s willing disclosure of the trade secrets to appellant Newbauer, Inc., a competitor, destroys its claim for legal protection. The parties, however, cannot be classified as competitors. At the time that Newbauer and Kelly gained access to the secret process, the parties were cooperating in a mu<a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>tually beneficial arrangement. Under that arrangement, Newbauer, Inc., was to market the appellee’s reproductions in a five state area. Appellants’ marketing endeavors were very successful and production was not meeting demand. It was at this point that Newbauer introduced Kelly to the appellee’s president, McConaughy, stating that Kelly might suggest methods of speeding up production upon reviewing the production process. It was for this reason that Newbauer and Kelly were able to gain access to the secret process. We do not have here the type of widespread disclosure found fatal in <em>Van Products, </em>supra, where the trade secret had been published in a patent application and was widely described in trade literature.</p>
    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[251,1113,1159,577]]]'>Appellants further content that, even if the appellee’s disclosure to Newbauer and Kelly did not destroy its right to protection, they should not be enjoined from using it because there was no violation of a position of trust and confidence in obtaining the secret, nor was the secret discovered by improper means. The standard for determining whether one is liable for the use or disclosure of another’s trade secret is set forth in the <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>§ 757 (1939) and in <em>Van Products, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/419/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="419 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1896850" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0248-01">419 Pa. at 25, n. 3</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="213 A.2d 769">213 A.2d at 774, n. 3</a>.

Since §§ <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>757(a) and (b) state alternative grounds for liability, if the trial court is correct in either of its conclusions, appellants were properly held liable.</p>
    <p id="b181-4" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[126,498,1150,478]]]'>The trial court’s conclusion that improper means were used to discover the secret is based on Newbauer’s misrepresentations to gain access to the secret. Newbauer told McConaughy that Kelly was brought to the plant to evaluate the production process in order to speed up production. The primary purpose for the visit, however, was for Kelly to obtain information so that Newbauer could produce his own reproductions using the appellee’s process.</p>
    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[125,1006,1153,534]]]'>This conclusion is not only supported by the evidence; it is inescapable. In addition to the misrepresentation, Newbauer attempted to hire appellee’s key personnel and to spy on the appellee’s operations. While neither of these attempts bore fruit they tend to confirm the conclusion that Kelly’s trip to the plant was for the primary purpose of gathering information. Furthermore, appellants’ reproduction of watercolor paintings within six (6) to eight (8) weeks after the visit confirms the information gathering purpose of the visit.</p>

Ours is a competitive business system in which it is only natural for one businessman to observe and discover what the competition is doing. This Court, however, will not put a stamp of approval on the use of misrepresentations and espionage as means that fall within the “generally accepted standards of <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>commercial morality and reasonable conduct.” Having found a clear violation of Section 757(a), we need not consider whether there was also a violation of Section 757(b).</p>

It was agreed that delivery would not be made until the “programs” for which the paintings had been made had been completed. Prior to the completion of the “programs” Newbauer appeared at appellee’s studio, knowing that its president would be visiting the Bank of Delaware. He spoke with the chief supervisor and told her that he needed the originals to compare to the copies because there had been complaints from the Bank of Delaware. He took fifty-four of the originals with him but never appeared at the Bank of Delaware. He used the originals to reproduce copies and then passed them off as appellee’s product, including the use of the trademark “Gray’s” watercolors.

At the time that the contract was made Newbauer was busy setting up his own operation for reproducing watercolor paintings. Within one month of the making of the contract, Newbauer was using the paintings to make his own reproductions as part of his total scheme to interfere with the appellee’s business operation. Finally, Newbauer surreptitiously obtained possession of the paintings prior to the date when he was supposed to receive possession. Under these circumstances, the conclusion is inescapable that Newbauer knowingly misrepresented his intention in order to induce appellee to sell him the paintings. Such fraud justifies the trial court’s rescission of the contract.</p>

This fact alone supports the conclusion that Newbauer did not keep his personal interests separate from the corporate interests. He used his total control over the corporation in an attempt to gain a personal benefit.

The bond or cash security is to be conditioned “that if the injunction is dissolved because improperly granted . . . the plaintiff shall pay to any person injured all damages sustained by reason of granting the injunction and all legally taxable costs and fees, . . . .” The preliminary injunction bond filed by the appellee did contain the condition required by Pa.R.C.P. Rule 1531(b). The purpose of that bond was to protect appellants in the event that the preliminary injunction was improperly granted and damages were sustained thereby. Since the permanent injunction issued was narrower than the preliminary injunction, the appellants may be able to prove damages in a proper proceeding. In that event, appellants are entitled to look to the bond for recovery. The trial court improperly dissolved the preliminary injunction bond. The order dissolving that bond must therefore be vacated and the bond remain in effect according to it original terms.</p>

Appellees within a week of the issuance of the contempt order filed exceptions in the trial court. After considering the exceptions, the trial court concluded that that portion of the preliminary injunction which appellees had violated had been improperly issued. The trial court, however, did not reverse the contempt order because it concluded that the appellees were bound to obey even an improperly issued preliminary injunction until successfully challenged and dissolved by court order.
