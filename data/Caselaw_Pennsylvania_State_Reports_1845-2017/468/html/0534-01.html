The majority of the Superior Court, refused to so extend <em>Sheehan. </em>The dissenters on the Superior Court, quoting from a footnote in <em>Sheehan, </em>supra, indicating that recent United States Supreme Court cases “seem to stand for the proposition that the possibility of either civil or criminal collateral consequences forecloses application of the mootness doctrine,” <a href="/pa-super/232/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="232 Pa.

    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[247,567,1162,1071]]]'>Prior to our ruling in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Ulmer v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/421/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="421 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1900315" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0040-01">421 Pa. 40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20233" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="218 A.2d 233">218 A.2d 233</a> (1966), Pennsylvania followed the so-called “traditional” rule. The <em>Ulmer </em>decision introduced the “collateral criminal consequences” rule, and allowed an attack on a prior criminal conviction where the conviction directly affected sentences <em>presently being served </em>by the petitioner. <em>Commonwealth v. Sheehan, </em>allowed a hearing on a post-conviction challenge to a conviction where the petitioner had been subsequently arrested and had good reason to believe that, if convicted, he would face a prison sentence since a subsequent conviction would render him a second offender, and because the trial court in which petitioner was convicted had established a policy of imposing sentences of imprisonment for a second offense on drunk driving charges, whereas, first offenders were subjected only to fine. Thus, in both <em>Ulmer, </em>supra, and <em>Sheehan, </em>supra, criminal consequences existed. It is conceded by appellant in the present case that no criminal consequences exist here.</p>
    <p id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[241,1666,1158,581]]]'>In his PCHA petition, however, appellant alleged the existence of severe civil and social consequences, including but not limited to, the forced resignation of his position as Dean of the Vermont Law School, voting restrictions in several states, and the fear of being impeached should he ever testify on his own behalf or on behalf of someone else in a trial court case. Appellant now argues that <em>Sheehan </em>should be extended to permit a challenge to convictions where the sentence has been satisfied if collateral civil consequences are shown to flow from said conviction.</p>

Several reasons compel this conclusion. First, <em>Sheehan </em>dealt with a factual setting which did not require an answer to the question presented by the instant appeal. The <em>Sheehan </em>court adopted the position it did simply because that was all that was required by the facts of the case before it. The <em>Sheehan </em>opinion, however, indicates that the court was aware of the possibility that a case such as this might arise, and hinted at least, at the position which this Court would adopt if, and when, such a case came before us. By taking the position it did, the <em>Sheehan </em>court was by no means implicitly rejecting the more liberal view as to the applicability of the mootness doctrine to cases where the judgment of sentence had been satisfied.

In the instant case it is alleged, among other things, that as a direct result of the allegedly invalid 1960 conviction, the petitioner was forced to resign his position as Dean of the Vermont Law School. We are not prepared to <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>conclude that a lifetime of forced unemployment, or employment in a job other than in one’s chosen profession, is a consequence any less severe than an additional few weeks incarceration. Nor are we prepared to hold that drawing the dividing line between civil and criminal consequences flowing from an allegedly invalid conviction is the only rational place to do so. In an earlier day, cutting off review when challenged convictions did not result in criminal consequences may have provided a reasonable end to litigation while imposing no undue burden on individual rights. With the advent of computer technology, however, and the great increase in the number of persons whose qualifications will be reviewed by professional and academic societies, it can no longer be said that precluding review where no criminal consequences exist places no undue burden on an individual’s rights. People today will repeatedly be asked by employers, by professional and academic societies, by lending institutions, and by others if they have ever been convicted of a crime. Frequently, the question will be asked of a computer without the knowledge of the person involved and frequently an unreversed conviction — even if achieved without due process or if otherwise fatally flawed — can cause a potential employer to select another candidate; can bar access to professional associations to which one must belong before one can practice a chosen profession; can result in the refusal to grant a loan which might otherwise have been given.</p>
