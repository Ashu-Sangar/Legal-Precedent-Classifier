The officer noted a metal license plate on the automobile as having the number 2Y9666. He compared the number to a “hot sheet” or list of stolen license plates. He found the number there listed. The officer turned his unmarked vehicle around and began to return to the corner where he had observed the automobile. As he was doing so, he observed Williams begin to drive west on Haver-' ford from 60th Street. Williams began passing other traffic and “at 61st and Haverford he cut through a gas <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>station lot . . . .” Williams was then forced to halt the automobile because of traffic on 61st Street.

The officer then checked the serial number of the car and learned it was stolen from Crawford on either August 30 or 31, 1973. Moreover, the Commonwealth established that Williams had not been given permission by Crawford or the lot attendant to use the automobile. Further Crawford testified that although the automobile was “new” when it was stolen, it was damaged when returned to him by the police. The damage included a burn on the seat cover, the wires were pulled out from underneath the dash, the knobs were removed from the radio, the radio was loose (Crawford opined these factors seemed to indicate an attempt to remove the radio), and the front and rear bumpers were damaged.</p>

But, since the trier of fact found sufficient evidence to establish the crime and since the Superior Court reversed because it viewed the evidence as insufficient to establish only one element of the crime, that is, knowledge that the property was stolen or believing that the property had been stolen, we need only determine if sufficient evidence exists to establish that element. Circumstantial evidence from which guilty knowledge can be inferred is sufficient to sustain a conviction if the underlying circumstantial evidence is sufficiently strong to support the inference beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

But if the trier of fact does not so consider the circumstances, he may then consider the possession as unexplained where the accused offers no evidence of explanation. This is not an infringement on the accused’s right against self-incrimination, <em>Barnes v.

Williams could produce neither a document of title, a registration card, nor a license when he was stopped by the police and, he did not do so subsequently. We have already commented on the possibility of the automobile having been borrowed, and much the same applies to the possibility of an innocent purchase. Persons do not buy automobiles without requesting documents of title. Finally, automobiles, because they are evidenced by documents of title, are not easily assimilated into trade channels without the documents.

While it is true that mere possession is insufficient to establish or permit an inference of guilty knowledge, something more than mere possession is generally involved and requires consideration. For instance, the nature of the goods, the quantity of the goods <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>involved, the lapse of time between possession and theft, and the ease with which the goods can be assimilated into trade channels, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McFarland, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>supra, are important considerations. And while, <em>Henderson, </em>supra, discussed the lapse of time and nature of the property, its discussion of the nature of the property included a consideration of borrowing a car and thus having possession so derived serve as a basis for a conviction. This consideration, although warranted at the time of the decision because of uncertainty with regard to constitutional rights in using unexplained possession as a basis for inferring guilty knowledge, see supra n. 4 and textual discussion infra p. 249, is no longer as strong a consideration because possession which is unexplained or unsatisfactorily explained may serve as a basis for the inference and no infringement on constitutional rights results from doing so. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra at 840, n. 3 and 844 n. 9, <a href="/us/412/0837-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="412 U.S. 837" data-case-ids="6176639" data-case-paths="/us/412/0837-01">93 S.Ct. 2357</a>. Thus, this added circumstance, which may now definitely be considered, i. e., possession which is recent and <em>unexplained, </em>must necessarily alter considerations made with regard to the nature of the property and thus, with regard to goods being borrowed in automobile cases.</p>

    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[295,787,1148,633]]]'>The crime of receiving stolen goods requires proof that appellant knew that the property possessed was stolen. 18 C.P.S.A. § 3925. Such knowledge on the part of appellant is an essential element of the crime, in addition to the elements of appellant’s possession of the property and the theft of the property prior to appellant’s possession. Since due process mandates “proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime . . . ”, <em>In re Winship, </em><a href="/us/397/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="397 U.S. 358" data-case-ids="12054393" data-case-paths="/us/397/0358-01">397 U.S. 358</a>, 364, <a href="/us/397/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="397 U.S. 358" data-case-ids="12054393" data-case-paths="/us/397/0358-01">90 S.Ct. 1068</a>, 1073, <a href="/us/397/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="397 U.S. 358" data-case-ids="12054393" data-case-paths="/us/397/0358-01">25 L.Ed.2d 368</a>, 375 (1970), appellant’s knowledge must therefore be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

As the dissenting Justices in <em>Barnes </em>pointed out, the burden cannot be shifted to the accused. The prosecution must prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution can rely solely on unexplained possession, a burden is imposed upon the accused to explain that possession in order to avoid conviction. Unexplained possession is simply another way of saying to the jury that a defendant could have but failed to present a defense and that this may be considered in determining guilt. Such an instruction places an unconstitutional burden on the accused. The burden must remain on the prosecution to establish sufficient circumstances, other than the possession of stolen property by appellant, to support the necessary element of appellant’s guilty knowledge. Since I do not agree with the majority that the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to support the inference of appellant’s guilty knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt, I must dissent.</p>

Furthermore, the majority also infers an attempt by appellant to avoid pursuit from the fact that appellant drove the car through a gas station while being pursued by the police. However, as there was no indication that appellant knew that he was being followed by police, since the police were in an <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>unmarked car, any inference of flight is incorrect and indeed irrelevant.</p>
    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[257,426,1143,96]]]'>The situation in this case is similar to that in <em>Henderson, </em>supra, where it was said:</p>
