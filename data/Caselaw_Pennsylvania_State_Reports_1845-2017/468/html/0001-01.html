The plaintiff, Wilbur Rice, has requested the other owners to purchase his interest in the property, and they have offered him the sum of $200 therefor, a sum he apparently found unacceptable. The $200 offer was made “pursuant to the intent set forth in” the deed, which contains the following recital:</p>

See Restatement of Property, §§ 173, 412 (1936); see also <em>Appeal of Latshaw, </em><a href="/pa/122/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="122 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1948420" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0142-01">122 Pa. 142</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20A.%20676" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="15 A. 676">15 A. 676</a> (1888). Without ascertainment of such surrounding facts, judgment on the pleadings is improper. As we said in the case of <em>Jefferies v.

These include all the facts bearing on the relationship of the parties <em>inter se </em>and whether and to what extent they have subscribed to by-laws or some other form of agreement. With matters of such pertinence unknown, judgment for the plaintiff was unwarranted. “Judgment on the pleadings should be allowed only where a case is free from doubt and trial would be a fruitless exercise” <em>North Star Coal Co. v.
