The Court of Common Pleas reasoned that Appellee had expressly authorized the execution of the Note and the confession of judgment provision therein relying upon the language contained in the Note, the Partnership Agreement and the Limited Power of Attorney. Therefore, the court found no defect on the face of the record to serve as a basis to strike the judgment. The court further found, based upon the Partnership Agreement and the Limited Power of Attorney, that Appellee could not assert a meritorious defense based upon lack of authority, and thus, held that the judgment should not be opened.</p>

The Superior Court reversed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia on February 17, 1995 and vacated the judgment by confession against Appellee. The Superior Court deemed the pivotal issue to be whether Daniel Banks had the authority to obligate Brighton Court to the loan containing the confession of judgment clause. The Superior Court found that, as a matter of law, Daniel Banks did not have express authority from Appellee to confess judgment against him. The Superior Court reviewed both the Limited Power of Attorney and the Partnership Agreement and found that they both failed to provide Daniel Banks with express authority to execute a warrant of attorney to confess judgment on behalf of Brighton Court and Appellee. In reaching this conclusion, the Superior Court relied upon the recent <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em>Resolution Trust Corporation v.

Finally, the Superior Court noted the inequities of the situation, finding that Daniel Banks abused his position of trust with Brighton Court by obtaining the loan solely for the financially troubled Copley Qu-Wayne.</p>

    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[190,1221,1153,586]]]'>The first issue raised by Appellant is whether the Superior Court erred in vacating the judgment based on an asserted defense of lack of authority. Specifically, Appellant argues that the Superior Court applied an incorrect standard for striking the confessed judgment by improperly relying upon matters outside of the original record supporting the confessed judgment as filed by Appellant and by improperly considering the equities of the matter. Appellant also argues that the Superior Court ignored the binding precedent of this court’s decision in <em>DeRose v. Lombardi </em><a href="/pa/413/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="413 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1888681" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0258-01">413 Pa. 258</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20336" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="196 A.2d 336">196 A.2d 336</a> (1964).</p>

The Superior Court’s decision is unclear as to the precise relief that it granted to Appellee. Although a petition to strike and a petition to open are properly brought in the same petition, Pa.R.C.P. 2959, a petition to strike and a petition to open are two distinct forms of relief, each with separate remedies.</p>

The defendants petitioned to strike the judgment on the basis that it had been entered against persons not parties to the note and that the warrant of attorney was insufficient to authorize the prothonotary to enter judgment against them because the notes failed to contain any authority in the signer to bind the other partners.

Accordingly, we conclude that the better course to take in cases dealing with questions of authority as those raised here is that espoused by this court in its later decision in <em>DeRose. </em>Thus, we do not believe that the failure to set forth express authority is a fatal defect or irregularity on the original record as filed by the party in whose favor the warrant is given.
