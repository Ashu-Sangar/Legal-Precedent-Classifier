Under the County Plan, three landfills were named as designated disposal facilities for a ten-year contract period, subject to the right of the County to terminate the contract period with respect to any or all of those designated disposal facilities at any time after five years. All municipal waste generated within the County was required to be disposed of at one of these designated disposal facilities, subject to certain exceptions, once the County Plan became operational.

On December 1, 1989, Empire and Danella extended the original term until December 1, 1994 and provided for two renewals of ten years each.

While 53 P.S. § 4000.303(e) does not explicitly require counties to select facilities in Pennsylvania or in the relevant county, it does require that sites be contained in a plan and be “permitted by the [DER] under the Solid Waste Management Act.” Since only Pennsylvania landfills can be permitted by DER under that act, counties which designate sites in their plans are required by Section 303(e) to restrict the disposal of waste to facilities in Pennsylvania.

Under the agreement, the town would guarantee a minimum waste .flow to the facility, and the contractor would charge haulers a tipping fee that exceeded the cost of disposal for non-sorted waste in the private market. The Court stated that the article of commerce was the service of processing and disposing of solid waste. 511 U.S. at 387, 114 S.Ct. at 1681-82, 128 L.Ed.2d at 407.</p>

The Court explained that while the immediate effect of the ordinance was to direct local transport of solid waste to a designated site within the local jurisdiction, its economic effects were interstate. The flow control ordinance discriminated because it allowed only the favored operator to process waste that was within the limits of the town and prohibited other in-state or in-town processors from participating. The ordinance thus deprived both local and out-of-state businesses access to a local market. 511 U.S. at 393, 114 S.Ct. at 1684, 128 L.Ed.2d at 410.</p>

There, the court ruled that evidence that the county did not afford out-of-state landfill sites equal opportunity to compete for waste disposal business under the counly’s waste flow control plan suggested a violation of the commerce clause and required a remand for further examination of whether the process for designating landfills had the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce. Further, the court ruled that while the fact that the waste flow control schemes of each county resulted in the designation of single in-state landfills did not alone establish discrimination, the potential for discriminatory effect required a remand for consideration of the designation process, duration of designation and the practical likelihood of amendment of the scheme.</p>

Also, if an approved DER facility is not designated in the county of its residence for whatever, including political, reasons, and is not designated in neighboring counties because of the burdens of section 502(g), then the facility may not be able to participate in interstate commerce at all.</p>

The contract anticipates that Danella could have more or less waste to dispose than the amount allowed under the terms of the contract. Accordingly, the definition of the term "Acceptable Waste”, by using the expression "waste that is delivered ... to the landfill,” does not necessarily mean that Danella is free to ignore the contractual duty to dispose of its waste at Empire. Rather, the definition may merely be a reflection of the uncertainty on a day-to-day basis of the total amount of waste Danella may have to dispose.</p>
