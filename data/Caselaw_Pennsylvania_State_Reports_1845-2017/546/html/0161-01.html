In a statement given to police, Appellant indicated that shortly after arriving at the lounge, he informed Ms. Dorsey that he was getting married but asked her if she would still see him after he was married. When Ms. Dorsey refused, Appellant pulled a gun from his person and shot Ms. Dorsey in the neck causing her to fall from the bar stool. As Ms. Dorsey lay on the floor, Appellant shot her three more times. Ms. Dorsey died as a result of these gunshot wounds. Appellant then fired a fifth bullet which struck another patron, Leroy Anderson, in the head. Fortunately, Mr. Anderson’s wound was not fatal.</p>

As he approached <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>his house, Appellant saw Earl Jones enter the house next door.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Appellant proceeded into his own home, retrieved a .30-.30 caliber rifle, and, armed with both the rifle and a revolver, went next door in search of Earl Jones. Appellant forced his way in the front door and chased Earl Jones upstairs. Earl Jones entered one of the bedrooms, warned Jacqueline Jones, Alan Whitfield, and Felicia Hubert, all three of whom were in that bedroom watching television, that Appel-, lant was after him. After issuing that warning, Earl Jones jumped from the bedroom window to safety. Appellant entered the bedroom and shot and killed all three of the above-mentioned individuals.</p>

While there, Appellant maintained telephone communications with the police during which time he informed the police that he was armed. The hostage negotiator with whom Appellant spoke asked no questions regarding the shootings, but tried only to convince Appellant to surrender peacefully. During these conversations, Appellant repeatedly volunteered that he intended to commit suicide because he did not want to be incarcerated for killing the victims. It was not until several hours later, after having talked with his son, that Appellant finally surrendered to police. Once in custody, Appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave inculpatory statements respecting all four murders. A search of Appellant’s home produced both a revolver and a .30-.30 rifle as well as numerous rounds of live ammunition.</p>

In support of his defense, Appellant presented the testimony of family and neighbors who testified as to Appellant’s military discharge in 1948 after his having been diagnosed as a schizophrenic psychopath.

However, Appellant did not present any medical expert testimony in support of these defenses. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, presented the testimony of two board-certified forensic psychiatrists who examined Appellant following the murders. Both concluded that, at the time Appellant committed the instant murders, he was not laboring under any mental illness sufficient to deprive him of his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>

When reviewing a trial court’s ruling denying a suppression motion, we must first determine whether the factual findings are supported by the record. Where, as here, it is the defendant who is appealing the ruling of the suppression court, we must consider only the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses and only that evidence of the defense that remains uncontradicted when fairly read in the context of the whole record.

As this court recently reiterated, <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only where there is custodial interrogation. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant submits that the telephone contact initiated by the police while he was barricaded inside his home constituted custodial interrogation since the police knew at that time that Appellant was a suspect in the shootings, and thus, should have realized that their efforts to coax Appellant from his home via those oral communications was likely to elicit inculpatory statements. He also submits that he was in police custody insofar as the police had his house surrounded and he was, thus, not free to leave. Appellant’s claim is wholly without merit. First, contrary to his assertions, he was not in custody at this time and, therefore, was not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See Commonwealth v.

One of the transporting officers replied that Appellant was a suspect in several shootings. Although no questions or remarks were directed to Appellant, Appellant blurted out that he had killed the three people inside 6135 Walnut Street, but not the two in South Philadelphia.

Many others involved the court’s repeated admonitions to defense counsel to remain in a specific location while addressing the jury and/or examining a witness. And, while at times, the comments of the trial judge evidenced his impatience with defense counsel, none of those comments were related to the issues in the case; none were reflective of any predisposition of the trial judge respecting the guilt or innocence of the defendant; and none were indicative of any bias in favor of the prosecution. Moreover, the trial court properly charged the jury that they were to be the sole judges of the facts.

On cross-examination of Earl Jones, defense counsel elicited testimony regarding the earlier murder of Appellant’s son. In essence, Earl Jones testified that Appellant’s son had pulled a knife on him and that he acted in self-defense. Defense counsel then attempted to impeach that testimony by asking the witness about the testimony of two witnesses, Damu Boyer and Ann Boyer, which testimony was elicited at the witness’ trial in 1985. Apparently, those two witnesses testified at Earl Jones’ trial that Earl Jones had threatened one of them with a knife thinking that he was Appellant’s son and that Earl Jones had stalked Appellant’s son.

While the fact that Earl Jones had killed Appellant’s son some years earlier might explain Appellant’s hostility towards Earl Jones, that same fact does little towards establishing any bias on the part of Earl Jones. Moreover, the jury was already aware that Earl Jones had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the murder of Appellant’s son and, indeed, some of the jury specifically found this very fact, that Appellant was distressed from seeing Earl Jones, to be a mitigating factor.</p>

O’Brien. Dr. O’Brien was originally retained by the defense for the purpose of evaluating Appellant and with the hope that he would testify in support of Appellant’s claim of insanity or diminished mental capacity. Following his evaluation of Appellant in April, 1992, Dr. O’Brien’s opinion was not, however, supportive of this defense and he was not called as a witness by the defense. Specifically, Dr. O’Brien concluded that, at the time of the murders, Appellant understood the nature and quality of his acts and that those acts were wrong. He diagnosed <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>Appellant, as of April, 1992, as suffering from depression in remission. Because of those conclusions, the Commonwealth chose, instead, to call Dr. O’Brien in rebuttal. So called, Dr. O’Brien testified as to his evaluation of Appellant and his psychiatric conclusions gleaned therefrom. He further testified that, in his opinion, Appellant was not suffering from schizophrenia either at the time he committed the murders or at the time of his evaluation in April, 1992. Dr. O’Brien explained that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-3R), which standardized evaluation and diagnosis of mental disorders, was developed after 1948, the year Appellant was discharged from the military due to mental infirmities. He was then questioned regarding his review of Appellant’s military records. Appellant relied heavily at trial upon this discharge from the military some 42 years earlier to bolster his defense that the instant murders resulted from his diminished mental capacity because the apparent diagnosis contained in those discharge records was that of schizophrenia reaction. Specifically, the prosecution inquired of Dr. O’Brien as to what diagnosis he believed would be given today, using the current standardized evaluation and diagnostic tests, to Appellant’s behavior as reported in the 1948 military records and, also whether he believed Appellant would be discharged from the military today if he exhibited the behavior he did in 1948. Essentially, Dr. O’Brien opined that based upon his review of Appellant’s military records, he would not have diagnosed Appellant as suffering from schizophrenia, but rather would have first ruled out toxic psychosis or alcohol withdrawal and then, although a possible diagnosis could have been brief reactive psychosis, he would nevertheless not have given any formal diagnosis. In response to whether he believed the behavior exhibited by Appellant in 1948 would today result in a similar military discharge, Dr. O’Brien opined:</p>

He asserts counsel’s ineffectiveness as well for having failed to raise this issue in post-trial motions. Our review of the record belies Appellant’s contentions. First, it was the defense which sought to interject Appellant’s mental infirmities as of the time of his military discharge in 1948 as support for his claim that, at time of the instant murders in 1990, he was insane or had diminished mental capacity so as to excuse the murders. Dr. O’Brien’s testimony was, thus, relevant rebuttal evidence. Moreover, Dr. O’Brien’s testimony was unequivocally phrased in terms of his opinion and what his recommendations would have been. Thus, contrary to Appellant’s intimations, Dr. O’Brien did not opine that the military would not, today, discharge Appellant under similar circumstances, but rather testified only as to his opinion as to the nature of Appellant’s mental condition based upon the information contained in those records. The defense stipulated at trial to Dr. O’Brien’s qualifications as an expert in the field of psychiatry and, more particularly, forensic psychiatry and our review of the record reveals that his testimony was limited to those qualifications. We simply do not find that the trial court here abused its very broad discretion regarding the admission of evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

Detective Morton was presented as a Commonwealth witness to testify regarding the pretrial statements of Appellant. On recross-examination of Detective Morton, defense counsel elicited testimony that some suspects who have confessed will then attempt to justify their behavior by claiming, for instance, self-defense. Defense counsel then asked Detective Morton whether Appellant made any such attempt, to which the detective responded “no.” Immediately thereafter, the prosecution elicited testimony from Detective Morton that in giving their version of the events precipitating the crime, most defendants try to put themselves in the most favorable light and that “in [his] opinion” Appellant did just that by claiming that he became enraged when he saw Earl Jones. Appellant submits that this redirect testimony constituted improper opinion testimony. Appellant asserts that Detective Morton’s testimony infringed upon the exclusive function of the jury to determine the credibility of Appellant’s statement. In so arguing, Appellant apparently relies upon Detective Morton’s use of the terms “in my opinion” when answering the prosecution’s question as to whether Appellant attempted to justify the killings. In support thereof, Appellant eites numerous cases which hold that the Commonwealth is prohibited from presenting opinion testimony concerning the guilt of the defendant.

The prosecution, on cross-examination of Mr. Daly, asked whether the amount of Appellant’s pension was based upon the number of dependents he claimed. Upon initiation of this line of questioning and objection thereto by defense counsel, a sidebar conference was held. During that conference, it was determined that this line of questioning was an attempt by the prosecution to inquire as to whether Appellant ever notified the Veteran’s Administration regarding the death of his wife in 1986, ostensibly for the purpose of establishing that Appellant sought to collect more benefits than he was entitled.

In other words, it is Appellant’s contention that not having been so apprised, the jury may have feared that they would have to acquit Appellant of these murders if they found he lacked the requisite mental capacity to form specific intent.</p>

Immediately prior to the above-recited portion of the charge, the trial court explained the three degrees of homicide, specifically informing them that one could be convicted of first degree murder only if the person formed the requisite specific intent. The court further instructed that homicide committed without the requisite specific intent constituted third degree murder. And, in distinguishing between manslaughter and murder, the court instructed that where the jury finds malice, the crime is murder of one of the degrees. Finally, after discussing specifically the distinct degrees of murder, the trial court instructed that with respect to each murder, the evidence should be viewed to ascertain whether it establishes any of the three degrees of murder. Accordingly, the charge as a whole adequately and accurately explained to the jury that a finding of diminished mental capacity could negate the finding of specific intent and thereby serve to reduce the degree of murder. Appellant’s argument to the contrary, that this instruction could have impressed upon the jury that a finding <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>of diminished mental capacity would require an acquittal, is simply unsupported.

Appellant submits further that the instruction given effectively compels those jurors who are in favor of a life sentence, but are in the minority, to compromise their beliefs and agree to the imposition of a sentence of death. Appellant’s claim is, however, without merit.</p>
    <p id="b322-7" data-blocks='[["BL_322.7",322,[258,1409,1153,628]]]'>The jury’s verdict in the penalty phase of a first degree murder case, whether it be a sentence of life or death, must, just as is true of any verdict in a criminal case, be unanimous. Where the jury is unable to reach a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, the court must impose a sentence of life. 42 Pa.S.C. § 9711(c)(l)(v). However, for the jury to return a verdict, it must necessarily be a unanimous verdict. Appellant’s argument to the contrary, that the jury could impose a life sentence in the absence of a unanimous agreement, is nonsensical. The charge as given does nothing more than inform the jury that it is free to reach a verdict of a life sentence or one of death.</p>

Perhaps Appellant here interprets this final statement of subsection (c)(l)(iv) to somehow permit a non-unanimous verdict of life imprisonment. While logic alone belies such an interpretation since a “verdict” by its very nature is a unanimous decision of a jury, subsection (c)(l)(v) also belies such an interpretation as it mandates that a court impose a life sentence where the jury is unable to reach a unanimous agreement.

Because the prosecutor here asserted that the jury could consider this mitigating circumstance of “age” only where the defendant was of a young age, the challenged remarks were, indeed, impermissible. Nevertheless, these remarks do not here constitute reversible error. First, the trial court cautioned the jury that the Commonwealth’s argument that age applies only to a young person was not necessarily true and that age might, indeed, be a permissible mitigating factor where, as here, there is an elderly person. The court further instructed the jury that they alone were <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>free to determine whether age was a mitigating factor in the instant, case. Moreover, the sentencing verdict slips respecting the three verdicts of death reveal that at least some of the jurors found age to be a mitigating factor. Thus, even assuming that the challenged remarks were sufficiently prejudicial, any such prejudice was adequately cured by the trial court’s instructions. <em>See, Commonwealth v.

The following three mitigating circumstances were found by at least some of the jurors: defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2); the age of the defendant at the time of the crime, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); and other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). It is unclear from the record, however, whether the precise aggravating circumstance presented and found was 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10) or (d)(ll). While the language employed by the court during trial indicates that the precise aggravating circumstance presented and found was (d)(ll), the Commonwealth, in its brief to this court, indicates that the aggravating circumstance presented by it was (d)(10). However, for purposes of the present appeal, it is inconsequential precisely which aggravating circumstance was, indeed, presented and found, first, because Appellant does not challenge the finding of the aggravating circumstance, and second, because with respect to our statutorily imposed review, <em>post, </em>we have considered this matter as if either (d)(10) or (d)(ll) were found.</p>
