In addition, on September 25, 1989, McClellan initiated a separate action against HMO PA asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>a claim in corporate negligence for HMO PA’s alleged failure to retain competent physicians and to screen and review the qualifications of selected physicians to assure their continued competence. Specifically, McClellan alleged that: (1) under contracts theory, HMO PA breached its subscriber agreement by misrepresenting the competence of its participating physicians; and (2) under a theory of ostensible corporate liability, HMO PA’s failure to adequately select, retain, and review Dr. Hempsey’s qualifications amounted to negligence causing decedent’s death.

Majority Opinion at 806. This conclusion ignores the reality of health care today. A corporation operating a health care facility— one of the examples of a professional health care provider in the statute — may not be in a place where it can oversee patient care “within its walls.” More importantly, HMOs dictate the care provided in health care facilities. They prescribe the tests patients receive, the doctors patients see, and the time patients stay in health care facilities. HMOs administrate, directly or through contracts with physician groups, health care facilities.</p>

Second, a Staff model HMO is an HMO that delivers services through its own physicians who are paid employees or staff of the HMO.
