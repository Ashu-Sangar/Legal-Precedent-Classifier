Counsel for Spaeder orally communicated the offer to counsel for Arthur on the record during a side-bar conference before the court, and the offer was subsequently transcribed in the notes of testimony.

Rule 238(a)(2)(i) provides that in actions beginning before August 1, 1989, the start date for delay damages is either the date the plaintiff first filed the complaint or the date one year after the accrual of the cause of action, whichever is later. Here, one year after the accrual of Arthur’s cause of action against Spaeder, May 22, 1988, is later than the date Arthur filed a complaint against Spaeder, October 6, 1987..

The calculation of Kuchar’s start date is governed by Rule 238(a)(2)(i) because Arthur commenced an action against Kuchar before August 1,1989, by filing a writ of summons on May 22, 1989. The date Arthur filed a complaint against Kuchar, August 24, 1989, is later than one year after the accrual of Arthur’s cause of action against Kuchar, May 22, 1988.

None of the parties raised this error in post-trial motions or on appeal to the Superior Court.

    </p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[217,1039,1153,476]]]'>Next, we must consider whether Spaeder’s and Kuchar’s $85,000.00 settlement offer tolls the running of delay damages. Rule 238(b)(1) requires there be a “written offer” to toll the running of delay damages. Spaeder and Kuchar do not contend the settlement offer here was in writing. Instead, they argue that an oral settlement offer made before the court, on the record, which is later transcribed in the notes of testimony, is the functional equivalent of a written offer for the purposes of Rule 238. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b145-7" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[216,1553,1159,527]]]'>We recognize that many cases settle on the steps and in the hallways of our courthouses. Thus, we need to strike a balance that will allow parties the flexibility to negotiate while retaining the formality necessary to effectuate a legally valid agreement. Rule 238’s written offer requirement can be met if an oral settlement offer is made before the court, on the record, and later transcribed. <em>See, e.g., Borough of Brookhaven v. Zoning Hearing Bd., </em>58 Pa.Cmwlth. 436, <a href="/citations/?q=427%20A.2d%201281" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="427 A.2d 1281">427 A.2d 1281</a> (1981).

Here, Spaeder and Ruchar extended their offer on June 3, 1992, the third day of trial, and conditioned it on its immediate acceptance and the termination of the trial. Because the offer was conditioned on its immediate acceptance, it was not continued in effect for at least ninety days. Additionally, Spaeder and Ruchar did not continue the offer in effect until commencement of trial because the trial was three days old when they made the offer. Thus, Spaeder and Ruchar’s offer does not satisfy the timing requirements of Rule 238(b)(1). Accordingly, the Superior Court erred in tolling delay damages between June 3, 1992 and June 9, 1992 based on the $85,000.00 settlement offer.</p>

This is an untenable position. After a verdict in a jury trial, a party may file a motion for post-trial relief. Pa.R.C.P. 227.1. In response to such a motion, a trial court may, among other things, order a new trial, direct judgment for any party, or make any other appropriate order. <em><a href="/f2d/717/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="717 F.2d 52" data-case-ids="11952805" data-case-paths="/f2d/717/0052-01">Id.</a> A </em>jury’s verdict is subject to the control of the trial court and may be set aside until judgment is entered on the verdict. <em>McFadden v.

Thus, the outcome of the case remains “reasonably in doubt” until the trial court enters a final judgment. Accordingly, Spaeder and Kuchar cannot rely on the jury’s zero verdict to avoid the imposition of delay damages from June 9, 1992, the date of the verdict, to March 17, 1993, the date the trial court granted a new trial. Contrary to the Superior Court’s reasoning, this period is not analogous to the period where an appeal is pending and it must be included in Arthur’s award of delay damages.</p>

I must dissent, however, from the majority’s holding that delay damages are not tolled while post-trial motions are pending after a jury’s verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b149-9" data-blocks='[["BL_149.9",149,[203,1258,1155,787]]]'>The majority attempts to distinguish cases in which an appeal is pending after a final judgment from this case because it involves a motion for a new trial. The majority reasons that the outcome of the case remains “reasonably in doubt” until the trial court disposes of post-trial motions. I disagree. In most instances post-trial motions are merely pro forma. I dare say more often than not, the post-trial motions are denied. Rule 238 is designed to encourage defendants to settle meritorious claims as soon as practicable. When a jury has returned a verdict in favor of a defendant, there is little or no incentive for the defendant to seriously consider settlement at that point. The defendant need no longer weigh the chances for a successful defense against the plaintiffs claim when a jury has already found that the plaintiffs claim has no merit.</p>

While it is true that a trial court may entertain post-trial motions and enter an order granting a new trial or judgment n.o.v., the plaintiff bears the burden of persuading <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>the court that such an order is appropriate. From a practical standpoint, a defendant who must assess the chances that a plaintiff will be successful on post-trial motions is in no different a position than one who makes that assessment while the case is pending on the plaintiffs appeal from the trial court. In both situations, the defendant has successfully persuaded the factfinder that the plaintiffs claim is not meritorious. Whether the verdict is ultimately upheld after it is rendered, either on post-trial motions or on appeal to an appellate court, is of no moment in considering whether Rule 238 serves its purpose after a successful defense verdict.</p>
