At approximately 6:30 a.m. on June 25, 1992, Officer Robert Snyder of the Philadelphia Highway patrol unit, while on routine patrol on Interstate 95 (“1-95”) in the area of Aramingo Avenue and York Street, observed Appellant operating a vehicle with expired temporary tags. Officer Snyder signaled for Appellant to pull into a nearby gas station. Appellant pulled into the gas station, but instead of stopping, proceeded around the building towards the entrance ramp of 1-95. Fearing that Appellant was attempting to flee, Officer Snyder pulled his vehicle in front of Appellant so as to block his route of travel and ordered Appellant to turn off his motor. As the officer was alighting from his vehicle, Appellant quickly exited his vehicle and walked to the back of his vehicle and away from Officer Snyder. Officer Snyder then approached Appel<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>lant and requested that he produce some form of identification as well as a title or registration for the vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[162,418,1154,1234]]]'>After fumbling through his pockets, Appellant indicated that he did not have any registration, but that he did have a title for the vehicle. Appellant then walked back towards his vehicle with Officer Snyder following close behind. According to the testimony of Officer Snyder, Appellant kept glancing over his shoulder as if to see where the officer was and then proceeded to open his car door slowly and bend inside. Due to Appellant’s suspicious behavior, Officer Snyder walked up behind Appellant and ordered him to stop. It was at that time that Officer Snyder noticed an object, protruding from under the driver’s seat, which was approximately three (3) to four (4) inches wide and two (2) inches deep wrapped in yellowish tinted plastic. Suspecting that the package contained narcotics, Officer Snyder immediately handcuffed Appellant and placed him under arrest. The officer testified that although he could not see through the wrapping of the package, he believed that the package contained narcotics based upon his prior experience as a police officer. Specifically, he testified that he has been a Philadelphia police officer for approximately thirteen (13) years during which time he was temporarily assigned to the Bureau of Narcotics Investigation, and that he had personally seen, perhaps fifty (50) times or more, narcotics packaged in similar “kilo” or “brick type” wrappings.</p>
    <p id="b545-6" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[161,1678,1154,472]]]'>Appellant testified on his own behalf, relating a very different factual scenario than that of Officer Snyder. The Municipal Court judge, however, specifically found Officer Snyder’s testimony to be more credible, thus accepting his rendition of the facts. However, the Municipal Court ultimately suppressed the evidence seized as a result of this warrantless arrest, finding that the officer’s belief that the package contained narcotics was nothing more than speculation and thus, insufficient to establish probable cause to arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In its opinion in support of that denial, the trial court reasoned that Officer Snyder’s observation of the wrapped object and his “subjective belief’ that the package contained narcotics was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.

    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[258,858,1155,745]]]'>Following that denial, the Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, certifying that the suppression order substantially handicapped its prosecution. As noted previously herein, the Superior Court reversed, finding that the facts as found to be credible by the Municipal Court were sufficient to establish probable cause to arrest Appellant. Judge Hoffman dissented, essentially agreeing with the suppression and trial court’s conclusions that the facts of which Officer Snyder had knowledge at the time of the arrest rose no higher than that of suspicion. Significant for purposes of the present appeal, is the Superior Court panel majority’s reliance, in part, upon the officer’s familiarity, due to his prior extensive experience, with narcotics being similarly packaged in kilo-sized bricks, to support its conclusion that probable cause to arrest was met.</p>

However, it is also true that, to establish probable cause to arrest, criminal activity need not be shown to, in fact, exist, but rather only that it may be reasonably inferred from the circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v. Weidenmoyer, </em><a href="/pa/518/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="518 Pa. 2" data-case-ids="1811684" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0002-01">518 Pa. 2</a>, 13, <a href="/pa/518/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="539 A.2d 1291" data-case-ids="1811590,1811684" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0001-01,/pa/518/0002-01">539 A.2d 1291</a>, 1297 (1988). The crucial determination for purposes of the present appeal is, thus, whether the officer’s belief that the package observed protruding from under the seat contained narcotics, <em>when viewed under the totality of the circumstances, </em>constitutes only a suspicion or a reasonable inference of criminal activity.</p>

Appellant argues that the Superior Court’s holding here is inconsistent with the law of probable cause and that its reliance on federal precedent permitting an officer to seize an object under the “plain view” doctrine where, given his prior experience, he has probable cause to believe the object is, or contains, contraband should not be countenanced by this court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> According to Appellant, to permit such warrantless arrests based solely upon the observation of an object, the illegal nature of which is not immediately apparent, will simply promote random searches and seizures without the barest of constitutional foundations.

In none of the above-cited cases did the courts find that the mere observation of a container or package, the likes of which an officer has known, in the past, to contain narcotics, was sufficient to establish probable cause. Instead, it was the holdings of those courts that when viewed together with the additional incriminating facts, an officer’s observation and evaluation of suspect containers and/or packages are appropriate factors to consider in ascertaining whether the warrantless arrest was supported by probable cause.</p>

In finding that Officer Snyder’s belief here rose no higher than that of supposition, both the Municipal Court and the trial court found significant the testimony of Officer Snyder to wit that he believed the package contained narcotics but that he was unable to actually see the contents of the package. Both of those courts seemingly equated the term “believe” or “belief’ with mere suspicion or a hunch. Apparently neither court accorded any weight to the officer’s prior experience; particularly the fact that, on at least fifty occasions during his thirteen years of employment with the Philadelphia Police Department and the Bureau of Narcotics Investigation, he had observed narcotics packaged in a similar manner. Indeed, the trial court implies that one’s “belief’ would always constitute mere supposition and never be a reasonable or objective conclusion even if based upon prior actual, and hence observable, experiences. (Tr. ct. op. pp. 9-11). Appellant, too, relies principally upon the inability of the officer to actually see the contents of the package. Such an interpretation, however, serves to elevate the standard of probable cause to that of <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>almost actual certitude. This is clearly an erroneous interpretation as the standard for determining probable cause has never been held to be such an exacting one. <em>See Commonwealth v. Weidenmoyer, supra.</em>

Although Appellant’s argument on this point is not entirely clear, he seems to imply at one point that we should not adopt, as our state constitutional standard, the "modification” of the plain view doctrine espoused by the Superior Court here as well as in the federal precedent set forth in that court’s opinion. However, as discussed <em>infra, </em>we do not agree with Appellant's interpretation that there has, indeed, been a "modification.” Appellant seems to agree that, in all other respects, our state constitutional standard for probable cause is equivalent to that of the federal constitutional standard. What Appellant really argues is that those federal cases, as well as thé numerous Superior Court cases following those federal cases, should be rejected by this court. Although somewhat convoluted, this argument of Appellant is nothing more than a continuation of his first argument to wit that probable cause should not be found to exist based solely upon the possession of an object.</p>
