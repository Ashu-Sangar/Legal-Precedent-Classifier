The sole issue pertains to the jury instructions, in which the trial court refused to give Penn-DOT’s requested instruction pertaining to notice of the dangerous condition.</p>

The tree had been topped more than twenty years earlier by persons unknown, and the branch had been growing at a forty-five degree angle over the roadway.</p>

The expert witness opined that a topped tree should raise a “red flag” to a well trained tree inspector. PennDOT’s inspector disputed that opinion, stating that the <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>tree was sound, and that there was no evidence the topping was clearly visible from the ground.

Unless you are so convinced by a preponderance of the evidence, you must return a verdict in favor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation.</blockquote>

The Commonwealth Court agreed, holding that “the liability of [PennDOT], as a possessor of land, arises only when [PennDOT] has either had actual or constructive notice of the risk of unreasonable harm. Before [PennDOT] can be charged with constructive notice of a dangerous condition, that condition must have been apparent upon a reasonable inspection.” 669 A.2d at 1094 (citations omitted).</p>

Under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(a), the legislature waived sovereign immunity in the instances specified in § 8522(b), provided that damages would have been recoverable at common law if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity. <em>See Snyder v.

Section 363(2) states: “A possessor of land in an urban area is subject to liability to persons using a public highway for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent an unreasonable risk of harm arising from the condition of trees on the land near the highway.” Despite appellee’s assertion to the contrary, § 363(2) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts has never been adopted in Pennsylvania.

To require a possessor of land to “exercise reasonable care” to prevent harm from the condition of trees is consistent with the necessity that he have actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition before he may be held liable. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343 may likewise apply in the circumstances of this case. It states: “A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he (a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition____” In other words, liability is premised on actual or constructive notice.</p>
    <p id="b691-6" data-blocks='[["BL_691.4",691,[187,929,1155,419]]]'>This requirement of notice is well established in the common law of this Commonwealth and, if any relevant section of the Restatement (Second) of Torts does not incorporate the requirement, we will interpret it as requiring notice, if possible, or we must conclude that it does not comport with Pennsylvania law. It is evident, therefore, that the trial court was incorrect in concluding that no notice was required to PennDOT and in failing to charge the jury on notice.</p>
    <p id="b691-7" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[186,1384,1154,743]]]'>When a challenge is made to the jury instructions, the appellate court must look at the charge in its entirety, against the background of evidence in the case, to determine whether an error of law was committed and whether prejudice resulted. In reviewing the propriety of the refusal of a new trial, the appellate court’s inquiry is whether the court below abused its discretion or committed an error of law which controlled the outcome of the case. When a charge is generally accurate, but misleads the jurors on a critical issue, a new trial should be granted. <em>Stewart v.

But the record also contains sufficient evidence to support the opposite finding — that PennDOT did . not have constructive notice because the defect was not apparent on reasonable inspection.
