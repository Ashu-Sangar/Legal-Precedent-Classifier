It is conceivable that the files at Tri-State were created and maintained by poorly trained temporary personnel who had no interest or ability to insure their accuracy.

The employer’s evidence as to possibly lost applications has no bearing on the case, for such evidence was also inadmissible hearsay and, in any event, was immaterial since Pertile made no claim that he applied after October 28, the date when the counselor checked the first time.</p>
