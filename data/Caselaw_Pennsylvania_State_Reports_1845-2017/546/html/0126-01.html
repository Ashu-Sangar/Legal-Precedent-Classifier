On March 10, 1986, Desiderio pled guilty to violating the Pennsylvania Conflict of Interest Act, a felony, in exchange for the Commonwealth’s withdrawal of the remaining three charges. On October 17, 1986, Desiderio was sentenced to a five (5) year term of probation.</p>

    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[186,946,1154,622]]]'>However, after Desiderio assumed office, appellants then sought to challenge his qualifications to hold the council position. Appellants initially forwarded a copy of a petition to the Pennsylvania Attorney General requesting that the Attorney General bring an action in the nature of <em>quo warranto </em>to disqualify Desiderio from office because of his prior conviction. On December 14, 1994, a Chief Deputy Attorney General informed appellants that the Attorney General’s office would not bring such an action because of an internal policy of the Attorney General’s office to defer challenges to a person’s eligibility to hold elected office at the municipal government level to the local district attorney’s office.</p>

On March 28, 1995, the trial court, after hearing argument on appellants’ petition in equity; issued a Memorandum in Support of Order dismissing appellants’ petition for want of subject matter jurisdiction and lack of standing. The memorandum opinion stated that the only manner in which the court could entertain a complaint seeking to oust an elected official was via a <em>quo warranto </em>action. Since appellants’ action to remove Desiderio was not a <em>quo warranto </em>action, the trial court reasoned that it did not have jurisdiction over appellants’ petition unless the Home Rule Charter of the Municipality of Clairton was able to confer jurisdiction. The trial court, however, found that neither the General Assembly nor the Pennsylvania Constitution authorized a local home rule charter to confer jurisdiction upon a Court of Common Pleas to hear a particular matter. Thus, the trial court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to consider appellants’ petition.</p>

The trial court declined to reconsider its previous ruling and noted that appellants still had not put forth any allegation concerning the Allegheny County District Attorney’s refusal to bring a <em>quo warranto </em>action in this matter. Moreover, the trial court noted that even if it could find that both the Attorney General and local district attorney implicitly declined to institute a <em>quo warranto </em>action, appellants failed to timely seek leave to amend their petition in order to properly plead subject matter jurisdiction and standing.</p>

In seeking to challenge a person's right to public office, a private person, with no special right or interest in the public office, must first seek to have either the Attorney General or local district attorney file a <em>quo warranto </em>action. It is only after <em>both </em>the Attorney General and the local district attorney decline to bring such an action that a private person will have standing to seek the removal of the holder of a public office through either an action in equity whereby the private person maintains the challenge in court seeking removal of the elected official or by seeking <em>mandamus </em>whereby the private person seeks the court to issue a writ compelling either the Attorney General or the local district attorney to bring a <em>quo warranto </em>action. <em>See Andrezjwski, supra.</em>
