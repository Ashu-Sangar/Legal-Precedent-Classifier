It focused on the language of Pa. <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>Const. Art. V, § 18(a)(8): “Statements, testimony, documents, records or other information or evidence acquired by the board shall not be public information____ All proceedings of the board shall be confidential except when the subject of the investigation waives confidentiality.” The court’s interpretation of the language is that it does not vest the board with discretion when a subject waives confidentiality. “The language is mandatory in nature. The proceedings remain confidential only when a judicial officer who is the subject of an investigation does not waive his right to confidentiality.” Slip op. at 3, May 10, 1995. The court contrasted the provision giving the board discretionary power to release information when it finds no probable cause to file formal charges. The constitution states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b612-7" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[284,1053,1109,418]]]'>In acting to dismiss a complaint for lack of probable cause to file formal charges, the board may, at its discretion, issue a statement or report to the complainant or to the subject of the complaint, which may contain the identity of the complainant, the identity of the subject of the complaint, the contents and nature of the complaint, the actions taken in the conduct of the investigation and the results and conclusions of the investigation.</blockquote>
    <p id="b612-8" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[241,1491,1153,853]]]'>Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18(a)(8). This use of specifically discretionary language in the situation where the board dismisses a complaint for lack of probable cause was understood by the court to reinforce its reading of the earlier wording it interpreted as mandating disclosure when- a subject waives confidentiality and the board has not dismissed the complaint. The court viewed the confidentiality provisions as existing to protect only the interests of the judicial officer who is the subject of an investigation. “The people of the Commonwealth, in approving the language of the constitutional amendment to require Board proceedings to remain confidential except when a judicial officer waives that right, did not intend to protect the confidentiality of any other persons involved in a proceeding against a judicial officer.” Slip op. at 4, May 10, 1995. Accordingly, it ordered disclosure of the identity of the complainant.</p>
    <p id="b613-3" data-blocks='[["BL_613.3",613,[193,289,1150,200]]]'>
      <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>The board counters with the argument that the court’s ruling confused the concepts of confidentiality and discoverability, and that the ruling was based on erroneous interpretation of the applicable constitutional provisions.</p>
    <p id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[193,515,1150,147]]]'>First, according to the board, the court erroneously construed the following sentences of Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18(a)(8). The section provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[235,679,1108,361]]]'>(8) Complaints filed with the board or initiated by the board shall not be public information. Statements, testimony, documents, records or other information or evidence acquired by the board in the conduct of an investigation shall not be public information.... All proceedings of the board shall be confidential except when the subject of the investigation waives confidentiality.</blockquote>
    <p id="b613-6" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[189,1061,1154,681]]]'>The court applied the waiver provision of the last quoted sentence to the confidentiality created in the first two sentences. The board argues that such an interpretation ignores the plain meaning of the constitution. The board suggests that the intent of the drafters was to protect a judicial officer in the event that a confidential investigation improperly becomes public information. “In those circumstances,” argues the board, “the judicial officer who is facing rumors and gossip concerning any actions taken by the Board, may wish to file a waiver so that he may participate in any hearings or meetings of the Board and open the proceedings to public scrutiny” so “there can be no claim that either the Board was persecuting the judge or “whitewashing’ the complaint.”</p>
    <p id="b613-7" data-blocks='[["BL_613.7",613,[187,1763,1156,573]],["BL_614.1",614,[257,289,1151,310]]]'>In the view of the board, waiver of confidentiality by the subject of an investigation does not make the documents set forth in the first two sentences of § 18(a)(8) discoverable. The constitution speaks of the confidentiality of “proceedings.” Board meetings and hearings are proceedings. Complaints and other information acquired by the board and minutes of board meetings are not proceedings; rather, they are records and information acquired by the board. The constitutional waiver language is designed so that the judicial officer under investigation by the board may open the proceedings to public scrutiny. There is no indication that the constitutional drafts<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>men intended to permit a judicial officer to obtain confidential information simply by filing a waiver after charges have been brought. After the board brings charges, it conducts no further proceedings with respect to the subject of its investigation; all further proceedings are conducted by the Court of Judicial Discipline, and all such proceedings are public.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[255,621,1154,685]]]'>The board argues, by analogy to the waiver of constitutional rights in a criminal case, that a waiver can only be effective if it occurs <em>prior to </em>surrendering the right in question. The constitutional section at issue addresses only proceedings of the Judicial Conduct Board, not proceedings of the Court of Judicial Discipline. Once formal charges have been filed and proceedings in the court have commenced, it is meaningless for the subject of the charges to waive confidentiality as to proceedings of the board, which have ended, for aü further proceedings before the court are public proceedings. In other words, the board claims, there remains no right of confidentiality to be waived once the board has filed formal charges and proceedings have begun in the court.</p>
    <p id="b614-6" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[254,1329,1156,1007]],["BL_615.1",615,[200,290,1154,308]]]'>Second, the board argues that the court made the “absurd” assumption that information which is not confidential is automatically discoverable. Production of documents, whether or not they are confidential, always requires a showing of relevance. While maintaining its position that the identity of the complainant is confidential, the board concedes that any information, including the identity of the complainant, is subject to disclosure if the judicial officer facing charges in the Court of Judicial Discipline can show a need for the information as well as its relevancy and materiality. In this case, however, the magistrate merely presented a boilerplate allegation that he needed the information in order to attack the bias or prejudice of complainants who testify at trial. The board averred that it had disclosed all information in its possession which was even arguably relevant to the adjudication of charges by the court. The complainant was not a witness at the trial, nor was the complainant even mentioned during the trial. Disclosure of the identity of a complainant carries the risk of retaliation or harassment, and should not be compelled unless the judicial <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>officer can state specific reasons which justify access to that information. The board again analogizes to the criminal law. The board argues that disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant to a criminal defendant, though it may be of vital interest, is not always required, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Carter, </em><a href="/pa/427/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="427 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1910370" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0053-01">427 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20284" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="233 A.2d 284">233 A.2d 284</a> (1967).</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[198,632,1155,582]]]'>Inasmuch as the board long ago disclosed the identity of the complainant to the magistrate pursuant to the order of the court, this matter is technically moot. It is nonetheless justiciable as an exception to the mootness doctrine because it is clearly “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, </em><a href="/us/457/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="457 U.S. 596" data-case-ids="6192549" data-case-paths="/us/457/0596-01">457 U.S. 596</a>, 603, <a href="/us/457/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="457 U.S. 596" data-case-ids="6192549" data-case-paths="/us/457/0596-01">102 S.Ct. 2613</a>, 2618, <a href="/us/457/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="457 U.S. 596" data-case-ids="6192549" data-case-paths="/us/457/0596-01">73 L.Ed.2d 248</a>, 254 (1982); <em>AY. v.

    <p id="b615-6" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[198,1247,1157,638]]]'>We agree with the board’s interpretation of the constitutional provisions governing confidentiality. Reading all of the relevant provisions together so as effectuate the intent of the drafters, we hold that a waiver of confidentiality by a judicial officer pursuant to § 18(a)(8) does not automatically entitle him to receive all the confidential information, including the complaint, acquired by the board in the course of its investigation. A waiver of confidentiality under § 18(a)(8) affects proceedings before the board prior to their termination, which may occur either upon the board’s dismissal of a complaint for lack of probable cause or upon the commencement of public proceedings in the Court of Judicial Discipline.</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">353 U.S. 53</a>, 61, <a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">77 S.Ct. 623</a>, 628, <a href="/us/353/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="353 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="6159521" data-case-paths="/us/353/0053-01">1 L.Ed.2d 639</a>, 645 (1957). In <em>Commonwealth v. Carter, supra, </em>this court interpreted <em>Roviaro </em>to require disclosure (of a confidential informant in a criminal case) only if it is relevant, material, and helpful to the defense, and the question requires a balancing <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>of the particular circumstances of each case, considering the crime charged, possible defenses, possible significance of the informant’s testimony, and other relevant factors. Thus, even in criminal cases which have the most liberal requirements of disclosure, the identity of an informant is not necessarily discoverable but depends always on materiality and relevancy, together with a balancing of other factors.</p>

The boilerplate allegation made by the magistrate in this case, that disclosure was necessary for “attacking the bias or prejudice of any complainants who testify at trial,” was far short of what was required, particularly as the complainant was never listed nor called as a witness. Thus, it was error for the Court of Judicial Discipline to order disclosure of the complainant’s identity in this case.</p>

He alleged that these records were essential to determine whether the board “violated its own rules of procedure and [his] due process rights by inappropriately ■ deferring any' investigation pending disposition of a criminal matter.” R.R. at 27a.

Again, we reject the notion that the magistrate’s waiver of confidentiality makes disclosure mandatory, for the reasons stated in relation to the first issue.

In 1991, in connection with an unrelated criminal case, police officers conducted a search of the magistrate’s residence, pursuant to a warrant, and discovered 43 grams of marijuana tied together at the root stems, lying on a beer tray under the magistrate’s bed. The beer tray also contained a Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board receipt dated June, 1984. The search failed to reveal any drug paraphernalia for using the <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>marijuana. The marijuana had been given to the magistrate by a friend at a party in the house and the magistrate placed it on a tray which had a liquor store receipt for the purchase of liquor for the party. After the party, the magistrate forgot about the marijuana and never saw it again until the search in 1991. He did not intentionally or knowingly possess the marijuana in 1991.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[224,663,1151,421]]]'>The board prosecuted the magistrate for misconduct, charging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the conduct violated Pa. Const. Art. V, § 17(b), engaging in any activity proscribed by law, and Pa. Const. Art. Y, § 18(d)(1), engaging in conduct which prejudices the proper administration of justice or brings the judicial office into disrepute. Following the trial, the court held that the magistrate had committed no misconduct which warranted the imposition of any disciplinary sanction.</p>
    <p id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[222,1119,1154,1015]]]'>The board’s first argument on this issue is that the court erred in concluding that the magistrate did not engage in criminal behavior in possessing marijuana. The first prong of this argument appears to be an unwillingness to accept the court’s factual finding that the magistrate did not intentionally or knowingly possess the marijuana when it was discovered. Our scope of review, as stated earlier, is limited to questions of law, and factual issues are clearly beyond that scope. Thus we must accept as a fact, as the court found, that the magistrate did not in fact possess the marijuana knowingly or intentionally. We must reject the board’s attempt to argue that such a finding is not a factual one, but a legal conclusion. Although knowledge and intent are legal elements of criminal possession, it is also possible to make a purely factual determination regarding knowledge and intent, which is what the court did in this instance. Even though such a factual finding may predetermine a legal conclusion as to possession with intent, it remains a factual finding. As such, it is not subject to review in this appeal.</p>

The board accurately sets forth the law of constructive possession, whereby an accused who is not personally in possession of contraband might yet be deemed to be in possession if the contraband was discovered in a place under his exclusive control, as the marijuana was in this case. Without extensive discussion, the defect in the board’s argument is the assumption that if the doctrine of constructive possession may be applied to the facts, then it must be applied. This is not so. The doctrine permits a finding of possession under these circumstances, but it does not require it. The court credited the magistrate’s testimony that he did not know the marijuana was under his bed and thus did not apply the doctrine of constructive possession. This is not an error of law.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[241,1167,1151,474]]]'>The board’s second argument on the marijuana incident is that, even if the magistrate was not guilty of a criminal violation, the conduct was certainly such as to bring the judicial office into disrepute. The board argues that a judicial officer, even in his private life, is held to higher standards than other citizens. It is not enough that a magistrate not violate the criminal law; the high standards of conduct contemplated in the Rules of Conduct for District Justices envision more than mere compliance with the criminal law.</p>

Two of seven judges dissented from the conclusion of the majority, indicating there is room for difference of opinion. Nevertheless, we will not override the decision to withhold sanctions. Although the conduct in this case might arguably bring the judicial office into disrepute, it is not indisputably such misconduct as de<a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>mands disciplinary sanctions, so we affirm this decision of the Court of Judicial Discipline.</p>

The court’s findings establish that at approximately 2:00 a.m. on February 8, 1992, the magistrate and a male friend were driving home from a club when they saw a teenage girl walking alone on the rural highway. The magistrate’s friend, who was driving, offered the girl a ride home. The friend dropped the magistrate and the girl at the magistrate’s house, where they got in his car and he drove her twelve miles to the town where she lived. As they approached the town, she asked him to leave her at a remotely located gas station so she could call her boyfriend. The magistrate asked her about her home and she told him her mother was an alcoholic and her father did not live with them. The magistrate refused to drop her at the gas station and, instead, returned her to his residence. She slept on a chair in his living room, he slept on a couch across from her, while his father slept in an upstairs bedroom. At approximately 8:00 a.m., he drove the girl to her grandmother’s house and waited outside until the girl entered the house. The magistrate did not touch the girl or make any sexual or improper advances towards her.</p>

While it may be true that the magistrate could have shown better judgment by exploring alternatives other than keeping the girl at his residence overnight, he did nothing improper with the girl, and, in fact, the entire situation arose out of his concern for the girl’s welfare when he and his friend first found her walking a rural highway in the middle of the night.
