    <p id="b754-4" data-blocks='[["BL_754.4",754,[268,448,1150,364]]]'>The disciplinary charges in this case arose from a fraud which Raiford perpetrated upon the judicial system in Allegheny County. In the course of representing two clients who had been charged with various criminal offenses, Raiford engaged in a series of flagrant deceptions that were designed to undermine the proper functioning of the criminal justice system. .</p>
    <p id="b754-5" data-blocks='[["BL_754.5",754,[265,841,1152,744]]]'>Raiford’s clients, Michelle Payne and Jonas Gillespie, had been charged with various narcotics offenses after police discovered drugs in a car in which they were seated. The car was owned by Gillespie. Raiford decided to benefit Gillespie at the expense of Payne through a scheme which utilized.an impersonator, Justine Wallace. Wallace, pretending to be Payne, was taken by Raiford to a police officer for the purpose of issuing a “confession.” After confessing, Wallace, again impersonating Payne, appeared with Raiford before a magistrate at a preliminary hearing. There she again stated that the drugs found in Gillespie’s car were her own. Raiford admits that he perpetrated these deceptions because Payne would not agree to say, that she owned the drugs found in Gillespie’s car.</p>
    <p id="b754-6" data-blocks='[["BL_754.6",754,[261,1611,1154,466]]]'>As a result of this fraud, the charges against Gillespie were withdrawn and the case against Payne proceeded to court. Soon thereafter, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Raiford again used Wallace to impersonate Payne. On that occasion, Wallace entered a plea of guilty for Payne and was sentenced to a term of probation. During the period when these deceptions were carried out, Raiford misrepresented to Payne the status of the charges against her so that she would remain unaware of his deeds.</p>
    <p id="b754-7" data-blocks='[["BL_754.7",754,[262,2111,1152,204]],["BL_755.1",755,[187,270,1153,308]]]'>Criminal charges were eventually filed against Raiford on the basis of the fraud which he perpetrated on the justice system. Convictions for obstructing administration of law or other governmental function (18 Pa.C.S. § 5101), unsworn <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>falsification to authorities (18 Pa.C.S. § 4904(a)), and tampering with public records or information (18 Pa.C.S. § 4911) ensued. Consequently, we suspended Raiford from the practice of law by order dated May 27, 1994. See Pa.R.D.E. 214(d) (temporary suspension of attorneys convicted of crimes). Raiford had no prior disciplinary record.</p>
    <p id="b755-4" data-blocks='[["BL_755.4",755,[188,602,1151,358]]]'>It is undisputed that conviction of a crime is in itself a basis for discipline.

The issue in this case is not, therefore, whether discipline is warranted; rather, it is whether the sanction of disbarment should be imposed in accordance with the recommendation of the board.</p>
