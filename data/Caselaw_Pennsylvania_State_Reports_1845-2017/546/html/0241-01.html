Officer Cartmell then transported appellee to the Tredyffin Township Police Station. At the police station appellee was again read the above cited warnings. Appellee again refused to submit to chemical testing without first consulting his attorney. Another officer, Officer Marc A. Reider, explained the <em>O’Connell </em>warnings once again to appellee, reiterating that he was not entitled to speak to counsel before the blood test. Appellee continued to refuse and to demand that he see his attorney. At that point a refusal was noted.</p>

Appellee appealed the suspension to the Court of Common Pleas. The trial court rescinded the suspension finding that because appellee believed he was entitled to consult with an attorney, he did not knowingly or consciously refuse to submit to the blood test. The trial court reasoned that although appellee was properly provided with <em>O’Connell </em>warnings, when Officer Cartmell then told appellee that “because this is a drunk driving case you do not have the right to counsel,” that misstatement of law increased appellee’s confusion, thus, vitiating the properly given <em>O’Connell </em>warnings.</p>

However, it was appellee’s burden, not DOT’s burden, to establish that he was <em>“not capable, </em>of making a knowing and conscious refusal to take the test.” <em>O’Connell, supra, </em>[emphasis supplied]. In essence, the trial court determined that although the officers had advised appellee of his <em>O’Connell </em>warnings, as appellee refused to believe the officers, his subsequent refusal to submit to chemical testing was not a knowing and conscious refusal. A motorist’s subjective beliefs are an insufficient justification for refusing to comply with the mandates of the Implied Consent Law.

Plainly stated, in the type of situations where this issue arises, we have a police officer dealing with a motorist who is suspected of being inebriated to the point that his ability to drive safely is being questioned. Obviously, when a motorist manifests intoxication to such a degree that an officer reasonably believes it is necessary to place the motorist under arrest and ask that the motorist submit to a chemical sobriety test, it <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>is reasonable to assume that the motorist may be somewhat confused.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[260,399,1154,728]]]'>The source of confusion for the motorist lies in the fact that the Implied Consent Law is civil in nature and deals only with the motorist’s continued privilege of having an operator’s license. Driving in Pennsylvania is a civil privilege conferred on state residents who meet the necessary qualifications. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1501. Under the terms of the Implied Consent Law, one of the necessary qualifications to continuing to hold that privilege is that a motorist must submit to chemical sobriety testing when requested to do so, in accordance with the prerequisites of the Implied Consent Law, by an authorized law enforcement officer. The obligation to submit to testing is related specifically to the motorist’s continued enjoyment of the privilege of maintaining his operator’s license. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(b).</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[255,1154,1155,838]]]'>The problem for most motorists is that the chemical sobriety test has the potential of revealing evidence that links the motorist to criminal wrongdoing, driving while under the influence (DUI). <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3731. Once the motorist has-been placed under arrest, the arresting officer normally provides <em>Miranda </em>warnings relevant to the criminal offense of DUI. So, armed with this knowledge of his rights, the motorist may reasonably assume he has the right to consult with an attorney before the chemical testing, or to refuse to submit to the testing as an exercise of his right to remain silent. The fact that the sanctions imposed by the Implied Consent Law are wholly separate and unrelated to the consequences of a criminal DUI prosecution is a nuance of the law that can readily escape the average motorist, let alone one suspected of being inebriated to the degree which prompted the officer to request that he submit to the test.</p>

Thus, we now hold, whenever a motorist has been requested to submit to chemical sobriety testing the motorist must be provided <em>O’Connell </em>warnings regardless of whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given, and, regardless of whether the motorist exhibits confusion concerning his rights when asked to submit to chemical sobriety testing.</p>

By requiring the officer to advise the motorist that his <em>Miranda </em>rights are not applicable to the request to submit to chemical sobriety testing, the officer can be assured that he has done everything possible to assist the motorist in making an informed decision consistent with that motorist’s rights as articulated by the Constitution and by the Implied Consent Law. Placing this additional burden on law enforcement in order to attempt to insure that a motorist is making a knowledgeable and informed decision is certainly reasonable and justified given the potential for confusion in circumstances such as these. Furthermore, the additional burden of requiring <em>O’Connell </em>Warnings, .whenever an officer requests a motorist to submit to chemical testing, is minor when balanced against the obvious need to verify that the motorist is fully aware of his rights and responsibilities. when being asked to submit to the testing.</p>
