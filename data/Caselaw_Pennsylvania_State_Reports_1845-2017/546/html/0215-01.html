This benefit formula is comprised of numerous terms that are defined in the Retirement Code. “Final average salary” is the “highest average compensation received as an active member during three nonoverlapping periods of 12 consecutive months.” <em>Id. </em>The “compensation” used in computing the final average salary is “any remuneration received as a school employee ... excluding any severance payments.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). “Severance payments” are defined as:</p>

The Lower Dauphin Termination Agreement altered the terms of the second employment contract by requiring Lower Dauphin to pay appellee a prorated salary of $12,253.80 for the period from the start of the 1984-85 school year on July 1, 1984 through <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>September 16, 1984.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> With respect to the period from September 17,1984 to November 30,1984, Lower Dauphin agreed to pay appellee a prorated salary of $15,411.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Starting December 1, 1984, appellee was to begin a year-long sabbatical that was to end on November 30,1985.

Appellee argues that these increases were not severance payments since neither increase was expressly "contingent on retirement.” The Board, in interpreting severance payments, has found retirement to include the termination of an employee’s relationship with an individual employer. <em>See In re: Claim of Thomas F.

This interpretation has been adopted by the Common- . wealth Court in <em>Howler, supra. </em>We cannot find this interpretation to be erroneous or inconsistent with the Retirement Code since such an interpretation will fulfill the General Assembly’s intention to preserve the actuarial soundness of the retirement fund by excluding payments from the computation of a member’s final average salary by excluding all payments which artificially inflate a member’s compensation. <em>Christiana, supra </em>at 140-42, <a href="/a2d/669/0940-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="669 A.2d 940" data-case-ids="11336561,461595" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/0940-01,/pa/543/0132-01">669 A.2d at 944</a>.
