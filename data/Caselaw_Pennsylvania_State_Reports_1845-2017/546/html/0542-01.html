Addressing whether Centre had violated section 1574(a), the trial court found that Centre had authorized or permitted Scribe to operate its van for work purposes; however, Scribe, with knowledge that Centre did not condone personal use of its company van by its employees, was using the vehicle to travel to and from a bar when the accident occurred. The trial court then concluded that there was nothing before the court which would show that Centre had “authorized” Scribe’s use of its vehicle at the time of the accident, and, therefore, nothing which would show that Centre -violated section 1574(a).

The Superior Court reasoned that, to hold an owner criminally responsible under section 1575 for the driver’s acts, if the driver exceeded the scope of the owner’s permission, would be to tie previously given lawful permission to an unknowable or unforeseeable after-the-fact occurrence. <em>Tharp, supra </em>at 293, <a href="/pa-super/373/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="373 Pa.

As we have explained, a violation of section 1574(a) occurs at the point in time that the owner (or controller) gives authority or permission to the unauthorized or unlicensed driver to drive the vehicle on the highway. By extending the basis for the <em>Tharp </em>decision into the civil liability statute at issue here, the Superior Court shifted the focus of the inquiry under section 1574 (i.e., the owner’s knowledge of the driver’s status as an unlicensed or unauthorized driver, at the time permission is granted) to the inquiry used for section 1575 (the owner’s knowledge, at the time permission is granted, of the manner in which his vehicle is to be driven in violation of law).

A violation of section 1574(a) occurs at the time the owner or controller entrusts his vehicle to one he knows, or has reason to know, is unauthorized, or unlicensed, to drive the vehicle on the highway. <em>Gibson, </em>therefore, does not circumscribe an owner’s section 1574 liability.
