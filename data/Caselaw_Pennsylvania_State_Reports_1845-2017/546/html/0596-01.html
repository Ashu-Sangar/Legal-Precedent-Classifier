To the contrary, although appellant attempts to portray this as a “refusal” to answer police interrogation, the evidence shows that appellant was never given the opportunity to <em>respond </em>to questioning- concerning the homicide as the' Cleveland police awaited the arrival of the investigators from the Erie police department. This Court has held that where a defendant neither explicitly invokes his <em>Miranda </em>rights nor declines to answer questions asked of him, there is no invocation of those rights. <em>Commonwealth v.

Specifically, he asserts that no reasonable jury could have fairly concluded that the one aggravating factor outweighed the one mitigating factor so as to warrant the death penalty. He argues that the verdict could have only been the result of confusion, bias or prejudice. In capital prosecutions it is exclusively for the jury to determine whether any mitigating factors exist, and if so, whether they outweigh credible aggravating circumstances. <em>Mitchell, supra </em>at 556, <a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">599 A.2d at 629</a>.</p>

However, the jury found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance and on October 25,1994, the trial court imposed the jury’s sentence of death for the first degree murder conviction and additionally sentenced appellant to serve an aggregate term of 6 to 12 years imprisonment.

Of the seven Justices agreeing on that issue, one concurred in the result only, four Justices found that the error in refusing to permit voir dire on racial bias affected only the penalty phase of the proceeding, and two Justices found the error affected both the guilt and penalty phases.

It is this limitation of <em>Turner </em>with which I cannot agree. In my opinion the holding of <em>Turner </em>was not restricted by the range of discretion that a particular sentencing jury wields under the Virginia capital sentencing scheme; rather, the court was focusing upon the greater discretion possessed by penalty <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>phase juries as opposed to guilt phase juries. The language of <em>Turner </em>which explains this distinction is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b740-5" data-blocks='[["BL_740.4",740,[285,407,1115,682]]]'>The inadequacy of voir dire in this case requires that petitioner’s death sentence be vacated. It is not necessary, however, that he be retried on the issue of guilt. Our judgment in this case is that there was an unacceptable risk of racial prejudice infecting the <em>capital sentencing proceeding. </em>This judgment is based on a conjunction of three factors: the fact that the crime charged involved interracial violence, the broad discretion given the jury at the death-penalty hearing, and the special seriousness of the risk of improper sentencing in a capital case. At the guilt phase of petitioner’s trial, the jury had no greater discretion than it would have had if the crime charged had been noncapital murder.</blockquote>
