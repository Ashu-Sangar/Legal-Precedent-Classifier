First, <em>Houston </em>interpreted a <em>Federal </em>Rule of Appellate Procedure and the matter before the Commonwealth Court was pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure. Second, the court noted that unlike in <em>Houston, </em>a petitioner appealing a Board order is entitled to counsel in Pennsylvania. <em>Bronson v.

Therefore, the prisoner had someone who was capable of posting his appeal. Finally, the court found that even if it desired to follow <em>Houston, </em>such a course would be in direct violation of Rule 1514, a rule promulgated by this court. Thus, the <em>Turner </em>court suggested <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>that any revision of that rule would have to come from this court.</p>

It is particularly troubling that according to Department of Corrections’ mailing privilege rules, an inmate may only utilize Form 3817 (or Form 3800) if he has funds available in his account, and that neither party could state whether Appellant had such funds or even if these forms are available at SCI-Graterford. <em>Smith, </em>661 A.2d at 907. Thus, arguably Appellant did all that he could reasonably be expected to do by obtaining a Cash Slip and by sending his appeal by first class mail. Certainly, our rules are not intended to be so rigidly applied as to result in manifest injustice where there has been substantial compliance and no prejudice. <em>Stout, </em><a href="/pa/491/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="491 Pa. 601" data-case-ids="1765657" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0601-01">491 Pa. at 605</a>, 421 A.2d at 1049.</p>

As the record before us does not contain the Cash Slip, the envelope which contained Appellant’s petition for review, and which would presumably have a postmark, was destroyed, and evidently there was no opportunity to offer evidence regarding the timeliness of Appellant’s appeal, we believe that the most appropriate course of action is a remand to the Commonwealth Court. There, an opportunity should be afforded Appellant to meet his burden of proof and come forward with evidence, such as the Cash Slip, and/or an affidavit, as to the date that he deposited his notice of appeal with the prison authorities. Although the burden is clearly on Appellant, if the Board so chooses, it may provide evidence that Appellant did not deposit, or could not have deposited, the notice of appeal in the prison mailbox within the thirty day time period for filing. Of course, evidence of routine practices of prison authorities regarding the pick-up and delivery of the <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>mail and any records regarding the dates of the deposit of outgoing mail may be offered by the Board in its response.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> A determination must then be made as to the timeliness of Appellant’s appeal.</p>

As there is a question whether Appellant did indeed file his notice of appeal in a timely fashion, we shall not address the merits of the appeal. This matter is remanded to the Commonwealth Court to determine the timeliness of Appellant’s notice of appeal and for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Appellees argue that <em>Houston </em>is further distinguishable because in <em>Houston, </em>the United States Supreme Court found that the mail room procedures involved in that case contained a detailed mail log that showed the date and time that the papers were received from the prisoners for mailing. It is argued that by contrast, the mail room at SCI-Graterford keeps no detailed log and that the prisoners anonymously deposit their mail in a prison mailbox. Yet, evidently, the mail room does keep a file card noting the number of letters for which each prisoner has been supplied free postage so that they may determine if the postage is free (for up to ten (10) letters) or is to be charged to the prisoner's account. Brief of Appellee atp. 11; <em>Smith, </em>661 A.2d at 907. While it may be true that the mailing procedures in the case at bar are different than those in <em>Houston, </em>we do not believe that this difference changes the outcome of the case. Certainly, the Board may want to institute a mail log system as a mechanism to dispute a prisoner's assertion that he mailed an appeal in a timely fashion.</p>
