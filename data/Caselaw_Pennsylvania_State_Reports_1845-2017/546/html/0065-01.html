After finding packets of cocaine that Cameron had thrown behind a couch, the police arrested him. The trial court granted the defendant’s motion to suppress, holding that the presence of a working television, a couch and food exhibited that the abandoned house was a dwelling place and was accordingly protected by Article I, Section 8. When reversing the trial court, the Superior Court acknowledged that Cameron manifested a subjective expectation of privacy by keeping a television, couch and food in the abandoned house. However, the Superior Court held that while Cameron did not need to show a property interest, he did need to establish some legal or <em>defacto </em>right to control the premises at issue to establish a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy.

Illinois, </em><a href="/us/439/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="439 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="11329017" data-case-paths="/us/439/0128-01">439 U.S. at </a>143 n. 12, <a href="/us/439/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="439 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="11329017" data-case-paths="/us/439/0128-01">99 S.Ct. at </a>430 n. 12 (1978). Therefore, a defendant can establish a legitimate expectation of privacy, despite lacking a common-law interest in the real property, if he demonstrates certain characteristics of ownership. Among the critical characteristics of ownership is the right to exclude others from the premises in question. <em>Rakas; Cameron. </em>Here, for example, the Superior Court concluded that the sheet hanging from the doorway in the kitchen effectively closed the room off from the rest of the house and society. The Superior Court clearly interpreted the presence of the sheet as an indication of Gordon’s right to exclude other people from the dining room in the abandoned house.</p>
    <p id="b199-6" data-blocks='[["BL_199.5",199,[199,1419,1154,786]]]'>However, we do not agree that Gordon sustained his burden of proving that the sheet served to exclude others from the dining room. Gordon did not present any testimony that he excluded other people living in the house from the dining room. Furthermore, as there was no testimony that Gordon hung the sheet himself, there was no reason for the Superior Court to conclude this sheet evidenced <em>Gordon’s </em>right to exclude others. Finally, Gordon’s claimed exclusion of the public from the dining room is implausible because the evidence revealed that the house had an unlocked, open exterior door. Thus, Gordon failed to produce sufficient evidence that the sheet hanging in the interior doorway of the open abandoned house exhibited his right to exclude others from the room in which he was claiming a legitimate expectation of privacy.</p>

However we find Gordon’s argument on behalf of the homeless disingenuous in light of Gordon’s testimony that he has a residence and a job. He testified at the sentencing hearing that he lives with his common-law wife and their three children at his wife’s grandmother’s house. Additionally, his attorney indicated at the sentencing hearing that Gordon’s family life is so stable that house arrest during his probation was not necessary. Also, Gordon testified at trial that he was a self-employed electrician who earned between $200.00 and $300.00 a week in non-reported income. Consequently, Gordon’s advocacy on behalf of the homeless rings hollow.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[238,966,1155,743]]]'>We conclude that, like the defendants in <em>Cameron </em>and <em>Peterson, </em>Gordon here has failed to prove that he has either a possessory interest, a legitimate presence or any factor from which society could recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy in the room in the abandoned house. Thus, we agree with the suppression court that although Gordon may have established a subjective expectation of privacy in the dining room of the abandoned house, he did not meet his burden of proving an expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as legitimate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Therefore, the officer’s warrantless search of the house did not violate Gordon’s rights under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.
