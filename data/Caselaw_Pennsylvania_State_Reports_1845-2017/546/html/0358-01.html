For the reasons set forth below, we find that such a complaint presents a non-justiciable political question, and on that basis, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s order which reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>

Section 13131 of the First Class City Home Rule Act provides that the City “shall have and may exercise all powers and authority of local self-government and shall have complete powers of legislation and administration in relation to its municipal function.” 53 P.S. § 13131; <em>See also Warren v.

Moreover, the status of City Council as a legislative body is set forth in the First Class City Charter Act which provides that “the legislative branch of the government of each city of the first class shall consist of a city council.” 53 P.S. § 12521. Thus, City Council, within the realm of its powers, is the legislative body under Philadelphia’s home rule form of government and it is entitled to the same deference as is the General Assembly. Therefore, this assertion fails. .</p>

Pursuant to this section of the Code, the City Council enacted such rules. Blackwell, however, argues that the internal rule in question constitutes a binding law that is subject to review by the courts. In order to determine whether the internal rule at issue constitutes a binding law that is subject to review by the Court, we must look to the manner in which it was adopted and the reason for which it was adopted.</p>

This distinction is certainly true in this instance since the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter expressly provides that “every legislative act of the Council shall be by ordinance and shall begin with the words: ‘The Council of the City of Philadelphia hereby ordains.’” 351 Pa.Code § 2.2-200. Resolution No. 1, however, was not entitled an ordinance and it did not begin with the proper language. Thus, Black<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>well does not present a claim based on a violation of a binding rule of law as opposed to a resolution pertaining to the internal workings of City Council.</p>

While the justiciability doctrine permits an exception where a legislative rule conflicts with the constitution or statute, no such suggestion of a conflict even appears in Blackwell’s complaint or brief. <em>See Zemprelli, <a href="/pa/496/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="496 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1772969" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0247-01">supra </a></em><a href="/pa/496/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="496 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1772969" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0247-01">at 258</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="496 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1772969" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0247-01">436 A.2d at 1170</a> (challenge to confirmation of certain gubernatorial appointments presented a justiciable question since it concerned whether internal rule conflicted with the constitution). Therefore, the issue of whether City Council violated its own internal rules is a non-justiciable political question. To hold otherwise would improperly result in judicial interference in the legislature’s conduct of its own internal affairs without expressing the “proper respect due to a coordinate branch of the government.” <em>Baker, supra </em>at 217, <a href="/us/369/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="369 U.S. 186" data-case-ids="6166554" data-case-paths="/us/369/0186-01">82 S.Ct. at 710</a>; <em>See also, Dintzis, supra </em>(claim that one Representative of Pennsylvania' House of Representatives violated House rules by manipulating his electronic roll call device presented a non-justiciable political question); <em>Ritter v.
