This issue was raised in written post-verdict motions, but Morris’ first post-verdict attorney <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>orally withdrew this claim at the evidentiary hearing on post-trial motions on November 12, 1986.

In addition, Morris presented two other witnesses at trial who testified that they were in the area at the time of the shooting and that Morris was not the man that they saw. Flowers’ testimony would therefore have been cumulative, and we cannot conclude that the absence of this testimony undermined the verdict.
