Lee knew the victims since he arid his girlfriend and child had lived with Mrs. Brown and her four children for approximately one year before Mrs. Brown asked him to leave in early 1986. On February 26, 1986, appellant and Lee knocked on the front door of the Browns’ apartment in the early evening hours and asked to use the telephone. Sonya Brown, one of Mrs. Brown’s daughters, recognized Lee and, hearing two voices, knew that he was not alone. Ms. Brown refused to let Lee in.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Lee then repeatedly kicked and banged on the door for several minutes.

At approximately 2:00 a.m., Denise Williams, a neighbor of the Browns, saw the two men standing outside the Browns’ front door. Williams observed appellant conversing through the closed door and heard the voice of one of the female occupants of the apartment. She also saw Lee standing to the side with his back against the wall, outside the view of the peephole in the door. <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>Appellant persuaded the occupants to let him inside the apartment.</p>

Gilbert had known Lee and his mother since Lee was a child. Lee had occasionally stayed with Gilbert after he was evicted from the Browns’ apartment. Lee awoke Gilbert and told him “I did something bad” and admitted “I stabbed Evelyn.” Lee then stuffed clothing into a plastic bag and told Gilbert he was going to his mother’s house. Lee left Gilbert’s apartment with appellant and both of them stayed together for a while at Lee’s mother’s home.</p>

Her body had a total of forty-eight stab, knife and puncture wounds to the face, neck, chest, side and thigh. The wounds had been inflicted through the use of cutting instruments, such as knives and scissors, and with such force that a rib was broken and wounds were inches in length and depth.</p>

Appellant had been present at the outside of the apartment earlier on the day when the killings occurred. He had observed someone else knocking on the door and departing when the knock was not answered. He later met the other person who showed appellant the two bloodied bodies and admitted that he had killed the victims.

C.S. § 9711(d)(10). The three mitigating circumstances were: the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); the age of the defendant at the time of the crime, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); and other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).

Detective Davis immediately stopped the interview and informed Detectives Naehurski and Lory of appellant’s request. Appellant interrupted this conversation and stated that he wanted to talk to Detective Naehurski, and that he was there, he did not do any stabbing but he did rape Tina Brown.

    <p id="b664-7" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[257,1571,1152,628]]]'>The record reflects that at the time of the suppression hearing, appellant had given counsel no reason to believe that he was mentally impaired or had a reading comprehension problem. Appellant communicated with counsel easily. Counsel reviewed appellant’s school records before the suppression hearing and determined that appellant was not in any special classes or curriculum for the learning disabled. It was in preparation for trial that counsel first suspected that appellant might have a reading problem. At trial, counsel presented a school psychologist, Mark Molyneux, to support his claim that appellant was unable to understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights or read and formulate his confession.</p>

This claim is contradicted by counsel’s testimony at the post-verdict hearing respecting the extent of his preparation. Further, appellant has failed to demonstrate what counsel should have done or that the outcome at the suppression hearing would have been different. Appellant’s claim has no merit.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[179,680,1152,1153]]]'>Appellant finally claims that trial counsel was ineffective when he failed to present evidence at a sidebar conference in the penalty phase regarding a mitigating circumstance. The record reflects that trial counsel did not request permission at a sidebar conference to incorporate Molyneux’s guilt phase testimony into the penalty hearing to prove mitigating circumstance (e)(3), respecting appellant’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and conform his conduct to legal requirements. When counsel made the request before the sentencing jury, the trial court properly denied the request. The court pointed out to trial counsel that the expert did not testify about any fact that would support (e)(3) and that counsel had failed to mention his intention to present the evidence for that purpose at the previous side-bar conference. Nevertheless, the court did permit incorporation of that evidence in order to prove mitigating circumstance (e)(8), respecting the character and record of the appellant and the circumstances of his offense. On review of the record, while the exchange of the court with counsel constituted mild criticism of counsel, it contained no criticism of appellant. Appellant has demonstrated no error and no prejudice, particularly since the evidence was admitted.</p>

Dr. Hoyer also testified that: both victims could have survived for at least five minutes after the infliction of the fatal wounds; the pain from the wounds to the nonvital parts would have continued during the period of dying; the pain caused by the wounds to the face and hands were the most painful due to the presence of numerous nerve endings at those body parts; and, the facial wounds were inflicted while each victim was alive, as evidenced by the substantial bleeding from the wounds.
