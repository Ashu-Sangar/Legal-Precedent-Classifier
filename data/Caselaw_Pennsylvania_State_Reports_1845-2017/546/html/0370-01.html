Everyone who had been sentenced to death under the statute was uniformly resentenced to a sentence of life imprisonment. Story’s case was on appeal at the time of the <em>Moody </em>decision; the result of Story’s appeal was reversal of his conviction due to trial error and the grant of a new trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

His second trial resulted in a sentence of death under a new, constitutional death penalty statute. In his second appeal, this court vacated his sentence of death and imposed a life sentence, holding that application of the new death penalty statute in Story’s second trial violated equal protection and due process. This was so because everyone sentenced to death under the prior, unconstitutional statute had automatically received a sentence of life imprisonment, even those who had been unsuccessful on appeal. To impose a new death sentence on Story, who had been successful on appeal, would have placed him in a worse position than everyone else sentenced under the prior statute. <em>Story, </em><a href="/pa/497/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="497 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1775301" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0273-01">497 Pa. at 281</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="497 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1775301" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0273-01">440 A.2d at 491</a>.</p>

The court instructed the jury that it must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had committed the robbery in the perpetration of the killing.

First, a different jury had judged appellant’s first sentencing hearing. This second jury had not heard the trial evidence, but was totally unfamiliar with the facts when the capital sentencing hearing began, as discussed infra. Second, the issues at the trial were different from the issues at the second sentencing hearing. The trial jury had to determine guilt or innocence of the crimes of murder and robbery. The second sentencing jury, on the other hand, had to accept the trial jury’s verdict that appellant had committed first-degree murder and robbery. Its tasks were to determine whether the killing occurred during the perpetration of the robbery, and, if so, to balance that aggravating factor against the mitigating factors presented by appellant. Thus, the admissibility of photographic evidence must be decided by different factors of relevancy. Although the photograph in question clearly depicted the victim and her injuries, it was presented to show the jury the circumstances surrounding the victim’s death, such as the geographically secluded nature of the area and the orientation of the body in relation to the victim’s personal belongings which had been scattered about in the course of the attack. Indeed, the vast majority of the testimony relating to the photograph dealt with these circumstances and not the victim or her injuries. Because the only aggravating factor presented was that the killing occurred during the commission of a felony, i.e., a robbery, the evidentiary nature of the photograph in relating the location of the body to the victim’s possessions clearly outweighs any potential of impassioning the jury. Therefore, we conclude that the admission of the photograph did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>

The court then correctly instructed the jurors that it was not their prerogative to debate whether they “like life rather than death,” but their responsibility was to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The jury was thus informed, as accurately as possible, of the meaning of a life sentence, and there was no deprivation of due process of the sort prohibited in <em>Simmons.</em>

The jury further found that the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factor and imposed the death penalty. This sentence is not excessive nor disproportionate to sentences imposed in similar cases. Further, the record does not provide any basis for belief that the sentence of death was the “product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)®.
