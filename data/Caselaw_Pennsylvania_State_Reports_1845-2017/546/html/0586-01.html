We clarify here that, contrary to the Commonwealth’s contention, Section 110(l)(iii)(A) does not operate as an exception to the application of Section 110(l)(i) or (ii) to a given set of facts.

Further, we disagree with Geyer’s contention that the trooper should have delayed issuing the speeding citation until receipt of DOT's verification of his license suspension. The trooper in this case complied with applicable law in immediately issuing the speeding citation and waiting to issue the second citation until after receipt of verification of Geyer's license suspension. A police officer has thirty days from the date of the offense (or discovery of the offense) in which to issue a citation for speeding or for driving with a suspended license. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5553. Pa.R.Crim.P. 60, directs an officer to issue a citation, where feasible, directly to the defendant at the time of the offense.</p>
