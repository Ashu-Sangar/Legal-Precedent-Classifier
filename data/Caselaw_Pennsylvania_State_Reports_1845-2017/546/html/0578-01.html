    <p id="b704-4" data-blocks='[["BL_704.4",704,[249,418,1159,636]]]'>Raymond Orwig owns property located in the general commercial zoning district in the Borough of Nazareth. The property contains a massive, one-story building and parking spaces. The building was erected in 1914 before the enactment of the Borough’s zoning ordinance. It is made of brick .and concrete and has been described as fortress-like. When Mr. Orwig bought the property, the building had been vacant for several years and was in disrepair. Because of the building’s heavy construction, razing it is cost-prohibitive. Renovation is also very expensive. Developing the property is further complicated by the fact that the building sits upon land containing hard rock and steep slopes.</p>
    <p id="b704-5" data-blocks='[["BL_704.5",704,[250,1085,1153,583]]]'>Mr. Orwig sought variances to the local zoning ordinance in order to develop the property. He proposed using the building’s first, floor for four commercial spaces and adding a second floor for ten one-bedroom apartments. Mr. Orwig found the addition of a second floor necessary to produce enough rent to cover the high cost of development. In addition to a variance to allow the construction of the second floor, Mr. Orwig needed variances from zoning ordinance provisions governing minimum lot area, maximum building coverage, maximum units per gross acre, yard, parking and landscaping requirements, and loading space on the street.</p>
    <p id="b704-6" data-blocks='[["BL_704.6",704,[249,1699,1153,367]]]'>In order to obtain a variance, an applicant must show that an ordinance imposes an unnecessary hardship dué to unique conditions peculiar to his property. 58 P.S.

Rather, the land adjacent to Mr. Orwig’s property has rock and slopes similar to those on his property. The record does not establish that the rock and slopes are a common hardship throughout the district necessitating rezoning.</p>
    <p id="b706-4" data-blocks='[["BL_706.4",706,[259,1217,1152,206]]]'>The fact that Mr. Orwig’s neighbors also have rock and slopes on their property does not preclude finding that Mr. Orwig suffers from a hardship due to the unique conditions of his property. As explained by the Board:</p>

We believe that the Commonwealth Court’s requirement that land be one-of-a-kind would prevent the grant of variances in many situations that warrant them. More often than not, a landowner shares some of the physical characteristics of his land with his immediate neighbors. The Board properly defined the test for uniqueness as follows:</p>
