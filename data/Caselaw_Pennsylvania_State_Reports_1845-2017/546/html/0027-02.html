The issue presented in this appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that the psychic injury resulted from abnormal working conditions. We hold that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that Lasher suffered psychic injury as a result of abnormal working conditions and reverse.</p>

In July 1980, Lasher became a district account supervisor with responsibility for direct buying customers and a greater dollar volume in Altoona, State College, Huntingdon, and DuBois. Her position involved contact of key accounts in that area and expanded her responsibilities to include the hiring, training, and supervision of a part-time sales representative who called on the convenience store trade.</p>

Sales were made to supermarkets, drugstores, candy and tobacco distributors, and mass merchandisers.</p>

Six months before her promotion, Lasher sought medical attention for fatigue and loss of energy. Lasher, who had married for the third time in 1984, lived apart from her husband during the work week. She resided in Pittsburgh while her husband <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>was employed and liyed in Altoona.

Illness plagued both her father and father-in-law. Her father-in-law died in February 1987. Lasher’s father, described as an unpleasant alcoholic, was hospitalized that year for cirrhosis and cancer. His condition was terminal. Although Lasher had never had a close relationship with her father, she responded dutifully to his growing dependence upon her.</p>

After evidentiary hearings, the referee determined that Lasher had sustained her burden of proof that she became disabled on June 6,1988, due to depression caused by a change in her working conditions and awarded benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Notably, the referee did not make any reference to abnormal working conditions in either her findings of facts or conclusions of law.</p>

The Board observed that the referee did not use the term “abnormal” in her decision, but inferred that the referee’s finding that Lasher was subjected to an excessive work load meant that abnormal working conditions caused her depression. The Board dismissed Hershey’s appeal. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board’s order, with Judge Doyle dissenting. We granted Hershey’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

Those regions were comprised of twelve districts, including Lasher’s district, with sales in excess of $230,000,000 and seventy-five full-time and seventy-five part-time employees.
