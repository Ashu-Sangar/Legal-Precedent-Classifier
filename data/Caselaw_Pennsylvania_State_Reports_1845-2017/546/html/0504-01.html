    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[261,414,1152,520]]]'>The issue presented in this appeal is whether the claimant, Lee A. Storoz, was properly awarded unemployment compensation benefits. In order to resolve that question this court must decide if the claimant voluntarily quit her employment or was terminated by her employer. If we find that claimant did voluntarily quit, we must determine if she did so for a necessitous and compelling reason. As we find that claimant did voluntarily quit and that she did so without a necessitous and compelling reason, we reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

In May of 1994, claimant was accepted for part-time employment with the United States Postal Service. Claimant was advised by the postal service that she would be required to undergo a week of training to be scheduled by the postal service before her employment with them would begin. Claimant had no control over the scheduling of the training period. Claimant requested that appellant allow her to utilize vacation time for the training period. However, appellant was unable to grant that request, as claimant was only entitled to two weeks vacation and the timing of her vacation was controlled by the collective bargaining agreement executed between appellant and claimant’s union. (See R.R. 95a-175a). According to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, all employees with two weeks vacation must take their vacation during the plant shutdown. (R.R. 123b Coll.bar.ag. § 19(D)). Claimant’s training period with the postal service did not coincide with either of the scheduled shut-down/vacation weeks.</p>

Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, a personal leave of absence for reasonable cause may be granted at the sole discretion of appellant. (R.R. 117a Coll.bar.ag. § 13.5).

No work <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>was available within claimant’s job classification on another shift during the week her postal service training was scheduled.</p>

Claimant continued to attend the training sessions at the postal service and called to report off at her job with appellant for the next three days.
