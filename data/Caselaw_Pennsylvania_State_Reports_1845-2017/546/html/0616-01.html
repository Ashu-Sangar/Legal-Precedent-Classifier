(See majority opinion at 620-21.) Rather, the majority, after citing the very language set forth above, finds that this jury was sufficiently apprised of the no adverse inference concept. The majority reaches this conclusion by finding that the no adverse inference concept was explained to the jurors in the opening remarks of the trial judge. The majority then bolsters its conclusion by tying the opening remarks to the language in the final charge which explained to the jury that the defendant has no obligation to participate in his own trial. In reaching this conclusion, the majority has ignored the very essence of <em>Lewis </em>which it professes to follow. Perhaps the error of the majority opinion is best illustrated by its omission of a significant portion of the <em>Lewis </em>opinion from which it quotes the above-referenced language. That missing language explains why piecemeal instructions to the jury throughout the trial are not adequate in replacing the no adverse inference instruction during the final charge prior to deliberation.

      <em>Such an argument, however, misses the mark. The specific constitutionally mandated “no-adverse-inference” charge may not be replaced by a patchwork of less direct instructions. </em>The entire premise underlying our requirement of the “no-adverse-inference” charge to the jury, under Article I, Section 9, is that the trial judge is vested with an obligation to protect the defendant’s right to remain silent, free from the insidious danger of adverse inference presented by a jury left free to wander in speculation. <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>Experience teaches us that the very exercise of an individual’s right not to testify, under Article I, Section 9, may endanger that right if the jury is left free to draw negative inferences from the defendant’s decision to exercise his or her constitutional privilege. The trial court, being in a unique position to protect a defendant’s constitutionally secured right through the jury charge, is the only bulwark to ensure that the exercise of a fundamental right does not turn into an act of constitutional suicide. Having determined in this Commonwealth that a “no-adverse-inference” charge is necessary to secure the guarantees of Article I, Section 9, the judge has either given the charge or he has not. Make-shift substitutes will not suffice. <em>Juries must be told in no uncertain terms that no adverse inference may be drawn from a defendant’s failure to take the stand; </em>otherwise, we are left to' mere guesswork as to the meaning juries have ascribed to tangentially related words of the court.

I find the majority’s distinction to be insufficient. In <em>Lewis </em>we rejected this piecemeal approach not because of the presence or absence of any “magic words” as the majority suggests, but because less direct means of conveying constitutional safeguards to the jury will not suffice. Legal principles scattered throughout a trial which can take days to conclude can never fulfill the same function as instructions related to the jury during the final charge which they receive immediately before beginning their deliberations. Thus, it is not the words used to convey the message alone which is at issue, but the combination of the <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>words and the timing of the instructions that are essential to protecting the defendant’s right to remain silent.
