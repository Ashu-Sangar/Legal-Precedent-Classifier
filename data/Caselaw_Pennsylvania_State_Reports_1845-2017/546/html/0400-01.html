See </em><a href="/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20360" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="21 U.S.C. § 360">21 U.S.C. § 360</a>(k)(a). Medical malpractice law simply does not place requirements on a device. Such law establishes requirements for the professional standard of care required of our medical community. Even where the allegation is that a physician committed malpractice while employing a medical device in his treatment, the issue to be resolved — and the law created by that resolution — concerns whether the physician’s conduct was reasonable. Resolution of that issue does not create standards concerning the safety and efficaciousness of the product in question.</p>
