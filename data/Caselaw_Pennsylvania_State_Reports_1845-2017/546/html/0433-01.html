Because we find that these remarks were wholly irrelevant to the issues at trial and created a strong possibility of substantial prejudice <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>to the defendant, we vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[182,390,1153,476]]]'>Thomas Hileman was employed by P &amp; LE as a laborer at its facility in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. On July 11, 1988, he reported to the diesel shop where he was given the job of cleaning locomotives. For most of the previous four years he had performed janitorial work and general labor in the service shop, but on that day a more senior member of the union had elected the service shop assignment. The cleaning job required Hileman to spray the locomotives with cleaning solution directed through a nozzle or gun by steam pressure.</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[182,894,1152,419]]]'>Approximately two months earlier, P &amp; LE had begun using a new piece of equipment, known as the Thermo-Blast System, on a trial basis. DuBois Chemicals, a division of Chemed Corporation, supplied the gun for free in consideration of P &amp; LE’s purchasing the cleaning chemicals for the system from DuBois. The system was supposed to cut costs by collecting the runoff, filtering out the dirt, grease and other impurities, and returning the cleaning solution to be used again.</p>
    <p id="b559-6" data-blocks='[["BL_559.6",559,[179,1341,1154,573]]]'>The Thermo-Blast gun differed in design from the equipment that Hileman had used several years before when he had been assigned to clean locomotives. The Thermo-Blast gun required the operator to grip a trigger mechanism with one hand in order to start and maintain the flow of steam and cleaning solution; releasing the trigger would stop the flow through the gun independently from the main valves. The older gun had been essentially a large nozzle with handles; to start and stop the flow of steam and cleaning solution the operator was required to use the main valves located elsewhere.</p>

At the end of the day, his hands were swollen and sore. That night he experienced soreness and a burning sensation in his hands, fingers, and wrists, which continued through the next morning when he reported for work. The supervisor sent Hileman to the company nurse, who sent him to the hospital. Although he was released by <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the hospital for light duty work, his hands were hurting so badly that he had to go home. Again the next day he had problems and went to see a doctor, who attempted to alleviate the pain and advised Hileman not to return to work.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[253,507,1153,907]]]'>When the doctor released him to work on July 25, Hileman was advised that he was furloughed. He returned to work on November 15 and worked fueling locomotives until the end of the year. He was then furloughed from that position but obtained an identical position in Youngstown, Ohio. He returned to the McKees Rocks location in May of 1989, and worked there until February of 1990. Throughout this period and after, Hileman continued to suffer intermittent severe pain and difficulty using his hands and fingers to perform ordinary tasks. His physician described Hileman’s condition as reflex sympathetic dystrophy. He offered the opinion that the condition was caused by the effort needed to control the high pressure system. He further indicated that Hileman was being treated with the steroid Prednisone and gold shots, and that although these treatments seem to control the swelling and moderate the pain, the condition is permanent and will continue to flare up and require regular monitoring.</p>

Hileman’s ineligibility for workers’ compensation benefits was irrelevant to any of the issues to be tried. The only reason offered by the court for presenting this information to the jury was that the jury would “be likely to assume that there is worker’s [sic] compensation, and ... that assumption has to be negated early on.” (Tr. Vol.I, p. 12) The court failed to articulate, however, why that assumption had to be negated. In a related context, it has never appeared necessary to negate any assumption that <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>there is workers’ compensation (or subrogation for that matter) in actions by employees against third parties for injuries that occur on the job. Proper instructions on the elements of liability and damages are adequate to focus the jury’s attention on the issues to be decided. Information about the lack of workers’ compensation can serve only to create sympathy for the plaintiff and potential prejudice against the defendant.</p>

They highlighted the fact that railroad workers “are different from most other employees here in Pennsylvania who are injured on the job and get worker’s [sic] compensation payments, regardless of whether or not their employer was negligent. Railroad employees do not automatically receive worker’s [sic] compensation payments, and instead, must prove their employer was negligent.” (Tr. Vol.I, p. 40) Thus in addition to possibly creating sympathy for an injured person who was not being compensated, these comments suggested an unfairness of result between Hileman and “most other employees”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>must also be noted that because the employer’s liability in FELA cases can be based on a finding of even the slightest bit of negligence, the effect of any prejudice against the defendant is particularly acute.</p>

      <blockquote id="b565-6" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[235,1512,1087,707]]]'>it came to be recognized that, whatever the rights and duties among persons generally, the industriad employer had a special responsibility toward his workers, who were daily exposed to the risks of the business and who were largely helpless to provide adequately for their own safety. Therefore, as industry and commerce became sufficiently strong to bear the burden, the law, the reflection of an evolving public policy, came to favor compensation of employees and their dependents for the losses occasioned by the inevitable deaths and injuries of industrial employment, thus shifting to industry the “human overhead” of doing business. For most industries this change has been embodied in Workmen’s Compensation Acts. In the railroad and shipping industries, however, the FELA and Jones Act provide the framework for determining liability for industrial accidents .... [I]t is clear that the general congressional intent was to provide liberal recovery for injured workers ... and it is also clear that Congress intended the creation of no static remedy, but one which would be developed and enlarged to meet changing conditions and changing concepts of industry’s duty toward its workers.</blockquote>

More recently, judicial and scholarly criticism has noted that there are no longer any doubts about the constitutionality of workers' compensation programs that might have existed when the FELA was passed and that might explain Congress’s choice of that remedy rather than a workers’ compensation plan. "Under Workers’ Compensation laws, reimbursement of medical expenses and, at least to some extent, lost wages do not rely on such subtleties as have been raised in this case. Recompense for industrial injuries ... should not have to depend on the vagaries of a statute such as ... FELA or on the whims of juries or the delays of litigation.” <em>Reed v.

Any unfairness therefore must be remedied by Congress. Although the intent of the FELA may be to "provide liberal recovery for injured workers,” according to the law that recovery must be based on a finding of employer negligence. The scope of the employer’s duly, the degree of the employer’s negligence, and other elements may be defined to ease the plaintiff's burden, but the trial of the issues cannot be skewed in favor of either party.</p>
