In her introduction Shuster observed, “It may be that the evaluations done utilizing the criteria set forth below will be more stringent than previous evaluations done by previous supervisors.

This contention is unsupported by the record. To the contrary, the evidence established that Blecker’s superiors had expressed continual dissatisfaction with his performance because of his inordinate attention to detail and resulting inability to dispose of cases assigned to him. Blecker’s commitment to his work was unassailed but, unfortunately, his perfectionism prevented him from handling the volume of cases as expected.</p>

When an employer has not previously done so, the implementation of performance standards, even if applied to employees who were hired earlier, is not an abnormal working condition per se. It is not unusual that a change in supervisory personnel will portend other changes for employees who are under their direction. The performance of an employee’s job responsibilities is typically judged by the expectations of the employer, whether communicated in writing or verbally.</p>

The written standards provided more definitive guidelines as to the employer’s expectations. Blecker’s supervisor referred to those standards in completing the evaluation form. An overview of the evaluation form, however, indicates that Blecker’s performance was not judged simply by reference to the 1984 litigation standards.</p>

The remaining factors required Blecker’s supervisor to consider qualities and traits that were not defined by the number of cases handled by an HRC attorney.

Recommendations <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>were also made as to how Bleeker might improve those weaknesses.

The memorandum referred to the fact that Bleeker had requested that an evaluation be done several times before. His supervisor simply responded to this request.</p>
