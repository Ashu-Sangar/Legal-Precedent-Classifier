He returned to light-duty work on May 31, 1991, this time with the Mercer County Association for the Retarded (“MCAR”). He was indefinitely suspended by MCAR on June 26, 1991 for alleged misconduct, and the suspension was later converted into a permanent discharge effective <em>I </em>gust 1,1991.</p>

The WCJ determined that he was bound by the unemployment referee’s findings of fact, which could not be re-litigated. In light of those findings, the WCJ concluded that “there is no possible way the [E]mployer would be able to demonstrate that the Claimant’s actions of June 25 and 26, 1991 exhibited unsatisfactory efforts and performance.” (WCJ’s Decision, Appellant’s Br. at A-6.) The WCJ therefore reinstated Claimant’s benefits,, reasoning that Employer was collaterally estopped from re-litigating the misconduct issue and would thus be unable to establish unsatisfactory conduct on Claimant’s part warranting a denial of reinstatement.</p>

On March 10, 1994, the Board amended its initial order to certify that the issue in question warranted an interlocutory appeal by permission, because it involved a controlling question of law with substantial ground for difference of opinion. <em>See </em>42 Pa. Cons.Stat. § 702(b) (1981). The Commonwealth Court subsequently granted Claimant’s petition for permission to appeal pursuant <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>to Pa. R.A.P. 1311 and 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. § 702(b) (1981). Sitting <em>en banc, </em>the court affirmed, with the Majority finding no identity of issues and thus no collateral estoppel. The Dissent, however, concluded that collateral estoppel did apply since the conduct standard in the unemployment setting was essentially identical to the standard used in workmen’s compensation cases.</p>

Employer, on the other hand, argues that estoppel does not apply because the conduct issue involved in deciding whether a claimant is entitled to a reinstatement of workmen’s compensation benefits is different from that involved in determining whether a claimant qualifies for unemployment compensation. Because these standards differ, Employer contends, there is no identity of issues and thus no estoppel.</p>

This issue is not one of misconduct akin to that found in the unemployment benefits setting; it is a question centering solely on whether the claimant’s injury is again affecting his ability to earn. An award of unemployment compensation benefits, on the other hand, turns on a question of “willful misconduct,” i.e., on the presence or absence of a defined level or degree of misconduct. <em>See </em>43 Pa.
