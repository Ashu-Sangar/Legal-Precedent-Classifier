Wiseman, </em>32 D. &amp; C.3d 294 (1983). In that ease, Judge Rodgers declared § 83.4 unreasonable concluding that there appeared to be no basis for the view that one epileptic seizure renders all persons unsafe to operate a motor vehicle for a period of at least one year. In support thereof, Judge Rodgers cited to several medical publications which indicate that the symptoms and frequency of epilepsy vary with each individual, noting as well that the Department offered no countervailing evidence that would suggest that every person who experiences one epileptic seizure is rendered unsafe to drive a motor vehicle. Alternatively, Judge Rodgers ruled that even if reasonable, the regulation offends procedural due process insofar as it provides for no meaningful hearing, but rather creates an irrebuttable presumption that such a person is incompetent to drive for a period of one year.</p>

The Commonwealth Court ultimately affirmed on the basis that § 83.4 violated procedural due process by creating an impermissible irrebuttable presumption.

The Department argues in the alternative that even assuming the “irrebuttable presumption” doctrine is one of procedural due process, § 83.4(a) does satisfy procedural due process insofar as Appellee had a right to a <em>de novo </em>hearing at which he could have presented evidence to rebut the fact that he had an epileptic seizure.</p>

While we do not believe it wise to pigeonhole whether an analysis of an irrebuttable presumption is solely one of substantive or procedural due process, the Commonwealth Court here nevertheless properly relied upon <em>Bell, <a href="/us/402/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="402 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="11734271" data-case-paths="/us/402/0535-01">supra</a> </em>in reaching its decision that the presumption contained in § 83.4 was violative of due process because it precluded that class of licensees ade<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>quate process.

      <em>Bell </em>is particularly instructive here insofar as the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bell </em>addressed the issue of whether a similar irrebuttable presumption violated procedural due process. More specifically, the Court there addressed a due process challenge to a Georgia statute which provided for the suspension of an uninsured driver’s license and registration where the licensee had been involved in an accident and failed to post security to cover the amount of damages claimed by the aggrieved party. The due process challenge in <em>Bell </em>focused on the fact that although an administrative hearing was permissible under the statutory scheme, the uninsured motorist was not permitted, at any such hearing, to submit proof that he or she was not liable for the accident. The Court found this particular statutory scheme violative of due process. Specifically, the Court held that before the state could suspend such person’s license and registration, procedural due process required a determination as to whether there was a reasonable probability that the uninsured licensee would ultimately be found liable. The Court reasoned that the government’s interest in protecting a claimant from the possibility of an unrecoverable judgment did not justify denying the uninsured licensee the process due him or her where there was no reasonable chance of a judgment being rendered against the licensee. The Court also determined that the additional expense associated with an expanded hearing did not justify denying the licensee a hearing meeting the ordinary standards of due process. <em>See, Bell </em><a href="/us/402/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="402 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="11734271" data-case-paths="/us/402/0535-01">402 U.S. at 540-41</a>, <a href="/us/402/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="402 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="11734271" data-case-paths="/us/402/0535-01">91 S.Ct. at 1590</a>, <a href="/us/402/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="402 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="11734271" data-case-paths="/us/402/0535-01">29 L.Ed.2d at 95</a>.</p>

However, given the nature of the matter currently before the courts, it cannot be gainsaid that any “meaningful” opportunity to be heard would here require that the licensee be permitted to present objections, not to the conclusion that he had suffered an epileptic seizure, but rather to the presumption of incompetency to drive. <em>See, Bell, <a href="/us/402/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="402 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="11734271" data-case-paths="/us/402/0535-01">supra.</a> </em>While Appellee indeed had a forum in which to assert his claim that he was competent to drive, that forum was rendered meaningless as a result of the irrebuttable presumption of § 83.4(a) since under that regulation, the recall of Appellee’s license was a foregone conclusion.

But, it is not an interest which outweighs a person’s interest in retaining his or her license so as to justify the recall of that license without first affording the licensee the process to which he is due.

As recognized in statutory and case law, enactments of the General Assembly enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality and they are not to be found unconstitutional unless they clearly, palpably and plainly violate the constitution. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3); <em>Commonwealth v. Nicely, </em><a href="/pa/536/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="536 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1843237" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0144-01">536 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="638 A.2d 213" data-case-ids="1843237,7357218" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0144-01,/a2d/638/0213-01">638 A.2d 213</a> (1994). Administrative regulations adopted pursuant to a grant of authority from the legislature, which are within the scope of the authority granted, are entitled to the same presumption, and the party challenging such laws or regulations bears a heavy burden of proving a clear constitutional violation.</p>

Legislation by its nature requires the <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>drawing of distinctions and these distinctions need not make allowance for individual circumstances in order to be valid. Apart from the assertion that the regulation creates an irrebuttable presumption, the licensee’s argument here is essentially that he is being treated differently from other drivers (is being denied equal protection) because of the occurrence of an epileptic seizure. I believe the Department has demonstrated a rational basis for the regulation.</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[166,729,1156,786]]]'>The General Assembly has established a Medical Advisory Board to “formulate rules and regulations for adoption by the department on physical and mental criteria ... relating to the licensing of drivers....” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1517(b). The rule in question at 67 Pa.Code § 83.4(a) is such a regulation. The Medical Advisory Board made an administrative judgment that the risk to the public from possible recurrence of an epileptic seizure within one year was significant enough to warrant a limited interference with a private interest in maintaining a driver’s license. The Department asserts that this period was deemed necessary “to ascertain the effectiveness of any anti-seizure medication which a licensee might have been prescribed, and to determine whether the licensee will be subject to the onset of further seizures.” Appellant’s Brief at 15-16.</p>
    <p id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[167,1547,1154,794]],["BL_480.1",480,[252,288,1152,259]]]'>Apart from lack of clarity in the analysis, I am also concerned about the lack of clarity in the outcome. It is simply not enough to state that the regulation violates due process. The majority apparently concludes that due process requires that the licensee be afforded a hearing at which an individualized determination of competency to drive can be made before the license can be recalled. Given the significant danger to the public, I would think that in these circumstances the Department should be permitted to recall or suspend the license first, until it is determined that the licensee is not at risk of having another seizure. The majority also fails to address the obvious question of who bears the burden of proof at any hearing. If the flaw in the regulation is that the presumption is irrebuttable, it would seem that a rebuttable presumption would satisfy the majority’s concerns. The Med<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>ical Advisory Board’s assessment of the risks, favoring suspension, would then be the starting point and the licensee would bear the burden of demonstrating by competent evidence that in his particular case those risks have been adequately minimized. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

The majority addresses the irrebuttable presumption "doctrine” in terms of procedural or substantive due process, suggesting that it matters not which. In a case that bears a striking resemblance to this one, <em>Commonwealth, Department of Transportation v. Slater, </em>75 Pa. Cmwlth. 310, <a href="/citations/?q=462%20A.2d%20870" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="462 A.2d 870">462 A.2d 870</a> (1983), a school bus driver’s license was suspended pursuant to a regulation making it a condition of holding such a license that a person have no history or diagnosis of diabetes requiring use of insulin or hypoglycemic medication. Commonwealth Court rejected the driver’s irrebuttable presumption argument and suggested that the irrebuttable presumption “doctrine” was a permutation of <em>equal protection </em>analysis that had limited application. See <a href="/citations/?q=462%20A.2d%20870" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="462 A.2d 870">462 A.2d at 876-881</a>. Nothing about the most recent case from the United States Supreme Court wherein the irrebuttable presumption concept was discussed, <em>Michael H. v.
