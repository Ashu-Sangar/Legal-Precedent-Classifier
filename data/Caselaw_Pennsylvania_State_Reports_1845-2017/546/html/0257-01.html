On December 15, 1987, while at work, Claimant sustained an injury to his lower back when he slipped and fell inside a tank in the shop area. After the accident, Claimant continued to work in his same position without any loss in earnings. On February 3, 1988, following customer complaints about Claimant’s work performance, Employer told Claimant that he must <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>resign or he would be fired. As a result, Claimant resigned on February 3,1988. On March 11,1988, Claimant was issued a Notice of Compensation Payable for his work-related back injury, and pursuant thereto received worker’s compensation benefits.</p>
    <p id="b383-4" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[172,582,1157,901]]]'>On April 14, 1988, Employer filed a petition to terminate and/or suspend benefits. Following hearings, the Worker’s Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) denied Employer’s termination petition, and granted Employer’s petition to suspend Claimant’s benefits as of March 31,1988, finding that Employer had demonstrated that Claimant was capable of returning to modified work, and that Claimant had voluntarily resigned. Claimant appealed to the Worker’s Compensation Appeal Board (“WCAB”), which remanded the case for further factual findings regarding the voluntariness of Claimant’s resignation. On remand, the WCJ concluded that Claimant’s resignation was involuntary, and reinstated Claimant’s total disability benefits as of March 31, 1988. The WCJ reasoned that since Employer had not demonstrated that Claimant was terminated for “willful misconduct” or “intentional wrongdoing,” the Employer had failed to meet its burden for suspension of benefits under the Act. The WCAB affirmed.</p>
