        "text": "OPINION\nCAPPY, Justice:\nThe issue presented in this appeal is whether the claimant, Lee A. Storoz, was properly awarded unemployment compensation benefits. In order to resolve that question this court must decide if the claimant voluntarily quit her employment or was terminated by her employer. If we find that claimant did voluntarily quit, we must determine if she did so for a necessitous and compelling reason. As we find that claimant did voluntarily quit and that she did so without a necessitous and compelling reason, we reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nClaimant had been employed full-time for appellant, Du-Co Ceramics, until July 9, 1994. In May of 1994, claimant was accepted for part-time employment with the United States Postal Service. Claimant was advised by the postal service that she would be required to undergo a week of training to be scheduled by the postal service before her employment with them would begin. Claimant had no control over the scheduling of the training period. Claimant requested that appellant allow her to utilize vacation time for the training period. However, appellant was unable to grant that request, as claimant was only entitled to two weeks vacation and the timing of her vacation was controlled by the collective bargaining agreement executed between appellant and claimant\u2019s union. (See R.R. 95a-175a). According to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, all employees with two weeks vacation must take their vacation during the plant shutdown. (R.R. 123b Coll.bar.ag. \u00a7 19(D)). Claimant\u2019s training period with the postal service did not coincide with either of the scheduled shut-down/vacation weeks.\nClaimant then requested a leave of absence. Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, a personal leave of absence for reasonable cause may be granted at the sole discretion of appellant. (R.R. 117a Coll.bar.ag. \u00a7 13.5). AppeUant denied claimant\u2019s request for a leave of absence. Claimant then attempted to arrange a shift change. No work was available within claimant\u2019s job classification on another shift during the week her postal service training was scheduled.\nClaimant\u2019s last day of work for appellant was Friday, July 9, 1994. On Monday, July 12, 1994, claimant began training for the postal service. Claimant called appellant on July 9, 1994 and reported off work for personal reasons. Claimant continued to attend the training sessions at the postal service and called to report off at her job with appellant for the next three days. On the final day of her training with the postal service, claimant did not report off to appellant as she had been informed by a co-worker that she had been terminated.\nOn July 13, 1994, the second day claimant had failed to report for work with appellant, appellant sent claimant a registered letter stating:\nBy your failure to report to work as scheduled, Du-Co Ceramics Company has concluded you have terminated your employment by your repeated refusal to report to work as scheduled.\nThis conclusion is based on our conversation of Tuesday, July 12, 1994 in which you informed me of your intention to complete the training you are currently receiving to obtain a job with the U.S. Postal Service in lieu of reporting to work as scheduled.\nIf this is incorrect or you believe there is a misunderstanding as to the reason for your absence, please contact me between the hours of 7:00 am and 4:00 pm.\nPlease contact me to make arrangements for your pension and other related matters concerning termination of employment at your earliest convenience if the above mentioned is true and correct.\nSincerely,\nBert T. Drum\nHuman Resources Manager\nClaimant testified that she received the notice that a registered letter had been sent to her on July 13,1994 and that she did receive this letter Saturday, July 17, 1994 when she retrieved it from the post office. (R.R. 27a).\nOn July 26, 1994, claimant filed for unemployment compensation benefits. Appellant contested the claim for benefits and a hearing was held on the claim on October 17,1994. The referee determined that claimant was entitled to benefits under 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(b) of the unemployment compensation law. The referee found that claimant had quit employment, but she was entitled to benefits as the quit was for a necessitous and compelling reason.\nOn appeal to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board), the referee\u2019s decision was affirmed. The Board, however, found that claimant had not quit. The Board then went on to find that claimant had been terminated and that appellant had failed to prove that her termination was justified on the basis of willful misconduct pursuant to 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(e) of the unemployment compensation law.\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision of the Board. The Commonwealth Court agreed with the Board that claimant had not quit employment, but rather, had been terminated and further, that appellant had failed to preserve the issue of willful misconduct for appeal. This court then granted appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal.\nWhen reviewing an appeal in an unemployment compensation case our scope of review is limited to a determination of whether constitutional rights were violated, errors of law were committed or findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence. See Bowen v. Unemployment Compen sation Board of Review, 156 Pa.Cmwlth. 552, 628 A.2d 513 (1993). The question of whether a claimant has voluntarily quit employment is a question of law, based upon the particular facts of the case. Evans, Portnoy & Quinn v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 665 A.2d 548 (Pa. Cmwlth.1995). A claimant who voluntarily quits employment carries the burden of proving that the quit was for a necessitous and compelling reason. Taylor v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 474 Pa. 351, 378 A.2d 829 (1977). Where the termination is based upon willful misconduct the burden of proof rests upon the employer. United Refining Co. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 661 A.2d 520 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995).\nIn the case at bar the claimant made a conscious decision not to report for work as scheduled knowing that appellant had denied her earlier requests for vacation, leave of absence, or a shift change. When a claimant voluntarily absents him or herself from work the claimant will only be eligible for compensation if the claimant\u2019s actions resulted from a necessitous and compelling reason. Taylor. As this court stated in Taylor, a necessitous and compelling reason for leaving one\u2019s employment \u201cresults from circumstances which produce pressure to terminate employment that is both real and substantial, and which would compel a reasonable person under the circumstances to act in the same manner.\u201d Taylor, at 359, 378 A.2d at 832-33. In further elucidating the nature of necessitous and compelling reason the Taylor court went on to state:\nWhen therefore the pressure of real not imaginary, substantial not trifling, reasonable not whimsical, circumstances compel the decision to leave employment, the decision is voluntary in the sense that the worker has willed it, but involuntary because outward pressures have compelled it. Or to state it differently, if a worker leaves his employment when he is compelled to do so by necessitous circumstances or because of legal or family obligations, his leaving is voluntary with good cause, and under the act he is entitled to benefits. The pressure of necessity, of legal duty, or family obligations, or other overpowering circumstances and his capitulation to them transforms what is ostensibly voluntary unemployment into involuntary unemployment.\nTaylor, at 359-360, 378 A.2d at 833; quoting, Bliley Electric Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. Of Rev., 158 Pa.Super. 548, 556-557, 45 A.2d 898, 903 (1946).\nThe Claimant in the present case had told her employer that she always wanted to work for the postal service. (R.R. 10a). At the hearing on her claim petition claimant offered no reasons for her action in failing to report for work as scheduled, other than the explanation that she had attempted to arrange time off with her employer and her attempts were unsuccessful, therefore she chose not to report. (R.R. 28a\u2014 31a). Claimant\u2019s efforts to secure time off with the employer\u2019s approval are laudable; however, the employer was under no obligation to accede to claimant\u2019s request. Claimant chose to leave her employment at Du-Co Ceramics in order to obtain part-time employment with the postal service. Claimant fails to offer any explanation for her actions which would indicate that she was under pressure of a real and' substantial nature which compelled her decision to voluntarily leave her full-time employment. As this court stated in Snyder v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 509 Pa. 438, 445, 502 A.2d 1232, 1236 (1985):\nWhen this court defined \u2018necessitous and compelling\u2019 cause for leaving work as \u2018circumstances which produce pressure to terminate employment that is both real and substantial,\u2019 it was never contemplated that the \u2018circumstances\u2019 might be the employee\u2019s personal goals, aspirations or ambitions which conflicted with some reasonable policy or requirement of the employer.\nThe facts in the instant case compel this Court to reach the legal conclusion that this claimant voluntarily quit her employment with Du-Co Ceramics and, claimant has failed to meet her burden of proving that she quit for a necessitous and compelling reason. Accordingly, claimant is not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits. The decision of the Commonwealth Court is reversed. Jurisdiction is relinquished.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\n. 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(b) provides, in pertinent part, that an employee shall be ineligible for compensation for any week\u2014\n\"In which his employment is due to voluntarily leaving work without cause of a necessitous and compelling nature, irrespective of whether or not such work is in \"employment\u201d as defined in this act:\u201d\n. 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(e) provides that an employee shall be ineligible for compensation for any week\u2014\n\"In which his unemployment is due to his discharge or temporary suspension from work for willful misconduct connected with his work, irrespective of whether or not such work is \"employment\u201d as defined in this act;\u201d\n. Although never directly stated, this court has always followed the same scope of review in unemployment cases as set forth by the Commonwealth Court. See Truitt v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 527 Pa. 138, 589 A.2d 208 (1991); Monaco v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 523 Pa. 41, 565 A.2d 127 (1989); Genetin v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 499 Pa. 125, 451 A.2d 1353 (1982); and, Taylor v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 474 Pa. 351, 378 A.2d 829 (1977).\n. Given our resolution of this matter we do not reach the issue of willful misconduct. We do note however, that appellant did not raise that issue before the referee. It appears from the record that the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review sua sponte raised the issue of wilful misconduct.",
