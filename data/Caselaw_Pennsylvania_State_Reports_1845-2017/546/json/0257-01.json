        "text": "OPINION\nNIGRO, Justice:\nThis is a worker\u2019s compensation case involving a suspension of benefits under section 772 of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (\u201cthe Act\u201d) Appellee Claimant Larry Bowers (\u201cClaimant\u201d) was employed by Appellant Employer Hertz-Penske Truck Leasing Company (\u201cEmployer\u201d) as a Service Manager-Supervisor of Maintenance. On December 15, 1987, while at work, Claimant sustained an injury to his lower back when he slipped and fell inside a tank in the shop area. After the accident, Claimant continued to work in his same position without any loss in earnings. On February 3, 1988, following customer complaints about Claimant\u2019s work performance, Employer told Claimant that he must resign or he would be fired. As a result, Claimant resigned on February 3,1988. On March 11,1988, Claimant was issued a Notice of Compensation Payable for his work-related back injury, and pursuant thereto received worker\u2019s compensation benefits.\nOn April 14, 1988, Employer filed a petition to terminate and/or suspend benefits. Following hearings, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Judge (\u201cWCJ\u201d) denied Employer\u2019s termination petition, and granted Employer\u2019s petition to suspend Claimant\u2019s benefits as of March 31,1988, finding that Employer had demonstrated that Claimant was capable of returning to modified work, and that Claimant had voluntarily resigned. Claimant appealed to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (\u201cWCAB\u201d), which remanded the case for further factual findings regarding the voluntariness of Claimant\u2019s resignation. On remand, the WCJ concluded that Claimant\u2019s resignation was involuntary, and reinstated Claimant\u2019s total disability benefits as of March 31, 1988. The WCJ reasoned that since Employer had not demonstrated that Claimant was terminated for \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d or \u201cintentional wrongdoing,\u201d the Employer had failed to meet its burden for suspension of benefits under the Act. The WCAB affirmed.\nA divided Commonwealth Court panel affirmed. See Hertz Penske Truck Leasing Company v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 168 Pa.Cmwlth. 657, 651 A.2d 1145 (1995). Citing section 772 of the Act, the Commonwealth Court stated that the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether there was an element of fault on Claimant\u2019s part which removed him from the workforce.\u201d Hertz, 168 Pa.Cmwlth. at 664, 651 A.2d at 1148. To satisfy its burden for suspension under section 772, the Commonwealth Court found that Employer was required to prove either that Claimant\u2019s termination was voluntary or that he was dismissed by Employer for good cause or for willful misconduct. See id.\nAs noted, however, by the Dissent below, the Commonwealth Court misapplied the unemployment compensation law principle of \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d to the setting of worker\u2019s compensation law. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\nThis Court\u2019s scope of review in a worker\u2019s compensation case is limited to a determination of \u201cwhether there has been a constitutional violation, an error of law, or a violation of [WCAB] procedure, and whether necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Markle v. WCAB, 541 Pa. 148, 151, 661 A.2d 1355, 1357 (1995).\nSection 772 of the Act governs the suspension of worker\u2019s compensation benefits. Section 772 provides in relevant part:\nA referee designated by the department may, at any time, modify, reinstate, suspend, or terminate a notice of compensation payable ... upon petition filed by either party with the department, upon proof that the disability of the injured employe has increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased, or that the status of the dependant has changed.... And provided further that where compensation has been suspended because the employe\u2019s earnings are equal to or in excess of his wages prior to the injury that payments under the agreement or award may be resumed at any time during the period for which compensation for partial disability is payable, unless it is shown that the loss in earnings does not result from the disability due to the injury.\n77 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 772 (emphasis added). The plain language of this section makes clear that to suspend benefits the singular focus of the inquiry is upon the claimant\u2019s work injury. By requiring a showing of willful misconduct for a suspension of benefits under section 772, the Commonwealth Court misconstrued the plain language of that section. Indeed, the term \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d appears nowhere in section 772.\nMoreover, the plain language of section 772 is consistent with the legislative aim of the Act. It is well-settled that the legislative intent behind the Act is simply to provide compensation to employees who suffer work-related injuries. See, e.g., Markle v. WCAB, 541 Pa. 148, 151, 661 A.2d 1355, 1357 (1995); Kachinski v. WCAB, 516 Pa. 240, 246-47, 532 A.2d 374, 377 (1987). It is equally well-settled that the Act was not intended as a remedy where a claimant\u2019s \u201closs [in earnings] is due to factors other than such injury.\u201d Harle v. WCAB, 540 Pa. 482, 488, 658 A.2d 766, 769 (1995). Unlike the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Act, the Act here contains no language whatsoever indicating that a showing of fault on the part of a claimant must be made in order to suspend that claimant\u2019s benefits.\nSince the purpose of the Act is purely to compensate a claimant for his work-related injury, the dispositive element in the suspension analysis under section 772 is the status of the injury. Issues of misconduct or fault, if any, on the part of a claimant do not impact upon this determination. Accordingly, we believe that the Commonwealth Court erred by extending the fault-based concept of \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d or \u201cgood cause\u201d from the unemployment compensation arena into the realm of worker\u2019s compensation law.\nThis Court has consistently adopted the aforementioned view of the plain language of section 772 and the legislative purpose behind that section. In Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments Division, 526 Pa. 25, 584 A.2d 301 (1990), this Court interpreted section 772 of the Act to mean that a \u201csuspension of [worker\u2019s compensation] benefits is supported by a finding that the earning power of the claimant is no longer affected by his disability____\u201d Pieper, 526 Pa. at 31, 584 A.2d at 303. Subsequently, in Inglis House v. WCAB, 535 Pa. 135, 634 A.2d 592 (1993), this Court held that under section 772, an employer can suspend worker\u2019s compensation benefits when an employee quits voluntarily because the \u201cemployee\u2019s loss of earnings was not caused by her injury, but by her voluntary decision to abandon the employment.\u201d Inglis House, 535 Pa. at 140, 634 A.2d at 595. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s \u201cw\u00f1lful misconduct\u201d analysis directly conflicts with this Court\u2019s recent decisions in Pieper and Inglis House, which both made clear that the relevant inquiry is whether the claimant\u2019s loss in earnings was the result of that Claimant\u2019s work injury.\nUnfortunately, the existing record does not contain any specific findings as to why Claimant in this case suffered a loss in earnings \u2014 for injury-related reasons or for work performance problems which are unrelated to his work injury. Thus, in order to give both parties a fair opportunity to resolve this matter under the correct legal standard, this case must be remanded to the WCJ for further factual findings and conclusions of law.\nFor the above reasons, the Order of the Commonwealth Court is REVERSED, and the case is remanded to the WCJ for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which CASTILLE, J., joins.\n. Writing for the Dissent below, Justice Newman correctly pointed out that \"because the action before this court is a workers compensation proceeding, and not an unemployment compensation matter,\" the Commonwealth Court Majority misapplied the correct legal standard. See Hertz, 168 Pa.Cmwlth. at 667, 651 A.2d at 1150.\n. See 43 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 802(e). Quite recently, in Rossi v. Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, 544 Pa. 261, 676 A.2d 194 (1996), this Court discussed the concept of \"willful misconduct\u201d under the Unemployment Compensation Act.\n. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s \"willful misconduct\u201d analysis also directly conflicts with the line of cases from our lower courts establishing that a suspension of worker\u2019s compensation benefits is proper where a claimant is fired for reasons which are unrelated to his work injury. See e.g., Christopher v. WCAB, 124 Pa.Cmwlth. 562, 566, 556 A.2d 544, 546 (1989) (holding that a suspension-of benefits under section 772 was permissible upon showing that claimant\u2019s employment was terminated for reasons unrelated to his work injury); Woodard v. WCAB, 49 Pa.Cmwlth. 558, 560, 411 A.2d 890, 891 (1980) (same); WCAB v. John W. Galbreath & Co., 20 Pa.Cmwlth. 283, 285, 341 A.2d 541, 542 (1975) (same).",

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\nconcurring and dissenting.\nI join the majority opinion insofar as it holds that the Commonwealth Court erred in applying the concept of willful misconduct of a terminated employee to a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the existing record does not contain any specific findings as to why the Claimant suffered a loss of earnings. I find that the record in this case is sufficient to establish that the Claimant was terminated from his employment because he was unable to meet the standard of performance expected by his supervisors.\nThe referee made the following specific findings of fact regarding the Claimant\u2019s unsatisfactory work performance in his decision dated July 7,1992.\n2. The Claimant had been employed by defendant employer\u2019s predecessor in business, Leaseway, as service manager. Hertz-Penske took over in November of 1986, and despite substantial re-training and direct instruction from his superiors the Claimant did not adjust to HertzPenske\u2019s operating procedures adequately so as to meet their expectations of him. After a number of warnings did not bring the desired results, it was decided that the Claimant would have to be replaced.\n3. The Claimant did not voluntarily resign his employment with the defendant employer on February 3, 1988. Rather, he was confronted by his superiors that day and given the option of either resigning or being fired on the spot for poor job performance; and at that time he signed a letter of resignation.\n4. At the time he signed the letter of resignation on February 3, 1988, the Claimant had been told that if he resigned (rather than being fired) he would continue to receive full salary payments for at least a one (1) month period, would receive his accrued vacation time, would continue to be covered for hospitalization, and would be able to collect unemployment compensation. Claimant mistakenly, although in good faith, also believed that he would forfeit his retirement benefits if he was fired rather than resigning.\nBased upon the referee\u2019s findings, I would conclude that the Claimant\u2019s loss of earning power was not attributable to his physical injury but to his poor performance on the job. I would hold that the Claimant\u2019s benefits should have been suspended as of March 31, 1988. Accordingly, I find it unnecessary to remand this matter to the workers\u2019 compensation judge for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law.",
