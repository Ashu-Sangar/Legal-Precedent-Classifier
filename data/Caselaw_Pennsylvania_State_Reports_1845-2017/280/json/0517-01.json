(in the petition to open) that it had in fact executed such document, states that \u201cthe paper attached to plaintiff\u2019s statement contains the alleged power of attorney to confess judgment, but is not signed by defendant\u201d; and, on this evasive averment, it asks that the judgment and all \u201cproceedings subsequent thereto\u201d be stricken from the record. Defendant\u2019s petition calls attention also to the following rule of the court below: \u201cEvery confession of judgment, on a warrant of attorney, shall be accompanied by the original note or bond, which shall be filed in the case.\u201d\nIn its opinion supporting the order assigned as error, the court below correctly says: \u201cSince there has been an admission of record that the agreement was signed by the defendant, [it] is estopped from denying the power of attorney......[Though by] attaching a copy [instead of the original] of the instrument containing the power of attorney [in which copy the name of defendant, at the foot thereof, was left off], a technical failure to comply with the rule of court [appears], it is such a defect as [under the circumstances of this case] might be waived by the court.\u201d Then this passage, of at least explanatory significance, occurs: \u201cAll the parties treated the original agreement as if it contained a properly signed power of attorney to confess a judgment and there is nothing, either in the testimony or upon the record, to show that the original agreement was not signed by all the parties.\u201d\nThe answer to the rule before us on this appeal avers that \u201cat the time of taking depositions, defendant offered an original of said agreement, which was signed by plaintiff and also by defendant, said offer being......admitted by the commissioner before whom the testimony was being taken\u201d; further, \u201cthat......counsel for plaintiff demanded of defendant......that said original be produced, so the same might be filed of record, but counsel for defendant failed and refused to produce said original.\u201d We find no denial of these statements in the record.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed.",

United Real Estate & Coal Co., Appellant.\nJudgment \u2014 Striking off judgment \u2014 Confessed judgment \u2014 Estoppel of record \u2014 Res judicata \u2014 Signature to contract.\n1. A judgment entered by confession under a warrant of attorney contained in a contract will not be stricken off on the ground that the contract had not been signed by defendant,- where it appears on a previous rule to open the judgment, which had been discharged, that all of the parties had treated the original contract as if it contained a properly signed power of attorney to confess a judgment, and defendant had attached to its petition to open what it averred to be a correct copy of the original contract showing its execution thereof.\n2. All the more is the court justified in refusing to strike off the judgment, where it appears that it had been entered on a copy of the contract not having thereon the signature of defendant, but that, in answer to the rule to strike off plaintiff averred (without denial) that, on the taking of depositions in support of the rule to open, defendant had offered the original of said contract, executed by defendant, and subsequently had refused, although requested, to produce said original contract so that it might be filed of record.\nArgued April 29, 1924.\nAppeal, No. 3, Oct.
