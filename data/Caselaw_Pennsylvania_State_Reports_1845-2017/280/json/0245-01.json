We have read the stenographer\u2019s notes and agree with the learned court below that \u201cthe testimony warranted the referee and compensation board in concluding that McDonnell\u2019s death was due to the fall and injury to his head suffered while in the course of his employment by defendant,\u201d at least, there is evidence on the record to warrant inferences to that effect, and this is sufficient: Thomas v. State Workmen\u2019s Ins. Fund, 280 Pa. 331.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
