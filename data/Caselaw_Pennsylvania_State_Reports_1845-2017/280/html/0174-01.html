If the sufficiency <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>of these averments was the only question involved, we would hold the present appeal to be governed by the usual rule, announced as early as Griffith v. Sitgreaves, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20378" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="81* Pa. 378">81* Pa. 378</a>, to the effect that writs under the Act of April 18, 1874, P.

Diehl, <a href="/pa/253/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="253 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1024066" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0353-01">253 Pa. 353</a>), and, unless the action of the court in refusing judgment is manifestly wrong, in the sense of being contrary to precedent or established rules of law, the order appealed from will not be' disturbed (Haibach C.

Hornung, <a href="/pa/270/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="270 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1066078" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0350-01">270 Pa. 350</a>); but it appears the defense was sworn to by an individual without showing his connection with defendant company, what his agency or authority was, or why an officer of the corporation did not act in the premises, —which, under our decisions, renders the affidavit invalid : Mintz v. Tri-County Nat. Gas. Co., <a href="/pa/259/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="259 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1038288" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0477-01">259 Pa. 477</a>, 483-4, and authorities there cited.</p>

While we refuse this application, as not being in accord with correct practice, the order about to be entered will not preclude the filing in the court below of the affidavit tendered to this court; but, before that is permitted, defendant should be ordered to pay costs to date.</p>
