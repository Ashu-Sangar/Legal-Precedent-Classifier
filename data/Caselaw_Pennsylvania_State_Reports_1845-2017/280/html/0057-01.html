Macfarlane stating that these papers and <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>stenographer’s notes have never been made, and are not, properly, part of the record in the case.</p>

A civil suit for false return is of little avail to a prisoner in jail, and when, as here, the record involves sentence of death for a capital offense, it would be practically of no avail to leave the prisoner to his civil remedy; therefore the authorities cited in the brief submitted by the Commonwealth do not control.</p>
