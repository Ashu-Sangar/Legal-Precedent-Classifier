As the supply from the former was inadequate, the water company, in 1895, purchased land along Pine Bun, erected a reservoir known as No. 3 dam, devoting its waters to public use. All the franchises, structures, reservoirs, property and water rights owned by this and the company supplying Weissport, were leased to the Lehighton Water Supply Company, this appellant.

All are brought within the purview of the “taking” and may become matters to be determined by the courts or the Public Service Commission. Waste, destruction or pollution of the water is not permitted to the detriment of the public good. A valid appropriation is, at best, but a qualified ownership. The first appropriator, to supply the maximum demand in all seasons, must erect suitable facilities to secure the necessary daily demand when the flow is at its minimum. The storage reservoirs erected for this purpose must not only not unnecessarily waste, but must be of a capacity sufficient to satisfy this demand during the dry seasons of the year, with the entire minimum flow of the watershed counted. These are burdens appurtenant to the property right acquired by the first appropriator, in its grant from the commonwealth of the right “to appropriate.” These duties and obligations cannot be passed to junior appropriators who may take the surplus water: Boalsburg Water Co. v.

On the other hand, where the appropriations are on the same stream, or legally cover the same watershed, and the first appropriator has taken reasonable precautions to conserve the supply for daily demand during droughts, and is serving the public, the first taker is entitled to the entire flow of the shed; “he has the best right who is first in time.” The junior taker at these times must let down the minimum flow of the stream during such period, by passing it around his <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>reservoir or permitting a quantity equal to the then minimum flow of the stream to escape from the reservoir.

While a verdict in trespass establishes to some degree a right and the tortiousness of the acts complained of (Davis v. Southwest Pennsylvania Pipe Lines, <a href="/pa/223/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="223 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="960984" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0056-01">223 Pa. 56</a>, 58; Holmes v. Wilson, 10 A. &amp; E. 503, 113 Reprint 190), it is not conclusive as to title, and the Steel Company was not a party to the action.</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[299,1290,1145,423]]]'>In addition, appellee formally condemned these waters in 1913. This act was not a waiver of its claim to title by prescription then ripening for many years, as against the reservation in the Palmer-Carbon contract; other rights were thus acquired which could not be secured by prescription or which were not covered by it. The Parry ville dam and appellant’s dam were some miles apart.</p>
    <p id="b530-6" data-blocks='[["BL_530.6",530,[299,1723,1145,371]]]'>If, then, the purchase of land, erection of a reservoir and diversion of water for the performance of duties and obligations in supplying water to the public, is not conclusive evidence of corporate action against a competing water company, yet as a riparian owner it would be entitled to hold the prescriptive right to use the water in a given way, to the same extent as a private individual.</p>
    <p id="b530-7" data-blocks='[["BL_530.7",530,[298,2103,1146,263]],["BL_531.1",531,[181,321,1152,1135]]]'>We now hold that the erection of a reservoir and diversion of the water for the performance of duties and obligations in supplying water to the public generally, as between competing companies for the same watershed, gives rise to conclusive presumption of corporate action, <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>fixing vested rights to the waters in the stream in the first occupier to the extent of such taking for immediate and reasonable future needs. While we give effect to the rule in the Boalsburg Case (rightfully doubted by the present Chief Justice in the Gring Case and by former President Judge Rice of the Superior Court in the Katharine Water Company Case), and will apply the rule so often announced by this court respecting the rights of lower riparian owners (as in the Lord Case), and the competing claims to water as between companies or individuals where the use of the water was an incident to its business (as in the Miller Case), and notwithstanding the dicta in the Philipsburg Case and the Boalsburg Case, the latter of which recognizes that the minute book is not the sole depository of the evidence necessary to prove corporate action, still the conclusive presumption necessary to establish corporate action between companies claiming the same waters lies in the uncontradicted evidence of actual use for corporate purposes before the second company comes on the ground. This conclusion fixes Lehighton’s right beyond question.</p>
    <p id="b531-3" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[184,1473,1149,478]]]'>Had there been merit to sustain appellee’s position throughout, the limit of the power of the court below was to direct appellant to let down the minimum flow of the stream during dry seasons, but, during the seasons when there was a surplus of water, appellant would have had authority to take the water necessary for its corporate purposes. However, as we have pointed out, appellee, on the record as presented to us, was not entitled to an injunction.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[186,1968,1148,102]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed and the bill in equity is dismissed, at the cost of appellee.</p>
