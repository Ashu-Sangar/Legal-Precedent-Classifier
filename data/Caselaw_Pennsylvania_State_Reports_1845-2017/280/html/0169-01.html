This train, on the regular southbound track, was held up at Auburn owing to operating conditions. In so doing it got on the time of passenger train No. 30, going south, scheduled to arrive at Auburn at 6: 01. Dewald, employed as a flagman on the coal train, in the performance of his duty went back to protect the rear of his train against southbound movements; under the uncontradicted evidence it was his duty to flag and stop all southbound trains on either the south or north track. To enable train No. 30 to make its regular schedule, defendant did as is customary on all railroads, — ran the passenger train from the south track to and on the northbound track, around the coal train. While proceeding on the latter track the flagman was struck by the passenger train and killed.

If the passenger train was on the northbound track, running against the current of its normal traffic, —and it was deceased’s duty to “flag” that track, — as the train approached, he should have seen it in time to avoid collision; the danger incident to such acts was assumed. Plaintiff’s counsel admits he could see 250 feet ahead; as an “experienced railroader” he should, on the approach of the train, have known the track it was on, stepped promptly a few feet to the side, and avoided injury. This could have been done by stepping either towards the southbound track or to the right-of-way along the northbound track.</p>

No one knows just what he was doing then. Murdock saw some slight movement of the hand, stating “he did not swing any signals.” He said he saw him move his hands a little (indicating it), and “in quite a short time the train came around the curve, I just saw a flash of light, and then it was over.”</p>

He is not required to stand in the middle of the track as the engine bears down on him, taking the chance of its stopping. His duty requires him to step to the side so as to inform the engineman of what is ahead; and, as a general rule, the flagged train approaches the flag slowly to permit the flagman to get on. The size of the train, the speed, and the condition of the rails often prevent stopping.</p>

His place was on the southbound track to protect the rear of his train; therefore the appearance of a train in either direction on the northbound track would cause him no injury.</p>

As the court below says, “It would be unreasonable, and, indeed, a thing unheard of, to require a railroad company, when it sends out a watchman to flag a train or to warn approaching trains, to send a second man to watch the first one and to warn him of the approach of trains. However, if this could be expected and required, the second watchman would be in just as great need of a third watchman as was the first of the second, and so on ad infinitum.”</p>

This would have exposed the rear of the train he was guarding to other traffic, thus placing travelers and employees in greatest danger. The only reason appearing to us to adopt this view seems to be because this unfortunate man failed to observe the most ordinary rules of self protection. Exposing the rear of trains without guard is one of the most serious menaces to public <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>travel; it should not be permitted under any circumstances, and certainly no decree of an appellate court should require such thing to be done.</p>
