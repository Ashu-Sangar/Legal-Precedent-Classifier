It is at least gravely doubtful whether any other conclusion would be constitutional (see article I, section 1, Constitution of Pennsylvania; Wolford v.

The only child of the first taker having died meanwhile, the trustee, with the written approval of the first taker, who was then 66 years old, and of her brother, petitioned the court for leave to sell the real estate. Objection was made by the heirs at law of the residuary devisee, who were also half-brother and half-sister of the first taker. It was held they had no standing to prevent the sale of this particular piece of property, since the interest of the remainderman was vested, and no circumstances existed by virtue of which the objectors could get it. In Stafford’s Est., <a href="/pa/258/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="258 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="1035063" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0595-01">258 Pa. 595</a>, testatrix’s gift was upon an active trust for her two brothers for life, remainder, as to either or both shares, to their sister, if surviving, and upon the death of the survivor of the three, to a specified charity. One of the brothers died, and the other and the sister transferred their interests to the charity. It was held that, as the only purpose of testator was to protect the corpus for the benefit of the charity, the trust would be declared ended. In Wood’s Est., <a href="/pa/261/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="261 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1042204" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0480-01">261 Pa. 480</a>, a trust for persons sui juris was declared to be terminated because, by the will, there was no limitation over, and “no ultimate purpose of any kind requiring the continuance of the trust, expressed in the will or [to be] implied from its terms, except the mere payment of the income to the cestui que trust.” In Behringer’s Est., <a href="/pa/265/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="265 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="1051889" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0111-01">265 Pa. 111</a>, a like conclusion was reached, because the trust was a passive one, and there was no limitation over, or other estates or interests to be protected.</p>

In the will con<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>strued in that case, testator gave his residuary estate, upon an active trust, the income to be paid quarterly to such of his grandchildren as might be living when the payments were to be made, and the lineal descendants of any who might have died theretofore; and this course was to be regularly pursued until such time as the trustees, in the exercise of their discretion, should have sold the property; after which the principal was directed to be forthwith distributed to his then living grandchildren, and the then lineal descendants of any who had died. The court below found, — and this court approved the finding, — that the trustees had unreasonably refused to exercise their discretion, and hence directed a conveyance of the properties to the grandchildren, who would have received the proceeds if the trustees had acted reasonably, and sold the properties. The fact of unreasonableness being found, the decision was, of course, right; for, under such circumstances, the question at issue was to be determined in exactly the way it would have been had the trustees been obedient to the mandate of the will, and then converted the properties into cash. It was in the light of this finding of unreasonable delay in making the sales, that we made use of the expression, (page 546), upon which appellees build practically their entire contention, namely, “The opinion of the majority in the court below, is based upon the view that, under the provisions of the will, the interests of the grandchildren were vested at the death of testator, subject only to be divested in the event of their death before the time of distribution. If this view is correct, the decree was proper.” The record shows that all the grandchildren were living at the time of distribution; hence there were no outstanding interests in the lineal descendants of any of them and the reference, in the above quotation, to grandchildren only, was strictly correct. Inasmuch as the will expressly provided that the grandchildren, if living when the time for selling arrived, should get their shares of the property absolutely, the result would have been ex<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>actly the same if their prior interests had been merely contingent upon their living to that date, if indeed contingency can be predicated on such a state of facts. The court’s discussion of the prior decisions dealing with vested and contingent interests was, therefore, wholly unnecessary, but may be excused, perhaps, because the question was elaborately argued, from those same cases, by counsel for appellant in that proceeding. It would have been sufficient for ns to have stated simply, as the opinion finally does, that, as the time had arrived when, under the express language of the will, the grandchildren together had the entire, absolute interest in the proceeds of the property, which should then have been sold, and as they were sui juris, and all of them asked the court to direct that it should be conveyed to them jointly, the decree was necessarily right; but, in any event, it was, under those facts, in exact accord with our foregoing interpretation of the rule relied on by appellees.</p>

In Stewart’s Est., <a href="/pa/253/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="253 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1024038" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0277-01">253 Pa. 277</a>, the syllabus correctly says: “The right of all the parties in interest under a will, to set aside or disregard the will, does not extend to the case of an active trust for a definite term, created by a testator for the protection of his beneficiaries, and this is particularly true where there are contingent remainders limited to the issue of legatees who may die during the pendency of a life estate.” And in King v. York Trust Co., <a href="/pa/278/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="278 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1080566" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0141-01">278 Pa. 141</a>, where a settlor, — who believed he was incompetent to properly handle his property, — conveyed it to a trustee, who was “to use the income for the support of the settlor and his wife and children, and to pay the principal to the wife and children after the death of the settlor, or to collaterals if they do not survive”: it was held that the trust would not be determined upon the application of the settlor, — who, the chancellor found, had <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>become competent to care for the property, — although his request was joined in by his wife and children, and by the collateral, who would then have taken the principal, if the settlor and his wife and children had been dead.</p>
