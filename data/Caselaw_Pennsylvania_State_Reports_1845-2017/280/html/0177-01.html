The Forwarding Company assigned the lease with all its interest in the truck, together with the note, to plaintiff, appellant here. Possession of the truck remained in the bailee; thereafter’ he made default in payments, and the Forwarding Company, which had warranted the bailee’s fulfillment of the contract, reclaimed possession of the truck, taking it to its place of business in Scranton. Thereafter, on July 20th of the same year, it was sold to defendant, C. C. Waters, appellee here. The full purchase price for this sale was duly paid, and the truck delivered. The Forwarding Company evidently did not <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>send the money to the assignee, the appellant; on the former’s insolvency, appellant brought this action of replevin. The case was referred to a referee, who decided in appellant’s favor. On appeal, the court below reversed the action of the referee and found the truck was the property of the appellee.</p>
    <p id="b203-3" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[181,630,1152,1189]]]'>It is not disputed he was an innocent purchaser for value, and the court below found from the evidence that the Forwarding Company, in this and many other transactions, acted as agent of appellant, with authority to act. In this finding we fully concur. Appellant was nothing more than a finance company lending its money to the Forwarding Company, taking as collateral security bailment leases and notes such as here indicated. The court below found this relation of agency from the course of dealing between the parties. When motors were bailed, the contracts were assigned to appellant, who furnished the money to keep up payments with the manufacturer. Thereafter the Forwarding Company became the agent of appellant to make collections, turn over the money and generally keep appellant clear of loss. If payments on a particular contract were lacking, through neglect, threats of replevin were made and occasionally the agent who guaranteed the contracts furnished the payment. The Forwarding Company stood in such close business relations with appellant that, if it was not one of agency, it was at least a joint undertaking, — so much so that its acts fully bound appellant.</p>

Appellant, with knowledge, or facts from which knowledge may be inferred, permitted this condition to continue for many months. These facts, explainable on no other theory than agency, combined with the authority just discussed, created a condition that had a tendency to deceive intending purchasers, if agency did not exist.

    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[293,849,1152,1018]]]'>Appellant complains, inasmuch as the referee made no finding covering some features passed on by the court below, that the court was powerless to proceed under the Act of April 6, 1869, P. L. 725, as amended. “Since a referee’s findings of fact are as conclusive as a jury’s verdict, it follows that, unless a trial judge would have been bound to direct a compulsory nonsuit, had the case been tried before a jury, or direct a finding for the defendant, it was error to set aside the referee’s report. ......It is not for us to inquire which of these conflicting views is better supported by the facts.......Under the evidence, it became a mixed question which called for consideration of all the facts......Had the case been tried before the jury, a submission of the question could not have been avoided. The jury’s determination would have been final, and we must allow like effect to follow that of the referee, who, by agreement of the parties, was substituted for the jury.” Ansley v.

Ordinarily, before a jury, we do not know what weight, if any, is given to particular subjects in evidence. In a referee’s finding we may learn if he has omitted consideration of certain elements of a decisive nature. If he has, whether tiie evidence is disputed or not, the court on review may consider such elements and the evidence in relation thereto, and from them make its own findings. Leonard v.

Also, where the facts found <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>are mere deductions from undisputed testimony, they are given no greater weight than findings of law: Holland v.
