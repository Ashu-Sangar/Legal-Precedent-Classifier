Kemble estate, of which appellant is trustee, owns four hundred, and thirty-five acres of land in Hegins Township, Schuylkill County, of which the part here in question, amounting to one hundred and seventy-five acres, is taxed as coal land. In making the triennial assessment in 1922 the assessor, for purpose of <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>taxation, valued this coal land at $285 per acre, amounting to $49,875. This was increased by the county commissioners, acting as a board of revision and appeal, to $494 an acre, amounting to $86,450. The trustee of the Kemble estate appealed therefrom to the court of common pleas. For purpose of uniformity the board of revision based its assessment on sixty per cent of value; this, by agreement of counsel, the court further reduced to forty-five per cent; making the total valuation for taxation $64,837.50; from its final decree refusing to make other reduction, the Kemble estate has appealed.</p>

Schulykill County, <a href="/pa/276/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="276 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1077545" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0246-01">276 Pa. 246</a>), who, after investigation, submitted estimates of the quantity and value in place of the coal in the one hundred and seventy-five acre tract, placing such value at $824 an acre; in fact one of the experts made a higher valuation. The board accepted the $824 an acre as the basis of its valuation, reducing the same to sixty per cent thereof as above stated. When the case was heard in court the testimony of these experts accorded with their previous statements and was confined to the estimated actual value of the coal in place, no evidence being submitted on behalf of the county as to the market value of the coal land or even of the coal in place, or that the latter had such value. For appellant, three mining engineers and experts in coal lands and their value were called and after qualifying testified as to the market value of the coal land in question; one said $200 an acre, another $175 and the third $150. There is nothing in the record to contradict or discredit this testimony. It was given by well known citizens of the county, who, on cross-examination, fortified their opinions by reference to numerous public and private sales of coal lands which had taken place in the vicinity, thereby showing a market value for such property. It has been statutory require-<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>meat in this Commonwealth for very many years, sustained by an unbroken line of decisions, that land must be assessed for what it would bring at a fair public sale after due notice. “The law requires that the valuation of real estate for the purpose of taxation shall be determined upon the basis of market value, or rather actual value, limited and defined by market value. What the law requires cannot be disregarded no matter how desirable some method not authorized might prove to be. ......Scientific formulas, arithmetical deductions and mental contemplations, have small value in making assessments under our practical system of taxation. The market value of the separate tracts at public sale, after due notice, is the legal basis recognized by our statutes of determining the assessable value of real estate, and until the legislature changes this method, it is binding not only upon the taxing authorities but upon the courts as well”: D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co. v. Luz. Co. Com’rs, <a href="/pa/245/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="245 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="326144" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0515-01">245 Pa. 515</a>, <em>518; </em>Lehigh &amp; Wilkes-Barre Coal Co’s.

This is clearly shown by the Acts of 1841 and 1842, which require the valuation to be fixed upon the basis of selling price at a bona fide sale after due notice”: Washington County v.

To save valuable property, which has no known market value, from escaping taxation, some other method may be permitted.

Luzerne County, <a href="/pa/255/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="255 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1027687" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0017-01">255 Pa. 17</a>, a method, however, not available here in any event because of the varying thickness of the <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>veins of coal.' But wherever the property has a market value, that value is the test, and the best evidence thereof is the opinions of credible witnesses familiar with such value, as in the analogous case of property taken under the right of eminent domain, in which the owner’s damages are estimated by the market value of the land taken as a whole, not by the actual or estimated value of its component parts. In Searle v. Lackawanna, etc., R. R., <a href="/pa/33/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="33 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="988396" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0057-01">33 Pa. 57</a>, Lowrie, C. J., (referring to the rejection of an offer to prove that there was $4,000 worth of coal under the land, about one acre), said: “We do not measure the value of land by such facts. Land may have $4,000 worth of coal per acre in it, and yet sell at $40.00 per acre......Moreover, the offer impliedly requires a degree of refinement in the measure of values, which seems to us totally incompatible with the gross estimates of common life. Though we might have the most accurate calculation of the quantity of coal in the land, yet, without knowing exactly the expense of bringing it to the surface and carrying it to market, and the amount likely to be lost in mining and conveying, and the times in which it would be brought out, and the market prices at those times, the quantity would not help us to the value of the land. The gross estimates of common life are all that courts and juries have skill enough to use as a measure of value. All other measures are necessarily arbitrary and fanciful.” The same rule is restated in Becker v. Phila. &amp; Reading R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/177/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="177 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="883642" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0252-01">177 Pa. 252</a>, 260; R. &amp; P. Co. v.

The uncertainty of valuing land by its supposed mineral contents is shown in the instant case where appellant’s witnesses estimate the quantity of recoverable coal at practically one-half of that estimated by appellee’s witnesses. The land in the instant case contains virgin coal with no open mine and should be assessed at its present market value as shown by the <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>evidence: Coal &amp; Iron Co. v.

In tax assessments, as elsewhere, the best evidence available must govern. On the record here presented, the best, and, in fact, only evidence of market value is that of appellant’s witnesses, and, under these circumstances, the evidence being worthy of credit, it should have been accepted.
