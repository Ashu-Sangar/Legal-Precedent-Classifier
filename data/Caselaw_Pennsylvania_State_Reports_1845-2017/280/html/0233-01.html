Gunton mined coal from a tract of land in Sullivan County. In conducting his operations, a culm bank of considerable extent was created, one-fourth of which rested on the land demised and three-fourths on adjoining unseated land, title to which was in a third person. The culm represented the coal mined, which passed through a screen with a mesh of one-eighth of an inch; for that which passed over such screen Gunton paid a royalty to the lessors, while for that passing through it, under the terms of the lease, he paid nothing, unless he sold it, in which event he was to pay one-tenth of the price received. He ceased operating the mine during the ten-year period and quit the property, leaving the culm in the pile as he had deposited it on the ground. The lessors resumed possession and subsequently conveyed the tract to plaintiffs without mentioning the culm. Twelve years after he gave up his lease, one of Gunton’s creditors levied on the culm pile under a testatum fi. fa. Plaintiffs thereupon claimed ownership of it, and a sheriff’s interpleader issue was framed by the court, in which the execution creditor was made defendant.</p>

We disposed of this proposition in Robinson v.

Even had a limitation of the term appeared, it would not have been- effective to change the character of the transaction, though to be considered in determining the intent of the parties.” The same principle was recognized in Timlin v.

In affirming the judgment in the former’s favor, we said: “The main question in the case was whether the property in controversy had been abandoned by the plaintiff. This was to be determined from a consideration of the nature of the property and the conduct of the plaintiff in relation to it, and the question was essentially one of fact for the jury.” Here it was one of fact for the court sitting without a jury and “When a case is tried before the court without a jury, the facts found by the court upon sufficient evidence must be accepted as true by an appellate court”: Gilles<a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>pie v.
