Appellant does not contend that the return judges, in their judicial or quasi judicial capacity, exceeded the jurisdiction con<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>ferred on <em>them, or </em>abused their legal discretion, in making the present computation; as before said, the sole complaint is that, at the time of the recount, certain memoranda were made and signed by the election officers, and that these should be included in the record so that we might consider them on review.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[158,638,1150,921]]]'>Upon the filing of the petitions alleging diminution of record, and after rules granted upon them, the common pleas judges filed returns that they had “no record on the subject other than, or additional to, the record as already certified.” If a computation proceeding were of a strictly judicial nature, the answer of the court below would be conclusive upon us, and complainant would be left to his action for a false return: Flagg v. Searle, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Leg.%20Int.%20101" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="31 Leg. Int. 101">31 Leg. Int. 101</a>; Com. v. Daily (No. 1), <a href="/pa/280/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="280 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1084504" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0057-01">280 Pa. 57</a>. The proceeding, being nonjudicial, it may be that the answer of the computation board is less conclusive, but we are of opinion that in no case can a certiorari sur diminution of record issue where, as here, it relates to memoranda which the statute regulating the proceedings does not mention, and which is prepared, not as a duty, but in the exercise of an administrative discretion, — in short, which forms no necessary part of the record.</p>

Appellate Practice, p. 497), which is the customary way in such cases, there were granted, in the present instance, rules on the court below to show cause why writs in peremptory form should not issue. This procedure is equivalent to the former practice, but is not intended to supersede it. We may add that, although the appeals before us question orders of the court of common pleas and the answers to the rules above mentioned were made by the judges of that court, these rules and the appeal writs were directed to the quarter sessions, because the records involved were in the latter’s custody, having been certified to it by the common pleas for use in an election contest. No question respecting possible practical com<a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>plications thus suggested has been raised on these appeals, however, and our views on the substantial points for decision render the consideration of such questions unnecessary.</p>
