    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[185,390,1151,588]]]'>Appellant sued a trustee in bankruptcy to recover the value of her chattels wrongfully seized and sold as the property of the bankrupt. When possession was taken by the trustee, reclamation proceedings were instituted; it was then incumbent on appellant to protect the claim throughout the litigation. The referee held the property to be that of the bankrupt; an appeal to the United States District Court followed, resulting, on January 31, 1918, in a decision adverse to appellant. It was there decreed “that the property be treated and disposed of by the trustee as the property of the bankrupt.”</p>
    <p id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.7",207,[184,988,1151,523]]]'>Later, on the 7th of February, 1918, a petition for an order of sale was presented by the trustee. The order was granted, the sale to take place February 23,1918, or about a year after the adjudication in bankruptcy, and after possession had been taken by the trustee, reclamation proceedings having been begun in April, 1917. The expense of preserving the property, consisting of cows, calves, horses, colts and farm implements was great and steadily increasing; it became necessary for the trustee to act.</p>
    <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.8",207,[182,1531,1152,424]]]'>After the order to sell had been lifted, but before the day of sale, claimant appealed from the decree of the district court in the reclamation proceeding to the United States Circuit Court Of Appeals. The trustee was not notified of this appeal until after the sale. No bond was filed, no supersedeas asked for or allowed, and no request made to suspend the order of sale by appellant ; it was not disturbed.</p>

The decree below will therefore be reversed and the cause remitted for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.” See Drabant v. Cure, <a href="/f/251/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="251 F. 47" data-case-ids="3982666" data-case-paths="/f/251/0047-01">251 Fed. 47</a>, 49.</p>

From the order, we must accept as part of the record in that court the fact of execution and sale; by it appellant is bound. So that we have, without objection from anyone, in a proceeding originally instituted to try title to certain personal property, which, in the course of the litigation, was sold, the parties and the court thereafter treating the contest as one over the distribution of the proceeds of that sale, title of course determining that question. This appellant, in that view of the case, was awarded, received and accepted the proceeds of sale, in addition to some costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. Just here it may be stated her attorney bought all the property in for her at trustee’s sale.</p>

She was a stranger to the proceeding, and the trustee had no legal right to include her chattels in those of the bankrupt. Appellant had many courses to pursue. She chose to institute reclamation proceedings, and thereby submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the federal court, as it related to the bankruptcy of John Kemara.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[192,975,1151,1078]]]'>The referee decided against her, and the District Court sustained that decision. The order of sale here granted extended to the bankrupt’s property and, so far as the trustee was concerned, it included that claimed by appellant. The matter adjudicated by the referee and the district court adversely to appellant was the title to that property. When the appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals it was incumbent on the claimant to surround it with all the protection accorded by law, otherwise she would lose the specific property involved. Had the appeal operated as a supersedeas, it would have stayed the hand of the officer as to the identical property. She chose not to perfect her appeal or secure the suspension of the referee’s order, and, having submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the federal court, it must follow that the law incident to such submission attaches. Though successful in appeal, while she would not (and did not) lose the value of the property, but, through her neglect to protect herself, did lose the specific articles claimed in the reclamation proceedings.</p>

Here not only does defendant sell under a lawful order of court, but, by judicial direction, he sells property the title to which has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be in the <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>

    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[304,476,1149,579]]]'>While the chattels were those of a stranger, unlike the ordinary execution, where such property is levied on and sold without any effort on the owner’s part to maintain title, here claimant contested the seizure and submitted her case to an appropriate proceeding as provided by federal law, and is bound thereby. The facts are more analogous to our interpleader proceeding, where the contest is over the proceeds of the sale of the property which the officer had been directed to sell, or the case of perishable goods seized and ordered sold pending the determination of the title.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[299,1075,1151,965]]]'>If the case is parallel to our fi. fa., of what avail would the Act of 1897 be if an execution may be executed only at the officer’s peril where an appeal is not a supersedeas. Section 4 (p. 68) of the act fixes a time within which an appeal acts as a supersedeas, and the statute further fixes the conditions under which it will so operate. If, on a claim of property, the appeal is not perfected within the time fixed by law, the execution subsequently issued may be proceeded on without peril to the officer. The act would be meaningless if this were not so, for, if the contrary view be correct, an appeal may be taken any time within the six months, regardless of bond given, and if a sale on execution is had at the peril of the officer on reversal of the judgment thereafter, why the necessity of the three-week provision, or anything regarding supersedeas. The effect of acts being a “supersedeas” is to cause a suspension or stay of all proceeding, without which the cause goes forward normally.</p>

Hill had been convicted of murder of the first degree, and, on July 31, 1897, was.sentenced to be hung. The governor fixed December 8th as the day of execution.

The sheriff of that county, advised by counsel there might be a question of the appeal’s acting as a supersedeas, declined to proceed with the execution. The contention then came before this court as to the exact status of the appeal, of the sheriff and the governor with relation to defendant’s execution. Commenting on the Act of 1897, we stated that it is the exclusive guide in all appeals of every kind, civil and criminal. Section 4 provides, “No appeal shall be allowed in any case unless taken within six calendar months from the entry of the sentence, order, judgment or decree appealed from, nor shall an appeal supersede an execution issued or distribution ordered, unless taken ......within three weeks from such entry.” And it was held that the execution of the sentence of death was not superseded by an appeal taken later than three weeks from the date of sentence.</p>

    <p id="b212-7" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[308,2162,1146,205]]]'>It would undoubtedly be a strange rule that would compel the district court to enforce its own judgment, at the same time punishing the court’s officer for carrying the judgment into effect.</p>
    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.3",213,[154,315,1149,314]]]'>
      <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>If appellant wished to retain the specific goods, it was her duty to cause the appeal to become a supersedeas. She knew of the sale and made no effort to avoid its effect, and, as later shown by her conduct, affirmed its legality, accepting in lieu thereof the money equivalent of the property.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[153,641,1150,641]]]'>The judgment of the district court was reversed. The appellate court made no order or restitution of specific articles as, under certain circumstances, it might have done, but directed that the proceeds of sale be turned over to this appellant. Without any protest or complaint she received this money. Under the law it may be this was all she was entitled to, but, as we have indicated, her voluntary act in accepting the money without protest or an effort to change the order of the court to conform to her proceedings or secure other relief, places her claim beyond redress. The money was accepted unconditionally.</p>
    <p id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[152,1293,1149,958]]]'>When this case was here before (<a href="/pa/274/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="274 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="1072921" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0180-01">274 Pa. 180</a>), we said (p. 185), “Whether or not the acceptance of the proceeds by her debars her from recovering the difference between the actual value of the property and the amount she received, we need not and do not now determine; necessarily the facts will be more fully developed at the trial, and possibly this will alter the entire status of the case on the point.” When plaintiff attempted to prove her claim it disclosed facts not presented to us at our first hearing. Instead of the trustee acting “wholly without color of right and contrary to law, claiming to act under and by virtue of his election and qualification as trustee in the said bankruptcy proceedings,” as averred in the statement, we find he acted under an order of court, on an adjudication of title, and that, in taking the appeal which is shown only by implication, she did so without any attempt to supersede or suspend the order.</p>
    <p id="b213-7" data-blocks='[["BL_213.6",213,[154,2273,1147,97]]]'>The judgment of the court below is affirmed at cost of appellant.</p>
