In 1892 the Harrisburg and Mechanics-burg Electric Railway was chartered as a street railway company, under the Act of May 14,1889, P. L. 211, with power to construct and operate a line of railway, beginning at Second and Market streets, Harrisburg (a city of the third class), extending thence west in Market Street to Front Street and from there north in Front Street to Walnut Street, where, turning westerly, it crossed the Susquehanna River, on the Peoples Bridge, and continued to Mechanicsburg, the line being nine miles long. In view of objection to Front Street being used for that purpose, the railway company, in April, 1893, adopted a resolution so that its line would extend from its terminus at Second and Market streets, north in Second Street to the center of Walnut Street, a distance of approximately five hundred and ten feet, thence westerly in Walnut Street to its chartered route at Front Street. The divergence was as to the manner of going half way around one block, the distance being the same. In October, 1893, the defendant city, by what we will call “the franchise ordinance,” granted the company a right to construct and operate its line of railway in and upon Second and Walnut streets (in accordance with the resolution), which was accepted by the railway company. At that time there was a double track street railway in Second Street, controlled by an operating company from whom in 1894 the Harrisburg and Mechanicsburg company leased the western track, from Market to Walnut streets, for the term of ninety-five years. The nine-mile line, a single track railway, was promptly built, the eastern end thereof coming up the center of Walnut Street and joining the leased line at Second Street. This rail<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>way, including the track leased in Second Street, was in constant use as an electric railway for nearly thirty years; but by some oversight the above-mentioned resolution was not recorded in the office of the proper recorder of deeds nor an exemplified copy thereof filed with the secretary of the Commonwealth as required by section 4 of the Act of 1889. To remedy this omission, in 1898, another resolution, of like import, was adopted by the railway company and duly recorded and filed as that section provides.</p>

This corporation has 43.64 miles of railway, operates thirty-nine cars and its daily patronage in and out of Harrisburg amounts to about five thousand passengers. Being a single track, without a turnout upon or east of the bridge, necessitates running the cars in both directions on Second Street, also on Walnut Street, and frequently as many as six or seven of these cars are on Second Street at one time. Second Street at this point faces Market Square, which is the business center of the city and a congested district, especially as the city street car line discharges and receives passengers there in large numbers. It is also thronged with automobiles, which, so far as permitted, park around the square. Under conditions as they have grown to be, the presence and movement of plaintiff’s cars, especially the northward movement on Second Street, add to the congestion and increase the danger at that point. In an apparently bona fide effort to relieve the situation, the defendant city adopted an ordinance in June, 1923, prohibiting the northward movement of any vehicles, including street cars, upon the west side of Second Street, inter alia, between Market and Walnut streets, and providing penalties for violation thereof. <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>The enforcement of this ordinance would exclude all of plaintiff’s cars from Second Street as there is no exit except by running them back north to Walnut Street on the single track; therefore, plaintiff brought its bill in equity to restrain the enforcement of the ordinance. After a hearing, the lower court held the ordinance valid and entered a decree dismissing plaintiff’s bill; from which the latter brought this appeal.</p>

When a municipal franchise ordinance is accepted and acted upon by a street railway company it becomes an irrevocable contract: Grand Trunk Western Ry. v.

We do not so read the statute. What section 4 of the Act of 1889, P. L. 211, provides, is: “Any company incorporated under this act, shall have authority to construct such extensions or branches as it may deem necessary to increase its business and accommodate the travel of the public: Provided, That the act of the company authorizing any extension or branch, shall distinctly name the streets and highways on which said extensions or branch is to be laid and constructed, and a copy of the minutes of said <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>company containing said authority shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds for the proper county, and an exemplification of the said record shall be filed in the office of the secretary of the Commonwealth, and no right to actually construct the same shall vest until after thirty days from the filing of said exemplification”; but does not say such recording and filing must precede its power to contract. There is a distinction between a contract for and the actual occupancy of a street. If the ordinance was valid when granted, a premature entry upon the street did not abrogate it. Of course the ordinance was not granted in view of the later resolution, but it is too late to expel an electric railway company from a street, for. lack of a recorded and filed resolution, twenty-five years after one has been recorded and filed, embracing the identical subject. The franchise ordinance embraced both Second and Walnut streets; if void as to the former because of the company’s lack of power to accept it, it was equally so as to the latter; yet the city concedes plaintiff’s right in Walnut Street, and for thirty years construed the ordinance as entitling plaintiff to move its cars in both directions on its Second Street track.</p>

It permitted such use to go unchallenged for thirty years, meantime collecting taxes from the company and otherwise treating it as properly occupying the streets. Meantime, also, the original company became merged with other companies, into an important system of electric railways whose greatest asset manifestly is the right to receive and discharge passengers at the business center of the City of Harrisburg.

This is not the meaning of the merger statutes. For example, the Act of May 15, 1895, P. L. 65, provides: “It shall be lawful for any traction or motor power company, or street passenger railway company, owning, leasing, controlling or operating different lines of street railways of different companies, to operate as a general system so much of said different lines as occupy streets, and from time to time to lay out such new routes or circuits over the whole or any part of such street or streets occupied by the tracks of the different companies which it thus owns, leases, controls or operates, and upon such routes or circuits to run cars for such distances, and in such directions, as will in the opinion of the operating company best accommodate public travel.” That is broad enough to confer upon the merged company the right to run all of its cars over the entire line. By the merger, the constituent companies became one company With the right to run any or all its cars upon the entire line; without such right a merger would be vain. “A railroad company formed by the consolidation of several companies, and invested by law with all their property, rights, and franchises, is entitled to enjoy the franchises of each of its several companies upon the road originally belonging to it”: 2 Morawetz on Private Corporations (2d ed.) section 947, p. 904.

If appellee’s contention as to the limited use were sound, still the ordinance of 1923 would be invalid, for it prevents appellant’s use of any cars on Second Street, as well those coming from Mechanicsburg as elsewhere.

True, in accepting the franchise ordinance the company agreed to “subject itself to all regulations of the city now in force or hereafter made,” but that must be construed reasonable regulations. What the 1923 ordinance attempts is not regulation but prohibition; for, as we have stated, its effect is to exclude appellant from Second Street, under conditions as they now are and have been for thirty years.

If this may be done by preventing the cars from moving north on the west side of Second Street, under the rule of the road, there is no reason why the city may not make Walnut Street a one-way street and thus effectually shut appellant out of the city. The rule of the road as to keeping to the right cannot be applied to single-track railways upon the side of highways in such a manner as to entirely deprive the railway company of the use of the highway, and plaintiff by its lease acquired only the use of a single <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>track in Second Street, with no turnout.

L. 1374, — whereas the question involved in the instant case is the validity of a city ordinance regulating the movement of cars of a street railway company, a question we held in City of Easton v. Miller, <a href="/pa/265/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="265 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1051894" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0025-01">supra,</a> to be within equity jurisdiction, notwithstanding the' Public Service Commission Law. And the other question, as to appellant’s status in the street, is purely one of law and constitutional right, which the courts have to determine.</p>

The necessity and extent of such regulation and the agency to control it depend on the circumstances of each case. While the court below finds “several fatal accidents have occurred and a large number of lesser injuries to persons and considerable damage to property,” our examination of the evidence shows that this finding is unwarranted. To effectually carry out the reserve police power mentioned in our Constitution in matters affecting public service companies, the Public Service Commission was created. And where, under circumstances such as those at bar, a corporation shares with another like corporation the exclusive privilege to occupy a street for railway purposes, the joint use <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>of the street should be regarded for purposes of regulation as though it were by a single company, and if such continued use proves unsafe, this agency, on application by the municipality or the railway affected, may require such rerouting of cars as will facilitate the general movement and proper public control of traffic on the highways. See section 17 of article V of the Act of July 26, 1913, P. L. 1374, also sections 1 and 7 of the same article as amended by the Act of March 23, 1921, P. L. 43.</p>

If the corporation with which appellant originally arranged for the privileges of the highway will not make some reasonable agreement for this apparently proper use, there are other means to that end. To my mind, the question now involved concerns the regulation of appellant’s privileges, and I think the case presents a situation within the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission; for, where, under circumstances such as those at bar, a corporation shares with another like corporation the exclusive privilege of occupying a street for railway purposes, I think the joint use of the street should be regarded for purposes of regulation as though it were by a single company; and if, in the course of time, the privilege, as employed, proves unsafe in the opinion of the muñid<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>pality, the latter, through the appropriate governmental agency, may require such rerouting of cars as will facilitate the general movement and proper public control of traffic on the highway, thus adding to the safety and adequacy of the service rendered: see section 17 of article V of the Act of 1913, P. L. 1414, and section 1 of article V of the same act, as amended by the Act of March 23,1921, P. L. 43.</p>

L. 43, to the effect that “no......street railway corporation shall be required to give the use of its tracks......to any other common carrier,” does not control here, because that particular paragraph has to do with the subject of through routes, and these words, when taken with their context, really mean that the use of the tracks of one company cannot be given to another company for the purpose of forming a through route except, perhaps, as specially provided in the act: I think the words above quoted do not contemplate, or comprehend, a situation such as the one presented at bar, where an operating company is already making some use of the tracks of another railway company, and the question is as to the regulation of that use in the public interest.</p>

Tamaqua, etc., <a href="/pa/259/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="259 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1038314" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0462-01">259 Pa. 462</a>, 468, where we said: “Since the Public Service Company Law has been on our books we have consistently adhered to the rule that matters within the jurisdiction of the commission must first be determined by it in every instance before the courts will adjudge any phase of the controversy: Bethlehem City Water Co. v.

Penna., etc., Co., <a href="/pa/271/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="271 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="295694" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0237-01">271 Pa. 237</a>, 245, is a case where an order to maintain the status quo was entered.</p>
    <p id="b425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[179,937,1152,1356]]]'>The reasonableness of the ordinance in controversy necessarily depends on the facts to which it is to be applied, and these may be fixed by a proper order obtained under the system of regulation we now enjoy. Should the Public Service Commission make an order enabling the Valley Railways Company to maintain its service on Second Street, under conditions consistent with both the company’s franchise rights and the terms of the ordinance, the application of the latter to such circumstances might, and probably would, be adjudged entirely reasonable. On the other hand, should no such relief be granted by the commission, or otherwise obtained, the reasonableness of the ordinance would then be open to question. Whatever the outcome, all points of law may be raised and determined on appeal after the commission has considered the matter. In the meantime, according to my idea, an order should be made reversing the court below, reinstating the bill, and directing it to grant a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo, so that the municipality, or any of the corporations concerned, may file an application with the Public Service Commission, along the lines above indicated; but I would not at this time decide, or express any view on, many of the points of substantive law determined in the majority opinion.</p>
