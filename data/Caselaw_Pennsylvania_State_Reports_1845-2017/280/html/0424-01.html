Gowen and James E. Hood, trustees under the will <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>of James Gowen, deceased. In the deeds, each property is described by metes and bounds and in two of them mention is made of the fact that the premises are described according to a survey made by John H.

Wilson and James Harker Chadwick, are described as real estate brokers, agents of the Gowen Estate, and J. Franklin Moss is alleged to have entered into a contract of purchase with them of part of the property belonging to that estate. The bill sets forth that the trustees, being seized in fee simple of a tract of land, caused a portion of it to be laid out and plotted and had a plan of lots prepared by John H. Dye in 1885, which plan was attached to the bill. It was set forth that this plan had been confirmed by the department of surveys of the City of Philadelphia on April 19, 1886, the department having been authorized to revise the lines of a certain city plan, including the tract in question, by ordinance of councils. This confirmation of the plan was prior to any conveyances being made by the Gowen Estate. Among the streets marked and plotted on the plan was one called Wads-worth Avenue, which was laid out 450 feet south of Gowen Avenue, on which latter street the properties of the plaintiffs front.</p>

This dedication was accepted by the board of surveyors October 2,1888, as they had the right to do under the Act of June 6, 1871, P. L. 1353, which provides: “Section 1. That the board of surveyors of the City of Philadelphia, as elected and constituted under acts of assembly, be and the same are hereby invested with full authority to examine and finally confirm or reject all plans of surveys or revisions of plans of <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>the City of Philadelphia when the same have been made by the direction of the select and common councils of the said city. Section 3. No street shall hereafter be added to any confirmed plan of the City of Philadelphia, and called a public street, until the same shall have been approved by the board of surveyors as to location, width and grades, and shall extend from street to street as a thoroughfare.” This acceptance, as heretofore recited, was by authority of city councils. The street has since been graded and has been opened for public use. The dedication and acceptance of the street was prior to any of the deeds to the complainants. It is averred that the complainants by implied covenant have the right to have Wadsworth Avenue remain in its location as it appears on the plan of lots of the Gowen Estate and to have the ground 60 feet wide, over which Wadsworth Avenue is located, left open forever, that all persons might use it as a public highway; that relying upon the implied and express dedication of the street and on the carrying out of the project of development provided for by the plan, the complainants purchased their respective properties and that they have a special value for use as high grade residences on account of the plotting as it appears on the plan. ■ The bill avers that the deeds to the complainants contained conditions restricting the land conveyed in respect to its use for the sale of spirituous or malt liquors, as a livery stable, stockyard, planing mill, carpenter or blacksmith shop, stone cutting yard, for carrying on any "manufacturing or other business causing a nuisance or affecting the health or comfort of the neighborhood, and so that no building could be erected within 50 feet from Gowen Avenue. There was no other building restriction in the deeds. The complainants recited that they had spent large sums of money on the improvement and development of their properties and have built handsome residences thereon.

It was averred that the adoption of the proposed plan will be a breach of the covenants between plaintiffs and the trustees of the Gowen Estate, and that the building of the small houses on the two new streets will be a continuing trespass on complainants’ rights, will seriously damage their properties for residential purposes and greatly depreciate their value.</p>

We are not, however, dealing with private streets appearing upon an owner’s plan, but, according to complainants’ bill, with a street, Wadsworth Avenue, which by deed, recorded preceding the conveyances to plaintiffs, the trustees of the Gowen Estate had granted to the City of Philadelphia “for a public street or highway......and thus dedicated the street to the public use” which “dedication was accepted by the board of surveyors October 2, 1888,” also previous to the vesting of title to the lots in any of complainants or their predecessors. Therefore, it appears, from complainants own pleading, that when the Gowen Estate sold the lots (and conceding for the purposes of the proposition that the purchasers were given the plan and the assurances claimed in connection with it) they <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>were sold, so far as Wadsworth Avenue Is concerned, upon a public street and not a private one. When a landowner lays out his land to conform to a public street, the rule is different, and there is no covenant on the grantor’s part that the streets shall remain open. “When appellant purchased, the streets and alleys were public highways, made so by the acts of the borough authorities. She was not in the position of one purchasing a lot from a private owner according to a plan showing streets and alleys laid out by that private owner, but not accepted or adopted as public highways by municipal authority. If she had purchased from a private owner before the streets and alleys had become public highways, her only protection would have been the implied covenant of her grantor that the streets and alleys shall remain open for the use of the lot owners, and of the public as well, as a means of access to their properties, ......she purchased with notice that the streets and alleys were controlled and maintained by the borough authorities as public highways”: Bell v. Pittsburgh Steel Co., <a href="/pa/243/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="243 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1001586" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0083-01">243 Pa. 83</a>.

In their printed brief they argue: “The land lying within the limits of the streets was conveyed to the city for use as a public highway by deed and the deed was accepted by the board of surveyors. Beyond this the city has done nothing with refer<a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>ence to Wadsworth Avenue.” They rely on North Front Street, <a href="/pa-super/52/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="52 Pa. Super. 345" data-case-ids="432703" data-case-paths="/pa-super/52/0345-01">52 Pa. Superior Ct. 345</a>, where, “there was no evidence whatever that the tender [of the street] had been accepted by the municipal authorities.” Here, however, it is averred in the bill that the dedication was “accepted by the board of surveyors” and the deed of dedication recorded. In view of the fact that city councils, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1871, had theretofore authorized the board to revise the lines of the city plan, including the tract in question, the city’s action was complete. The conclusion, must be that when the land passed out of the Gowen Estate to complainants and their antecedent title holders, the avenue was a public street, and there was no covenant on the part of the trustees of the Gowen Estate by its plotting on their plan. The city has the right to change the location of the avenue and defendants are in no way responsible for what it may do.</p>

Even had that plan been recited in the deeds, there would, from this circumstance alone, have been no implied covenant that the lots should not be changed in size, and that smaller houses should not be built on them —to accomplish this, there would have been required a building restriction in the deeds to plaintiffs of clear and unmistakable import. An injunction will not be granted restraining an owner of land from subdividing or selling lots of smaller dimensions than those indicated on a plan made by him, in the absence of an express agreement or covenant that the land embraced in the map shall not be sold in lots smaller in area than those shown thereon, and no such covenant is implied from the mere making of the map and sale of lots with reference thereto: Herold v.
