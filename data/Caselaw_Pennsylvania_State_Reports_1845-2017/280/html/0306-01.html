It can be seen, even from this portion of the writing alone, that testatrix did not, as contended by appellants, intend simply to provide for the possibility of the death of the original legatees, or first takers, during her own life, and in such contingency to substitute others in their places (as in Edelman’s Est., <a href="/pa/276/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="276 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1077661" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0503-01">276 Pa. 503</a>, 506); on the contrary, she used language indicating that she meant to provide for the death of such legatees at any time. She refers to the possible marriage of her son, to his having children, and to the property going “to his family,” also, by in<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>ference, to the possibility of her daughter leaving children. When these amplifying expressions are taken together, and considered in the light of the fact that testatrix evidently intended equality between her two children so far as their individual enjoyment of her estate is concerned, they are indicative of an intention to provide for the passing of that estate on the deaths of such original legatees at any time: Jessup v. Smuck, <a href="/pa/16/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="16 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="410123" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0327-01">16 Pa. 327</a>, 341; Field’s Est., <a href="/pa/266/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="266 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1055996" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0474-01">266 Pa. 474</a>, 477. Then, again, as is well said by the court below, the provision at the end of the paragraph now under consideration, giving the original legatees the right to “decide which charity shall have” the estate in case of their deaths “without children,” also “necessarily visualizes the [first takers] as living after the death of their mother...... [for this provision] cannot mean to refer to their death in her lifetime......[since] until her death, the will is not effective, [and hence] they [the original legatees] are in no position to determine anything with reference to the selection of the charities”; see the same thought in Deeter’s Est., <a href="/pa/280/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="280 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1084478" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0135-01">supra;</a> also.consult Blair v.

It is not necessary to determine either the exact meaning or effect of testatrix’s mention of her son’s “family” (Wettengel’s Est., <a href="/pa/278/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="278 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1080562" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0571-01">278 Pa. 571</a>, 575); or of the privilege conferred on the original legatees to decide as to possible ultimate charities. We have noted these features merely to assist us in arriving at testatrix’s intention concerning the quantity of the estates given to her son and daughter; or, more directly, as aids in determining the key to that problem, which is found in the answer to the question, Did she intend to provide only for the passing of the interests given to her children in case of their deaths in her own lifetime, as contended by appellants, or on their deaths generally, as contended by the other side?
