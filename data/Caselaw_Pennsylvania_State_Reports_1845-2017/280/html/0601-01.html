Jackson for benefit of creditors. At that time the defendant, a school district of the fourth class, was ostensibly indebted to the bank in the sum of $35,812.57, made up as follows: an overdraft of $194.25 as of January 30, 1922, and of a series of notes of the School District of Conneautville, payable to said bank, in amounts and dates as follows: Jan. 1, 1917, $3,500; March 30, 1917, $1,200; April 30, 1917, $1,500; June 25, 1917, $1,300; March 13, 1919, $2,500; June 3, 1919, $2,500; October 20, 1919, $3,000; December 23, 1920, $20,000; December 16, 1918, $118.32. A suit thereon brought by the assignee was by agreement tried before the court without a jury, and, in due course, resulted in a final judgment for defendant; from which plaintiff has appealed. The notes declared upon were executed by the president and secretary of the school board, but no action of the board of school directors was ever taken authorizing the borrowing of the money, or the execution of the notes in question, and hence there was no record made or recorded of any affirmative vote relative thereto. We agree with the trial court that the notes so issued were void and unenforceable against the district. Section 403 of the Act of May 18, 1911, P. L. 330, known as “The School Code,” provides: “The affirmative vote of a majority of all the members of the board of school directors in every school district in this Commonwealth, duly recorded, showing how each member voted, shall be required in order to take action on the following subjects: ......creating or increasing any indebtedness;...... establishing additional schools or departments.” It has been repeatedly held that the acts of a school board done in violation of the above quoted provision of the statute, which is a reenactment of the Act of April 11, 1862, P. L. 471, are void: Dyberry School Dist. v.

City of Richmond, <a href="/us/79/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="79 U.S. 349" data-case-ids="5654277" data-case-paths="/us/79/0349-01">79 U. S. 349</a>), and the fatal outstanding objection to plaintiff’s claim is that it is founded upon loans made to the defendant in manifest violation of article IX, section 8, of the state Constitution, which provides that: “The debt of any county, city, borough, township, school district or other municipality or incorporated district, except as herein provided, shall never exceed seven per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property therein, nor shall any such municipality or district incur any new debt, or increase its indebtedness to an amount exceeding two per centum upon such assessed valuation of property, Avithout the assent of the electors thereof at a public election in such manner as shall be provided by law.” At the time each loan here in question was made, except the first, the indebtedness of the defendant was beyond the constitutional limit. In 1917 the assessed value of the taxable property in defendant school district was $231,-694, which, at the two per cent limit, authorized an indebtedness of $4,633. At that time its interest bearing debt was $8,500. Approximately the same condition existed in 1918. In 1919, the assessed value of its taxable property was $276,664, which authorized an indebtedness of $5,532, while its interest bearing debt was $13,500. In 1920 the assessed value of its taxable property was $276,185, which, at the same rate, authorized an indebtedness of $5,523, while its interest bearing debt was $16,618. In the last named year the electors, for <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>the first time and for the express purpose of building an addition to the school house, voted an increase of indebtedness up to seven per cent, making the authorized amount $19,832. In 1921, the assessed value of the district’s taxable property was $322,874, which at seven per cent authorized an indebtedness of $22,601, while its interest bearing debts were $48,018. The statements given above for the years 1917-1921, inclusive, are the facts as found by the lower court from the evidence and need no comment. One who deals with a school district, or any municipality, must do so in recognition of its constitutionally limited power to create indebtedness.</p>

In fact, the taxing power of the district and all other sources of income were wholly insufficient to defray current expenses and repay the loans. For example, take the year 1919, when the total receipts of the district from all sources were $9,272, and had the tax levy been the limit then allowed by law (20 mills) could not have exceeded $11,888, all told, while the current expenses were $14,686. It will be recalled from the figures <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>first above given that the district’s interest-bearing indebtedness was increasing from year to year, and in 1921, amounted to about fifteen per cent of the assessed value of its taxable property. The authorities last above cited place the burden upon the municipality of proving its indebtedness exceeded the constitutional limit when the debts in question were created. In the case in hand the trial court finds upon undisputed evidence that such burden was met.</p>

A municipality must live within its means-and can no more increase its indebtedness, beyond its actual or expected annual income, for payment of current expenses, than for any other purpose. It is the increase of indebtedness that is forbidden regardless of the object to be accomplished thereby. In 1920, the electors of the defendant district could have validated the existing indebtedness up to seven per cent (Rettinger v. Pittsburgh S. Board, <a href="/pa/266/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="266 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1056104" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0067-01">supra;</a> Bell v.

The fund so obtained could be used for no other purpose: Major v.

In fact, pursuant to such election, bonds to the par valué of $12,500 were issued to raise funds to build the addition. Possibly some of the bank’s $20,000 loan of December, 1920, was used for the same purpose, but that is not clear, and, in any event, the district’s indebtedness was then above the seven per cent limit.</p>

Error is assigned to the refusal of these motions. Trials before the court without a jury conform largely to equity practice (see Lytle, Campbell &amp; Co. v. Somers, F. &amp; T.

Such application, like a motion for new trial, is addressed to the discretion of the lower court and, in the absence of a manifest abuse thereof, which is not shown here, an appellate court will not interfere.
