Dombrowski, appellee, was employed by the City of Philadelphia as chief of general accounting from July, 1952 to June, 1966. Under Philadelphia’s municipal retirement plan he is entitled to retirement benefits commencing in August, 1972. Alleging that §2-308 of Philadelphia’s Home Rule Charter requires an “actuarially sound pension and retirement system” and that the city’s contributions in 1966 and 1967 were insufficient to maintain its retirement system on an actuarially sound footing, Dombrowski instituted an action of mandamus to compel appellants to make the necessary appropriations.</p>

Appellants insist that their position is supported by the language of the Mandamus Act of 1893, Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 345, §3, 12 P.S. §1913; appellee disputes this point and further argues that, if the cases decided pursuant to the Mandamus Act do support appellants, these cases were impliedly overruled by the promulgation of Pennsylvania Sale of Civil Procedure 1082, one of the roles governing mandamus actions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

We held that this private plaintiff had standing and that the writ should issue, stating the proper rule for standing as follows (id. at 136, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.%20580" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="54 A. 580">54 Atl. at 581-82</a>) ; “True, the act directs that when the writ is sought to procure the performance of a public duty only the proceeding shall be in the name of the commonwealth at the relation of the attorney general or the district attorney of the proper county, but it also provides in the 3d section, that it shall issue on the application of any person beneficially interested. While we have no doubt, that these words would give standing to any one interested to make application to the attorney general for his intervention, <em>they just as clearly save to each person the right existing before the act, to sue out the writ when he seeks to protect an interest, special to himself as distinct from the general </em>public.” (Emphasis supplied.)

First, DombrowsM is not protesting a legislative alteration of his pension system but rather a failure of the city to follow the plan <em>it </em>enacted and, for these purposes, has never amended. Second, there is nothing theoretical or possible about Dombrowsky’s injury — the court below found that the city’s retirement system was <em>actually </em>and <em>presently </em>unsound.

Where the appropriations are not sufficient to meet this amount, the accrued liability increases until the system is forced to operate on a cash disbursement basis (a pay-as-you-go system), a system which even the city’s expert agreed was actuarially unsound and contrary to the Charter.</p>

Section 1914 provides: “When the writ is sought to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the proceedings shall be prosecuted in the name of the Commonwealth on the relation of the attorney general: Provided however, That said proceeding, in proper cases, shall be on the relation of the district attorney of the proper county: Provided further, <em>That when said proceeding is sought to enforce a duty affecting a particular public interest of the state, it shall be on the relation of the officer entrusted with the management of such interest. . . </em>.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

Thus, there are several cases which the majority is apparently unaware of, which construe the import of the proviso dealing with mandamus actions commenced by public officials other than the attorney general or the district attorney of the appropriate county. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Lafean v.

The defendants argued that the banking commissioner lacked standing under §1914 of the Mandamus Act to bring such a proceeding and that the only proper party plaintiff was the Commonwealth on relation of the attorney general. In rejecting this contention and permitting the banking commissioner to maintain the mandamus action under the proviso of §1914, we stated: “. . . There can be no doubt that the present proceeding is brought to enforce a public duty and also one affecting a public interest, namely, the banking department of the Commonwealth, and therefore is properly brought in the name of the Commonwealth on the relation of the commissioner of banking. While the relator has also a private interest in his salary, yet the payment of his compensation, as well as the payment of other expenses of his office, is a necessary incident to the administration of the affairs of the department, and being paid out of public <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>funds is a matter of public concern, consequently, the duty of the officials having charge of such payment is a public duty. . . .”</p>

The first question raised in <em>Powell </em>was whether the attorney general was the proper person to act as relator in the proceedings or should the action have been commenced on the relation of the state highway commissioner. We held that the attorney general was a proper party plaintiff but <em>not </em>the <em>only </em>proper plaintiff to the exclusion of other public officials, namely, in <em>Powell, </em>the state highway commissioner. In other words, we recognized that an official entrusted with the management of a particular state interest would have standing to institute a mandamus action <em>in addition to and not to the exclusion of the attorney general or the district attorney of the appropriate county. </em>Cf. Stegmaier <em>v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/203/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="203 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="994741" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0047-01">203 Pa. 47</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20A.%2056" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="52 A. 56">52 Atl. 56</a> (1902). Consequently, the standing of the Retirement Board of Allegheny County in <em>McGovern </em>was predicated upon §1914 (as a public officer) and not because the Board was a “beneficially interested person” under §1913. It should also seem obvious that the Board in <em>McGovern </em>was not a “beneficially interested person” in the sense that all the cases heretofore suggest, i.e., it had no pecuniary or financial personal interest other than enforcing its statutory duties and responsibilities to the public. The Board was acting in its public capacity in an attempt to discharge its public functions <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>and by no stretch of the imagination, reason, logic or case authority can it be categorized, as the majority does, as a private plaintiff.</p>

Therefore, the Court concluded that mandamus will not issue unless the party seeking relief is presently entitled to the funds he is seeking to create. Contrary to the majority opinion, <em>Davidson </em>is not an exception to the rule, but rather has been the rule without exception in this Commonwealth for years with respect to mandamus actions. If <em>Davidson </em>is an exception to a long line of cases suggesting otherwise, why does the majority opinion glaringly fail to cite one authority which has permitted a mandamus action when the individual member of the retirement system did not allege that certain moneys were presently due and owing?</p>

Retirement Board of Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/374/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="374 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1241456" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0165-01">374 Pa. 165</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%20231" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="97 A.2d 231">97 A. 2d 231</a> (1953), involved the following factual picture: Baker in 1928, after having terminated 20 years of service as a member of the Police Department of the City of Pittsburgh, applied to the Police Pension Fund Association for certain pension payments. He was awarded the pension and began receiving the benefits as of January 1, 1929. On October 1, 1928, Baker became an employee of the County of Allegheny which employment continued until June 30, 1952, when he retired. He then applied for the county retirement allowance but his application was denied. Thereafter, an amicable action of mandamus was instituted against the Retirement Board to compel the payment of benefits under the retirement system which Baker alleged were <em>presently due and owing to him. </em>Suffice it to say, this is just another case cited by the majority which cannot be said to involve a situation parallel to the instant ease.</p>

Again there was an allegation that the plaintiff seeking mandamus, if successful, <em>would be entitled to benefits </em>under the system. See <em>Harvey v. Allegheny County Retirement Board, </em><a href="/pa/392/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="392 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="8845571" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0421-01">392 Pa. 421</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20197" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="141 A.2d 197">141 A. 2d 197</a> (1958), and <em>Wright v.

Abernathy, </em><a href="/pa/422/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="422 Pa. 629" data-case-ids="1901737" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0629-01">422 Pa. 629</a>, <em><a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20863" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="222 A.2d 863">222 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20863" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="222 A.2d 863">A. 2d 863</a> (1966), for the assertion: “If anything, plaintiff-Taylor’s interest was weaker than that of Dombrowski for, at the time suit was brought, under the existing retirement system Taylor was no longer entitled to any retirement benefits.” On the basis of this reasoning, the majority concludes that if Taylor had standing, then certainly Dombrowski would have standing. Contrary to the majority’s assertion, Taylor’s interest was unquestionably much stronger than Dombrowski’s. Taylor had a present immediate interest inasmuch as he was being denied certain funds which he quite clearly alleged were <em>then due and owing. </em>Here, Dombrowski has yet to suffer any injury other than the theoretical possibility that the City of Philadelphia in the future (1972 or later) might not have sufficient funds to meet their obligation to him. In <em>Taylor </em>the possibility became the reality of the situation, since Taylor was definitely being denied funds which the majority concluded right<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>fully belonged to him. As of tbe time this suit was instituted, tbe City has continued to meet its financial obligations in full under the retirement system and it is merely conjecture or surmise that some day it will not meet these obligations. The time for DombrowsM to complain is not now, but at such time when he is entitled and eligible to receive his pension and the City for some reason or another has failed to make payments in accordance with what the law requires. In <em>Geary v. Allegheny County Retirement Board, </em><a href="/pa/426/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="426 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1908605" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0254-01">426 Pa. 254</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=231%20A.2d%20743" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="231 A.2d 743">231 A. 2d 743</a> (1967), Geary instituted an action of mandamus to compel the Board to grant his application for a retirement allowance, which he alleged he was presently eligible to receive. The Board defended on the basis that the statute which reduced the required age from sixty to fifty-five was unconstitutional, since it changed the terms of the retirement contracts (discriminatory) and in addition reduced the certainty of payment to the members of the system. In other words, the Board in <em>Geary </em>alleged as a defense basically that which Dombrowski alleges in his complaint, namely, the system is presently actuarily unsound and that the City will not in the future be able to meet its commitments. Our Court, in issuing the writ of mandamus and refusing to consider the actuarial soundness of the system, reasoned that there must be some sort of concrete detriment to the employees rather than a conjectural, theoretical possibility that payments to them will not be met sometime in the future. While the Court did not use the language “standing to sue,” the result reached impliedly leads to the conclusion that an employee would lack the requisite interest for challenging the actuarial soundness until a more concrete detriment existed, i.e., the actual failure of the City to meet its current obligations to him. If the defense of actuarial unsound<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>ness could not be raised by the Retirement Board in <em>Geary, </em>it seems only reasonable to conclude that the question of actuarial unsoundness likewise cannot serve to form the basis of a complaint in mandamus by Dombrowski. It is just as speculative, conjectural, and theoretical that payments will not be forthcoming in the future whether this is a matter of defense or the subject of a complaint. For these reasons, I would hold that Dombrowski lacks the requisite interest in order to have standing to maintain this action of mandamus. However, I do not mean to suggest that other parties would also lack the standing to contest the actuarial soundness of the City’s retirement system, since traditionally certain public officials, as well as the Retirement Board itself, have a sufficient interest in compelling the City to perform its duties to the public.</p>
