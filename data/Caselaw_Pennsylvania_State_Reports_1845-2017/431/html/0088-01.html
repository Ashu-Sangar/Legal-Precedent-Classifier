This petition was predicated on the fact that on December 3, 1958, — 27 days prior to decedent’s marriage to Mrs. Vallish — an antenuptial agreement had been executed wherein decedent and Mrs. Vallish each agreed to relinquish any and all claims which each party might have in property then owned or thereafter acquired by the other. The court granted the rule and Mrs. Vallish filed an answer alleging, inter alia, that the antenuptial agreement was invalid because decedent had not fully and fairly disclosed to her the extent and value of his property and that the consideration for the agreement was neither adequate nor reasonable. After several hearings, the court entered a decree revoking and vacating Mrs. Vallish’s election to take against the will and from that decree the instant appeal lies.</p>

Thus, in the case of Kline v. Kline, <a href="/pa/57/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="57 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1010467" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0120-01">57 Pa. 120</a>, we said: ‘There is perhaps no relation of life in which more unbounded confidence is reposed than in that existing between parties who are betrothed to each other. Especially does the woman place the most implicit trust in the truth and affection of him in whose keeping she is about to deposit the happiness of her future life. From him she has no secrets; she believes he has none from her. To consider such persons as in the same category with buyers and sellers, and to say that they are dealing at arms’ length, we think is a mistake. Surely when a man and woman are on the eve of marriage, and it is proposed between them, as in this instance, to enter into an ante-nuptial contract upon the subject of the enjoyment and disposition of their respective estates, it is the duty of each to be frank and unreserved in the disclosure of all circumstances materially bearing on the contemplated agreement.’ We held that the relation existing between betrothed persons was one of the confidential relations which require uberrima fides in all transactions between them.”</p>

It is clear beyond any question that the agreement made no provision for Mrs. Vallish and that the agreement was disproportionate to the value of decedent’s assets. Under our case law, in view of the obvious absence of any provisions for Mrs. Vallish, unless a full disclosure was made of decedent’s assets at the time of the agreement, this agreement would be invalid; determination of the question of disclosure must depend upon that which the record discloses.</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[159,914,1155,1081]]]'>Common sense would seem to require that, in order to determine whether there was a <em>full </em>disclosure of decedent’s assets, it was a sine qua non to establish the <em>extent </em>and the <em>value </em>of decedent’s assets on the date of the agreement and whether the disclosure made was complete and full would depend on <em>what </em>was disclosed in relation to the extent and value of the <em>total </em>assets. The record reveals that the proponents of the agreement resisted the attempt of Mrs. Vanish’s counsel to present proof of that which decedent owned and its value and such resistance was upheld by the court. The end result is that the record is barren of <em>any </em>evidence in this respect. To argue, as do the agreement proponents, that the assets shown in the inventory, filed after decedent’s death and almost seven years after the agreement, supplies such information is utter nonsense; proponents made <em>no effort </em>to show that the assets shown in the inventory reflected, as to extent or value, that which decedent owned on the date of the agreement.</p>

On cross-examination, the witness could not state whether Frank Valeski, the other subscribing witness, was present when the agreement was signed; he stated that he was sure decedent mentioned the total value of his personalty but could not recall such value, that he could not recall that decedent ever told him he had any bonds but he recalled that stocks were discussed of which he could recollect only Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company stock, that decedent never itemized the personalty and that, while bank stock was mentioned, he could not recall the name of the bank.

At the third hearing, when Mrs. Vanish’s counsel offered such proof the court sustained an objection thereto stating “we have closed the record”; thereupon, counsel requested the right to make a formal offer upon the record “as to exactly what evidence [he] would produce on this subject” to which the court then responded “you may make the offer but it will not be transcribed”. The exclusion of such proof and the refusal even to permit the formal offer of proof to be transcribed as part of the record constituted palpable error. Such evidence was germane to the issue and of vital importance in determining whether a <em>full </em>dis<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>closure had been made. On this ground the matter must be remanded to the court below for further hearing so that such evidence could be made a matter of record.</p>

This agreement, copied verbatim from a form book (6 Dunlap-Hanna Pennsylvania Forms), was prepared by decedent’s own counsel and Mrs. Yallish was not represented by counsel; while no schedule of assets is attached to the agreement, not even an estimate of the value of assets appears in the agreement. Of. <em>Kaufmann, </em>supra. The proponents of the agreement stress the third paragraph thereof: “. . . the intended husband is seized in fee simple of certain real property and owns certain personal property <em>the value of which has been fully disclosed to the intended wife.” </em>(Emphasis added). Such a provision, while <em>prima facie </em>evidence that a full and fair disclosure had been made by decedent to his intended wife, is rebuttable and the burden of proof to show the absence of such full and fair disclosure rests upon the wife.

Moreover, the court below erred in not permitting the introduction of evidence to show with certainty the extent and value of the assets at the time of the agreement; had the court below permitted the introduction of such evidence, such evidence coupled with Mrs. Vallish’s unrestricted testimony might well have shown the absence of a full disclosure of assets.</p>

The refusal of the court below to permit Mrs. Vallish to testify save in a limited manner to the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the execution of the agreement and the refusal of the court below to permit Mrs. Vallish to present evidence of the value and nature of decedent’s assets at the time of the agreement placed such obstacles in her path as made it almost impossible for her to prove, if she could, the absence of a full and <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>fair disclosure.
