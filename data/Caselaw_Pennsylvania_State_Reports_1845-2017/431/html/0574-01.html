      <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>The first reason assigned by the court was that the verdict was against the “Weight of <em>credible </em>evidence”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> This stated reason clearly indicates that the court took upon itself the determination of the <em>credibility </em>of the witnesses and placed its imprimatur of credibility upon McConns’ expert witnesses and deemed not credible the Commonwealth’s expert witnesses. <em>Springer, </em>supra, is particularly apposite to the case at bar. In <em>Springer, </em>one of the assigned reasons for the grant of a new trial was identical with the first reason assigned by the court below in this case, i.e., the verdict was against the weight of the credible evidence. In <em>Springer </em>this Court, unanimous in reversing an order granting a new trial, stated (p. 560) : “The lower court’s assumption that the verdict was against the weight of the <em>credible </em>evidence transgressed the bounds of the judicial function. The <em>credibility </em>of the oral testimony, which was concerned with the fair market value of the property, was peculiarly for the jury to appraise and not for the court. Nor can it properly be said that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The value of the land appropriated was the only substantial issue that the jury had to resolve. There was no dispute as to the extent of the property taken, nor its location, condition, topographical characteristics or the plaintiff’s right to recover its fair worth. In arriving at a just determination of the fair market value, the jury had as criteria the customarily widely disparate opinions of the real estate experts who testified for the respective sides. It was the province of the jury to weigh the credibility of the valuation witnesses’ testimony and to determine what the land taken was fairly worth at the time of the condemnation. The jurors had a right to, and undoubtedly did, bring to bear, in appraising the expert testimony, what <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>they had perceived with respect to the property at the time they formally viewed it for trial purposes and further, exercised their own good common sense. To overthrow the verdict on the ground that it was against the weight of the evidence would, in the light of the record, amount to a judicial usurpation of the jury’s province.” When the court below in this case, as did the court below in <em>Springer, </em>took upon itself the determination of the witnesses’ credibility it went beyond its judicial function and its conclusion that the instant verdict was against the weight of the <em>credible </em>evidence did not justify setting aside the instant verdict.</p>
    <p id="b607-3" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[167,1106,1147,1263]],["BL_608.1",608,[215,392,1155,542]]]'>The second reason assigned by the court for the grant of a new trial was that the jury had failed to accord to the land, prior to taking, any commercial value. In its opinion the majority of the court below stated: “For even the Commonwealth experts testified that the sloping 12 acre tract which abutted on the old National Highway had commercial value before the condemnation.” Our review of the record does not lend support to this statement. One Commonwealth expert, G. P. Amanti, did testify that the portion of McConns’ land which fronted on the old highway had <em>potential </em>commercial value but he considered that only 5, not 12, acres had such potential value; moreover, he testified that the demand for commercial property on this stretch of highway was not great and that the “potential commercial value” which existed along the old Route 40 prior to the taking still existed, after the taking, along the new Route 40 and the Hutch Fork Lake Road. The other Commonwealth expert, G. H. Fetherlin, attributed <em>potential </em>commercial value to only 4%, not 12, acres and he agreed with Mr. Amanti that the demand for commercial property along this stretch was not great and that that portion of Me<a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>Conns’ property which remained did have, to some extent, potential commercial value. The jury may well have accepted, and probably did, the testimony of these two witnesses who attributed almost minimal commercial value to the property; however, such was the province of the jury and it was for them to believe or disbelieve the testimony of these witnesses. The <em>assumption </em>by the court below that the jury did not give consideration to the question of the commercial value prior to the taking finds no warrant on this record.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[206,948,1159,1261]]]'>The third and last reason assigned by the court was that the Commonwealth’s expert witnesses had ignored comparable sales of land in the area and, in some manner, thereby misled the jury. In the first place, the court permitted these witnesses to testify; in so doing, the qualification or disqualification of these witnesses was for the court to determine and, if the court believed that the lack of knowledge of comparable sales rendered valueless their prospective testimony, the court should not have permitted them to testify. In the second place, the question of the weight to be accorded the testimony of the Commonwealth witnesses was for the jury and, in determining such weight, we cannot assume that the jury did not take into consideration their knowledge or lack of knowledge of sales of comparable land in the area. In addition, the jury may well have considered the sales in the area unreliable by reason of the times of such sales prior to the taking or the distance of the various tracts of land sold from MeConns’ land. We cannot assume, as the court below did, that the jury did not take into consideration comparable sales; to do so would constitute pure speculation and conjecture.</p>

While in no sense controlling, the fact is that two juries, after hearing all the evidence, have chosen to accept the Commonwealth’s rather than the McConns’ version of the damages actually suffered. Certainly, the reasons assigned by the court for the award of a new trial are not sufficient in the law to set aside this verdict. The action of the court below in granting a new trial constituted an abuse of judicial discretion and must be reversed.</p>
