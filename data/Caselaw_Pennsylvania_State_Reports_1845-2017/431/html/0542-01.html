Questions concerning this trust have been appealed to this Court on two prior occasions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">*</a> This time the issue is the amount of attorney fees which should be paid out of the trust estate for legal services rendered in connection with the protection of Julius LaRocca’s interest in the trust.</p>

No income from the real estate was applied or paid in accordance with the provisions of the trust, and nothing was done about this provision of the trust until after the separation in 1958 of Julius LaRocca’s parents, Samuel (who was Joe LaRocca’s son) and his wife Maria LaRocca.</p>

In response to this action, Joe LaRocca sought reformation of the trust instrument, alleging that because of <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>mistake the trust should be modified (1) to entitle him to receive the income from the trust property until his death or until the named beneficiary, Julius, reached the age of twenty-one years, and (2) to give him the power to revoke the trust. The Orphans’ Court reformed the instrument and gave Joe LaRocca the income from the trust until his death or until Julius reached twenty-one, but refused to give Joe any power of revocation. On appeal to this Court in 1963, we reversed and decided the minor beneficiary was entitled to the income from the trust and the trust deed could not be reformed. <em>LaRocca Trust, </em><a href="/pa/411/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="411 Pa. 633" data-case-ids="1885940" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0633-01">411 Pa. 633</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20409" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="192 A.2d 409">192 A. 2d 409</a>.</p>
