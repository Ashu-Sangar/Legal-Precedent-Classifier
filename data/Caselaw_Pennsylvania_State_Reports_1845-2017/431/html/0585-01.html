Budnik and Marina Budnik, through their Philadelphia counsel, presented documentary evidence, consisting of purported copies of public records of births, marriages and deaths, to eliminate any kin closer in degree than themselves and to establish their own relationship, all of which documents were authenticated by the American Consul in Moscow. No witnesses appeared in their behalf. Their counsel also presented a petition for a citation to be directed to all adverse parties to show cause why a commission should not be issued or letters rogatory be allowed to obtain the testimony of the two claimants in the Ukraine. The Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County denied this petition. <em>(Mackarus Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/41/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="41 Pa.

The court based its holding on two factors: <em>first, </em>the two nieces had failed to sign the petition as required by Philadelphia Orphans’ <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>Court Rule 34.1<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and since the petition had not been signed by claimants themselves, the petition could not be <em>granted; second, </em>since the issuance of a commission is not a matter of right but rather within the discretion of the court under Philadelphia Orphans’ Court Rule 36,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>the court denied the petition because it believed that the evidence which would be elicited could not be trusted and because the interests of the Commonwealth and the United States could not be protected.

The Orphans’ Court denied the claim of the United States on the ground that, while the two alleged nieces had not proved they were the deceased’s next of kin, there was some indication that they <em>might </em>be.

      <em>First, </em>appellants did not sign the petition as required by rule 34.1 of the Philadelphia County Orphans’ Court rules<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> and, while this in itself is perhaps not fatal, appellants should at least comply with all the local rules before making a request for a commission or letters rogatory.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>
      <em>Second&gt; </em>the Orphans’ Court rejected all of the appellants’ documentary evidence <em>(Mackarus Estate (No. 3), </em>supra, at 270-74), because all of the documents were either <em>ex parte </em>affidavits or <em>post Ktem motam </em>records and were inadmissible as evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> The appellants have, as of yet, brought forth no competent evidence to substantiate their claim; instead, they wish to be examined far from the jurisdiction where opposing parties will be unable to protect effectively their interests. This testimony will loom very large in their case since they have offered no other competent evidence. In a case such as this, before the court will issue a commission or letters rogatory, the petitioner should produce some competent documentary evidence which indicates that his claim is tenable and that the testimony of the petitioner will help substantiate his case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

      <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>There is no question that these requirements place a heavy burden on foreign claimants. The burden is no greater, however, than would be placed on a resident of another state. Such requirements are necessary where the foreign claimant is an actual party to the suit and the rights of the other parties must be preserved and the preservation of such rights is difficult to accomplish if a claimant is examined outside the jurisdiction of the court. Even though the burden placed upon the appellants by the Orphans’ Court’s decision is heavy, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying the petition.</p>
    <p id="b626-4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[206,1054,1160,1191]]]'>Appellants’ second argument is that the Orphans’ Court’s decision conflicts with United States foreign policy because of an exchange of letters between Ambassador William C. Bullitt and Commissar Maxim M. Litvinov in 1935, an exchange which details the procedures in the United States and the Soviet Union concerning discovery. The letters were subsequently republished in Executive Agreement Series, No. 83. Appellants claim that the Orphans’ Court was prohibited by the terms of the Agreement from restricting the issuance of letters rogatory or a commission to the proper official in the Soviet Union. On the contrary, the Agreement merely details the discovery procedures in the two countries, and does not mandate courts in either country to alter their normal procedures for issuing such letters. The exchange of notes contains nothing which is obligatory on either nation. While appellants are correct in pointing out that the Orphans’ Court cannot ignore a treaty or an Executive Agreement, still there is no treaty or agreement requiring it to issue letters rogatory or a commission in this case.</p>

      <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>Appellants also cite the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Zschernig v. </em>Miller, <a href="/us/389/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="389 U.S. 429" data-case-ids="11340675" data-case-paths="/us/389/0429-01">389 U.S. 429</a> (1968). In that case, the Supreme Court held an Oregon escheat statute unconstitutional because it conflicted with United States foreign policy. While <em>Zschernig </em>may raise grave doubt as to the constitutionality of Pennsylvania’s “Iron Curtain Act” (Mar<em>tyniuk v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/f-supp/282/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="282 F. Supp. 252" data-case-ids="5353704" data-case-paths="/f-supp/282/0252-01">282 F. Supp. 252</a>, 254, n. 2 (E.D. Pa. 1968)), that case is presently inapposite. We are merely deciding a narrow procedural question: whether the Orphans’ Court abused its discretion in denying a petition for a commission or letters rogatory. <em>Zschernig </em>applies to escheat statutes and the case at bar does not involve an escheat statute. We are merely concerned with the scope of the rules of the Philadelphia County Orphans’ Court and whether the court went beyond its power under those rules. The Orphans’ Court opinion in this case involves the procedure whereby next of kin are ascertained, whereas, the heirs in <em>Zschernig </em>were already identified. <em>Zschernig </em>says nothing about the procedures which a local court may use to determine the identity of next of kin. Furthermore, in its decision on the merits, the Orphans’ Court awarded the estate to the Commonwealth under section 1314 of The Fiscal Code and not under the “Iron Curtain Act”. <em>(Mackarus Estate (No. 3), </em>supra, at 275).</p>
