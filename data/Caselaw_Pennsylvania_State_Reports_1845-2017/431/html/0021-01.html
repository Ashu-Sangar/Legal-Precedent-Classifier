This 5' tall, and 131 lb. man fell backward, flat on his back. His wallet was emptied and thrown near his head. The youths fled. There was an abrasion of the left side of the victim’s nose, and an abrasion on the right side of his forehead in two places.

In support of his motion in arrest of judgment, he urges that the evidence is insufficient to convict where, of several witnesses, only one, Emma Holliday, can identify the defendant, and <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>that one witness is of doubtful credibility. Appellant seems to ignore the fact that credibility is for the jury, and the jury resolved the issue against appellant. Nor can we say that no reasonable jury could have believed Emma. On the contrary, despite some inconsistencies in the details of her testimony, Emma at all times positively identified Marion Wilson as one of the assailants. Her testimony, believed by the jury, certainly is enough to support the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b55-3" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[190,852,1147,479]]]'>Several of appellant’s arguments in support of his motion for a new trial relate to alleged prejudice against him on the part of the judicial machinery of the Commonwealth. We see absolutely no merit in any of these contentions. Appellant claims that the prosecution failed to investigate diligently the possibilities concerning his innocence. Yet he was unable to supply any information whatsoever to the district attorney. We find this contention groundless.</p>
    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[187,1343,1148,590]]]'>Next appellant alleges that the court below was prejudiced against him, as evidenced by its participation in the examination and by its charge to the jury. With regard to the participation by the trial judge, appellant alleges that the court usurped the role of the prosecutor. Actually, the court was only fulfilling its proper function, by seeking to clarify answers and calm the youthful witnesses. Nothing was said in response to questions by the court by either of the witnesses appellant refers to that was not also stated in response to questioning by the district attorney.</p>
    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.6",55,[183,1943,1148,482]],["BL_56.1",56,[184,365,1156,755]]]'>Nor do we find that the charge to the jury was prejudicial. We find no merit in appellant’s claim that the charge as a whole was one-sided. Furthermore, the court did not err in instructing the jury that “It’s either first degree murder ... or it’s not guilty.” Appellant’s objection to such a charge is twofold. He claims that this is an invasion of the jury’s province of ascertaining the degree of guilt. However, this court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Chavis, </em><a href="/pa/357/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="357 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="472060" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0158-01">357 Pa. 158</a>, <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>172, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%2096" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="53 A.2d 96">53 A. 2d 96</a> (1947), quoting from <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court did not remove the jury’s right to ascertain the degree of guilt; on the contrary, it plainly told the jury what each of the possible verdicts was, and did not exclude the possibility of a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree or of voluntary manslaughter.</p>
    <p id="b56-4" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[179,1130,1157,908]]]'>The other objection to that part of the charge is that it assumed that the homicide was done in the perpetration of a robbery, foreclosing the possibility that the intent to rob was not conceived until after the stabbing. Despite appellant’s assertion that “there is little citable authority” on the question, his contention was treated directly and dismissed in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Hart, <a href="/pa/403/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="403 Pa. 652" data-case-ids="1299531" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0652-01">403 Pa. 652</a>, 658, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20850" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="170 A.2d 850">170 A. 2d 850</a> (1961) : “Defendant’s highly technical argument amounts to this: Unless the Commonwealth proves that the intention to commit a robbery was formed before the beginning of the fatal assault, the evidence cannot amount to a murder which was committed in the perpetration of a robbery. In other words, defendant would require a televised stop-watch in every robbery or felony-killing to prove that the felonious intent existed before the attack. . . .</p>

As the victim lay on the ground, <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>defendant took money from his pockets, bnt he claimed he never intended to do this until after the victim was lying unconscious or dead. The court in sustaining a conviction of murder in the first degree with penalty of death, said (page 321) : . . The defendant’s argument that the intention to rob originated subsequent to the assault upon the deceased need not be seriously considered in view of the verdict of the jury. Moreover, even though such were the case, <em>it is immaterial when the design to roh toas conceived, </em>if the homicide occurred while defendant was perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a robbery.’ ” (Emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b57-4" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[190,1025,1149,1027]]]'>Appellant does not limit his allegations to the misconduct of the prosecution and the court, but also contends that defense counsel did not adequately and competently represent him. This contention is based largely on failure of counsel to object to the admission of certain evidence and various procedures followed by the court. As will be seen later, the court’s action in most of the instances complained of was proper, and in any case, was not harmful. The record of the instant case is almost 1,000 pages long. It would be inconceivable to expect a trial lawyer, on the spur of the moment, to make every proper objection. Moreover, failure to object is often a valid tactical move. <em>Commonwealth v. Thompson, </em><a href="/pa/367/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="367 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1228352" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0102-01">367 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20401" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="79 A.2d 401">79 A. 2d 401</a> (1951).

Appellant contends that the court erred in permitting Juror No. 11 to continue, over objection of both parties, after she took ill while out of court. The juror reported that she was feeling fine, that her condition had arisen before and quickly passes, and that she de<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>sired to continue. Under those circumstances, we cannot find an abuse of discretion in permitting her to continue on the jury.</p>
    <p id="b58-4" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[164,526,1159,1678]]]'>The other objection to the jury composition is a much more fundamental one, directed to what is known as “death qualification” of jurors. Appellant urges that the procedure followed here unconstitutionally excludes a substantial segment of the community from the jury. The recent landmark decision of <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/391/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="391 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="1767501" data-case-paths="/us/391/0510-01">391 U.S. 510</a>, <a href="/us/391/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="391 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="1767501" data-case-paths="/us/391/0510-01">88 S. Ct. 1770</a> (1968), however, is determinative of the case and adverse to appellant’s position. In that case, the sentence of death was held to be invalid because the State had been permitted to challenge for cause all who said they were opposed to capital punishment and all who indicated that they had conscientious scruples against inflicting it. The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Witherspoon </em>on two very important grounds. First of all, in <em>Witherspoon, </em>only the death penalty, not the conviction was invalidated. Moreover, the jury in the instant case was not selected in the same manner as the <em>Witherspoon </em>jury. The Commonwealth anticipated what <em>Witherspoon </em>would allow as a proper form of voir dire. The district attorney was careful not to challenge a potential juror for cause if the juror merely stated that he had scruples against capital punishment. The district attorney always went on to ask whether the juror could in no case impose the death penalty. Only if the juror stated that he never could vote for a death penalty was he challenged for cause. <em>Witherspoon </em>indicates that if this procedure had there been followed, even the sentence of death would have been affirmed. Appellant has no legitimate complaint about the selection of the jury.</p>

The argument with regard to the slides is that they were so inflammatory as to prejudice appellant unduly. The test that has evolved in these cases involving pictures of the victim’s body is “whether or not the photographs are of such essential evidentiary value that their need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors.” <em>Commonwealth v. Eckhart, </em><a href="/pa/430/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="430 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1915684" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0311-01">430 Pa. 311</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20271" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="242 A.2d 271">242 A. 2d 271</a> (1968); <em>Commonwealth v.

In both of the cited cases, admission of the photographs involved was held to constitute reversible error. However, <em>Powell </em>was a clear case of felony-murder where the force used and the nature and extent of the injuries was irrelevant. In the instant case, the Commonwealth, although advancing the felony-murder theory, also contended that this <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>was a case of first degree murder by virtue of the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body.</p>

In <em>Eckhart </em>“the gruesome scalp and bloody web of tangled hair” were found to be highly inflammatory and easily excisable. Stated simply, the slides in the instant case are not nearly so gruesome and inflammatory as were the photographs in <em>Eckhart. </em>This court has always recognized that the admission of photographs is within the discretion of the trial judge. Eckhart, supra; <em>Powellj </em>supra, and cases cited therein. The court below clearly exercised that discretion, taking care to limit any prejudicial effect the slides might have had. Although the Commonwealth sought to introduce five slides, the court admitted only three, excluding one as being repetitious, and a second as being too inflammatory. The three slides admitted were shown for a total of less than two minutes and did not go out with the jury. In view of all these circumstances, we cannot say that the admission of the three slides constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>

    <p id="b61-4" data-blocks='[["BL_61.4",61,[174,648,1151,1182]]]'>Finally, appellant urges that the court erred in permitting Herbert Holliday to testify as to what his daughter, Emma Holliday, told him after she witnessed the slaying. He further contends that the error in allowing Mr. Holliday to testify was compounded by the fact that the Commonwealth, after pleading surprise, was permitted to examine him as if on cross-examination. We find no error in either the content or the manner of his testimony. His was proper rehabilitation testimony for two distinct reasons. First his testimony tended to rebut the suggestion raised by appellant’s counsel in his cross-examination of Emma Holliday that her story was recently fabricated. During the cross-examination of Emma, it was brought out that the police were not notified of the event allegedly witnessed until the following day. This could well have raised a doubt as to whether Emma really witnessed the event or whether she made up the story later. Herbert’s testimony to the effect that Emma did relate the facts of the slaying immediately after it occurred, and that he told her to forget it, negates the inference of recent fabrication.</p>

Lehigh Val. R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/236/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="236 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="986764" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0038-01">236 Pa. 38</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20595" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="84 A. 595">84 Atl. 595</a> (1912). Emma Holliday had indeed been impeached by the use of prior inconsistent statements, not only as to number of assailants but as to identity. We cannot accept appellant’s contention that it was error not to exclude this rehabilitation as being collateral to the main issues of the case. If examination as to the number of <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>assailants was improper rehabilitation, it was improper cross-examination too. Controlling the scope of the examination is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge, and permitting the instant testimony was a valid exercise of that discretion.</p>
    <p id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[172,658,1150,370]]]'>So too was permitting the Commonwealth to cross-examine the witness, Herbert Holliday, after pleading surprise. We see no reason why a rehabilitating witness should be treated any differently from any other regarding cross-examination after a plea of surprise. Providing that the surprise is shown to the satisfaction of the trial judge, such cross-examination is proper.</p>
