On May 18, 1966, the Commonwealth filed an appeal from that decree in this Court and, on June 29, 1967, this Court, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, held that the trial court had abused its discretion in not enjoining the operation of the premises as a restaurant licensed to sell liquor and malt beverages and we remanded the record to the court <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>below for the entry of an “appropriate decree”.

Necessarily, resolution of the question whether the appeal should be dismissed will require our consideration of the issues raised on this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[191,658,1158,1039]]]'>On the <em>prior </em>appeal, the issue was whether the court below had abused its discretion in not enjoining the operation of the Wheel Bar. In view of the findings of fact of the court below, which were supported by evidence of record and which led to the conclusion of the court below that appellants’ actions in the operation of this bar-restaurant constituted a nuisance, we held that the court below had abused its discretion in not enjoining the operation of the Wheel Bar and in permitting its continued operation under bond. See: <em>Tich, </em>supra, p. 125. Even the most cursory examination of our opinion in <em>Tide, </em>supra, will reveal beyond question that, when we remanded the matter to the court below for the entry of an “appropriate decree”, we contemplated the immediate entry of a decree enjoining the operation of this bar-restaurant. The court below correctly interpreted our remand order and entered a decree enjoining the operation of the Wheel Bar for one year.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[191,1711,1152,595]]]'>In appealing from that decree, appellants now present two questions: (1) whether the court below, in consonance with our remand order, had the discretion to padlock the Wheel Bar for a period less than one year; (2) whether the court below, in fashioning an “appropriate decree” in compliance with our remand mandate, had discretion to hear and consider evidence that the nuisance had been abated and that the operation of the bar-restaurant had been exemplary ever since the equity action was instituted, a period of over two years.</p>

      <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>The Pennsylvania Liquor Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> provides that, once the court has found the existence of conduct in the operation of a bar-restaurant to constitute a nuisance and has directed its abatement, the court then has two options: (1) “upon proper cause shown”, to order that the premises “shall not be occupied or used for one year thereafter” or (2) to permit the use and occupancy of the premises provided a bond in the penal sum of not less than $500 be posted and that no further violation of the Code occur. Under the Code, if the court, in the exercise of its discretion, rejects the second option and adopts the first option, then the unequivocal language of the Code provides for padlocking of the premises “for one year thereafter.” Upon our remand of this matter for the entry of an “appropriate decree”, such decree of necessity had to be fashioned in the language of the statute. To contend, as appellants now do, that the court is given discretion to padlock the premises for less than one year offends both the statutory language and the remand order in <em>Tide, </em>supra, particularly because the remand order envisioned a decree padlocking the premises as authorized and permitted under the statute.</p>

    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[185,484,1157,1039]]]'>On <em>this </em>appeal, appellants next contend that, upon our remand and in order to fashion an “appropriate decree”, the court below had discretion to hear and consider evidence that the nuisance had been entirely-abated and that such abatement had continued for over two years. To the very same question (although, of course, the time during which the nuisance had allegedly been abated was of shorter duration) this Court addressed itself on the <em>prior </em>appeal. In <em>Tick, </em>supra, p. 125, we said: “Nor was the court justified in suspending the applicable law because the owner of the Wheel Bar had endeavored, in some manner, to abate the averred nuisance after the suit in equity had been filed.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Moreover, the decree involved in the <em>prior </em>appeal directed the abatement of the declared nuisance and, had the nuisance not been abated, appellants would have been disobeying the original decree in this litigation.

    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[170,599,1166,1317]]]'>The United States Supreme Court has held that section 22 “authorizing an injunction is not punitive but preventive” in nature, <em>Grosfield v. United States, </em><a href="/us/276/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="276 U.S. 494" data-case-ids="3902464" data-case-paths="/us/276/0494-01">276 U.S. 494</a>, 497 (1928). The Supreme Court further discussed the nature of the injunctive decree saying, “the decree must rest [on the ground] that the premises ought to be closed for a period long enough to end the probability of a recurrence of their unlawful use.” <em>Grosfield v. United States, </em><a href="/us/276/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="276 U.S. 494" data-case-ids="3902464" data-case-paths="/us/276/0494-01">supra, at 499</a>. The remedy there is fashioned by likelihood of the continuance of the nuisance rather than an inflexible one year standard in the nature of punishment. The language above is very close to that used in <em>United States v. Studio Club, </em><a href="/f2d/12/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="12 F.2d 462" data-case-ids="1644465" data-case-paths="/f2d/12/0462-01">12 F. 2d 462</a> (S.D. N.Y. 1926). That case was modified in <em>United States v. Pepe, </em><a href="/f2d/12/0985-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="12 F.2d 985" data-case-ids="1644717" data-case-paths="/f2d/12/0985-01">12 F. 2d 985</a> (2d Cir. 1926), which was cited by the Supreme Court in <em>Qrosfield, </em>supra. In <em>Studio Olub, </em>supra, the decree closing the premises under section 22 was for a period of <em>six months. </em>Since the federal statute after which our own was patterned permits an injunction'for less than a year, the majority is in error in straining the language of our statute to hold that the court below could not make a determination to enjoin the nuisance for a period of less than one year.</p>

Instead, we remanded to the chancellor to enter in his discretion a decree appropriate to the situation. Thus, he was to look at the nuisance as it then existed and in accordance with the act fashion a decree that would best achieve the abatement of the nuisance. This is the only reading of “appropriate decree” that can support this Court’s action of remand.</p>
