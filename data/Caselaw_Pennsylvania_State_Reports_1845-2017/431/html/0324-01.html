The District, a fourth-class school district, levied for 1965-1966 an occupation tax on appellant and all other farmers within the boundaries of the school district. The District claims to derive its authority for the tax from the so-called “Tax Anything Act” (Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145, §1, as amended, 53 P.S. §6851: “A. The duly constituted authorities of . . . school districts of the fourth class may, in their discretion, by ordinance or resolution, for general revenue purposes, levy, assess and collect or provide for the levying, assessment and collection of such taxes as they shall determine to be paid ... on <em>persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property </em>with the limits of such political subdivisions .... (emphasis added).” This general grant of power is followed by several exceptions. Appellant maintains that the fourth exception exempts farmers from occupation taxes: “Except that such local authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this act . . . (4) to <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>levy, assess and collect a tax on goods and articles manufactured in such political subdivision or on the by-products of manufacture, or on minerals, timber, natural resources and farm products produced in such political subdivision or on the preparation or processing thereof for use or market, <em>or on any privilege, act or transaction related to the business of </em>manufacturing, <em>the production, preparation or processing </em>of minerals, timber and natural resources, <em>of farm products, </em>by manufacturers, by producers and <em>by farmers with respect to the </em>goods, articles and <em>products of their own manufacture, production or growth, </em>or on any privilege, act or transaction relating to the business of processing by-products of manufacture, or on the transportation, loading, unloading or dumping or storage of such goods, articles, products or by-products.” (Emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[189,1322,1155,646]]]'>The “Tax Anything Act” was repealed as of January 1, 1966. The portions quoted above, however, were included in “The Local Tax Enabling Act” (Act of December 31, 1965, P. L. 1257, §2, 53 P.S. §6902). In addition, the legislature included the following provision at the end of the fourth exception: “. . . except that local authorities may levy, assess and collect taxes on the occupation, occupational privilege, per capita and earned income or net profits of natural persons engaged in the above activities . . . .” There is no question that appellant would be subject to an occupation tax under the new act.</p>

The District points out that the work “occupation” has been included in the general grant of power but has been omitted in the fourth exception. It, therefore, maintains that occupation faxes are not exempted under the fourth exception. Appellant counters by indicating that a new word “act” has been included in the fourth exception and he argues that the legislature used “occupation” and “act” to convey the same concept. In drafting legislation, precision in language is a prerequisite and in statutes, perhaps more so than in any other type of writing, words acquire specific meanings. It is difficult for us to accept the argument that the legislature <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>used the word “occupation” in the general grant of taxing authority and then used the word “act” in the fourth exception to convey the same concept.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Neither can it be questioned that the privilege of engaging in the occupation of farming is the sum total of all the privileges related to the production, preparation or processing of farm products by farmers, with respect to the products of their own production or growth.” <em>Brandt v. Conewago Twp. School </em>District, <a href="/pa-d-c2d/34/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="34 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 146" data-case-ids="8729392" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/34/0146-01">34 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 146</a>, 151 (1964). This interpretation places a strain on the word “privilege”, which was included in both the general grant of power and in the fourth exception. Under the court’s interpretation in <em>Brandt, </em>the word must mean more in the fourth exception than it does in the general grant since it now includes the concept of “occupation” which was not repeated in the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>fourth exception. The three earlier cases also fail to explain why the legislature did not merely repeat the word “occupation” if it intended to ban occupation taxes. Furthermore, if the words “privilege, act or transaction” carry the broad interpretation these courts suggest, why did the legislature not merely say that the local taxing authority could not tax farmers and manufacturers instead of constructing a detailed exception to the general grant?</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[178,864,1148,1042]]]'>In statutory construction cases it is easy to fall into a morass attempting to define one word in isolation. Instead of focusing on the words “Occupation”, “privilege”, and “act”, it would be more beneficial to <em>look </em>at the structure of the entire fourth exception. The fourth exception is divided into five parts. The first section forbids taxes on manufactured articles, natural resources and farm products. The second forbids taxes on the processing and preparation of those items. The fourth forbids taxes on any “privilege, act or transaction”, involved in the production of byproducts of manufacture. The fifth forbids taxes on the transportation and storage of those items. The third section, which is the section in question, forbids taxes on “any privilege, act or transaction related to . . . the production, preparation or processing ... of farm products ... by farmers with respect to the . . . products of their own manufacture, production or growth . . . .”</p>

If these words are so all-inclusive, why was it necessary to include the first, second and fifth sections? These words are repeated in the third and fourth sections. These two sections deal with different subjects. Therefore, the meaning these words have in either section <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>is limited to the particular area with which each of these two sections deals.</p>

The first forbids taxes on completed products, the second processing taxes, the fourth processing taxes on by-products of manufacture, the fifth storage taxes. The controversial third section, when read in the context of the other sections, is an extension of the second section. It prohibits the taxing authority from taxing the farmer on any “privilege, act or transaction” concerning the production, preparation and processing of items when the farmer himself does the work. An example would be a tax on the privilege of processing one’s own milk. When read in the context of the other four sections, this third exception does not convey the expansive meaning the appellant argues.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[193,1315,1155,707]]]'>Third, the first, second, fourth and fifth sections indicate that the legislature was concerned about taxes on <em>goods </em>and <em>articles </em>in their various stages of production and sale. When read in context, the third section should be given the same interpretation. The third section prohibits a tax on any “privilege, act or transaction” involving production, preparation and processing by the farmer himself, which tax will necessarily be included in the cost of the completed product. For instance, if there is a tax of one cent per gallon for the privilege of processing milk, the farmer will be forced to include this one cent in the cost of each gallon he sells.</p>

In <em>Isaly, </em>this Court struck down a mercantile tax on retail dealers for all sales made in a location other than the place of manufacture. The language of the act would seem to require this result. The <em>Miller </em>court then goes on to say, however: “If a tax on only the sale of manufactured products is invalid as a tax on a privilege, act or transaction related to manufacturing, it seems obvious that a tax on the entire occupation of farming is in reality a tax on every privilege, act or transac<a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>tion related to the production, preparation, or processing of farm products by farmers.” <em>Miller, </em>supra, at 424.

In <em>Fischer, </em>this Court struck down a tax on the profits earned from the business of a partnership. Starting from the proposition that sales taxes are not permitted under the act, this Court continued, “The sale of the manufactured articles being, therefore, a privilege, act or transaction related to the business of manufacturing, it is equally a privilege related to the business of manufacturing to obtain profits therefrom”. <em>Fischer, </em>supra, at 143. In <em>Heinz, </em>the Superior Court struck down a mercantile license tax based on the dealer’s annual gross business. “It apparently is a part of the policy of the Legislature of Pennsylvania in fostering industry to reserve to itself the taxation of manufacturing in all of its phases. The 1949 amendment in prohibiting the taxation of <em>‘any </em>privilege, act or transaction <em>related </em>to the business of manufacturing’ is a manifestation of that policy.” <em>Heinz, </em>supra, at 440. Like <em>Isaly, </em>these two cases dealt with taxes directly affecting the “business of manufacturing”. The cases are agreed that taxes levied at any stage of production are not permitted by the act. An occupation tax on farmers, however, has no direct bearing on the production, preparation and processing of farm products. <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>Taxes based on sales volume or net profits, however, do have a direct effect on the cost of each product.

The court responded: “There might be some validity to this argument had the legislature specifically authorized an income tax by name in that part of the section which authorized the imposition of the tax. But it did not. It authorized a tax on ‘persons, actions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property’, without reference to income.” <em>Fischer, </em>supra, at 25.
