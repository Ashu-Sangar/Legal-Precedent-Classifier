Near the close <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>of the Commonwealth’s case, the prosecution introduced into evidence two confessions whose existence was unknown to both of appellant’s counsel until that very moment. Defense counsel thereupon requested a recess, conferred with their client briefly in the court ante-room, then returned to announce that the plea would be changed to guilty. Subsequently, appellant was found guilty of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to life imprisonment. No direct appeal was taken.</p>

He filed a total of eight, all of which were dismissed without hearing. Finally, in 1965 appellant filed his ninth pro se petition. This one went undecided for over a year, before it was finally dismissed; in its stead was substituted a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. Counsel was appointed, and an evidentiary hearing held. Appellant contended that his guilty plea was motivated by an involuntary confession, and that the plea itself was not knowingly and intelligently entered. Relief was denied and appellant appealed to this Court.</p>

This was done, resulting in appellant having two cases before us at the same time. Accordingly, counsel petitioned this Court to have Johnson’s first appeal continued, alleging that the second one, involving solely an alleged violation of appellate rights under <em>Douglas v.

The court below quite permissibly rejected Johnson’s tale of drugged hamburgers and coffee, especially given the testimony of one of the original interrogating officers, who stated at the collateral hearing that he had purchased all the food consumed during the interrogation session, that he observed it being prepared, and that no drugs were placed in any of the hamburgers or cups of coffee. In fact, the officer testified that he himself was going to eat the food which appellant eventually ate, but that Johnson took it when the officer briefly left the room.</p>

He, apparently to me has no conception of the danger which has been hanging over him during the past few days. He seems to me to be in that state of mind that he can be of little help to counsel in his defense.

Although we indicated that this statement, together with the reports of four examining physicians, could be enough to vitiate a guilty plea, <em>Eilberry </em>in no way controls this case. Hilberry’s marginal mental condition was verified by four different medical doctors, all of whom placed the defendant’s mental age between 8 and 12 years. One of the four, the only psychiatrist in the group, even reported that Hilberry was unable to tell right from wrong.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> By contrast, the present appellant was the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>subject of a sanity commission report dated only a month before his trial.

Finally, we note that the remarks of the trial judge were made primarily to justify his “merciful” life sentence in the face of an atrocious crime (victim was a 94 year old woman who was strangled during an apparent robbery attempt) which was the subject of great public attention in the small community where it occurred.</p>

According to appellant, the conference in the ante-room lasted only a few minutes. Both counsel expressed the strong view that unless appellant changed his plea, he would receive the death sentence. Although Johnson admits that the thought of a death penalty frightened him, he steadfastly maintains that he never consented to the entry of a plea. When he was asked at the hearing below why he did not object when counsel formally entered the plea for him, appellant testified that because he misunderstood the nature of a guilty plea, he mistakenly believed that his lawyers had the right to enter the plea even against his will in light of the confessions, and further that the plea could result in a conviction of only murder in the second degree.</p>

Although appellant testified on direct examination that he did not comprehend the meaning or nature of a guilty plea, he admitted on cross-examination that he had previously pled guilty in 1940 to crimes of larceny and burglary. Johnson confessed that in 1940 he <em>did </em>understand the plea of guilty to mean that the pleader was telling the court that he had in fact committed the crime charged. Furthermore, Johnson told of having had past experiences in pleading not guilty. (Post Conviction Hearing Record at 266-69.) We find it difficult to believe, just as the court below found it difficult, that appellant could know so much about guilty pleas in 1940, yet forget it all. 14 years later, especially given the fact that 12 of those 14 years were spent in custody, where talk of legal phrases and concepts so permeates the atmosphere.</p>

As he recalled appellant’s trial, after the initial shock of hearing the Commonwealth introduce the confessions into evidence, and after objecting unsuccessfully to their admission, he requested a recess. According to counsel’s version, the ensuing ante-room conference lasted approximately <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>fifteen minutes, during which time the nature of the guilty plea was explained to appellant, as well as the distinct possibility of a death sentence if the case went to the jury. It was counsel’s recollection that Johnson consented to the plea because of Ms fear of the electric chair. Appellant's story about his lack of consent was flatly contradicted by tills attorney who testified that at no time during the conference did Johnson voice any disagreement, with the decision to change the plea. He concluded his testimony by saying that under no circumstances would he have entered a guilty plea for his client without having first secured appellant’s consent. On the basis of this testimony, as well as the admissions of appellant himself, we conclude that Johnson did know the meaning of a guilty plea, and that the decision to enter this plea was in fact his own choice, not one forced upon him by counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> As such, this plea comports with the “personal participation” requirements of this Court, <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

This becomes even more obvious when the conclusions of the commission are studied. The broad language used would support not only a finding that appellant could aid in his own defense, but also that he had sufficient contact with reality to make his confessions voluntary. One of the examining physicians reported: “This man [appellant] is not psychotic and is therefore responsible for his own behavior.... While his intelligence is probably low, it is within the average range.” The other doctor stated: “At no time do I find any concrete evidence that Mr. Johnson was ever psychotic or insane---He is sane medically, knows the difference between right and wrong and the serious nature of his crimes.” Ifinally the attorney on the commission said of appellant: “the defendant is a confirmed criminal of lower than average intelligence, but . . . the defendant is not a mental defective, neither is he a moron, idiot or imbecile.”</p>

Grays maintained that he pleaded guilty because he was told of an improper “deal” made between the judge and defense counsel that a plea would result in a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. (Grays eventually was found guilty of murder in the first degree.) Petitioner also testified that he had been promised a new trial if a sentence greater than six years was imposed. Petitioner’s wife testified that she had been told by counsel that a new trial could only be obtained if her husband pleaded guilty and was convicted. On a not guilty plea, no new trial could be obtained. Even though the Commonwealth offered no testimony to rebut these versions of the plea, relief was denied because the hearing judge did not believe either Grays or his wife. In affirming this denial, we specifically rejected appellant’s contention, that “where the prisoner’s testimony is sufficient, if believed, to constitute the basis for a finding that his plea was not constitutionally valid, the burden shifts to the Commonwealth to rebut this testimony upon penalty of issuance of the writ.” 428 Pa. at 111, 237 A. 2d at 200.</p>

Actually, we agreed to hear appellant’s guilty plea arguments, rather than remand immediately for a <em>Douglas </em>hearing, <em>only </em>because a finding that the plea was invalid would have necessitated a new trial thus mooting the alleged denial of the right to appeal.
