Dr. Samuel B. Hadden, Board certified psychiatrist and neurologist, testified for Dr. Hand that electroshock therapy is recognized treatment for manic-depression, that fractures are a recognized risk of such therapy and that neither old age nor osteoporosis contraindicates the administration of such therapy. Dr. Deichelmann,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> also testifying for Dr. Hand, opined that the acetabular fractures occurred as a result of equal bilateral muscular reaction which pulled the hip bones on either side with such force that the acetabulae were fractured. He stated his experience was such that fractures did occur and it is impossible to predict when the muscles will react in such a manner as to cause fractures. Appellee relies heavily on Dr. Deichelmann’s testimony that this muscle contraction can be prevented if a muscle relaxant is used. However, Dr. van der Meer testified that the muscle contraction caused by application of electrical impulses is itself part of the treatment.8 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Indeed, it is fairly obvious that appellee’s whole theory of the cause of the acetabular fractures was the application of too much restraint on her legs during the electroshock therapy by the shock team at Eugenia and the testimony elicited from her own witnesses was calculated to minimize the effect of the osteoporosis.

Dr. Tomasco, who later treated Miss Collins for the fractures, testified that this was proper treatment. He also said: “A. As I tried to explain, in this particular type of fracture, we were mostly interested in the soft tissues that surround the hip joints. We were not too interested — I found there was no locking, or there were no lockings into the hip joints that would require surgery, so that all the treatment was diverted to the soft tissue. This woman showed she had motion in her hip joints, and when it developed that she had muscle spasm, it was mostly training her to walk.

It is argued that Miss Collins’ blood pressure wras only taken three times showing no real concern on this iwint and when she was admitted to Eugenia her pressure actually lowered. However, at the time of her admission to Eugenia, the reports show two different blood pressure readings, one of which was very high. At any rate, Dr. Hand explained that Miss Collins’ high blood pressure was <em>only one </em>of the factors he considered in deciding upon her course of treatment. As to the risk of suicide, appellee argues from the testimony of Dr. van der Meer that suicide is only a risk to a manic-depressive who is psychotic and nowhere is there any testimony that Miss Collins was psychotic. Further, it is argued that Dr. Hand admitted there was no <em>immediate </em>risk of suicide. We agree that there was no showing of <em>immediate </em>risk of suicide, but this was not the problem. Concern was over the possibility of suicide. Furthermore, manic depression actually is <em>a </em>psychosis. See: Hinsie and Campbell, Psychiatric Dictionary, 3d ed. (1960). Moreover, Dr. van der Meer himself testified that electroshock would considerably shorten the hospitalization of a <em>manic-depressive </em>and, as previously noted, <em>Dr. </em>Hadden also testified that electroshock treatment is standard treatment for a “manic-depressive state, agitated.”</p>

You say you are sta<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>tioned behind the head of the patient or top of the head? A. Ves, I am at the head of the bed, and there is an attendant on either side approximately at the chest of the patient <em>. ... Q. </em>What do the aides do? What are they directed to do? A. One of the aides is directed to insert the rubber mouthpiece and hold the jaw firmly so that the mouthpiece cannot be pushed out and also to hold cotton on the arm, where I have injected the medication. The other aide has her hand on the shoulder and the other hand on the hand or head of the patient, depending.” Mrs. Laura Succino, a registered nurse in charge of the electroshock treatment room at Eugenia in 1959, testified: “Q. When the patient, particularly Julia Collins, was on the bed, was she strapped down by any straps or anything like that? A. No. We never applied any straps, Q. Were there any canvas straps or restraints upon her person? A. No straps were applied. Q. With respect to her extremities, were they held down or restrained in any fashion? A. No.”</p>
