On that date and for some time prior thereto, Trailways had a contract with Walso Bureau, Inc. (Walso), an investigating and security agency, to provide security guards for Trailways’ bus terminal. On that date and for some months prior thereto, Walso had in its employ one Kenneth Steinberg as a security guard, his place of duty being the same bus terminal at which Dempsey was a dispatcher.</p>

Steinberg pulled Dempsey out of' his chair, bent him over backwards and pinioned him, with his knee in Dempsey’s back, for several minutes despite Dempsey’s protests. Allegedly, by reason of Steinberg’s actions, Dempsey sustained severe personal injuries.</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[212,721,1155,531]]]'>To recover damages for his injuries, Dempsey instituted a trespass action in Court of Common Pleas No. 10 of Philadelphia County against Walso. Upon issue joined, the- matter was heard before the court without a jury and, after hearing, the court dismissed Dempsey’s complaint and directed the entry of a judgment in favor of Walso and against Dempsey. Upon dismissal of exceptions to this order by the court en banc, judgment was entered and the instant appeal was taken.</p>

On the contrary, Dempsey’s theory of liability is that, by reason of Stein-berg’s conduct on various occasions prior to April 6, Walso knew or, by the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of Steinberg’s dangerous propensity for violence and should not have continued him in its employ and, moreover, Walso, before hiring Stein-berg, did- not exercise reasonable care in its selection and should not have hired a person inclined to violence. . ..</p>

This Court approved a jury instruction which stated that it was the railroad’s duty to employ careful and prudent conductors and, if the railroad employed a person as conductor whom it <em>knew </em>to be careless, the fact that the railroad employed such a conductor or continued such conductor <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>in employment after learning of his carelessness would constitute negligence on the railroad’s part.

The theory upon which it was sought to fasten liability on the railways company was that the motorman, a three-year employee, was incompetent and careless and that such incompetency and carelessness was known or, under the circumstances, should have been known to the railways company if reasonable and ordinary care had been exercised. While we reversed a verdict against the company because of the introduction into evidence of certain prejudicial and incompetent testimony, we approved the charge of the trial court that it was encumbent on the part of the plaintiff not only to prove incompetency and carelessness on the part of the motorman prior to the accident but also to prove that the railways company knew or had reason to know of such incompetency or carelessness on the part of the motorman.

Rptr. 146</a> (1961), that Court well stated the basic rule: “The cases hold that the knowing <em>employment </em>of a dangerous employee who inflicts injury upon a fellow employee constitutes a common law tort on the part of the employer. Indeed the employer railroad at common law owed a duty to its employees to use ‘reasonable care ... in the selection of competent fellow servants and in the retention in his service of none but those who are . . . .’ [citing authorities]. More<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>over, ‘there could be no difference whether the injury result from negligence in doing the master’s work, or from an assault made by a dangerous, drunken and desperate employe, if his reputation was such that the master might reasonably have foreseen such consequences. [citing an authority].’” In that case, the employee of the railroad, who was known to be quarrelsome and quick-tempered as well as a “drinking man,” assaulted a fellow employee. The court considered two questions: (1) whether the railroad was negligent in “employing and retaining” the assaulter, and (2) whether the acts of the employee could be imputed to the railroad. Denying liability on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>the court submitted the case to the jury on the theory of the employer’s negligent hiring and retention of the employee. Other authorities, including the Sestatements of Agency and Torts, recognize. the employer’s duty as to the proper selection of his employees. Section 213 of Restatement 2d, Agency, states: “A person conducting an activity through servants or other agents is subject to liability for harm resulting from his conduct if he is negligent or reckless: . . . (b) in the employment of improper persons. . . .” The comment under that section declares further: “An agent, although otherwise competent, may be incompetent because of his reckless or vicious disposition, and, if a principal, without exercising due care in selection, employs a vicious person to do an act which necessarily brings him in contact with others while in the performance of a duty, he is subject to liability for harm caused by the vicious propensity. . . .” (pp. 158, 159) (Emphasis added).</p>

In <em>Dolan, </em>supra, wherein an employee of a restaurant had been assaulted by a fellow-employee, the theory of liability was bottomed on Section 317; the employer, by way of preliminary objections, questioned the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the action, contending that Dolan’s remedy was limited exclusively to that provided by the Workmen’s Compensation Act; we reversed the order of the court below which had sustained the employer’s position and held that, if the injured employee could amend Ids complaint to show that his assailant was performing his duties when the attack took place and that the attack was for personal reasons, the injured employee would have a valid cause of action cognizable in a common pleas court. In <em>McBride, </em>an employee, injured by an assault by a fellow-employee, sued and recovered a verdict against the employer and we held that, if the attack had been motivated by personal animosity, <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>the employee had a common law remedy and, there being evidence that the attack had its origin in personal animosity and that the employer had knowledge or notice of the likelihood that the employee might attack his fellow-employee, the verdict should stand.</p>

    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[186,1101,1157,597]]]'>Even though Steinberg’s conduct prior to April 6 could be equated with conduct showing propensity for violence, there is no evidence of record to show either knowledge or reason for knowledge on the part of Walso of Steinberg’s conduct. Dempsey takes the two-fold position that Walso, prior to the employment of Stein-berg, was negligent in making an insufficient investigation into Steinberg’s past before employing him and that Walso was also negligent in not properly supervising Steinberg and ascertaining the manner in which he was conducting himself on the terminal premises.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[179,1710,1159,654]],["BL_601.1",601,[181,386,1148,546]]]'>The record indicates that, before hiring Steinberg, Mr. Rulli, Walso’s president, contacted an employment agency, previously used by Walso and known to Mr. Rulli to be a reliable agency, and, in that maimer, secured an application for employment from Steinberg. An interview between Steinberg and Mr. Rulli then took place in the course of which the latter inquired into Steinberg’s background. Mr. Rulli further checked with two of Steinberg’s previous employers, the police, both city and state, and the District Attorney’s office in Philadelphia, and, after receiving no information indicating Steinberg was guilty of any prior miscon<a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>duct, and, only after such investigation, Steinberg was hired. The real difficulty in the position taken by Dempsey that Walso was negligent in not fully investigating Steinberg’s past prior to hiring him is that there is absolutely no evidence that, had there been a more extensive and exhaustive investigation, such investigation would have revealed some improper actions or misconduct in Steinberg’s past. So far as the instant record reveals, prior to Walso’s hiring of Stein-berg, Steinberg’s past was exemplary.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[181,942,1147,1152]]]'>The next position taken by Dempsey also lacks merit. It is contended that, because of the nature of Steinberg’s duties — a “sensitive position” — the fact that Steinberg was permitted to use a night stick and that he “was in a position to inflict injury upon others”, Walso should have supervised Steinberg more closely. Mr. Eulli personally spent about fifteen hours weekly at the terminal, although his observation of Steinberg encompassed only about one hour of such weekly time: periodic reports from bus terminal officials to Walso up until April 6 did not reveal any misconduct on Steinberg’s part; Mr. Eulli never received any report, verbal or written, from any person connected with the operation of the terminal concerning Steinberg’s actions and, when the incident of April 6 was reported, Steinberg was immediately discharged. We find in this record no evidence that Walso either knew or had reason to know of any actions on the part of Steinberg which indicated a propensity for violence and, absent such knowledge or reason for knowledge, liability cannot be fastened upon Walso.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[181,2105,1145,210]]]'>Lastly, it is contended that the trial court erred in rejecting certain evidence during the trial. We have carefully examined the trial record and find no error committed by the trial court in this respect.</p>
