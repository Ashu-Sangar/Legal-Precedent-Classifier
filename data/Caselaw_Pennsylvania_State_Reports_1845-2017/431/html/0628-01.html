He was tried and convicted on Bill No. 26, plead guilty to the charges on Bill No. 27, and was given consecutive sentences of ten to twenty years on each bill. These sentences were later vacated and appellant sentenced to life imprisonment under the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §1108(b), 18 P.S. §5108(b). In 1964 a petition for habeas corpus was granted revoking the life sentence; appellant was then resentenced, receiving consecutive sentences of six to twelve years on Bill No. 27 (the guilty plea) and six to twenty years on Bill No. 26 (the trial).</p>

In holding that petitioner in <em>Hamilton </em>was entitled to counsel at his arraignment, the Supreme Court noted that an Alabama arraignment, per se, was always a “critical stage” requiring the assistance of counsel because, under Alabama law, certain defenses must be raised at the arraignment or be forever unavailable to the defendant. The crucial fact in <em>Hamilton </em>however was not that petitioner was without counsel at an arraignment, but rather that he was without counsel at an arraignment which was a <em>critical stage </em>in the criminal proceeding. Of course, the Court in <em>Hamilton </em>did not have to face the issue of whether an arraignment or preliminary hearing could amount to something less than a “critical stage.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

However, the Supreme Court did hold that the particular hearing in <em>White </em>was critical because, just as in the present case, an uncounseled defendant entered a plea of guilty at the preliminary hearing which was later withdrawn, yet still introduced into evidence at trial. In so deciding the Court said: “We therefore hold that Hamilton v. Alabama governs . . . .” <a href="/us/373/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="373 U.S. 59" data-case-ids="11716498" data-case-paths="/us/373/0059-01">373 U.S. at 60</a>, <a href="/us/373/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="373 U.S. 59" data-case-ids="11716498" data-case-paths="/us/373/0059-01">83 S.

Although the Commonwealth in the present case concedes, as it must, the retroactivity of <em>Hamilton, </em>it. argues that this does not affect the. retroactivity of <em>White, </em>because <em>Hamilton </em>involved only the peculiar Alabama arraignment procedure.

The real holding of <em>Hamilton </em>is that <em>any </em>arraignment or preliminary hearing which amounts to a critical stage requires the presence of counsel. <em>White </em>merely holds that the particular hearing in that case meets the critical stage test set forth in <em>Hamilton. </em>In fact, <em>White </em>specifically says that its holding is “governed” by <em>Hamilton. </em>It follows inexorably therefore that since <em>Hamilton </em>is retroactive, <em>White </em>must be.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The right of every individual to have the aid of counsel in making the difficult and complex journey down the path of criminal court procedure is one that has always been held retroactive. The retroactivity of both <em>Gideon </em>and <em>Douglas </em>rest upon the proposition that so fundamental is the right to counsel that its absence at any point after the judicial machinery has begun to operate upon the accused can have extremely deleterious effects upon the truth determining process itself. Whenever the accused enters a courtroom, he it <em>presided </em>over by magistrate or judge so long as what transpires in that <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>courtroom becomes a critical stage in the proceeding counsel must be at the defendant’s side unless knowingly and intelligently waived.</p>

For this reason, it became necessary for this Court in <em>Padgett </em>to undertake our own review to determine whether violation of <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a>, <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">84 S. Ct. 1758</a> (1964), could be harmless. In making this review, one of the guidelines used to pass upon the harmless error-automatic reversal question was whether retroactive effect had been given to the right whose violation was claimed to be harmless. The reason for this test was the well-founded notion that those rights whose violation tends to have the greatest adverse effect on the reliability of the guilt determining process have traditionally been the rights given retroactive effect, for example the right to counsel or the right to have coerced confessions excluded from evidence. Similarly, it was felt by this Court that these same rights are so basic that their violation could not be considered harmless. Applying this barometer of retroactivity to the possible harmlessness of a <em>White </em>violation, since <em>White </em>is retroactive, so also do we hold its violation to be grounds for automatic reversal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a>

For example, in Pennsylvania a preliminary hearing is that same proceeding which in Alabama is called an arraignment. It is a hearing before a magistrate, alderman, etc., at which time it is determined whether there <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>exists a prima facie case sufficient to hold defendant pending indictment by the grand jury. As <em>White </em>and the present case demonstrate, pleas of guilty are sometimes entered at this hearing. Of course, Pennsylvania does not <em>require </em>a plea to be entered at the preliminary hearing. Accordingly, unless such a plea is entered, or something else done at the hearing which later prejudices defendant, the preliminary hearing will not be considered a critical stage requiring the assistance of counsel.
