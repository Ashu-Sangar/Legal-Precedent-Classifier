The Commonwealth places itself in sort of a dilemma; if the “interpretation” of the taxing statute was so well settled, the Commonwealth, by its settlement of Bethlehem’s tax reports based upon another “interpretation” of the statute, permitted Bethlehem to overpay its taxes; on the other hand, if there was no such established “interpretation”, then Bethlehem’s “interpretation” later became erroneous only when this Court so declared such error in <em>Com. v.

The <em>Koppers </em>case dealt only with the propriety of including certain proceeds in the makeup of the fraction, not with the question of whether gross or net proceeds were to be used; in fact, it referred to the earlier cases noted above as holding that gross proceeds were the proper measure to be used when dealing with receipts from the sale of securities.</p>

    <p id="b40-4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[185,644,1160,1303]]]'>I am in agreement with the other determination of the majority. In holding that Bethlehem cannot rely upon payments made within two years of the filing of the refund petitions when such payments were made only as a result of changes in its federal net income, the opinion is clearly correct. Section 503(a) (1) of “The Fiscal Code” speaks of petitions for refund of taxes “the payment of which refund is requested.” Surely, no refund here is requested of the additional taxes paid as a result of a change in federal net (now taxable) income; nor can I conceive of such a request since such a change is mechanical and raises no substantive issue. Furthermore, this conclusion is the only reasonable view of the matter in light of the time lag which may occur between the filing of a return and its settlement, on the one hand, and a federal audit and change on the other. This time lag may well stretch for ten years. I cannot conceive • of then exposing the Commonwealth to all forms of refund claims following a report of change, such claims being based on issues unrelated to the report of damages. I would hold that the Board of Finance and Revenue properly denied Bethlehem’s petitions for refund and lack of timely filing and affirm the Board’s action.</p>

Apparently, the majority has decided that the error upon which the refund is predicated must be causally connected with the payments involved and that, since the 1957 payments resulted from a change in Bethlehem’s net income for federal tax purposes rather than a change connected with the alleged erroneously computed gross receipts allocation fraction, the requisite causal connection is lacking. I cannot agree for I can find no requirement in either our cases or the statute itself of a causal connection. Certainly, had the Legislature intended such a requirement, it could have easily so specified; the statute, however, employs the word “payment” unmodified by any requirement that the payment be connected to the error supporting the refund claim. The majority tells us that this statute “affords a striking illustration of the exercise by the Commonwealth of its conscience and, in line with the legislative motivation, should be liberally construed.” If such is the case, I submit that a liberal construction (or, for that matter, even a grudging construction) impels the conclusion that the payment need not be connected to the alleged error.</p>

In both of these decisions, as in this litigation, the taxpayer’s state tax liability was modified by virtue of a change in its net taxable federal income. However, in <em>Lukens Steel </em>and <em>Abrasive </em>the taxpayer contended that the change in its net taxable federal income allowed it to recompute all of the calculations employed to determine the allocation fraction. Since in both cases the time for resettlement had passed, we held that a wholesale resettlement of all calculations was not permissible. These cases do not hold, as the Commonwealth suggests, that a refund is not obtainable even though payments have been made within the two year period. In fact, if after the time for resettlement had passed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> a refund could no longer be obtained, then the refund provisions would have no function for the limitations period would be that contained in the resettlement sections.</p>
