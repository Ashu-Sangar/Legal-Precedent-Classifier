All three were apprehended the next day in Harrisburg and on November 18, 1958 all three appeared in court. Petitioner and Kenneth John Wagner were without counsel; Paul Custalow had retained Attorney Thomas Gill to represent him. At the outset of the hearing the following colloquy took place: “The Court : Q. Do either of you gentlemen desire counsel? A. By Mr. Wagner: No, sir. By Mr. Ritchey: No, sir. Q. You understand that you are entitled to Counsel if you would like to have it? A. By Mr. Wagner: No. By Mr. Ritchey: No. The Court : Let the record show that Mr. Gill, Attorney for <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>Mr. Custalow, explained to all three of the defendants their Constitutional rights and right of Counsel. Would you please do that, Mr. Gill? (Mr. Gill consults with all three defendants and then states to the court that the defendants, Mr. Wagner and Mr. Ritchey, have indicated that they do not desire counsel.)” The indictments were then handed to the defendants and written pleas of guilty were entered thereon by each defendant.

And as a first principle, the court must make certain that the accused understands the full dimensions of the right. It cannot be assumed <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>that the accused understands any element of the right which has not been explicitly explained. For example, in the instant case petitioner was told only that he was “entitled to counsel.” A careful examination of the record has failed to establish any evidence which would lead us to conclude that appellant was ever informed that he was entitled to <em>free </em>counsel. The trial judge instructed the attorney for Ritchey’s co-defendant to explain the right of counsel to appellant. The content of this explanation does not appear of record nor was Mr. Gill able to recall whether the exact nature of the right to counsel was ever discussed. His testimony was: [By the District Attorney] : “Q. Mr. Gill, do you remember what discussion you had with Mr. Ritchey in particular, as to his constitutional rights and his right to any attorney? A. I cannot remember, Mr. Harris, any specific wording or the extent of the discussion. It took place, I am not too sure, here in the court room, at the counsel table after an explanation had already been given and an offer made by the court to the two defendants that were not represented by counsel, to provide them with counsel, at the request of the court, I made a further more private explanation of this, that is in a conversation between myself and the two individuals but as I say, I am reasonably sure it was at the counsel table. It was a fairly brief discussion, but sufficient to satisfy myself that they apparently were making an informed decision and statement to me which I then repeated to the Court that they did not desire counsel. Q. Mr. Gill, do you hear Mr. Ritchey’s testimony here today that all of . . . all you told him was that he had a right to counsel? A. Yes sir. Q. Does your recollection include that you told him more than just that? A. I can’t say specifically but I would say probably the conversation was a little more longer than that state<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>ment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Record of 1965 Habeas Corpus Proceeding, pp. 24-25.</p>

Ordinarily, in cases where the post-conviction hearing pre-dated our <em>Wilson </em>decision, we would remand tlie proceeding to allow the Commonwealth to meet this burden if it could. But no such remand is necessary in the present case since the transcript of the hearing clearly demonstrates that counsel for appellant’s co-defendant (the only man in a position to tell appellant of his rights) could not specifically recall what he told appellant during the short conference prior to the entry of the guilty plea.
