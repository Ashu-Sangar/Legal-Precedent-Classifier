    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[169,1699,1152,637]]]'>The crime arose out of a robbery of a drug store in Philadelphia by Harris, Harry Johnson and Willie Odom; eighteen, sixteen and fourteen years of age respectively. Harris was armed with a revolver given him by another youth some time before. Odom remained outside as a lookout. As Harris and Johnson entered the store and announced “this is a hold-up, let’s have the money,” the proprietor became frightened and started to run away. Johnson then yelled to Harris “shoot him.” Harris immediately shot one bullet from the revolver into the proprietor’s back, which caused his death.</p>

He was shuttled from one school to another and finally “dropped” permanently in 1950, when he was sixteen years old and enrolled in the sixth grade. This course of action was pursued by the school authorities following such a recommendation by the school’s supervisor of mental examinations and the receipt of the results of psychological tests indicating Harris was a “mental defective” with a mental age of eight years and an intelligence quotient of forty-nine.</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[189,984,1158,372]]]'>Prior to trial, Harris was examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist. He found that Harris’ “judgment was poor and there was no guarantee that he would not be subject to impulses over which he would have no control.” He also reported that Harris was a “moron” with sub-normal intelligence and lacking ability “to think intellectually in any degree.”</p>
