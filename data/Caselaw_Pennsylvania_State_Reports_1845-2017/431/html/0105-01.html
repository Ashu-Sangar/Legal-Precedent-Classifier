This contention was flatly contradicted by Payton’s trial, counsel" who testified at the post-conviction hearing that he and his client had discussed the possibility of an appeal, but that appellant never requested that such action be taken. Trial counsél also testified that he specifically informed appellant of the right to file new trial motions.</p>
