In 1963, he met the victim, Sylvia Jackson, and lived with her thereafter as man and wife, although they were never legally married. She was known as and represented by Cooney as his <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>wife, and bore a child by him who was six months of age at the time of her death. After living in California for a brief time, Cooney and Sylvia returned to live at the home of her parents in the City of Chester. On December 31, 1966, Cooney and Sylvia went to Philadelphia to attend a New Year’s Eve celebration, where both had been drinking. They returned home at 4 A.M., rang the doorbell because neither had a key, and were let in by Sylvia’s mother, Jennie Jackson. Mrs. Jackson testified that when she let the couple in, Cooney did not say anything, but “acted like he was mad.” Cooney and Sylvia went upstairs to their bedroom, and shortly thereafter Mrs. Jackson, who was in an adjoining bedroom, heard Sylvia whisper, “Don’t do that, don’t do that, don’t do that,” which was immediately followed by three shots. Mrs. Jackson and her husband, Arthur Jackson, who was also in the adjoining bedroom and who also heard the three gunshots, ran into Sylvia and Cooney’s bedroom and saw their daughter and Cooney lying on the floor. Jackson testified that he sat down on the bed and picked his daughter up in his arms “trying to make her live. I wanted to make her live.” He further testified that Cooney, although continuing to lie on the floor, was conscious and had looked up at him. A gun, which was used in the shooting, and which was found on the bed approximately six feet away from Cooney, had been acquired by Cooney some years before in connection with his service as a policeman.</p>

He said it “frightened me and I leaped at her — like this — for the gun.” When he tried to yank the gun from her hand, the gun went off. There was an “explosion,” he felt pain, and he did not recall what hap<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>pened thereafter until he “woke up” at the police station.

Pavillard, </em><a href="/pa/421/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="421 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1900334" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0571-01">421 Pa. 571</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20807" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="220 A.2d 807">220 A. 2d 807</a>. Cooney’s attorney now contends that, by so charging, the trial Judge placed the burden of this defense on the defendant. There is absolutely no merit in this contention. Not only was the charge correct, but the trial Judge after charging on misadventure specifically charged the jury that “the burden [of proof] is with the Commonwealth throughout the trial of the case.”</p>
