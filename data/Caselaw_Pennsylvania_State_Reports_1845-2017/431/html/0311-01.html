The lower court further held that when a joint tenant, without the consent of the other joint tenant, makes a very large withdrawal from a joint account, this action terminates the joint tenancy and creates a tenancy in common. On the basis of this reasoning, the lower court held that: (1) the creation by Hazel of a joint checking account between herself and Bethel on October 20, 1959, was a valid gift inter vivos; (2) the portion of the Public School Employes’ Retirement Fund which consisted of individual contributions by Hazel was properly paid to Bethel as the duly designated beneficiary, but that the portion of the fund attributable to the contributions of her employer and the Commonwealth should be awarded to the estate of the decedent since the latter occurred during the period of confidential relationship; (3) the reissued IT. S. Savings Bonds having a maturity value of <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>$20,400 should be returned to the estate along with any income received thereon, since this transaction also occurred during the period of confidential relationship; (4) one-half of the U. S. Savings Bonds having a maturity value of $20,000 and one-half of the 300 shares of common stock of Western Pennsylvania National Bank were to be held in constructive trust for the benefit of decedent’s estate, and (5) Bethel was to further account for one-half of all income received thereon, including stock splits, etc., from the date of purchase to the date of accounting. The lower court further ordered that Bethel be entitled to one-half of the remaining funds in the joint checking account after the checks drawn on the account were deducted, since Bethel’s withdrawal of the funds worked a severance of the joint tenancy in said account.</p>

There is little, if any, evidence on the record to indicate that during the period of confidential relationship as determined by the lower court Hazel’s mental condition deteriorated to such an extent that Bethel could have exerted an overmastering influence upon her in the conduct of her business affairs. The great preponderance of the evidence in<a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>dicates that although Hazel was weakening physically, she remained mentally alert until the day she died. The testimony of her fellow teachers, her minister, her housekeeper, her nurse during her last days and her niece and nephew, among others, indicates that Hazel knew what she was doing at all times. This being the case, we find that Hazel remained mentally competent until her death.</p>

We believe that this is the proper test to be applied in the instant case. Although Hazel was weakening physically, she nevertheless remained mentally competent, and was fully aware of the consequences of her acts. Thus Hazel knew what she was doing when she signed the forms for the re-issuance of the bonds and for the change of the beneficiary of her retirement fund. In view of these circumstances, we are of the opinion that Bethel was not in a position to exert such an overmastering influence upon Hazel and that Hazel was not so dependent upon Bethel so as to create a confidential relationship between the two sisters.</p>
