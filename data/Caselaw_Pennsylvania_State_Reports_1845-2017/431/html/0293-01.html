    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[198,474,1148,374]]]'>On October 21, 1966, appellant filed an election to take against his wife’s will, in spite of his covenant not to do so. Upon a petition to show cause why the election should not be vacated, the Orphans’ Court, after a hearing, struck off the election, because of the above-recited antenuptial agreement. From the Order of the Orphans’ Court, the husband took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b325-6" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[201,858,1148,643]]]'>The law with respect to antenuptial agreements has been so recently reviewed and restated in <em>Hillegass Estate, </em><a href="/pa/431/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="431 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1917381" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0144-01">431 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20672" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="244 A.2d 672">244 A. 2d 672</a>, that it will suffice if we merely restate that part which is most <em>pertinent </em>to this case. The antenuptial agreement is presumptively valid and binding upon both parties, and since the surviving husband contended that he entered into the agreement because of misrepresentations of her property by his intended wife, the burden to prove material nondisclosure and thus overcome the presumption of validity and full and fair disclosure was upon the surviving husband.</p>
    <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[205,1512,1149,807]]]'>Prior to the <em>April 21, 1959 </em>antenuptial agreement, deceased had consulted her then counsel, Roland J. Christy, and he prepared for her an antenuptial agreement to which was appended a schedule of her assets, which included $87,000 in securities. This antenuptial agreement was never executed, but a copy of it, <em>without the schedule attached, </em>was taken by the deceased to the April 21, 1959 meeting with her intended husband at Campbell’s office. The antenuptial agreement which the parties executed on April 21, 1959 is substantially identical with that drawn for the deceased by her counsel, Roland J. Christy, except that a provision in the Christy-drawn agreement providing for waiver of the defense of nondisclosure was omitted from the agreement executed by the parties.</p>

Campbell was permitted to testify as to exactly what happened at the two meetings which the parties held at his office, the latter being the meeting on April 21, 1959, when the antenuptial agreement was executed. Appellee contends, based on the Dead Man’s Act, P. L. 158 (1887), 28 P.S. §322, that Campbell was not a competent witness. There is no merit in this contention; the authorities hold that the scrivener of an antenuptial agreement is permitted to testify for or against the estate as to transactions which occurred with the decedent unless <em>the scrivener's interest, </em>as distinguished from his testimony, is adverse to the decedent’s estate: <em>Gelb Estate, </em><a href="/pa/425/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="425 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1906764" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0117-01">425 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=228%20A.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="228 A.2d 367">228 A. 2d 367</a>.
