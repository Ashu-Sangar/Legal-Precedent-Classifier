Barrett (hereinafter the Claimant) petitioned the Workmen’s Compensation Board (hereinafter Board) for an award in accordance with the provisions of The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act, the Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, 77 P.S. §1 et seq., alleging that he had incurred a disability as the result of an accident which occurred in the course of his employment for Otis Elevator Company (hereinafter the Employer). After considering the conflicting testimony of four medical doctors, the Board found that the claimant was totally disabled from December 8, 1961, to March 10, 1962, and 40 per cent disabled for an indefinite period thereafter. The claimant excepted to the Board’s finding that his disability was only partial after March 10, 1962, and he appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County. On remand from that court, the Board clarified and reaffirmed its finding and the claimant again appealed. The Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County dismissed the appeal on the ground that the challenged finding does not capriciously disregard competent evidence. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam, without opinion. This Court then granted allocatur. On September 26, 1967, we filed an opinion affirming the lower courts. Thereafter, we granted a petition for reargument to reconsider the question of whether or <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>not the Board’s finding of partial disability should be sustained in the light of the decisions in <em>Kirk v.

The Board found that the employee was only partially disabled, granted the employer’s petition, and the employee appealed. Thus, the question on the appeal by the employee, who did not have the burden of proof, was whether or not the finding that he was partially disabled was supported by competent evidence. On the other hand, in this case the claimant concedes, with reference to this objection to the finding, that he has the burden of proof and he recognizes that, consequently, the standard of review is whether or not the Board capriciously disregarded competent evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

A finding that is completely unsupported by competent evidence does not capriciously disregard competent evidence if there is not competent evidence to support a contrary finding. Actually the claimant’s argument echoes a confusion which both the Superior Court and this Court have attempted frequently to dispel. Thus, the Superior Court has said: “Where the compensation authorities have found against the party having the burden of proof, in this case the claimant, the question on appeal is not whether the findings of fact are supported by sufficient competent evidence but rather whether there has been a capricious disregard of the competent evidence . . . .” <em>Bogan v.

The employer responds that in <em>Petrone </em>the finding that the claimant was partially disabled was rejected because it rested on the ability of the claimant to do only light work of a general nature and on the economically unrealistic presumption that such work is available to someone capable of performing it. The employer argues that because the finding of partial disability in this case does not rest on the claimant’s ability to do only light work of a general nature and on the rejected presumption, but rather on his ability to do any type of work, <em>Petrone </em>is not controlling.</p>

To intelligently resolve this issue, the fact to be proven must be closely analyzed with reference to the considerations which underlie the apportionment of burden of proof.

Given that a preponderance of the evidence is all that is required, the proof of a negative does not appear so difficult that <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>the burden of proof should be placed on the party who wishes to establish the affirmative.</p>

There does not appear to be a “bright line” dividing light work of a general nature from work demanding more physical ability or training, as there was dividing light work of a general nature from light work of a selective nature, see <em>Earley v. Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>supra, the boundary line where the burden of proof, switched from employee to employer before the decision in <em>Petrone. </em>Although it might be possible to definitely fix the boundary between light work of a general nature and work requiring more physical ability and training, for instance in terms of categories used in United States Department of Labor, Selected Characteristics of Occupational Titles (Physical Demands, Working Conditions, Training Time), A Supplemental to the Dictionary of <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>Occupational Titles, A-l to A-7 (1966), this line would he somewhat arbitrary and also might cause a disproportionate amount of effort to be devoted to the determination of whether a particular claimant’s disability was on one side of the line or the other.

If the employer agrees to pay total disability benefits, he later may have to petition the Board to reduce or terminate the payments and he will have the burden of proof on such a petition. If the employer does not agree to pay total disability benefits, the employee will have to petition the Board and he presently has the burden of proof.
