The rationale of the court below is that equity was not the proper forum because a constructive trust — which would make Mancini a <em>trustee ex maleficio </em>— could not arise in the absence of a trust <em>res </em>and, since Mancini did not receive in possession the amount of wage tax deduction, there was no trust res; moreover, the court found that Mancini had not been unjustly enriched, had not embezzled and had not been reckless in the handling of the tax money and, in the absence of such conduct, assumpsit, not equity, was the proper remedy.</p>

In vacating allowance of the claim the Court stated (at 194 F. Supp. page 30) : “It was found by the Referee in Bankruptcy, after the initial hearing, that the Debtor ‘paid net wages’ and ‘did not set aside withholding and social security taxes in a special trust fund.’ (Certificate of Review, December 1, 1958). He concluded that the Debtor ‘neither collected nor withheld the taxes’ for the period in question. It seems reasonably clear that under these circumstances there was no trust fund to which the legal right of the United States could attach. The absence of such a trust fund could not possibly support the right of the United States to an equitable lien on the bank account of the Debtor or any other asset. . . .”</p>

For a period of time the employer failed to deduct and remit to the Association the agreed amounts, although the employer did make bookkeeping entries to this effect. When the employer went into bankruptcy a preferential claim to its remaining funds was filed on the basis that the employer was a constructive trustee of the funds which were never remitted. The United States Supreme Court rejected this position and in terms very appropriate to this matter stated at 299 U.S. pp. 122-123 that “The bankrupt was a debtor which had failed to pay its debt. We know of no <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>principle upon which the failure can be treated as a conversion of property held in trust. At no time throughout the whole period was there a trust fund or res. No fund was segregated or set up by special deposit or in any manner. When the wages became due, there was no such fund but only the general assets of the employer and its obligation to pay a debt. The agreement of the employer to pay the association instead of the employee did not give to the employee or the association equitable title to or lien upon any part of the employer’s property. The assets of the employer remained, as they were before, general assets. It would be impossible to state all the circumstances in which equity will fasten a constructive trust upon property in order to frustrate a violation of fiduciary duty, gee: 3 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, §§1044 et seq. But the mere failure to pay a debt does not belong in that category.”</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[190,1370,1157,542]]]'>The conclusions of the lower court and authorities above cited are amply supported by reason and by general principles of trust law. As previously noted, no trust can properly be held to exist unless there is a <em>res </em>upon which the trust can be fastened. The mere failure by Mancini to set aside and remit moneys to the City, which he was required by law to do, cannot establish a trust of these moneys. The evidence is clear that, at no time did he withhold from his employees’ wages any sum representing wage taxes due the City.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

That this was the actual holding of the <em>Heinel </em>case was reiterated by that same court in <em>Philadelphia v. Louis Laboratories, Inc., </em>supra. The adjudication of the court in <em>City of Philadelphia v. J. &amp; E. Inc. </em>(Ct. C.P. Phila. County, Dec. Term 1958, No. 2171 unreported opinion of June 9, 1961), also relied upon by the City, is unclear as to whether the corporate defendant did or did not actually withhold the wage and amusement taxes due the City in that case. The other cases relied upon by the City are not relevant to the basic issue in this case, namely, whether Mancini is a <em>trustee ex maleficio </em>of the wage taxes which should have been but were not deducted and remitted to the City.</p>

These averments were read into evidence at the hearing because Mancini had insufficiently denied them in his answer. However, a city tax examiner who audited Mancini’s records, testified, on both direct and cross-examination, that the records did not disclose any wage taxes were withheld. And when Mancini testified that he did not withhold from his employees’ wages the taxes due, the City failed to object on the basis that such fact had been <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>admitted by tbe pleadings. Moreover, tbe City does not now argue that Mancini withheld any moneys for the wage taxes; to the contrary, it claims that Mancini should have withheld the taxes before he paid any of his business expenses.</p>
