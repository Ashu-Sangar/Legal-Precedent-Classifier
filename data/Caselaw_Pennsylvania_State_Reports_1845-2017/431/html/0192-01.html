Pursuant to similar instructions given on the 17th, Goldberg withdrew $2,000 from a savings account in ■ the Philadelphia National Bank and delivered these funds to a sister of Mrs. Cohen. Finally, on the 30th in compliance with Mrs. Cohen’s instructions, Goldberg withdrew from a savings account in the Bell Savings and Loan Association $3,000, purchased four $1,000 United States savings bonds (at a cost of $750 per bond) in the name of Frances Cohen payable on Frances Cohen’s death to four selected grandnieces and grandnephews.</p>

The amount of the withdrawals (a total of $7,000) left a balance in these accounts at Mrs. Cohen’s death of $5,551.30. Subsequent to Frances Cohen’s death Morris Cohen learned of these withdrawals and then instituted an equity action in Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia County to recover the proceeds from Goldberg. The <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>court below granted relief based upon its belief that Mr. Cohen, as a surviving tenant of these entireties accounts, was entitled to <em>all </em>of the withdrawals.

This doctrine was best articulated in <em>Stemniski v. Stemniski, </em><a href="/pa/403/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="403 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="1299476" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0038-01">403 Pa. 38</a>, 42, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.2d%2051" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="169 A.2d 51">169 A. 2d 51</a>, 53 (1961) : “A violation of the rules [governing entireties property] by one spouse’s appropriating the property to his own use works a revocation of the estate by the <em>fiction </em>of the appropriation’s being an offer of an agreement to destroy the estate and an acceptance of that offer when the other spouse starts suit: the property is then fit for accounting and division: . .

The court below concluded that Mrs. Cohen’s death prior to the commencement of Mr. Cohen’s equity action forestalled any acceptance of this <em>fictional </em>offer because, under general contract principles, to be accepted an offer must be communicated to the offeree prior to the death of the offeror.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The lower court therefore held that Mr. Cohen was the surviving entireties tenant and awarded to him the funds withdrawn by Goldberg. We agree that the lower court was correct in its view as to traditional contract doctrine. Appellants, however, urge this Court to extend the offer-exception doctrine, apparently contending that they should be entitled to at least one-half of the property owned jointly by Mr. and Mrs. Cohen. We decline to promulgate such an extension and conclude that the doctrine should be confined to the situation which spawned it.</p>

      <em>JS temniski </em>involved an inter vivos suit between husband and wife in which the plaintiff requested an accounting and division of the property. In the present case Mr. Cohen’s action cannot be regarded as an acceptance of Mrs. Cohen’s offer for the simple reason that he asked not for an accounting and division of the property but for return of all the funds appropriated by Mrs. Cohen. Support for this position can be found in <em>Brose Estate, </em>supra at 391, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20301" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="206 A.2d 301">206 A. 2d at </a>304: “Withdrawing by one tenant and appropriating the money or property to the withdrawer’s own exclusive use without the consent or subsequent approval of the other tenant, terminates the tenancy <em>at the option of the co-tenant, </em>but not the co-tenant’s right to an accounting and to one-half thereof.” (Emphasis supplied.) Mr. Cohen, now the surviving tenant of the entireties accounts, cannot be deemed to have exercised his “option” by this lawsuit; he attempts not to acquiesce in Ms wife’s withdrawals but to enforce his survivorship right in the accounts. Having never consented to his wife’s action, the money withdrawn continued to be impressed with the entireties provisions and Mr. Cohen is entitled to those funds as surviving tenant.

We find it unnecessary to decide whether a constructive trust was properly imposed by the court below for, although in its opinion it mentions the creation of a constructive trust, its decree merely requires that the funds be returned, thus operating as if a judgment had been rendered, in effect holding that vis-a-vis Mrs. Cohen’s donees Mr. Cohen has title to the funds in question. The court below has merely decided a question of title and thus <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>the issue of the propriety of creating a constructive trust need not be readied.

Appellants also contend that Doris Kurland, the sister of Mrs. Cohen who was to receive $2,000, has not been joined as a party-defendant and that there was therefore a failure to join a necessary party. Since Doris Kurland is not a party, then the modified decree will have no impact upon her. However, she was not a necessary party as we view this action because it was within Mr. Cohen’s discretion to pursue any or all of the individuals who allegedly received the disputed funds — his failure to join Doris Kurland merely results in a situation in which any funds received by her are not reached by the decree as modified.</p>
