Decedent alone owned an interest in the partnership which he wanted to sell, initially at least, for $100,000. Lengthy negotiations with his two partners ensued. The two partners finally agreed to a payment to decedent of $46,400 of which $21,400 was paid in cash and a promissory note given for $25,-000. It was to the interest of the purchasing partners to insure, for as long as possible, the use of the premises for their tavern-restaurant business and, under their extant lease, they had only ten years of assurance of such use. It was to decedent’s interest, • decedent being about to retire from business activities, to increase the income from the leased premises. The property leased was owned by himself and his wife, as tenants by the entireties, and any change in the lease Avould be a matter for them <em>jointly.</em>
