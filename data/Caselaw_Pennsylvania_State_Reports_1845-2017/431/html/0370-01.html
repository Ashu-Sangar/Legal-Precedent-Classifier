The defendants are H.R.B., Inc., a nonprofit Pennsylvania corporation organized to raise funds to provide free dental care for the handicapped, and Mrs. Helen R. Blumberg, the president of H.R.B., Inc. After a trial without a jury, <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>the trial judge entered, a verdict for $5,500 in favor of the plaintiff and against both defendants.

In fact, plaintiff never has questioned Mrs. Blumberg’s authority to act in this matter for H.R.B., Inc. Plaintiff’s efforts to establish H.B.B., Inc.’s liability impliedly accepts Mrs. Blumberg’s authority to hind the corporation, for on no other theory could the corporation be held liable. Even if plaintiff did question Mrs. Blumberg’s authority, the trial <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>court’s finding that the corporation is liable confirms that Mrs. Blumberg had authority and that finding is amply supported by the evidence.</p>

The printing for which plaintiff seeks to recover was ordered from plaintiff by Mr. Herbert Pasker, who had been contacted by Mrs. Blumberg at the suggestion of a printer who previously had handled work for H.R.B., Inc., but who could not prepare the convention literature in the short time available. Plaintiff’s officials testified that after the second of thirteen job orders that make up plaintiff’s claim, they asked Mr. Pasker whom to bill and, after asking Mrs. Blumberg, he told them to bill H.R.B., Inc. Mr. Pasker’s testimony and plaintiff’s records corroborate this. Thus it certainly was disclosed to plaintiff that H.R.B., Inc. was the principal for whom Mr. Pasker ordered the last eleven of the thirteen jobs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> With respect to the first two job orders, Mrs. Blumberg also cannot be held personally liable. It appears to us that the major reason for holding personally liable an agent who does not disclose either the principal’s identity or existence is that, under such circumstances, the party dealing with the <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>agent must rely on the agent personally. In this case, it is clear that if plaintiff was relying on any agent, it was Mr. Pasker. Mrs. Blumberg did not deal with plaintiff at all. Thus, if any agent was acting for an undisclosed or partially disclosed principal, it was Mr. Pasker, not Mrs. Blumberg.</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[180,711,1146,481]]]'>Mrs. Blumberg cannot be held personally liable on the theory, adopted by the trial court, that she voluntarily agreed with plaintiff to be personally liable. Although officers of plaintiff testified that they were looking to Mrs. Blumberg for payment, this is less than a complete agreement. Mrs. Blumberg also in some way must have offered to be personally liable or must have accepted personal liability. There is no evidence that she did so.</p>
    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[180,1211,1147,430]]]'>During the transactions giving rise to the debt, Mrs. Blumberg and plaintiff communicated only through Herbert Pasker. Since Mrs. Blumberg did not deal at all with plaintiff, she could not herself have indicated to plaintiff that she agreed to be personally liable. Assuming that Mr. Pasker represented to plaintiff that Mrs. Blumberg would be personally liable, he did not have authority to make such a representation.</p>
    <p id="b403-6" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[179,1654,1147,709]],["BL_404.1",404,[186,375,1161,1028]]]'>There is no evidence to support a finding that Mr. Pasker had apparent authority to bind Mrs. Blumberg. Apparent authority is power to bind a principal which the principal has not actually granted but which he leads persons with whom his agent deals to believe that he has granted. Persons with whom the agent deals can reasonably believe that the agent has power to bind his principal if, for instance, the principal knowingly permits the agent to exercise such power or if the principal holds the agent out as possessing such power. <em>Jennings v. Pitts. Mercantile Co., </em><a href="/pa/414/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="414 Pa. 641" data-case-ids="1890409" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0641-01">414 Pa. 641</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%2051" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="202 A.2d 51">202 A. 2d 51</a> (1964) ; Restatement 2d, Agency, § §8, 27 (1958). On the first two printing orders, it <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>appears that Mrs. Blumberg was not even a disclosed principal. Thus, Mr. Pasker eould not have had any apparent authority on those transactions. <em>Jennings v. Pittsburgh Mercantile Co., </em>supra, 414 Pa. at pp. 644-45, 202 A. 2d at p. 54. On the last eleven printing orders, it does not appear that Mrs. Blumberg in any way manifested to plaintiff or to anyone else that Mr. Pasker could bind her personally. There is no evidence that she knew that Mr. Pasker was purporting to bind her to pay for the printing which she directed him to have billed to the corporation. Nor is there any evidence of other conduct on the part of Mrs. Blumberg from which the plaintiff could reasonably believe that she consented to Mr. Pasker, a special agent, exercising the unusual authority to bind her personally on this corporate contract. Thus, on this record, a finding that Mr. Pasker had apparent authority to bind Mrs. Blumberg personally is completely unsupportable.</p>
    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.5",404,[180,1426,1156,586]]]'>There is no evidence to support a finding that Mr. Pasker had actual authority, express or implied, to bind Mrs. Blumberg. The record discloses nothing said or done by Mrs. Blumberg from which Mr. Pasker reasonably could have believed that she consented to his exercising the power to bind her personally. Moreover, it would not have been reasonable, especially after having been told to bill H.R.B., Inc., to think that he could bind Mrs. Blumberg as an agent personally without some definite indication to that effect. The record is devoid of such evidence.</p>
    <p id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.6",404,[177,2033,1153,210]]]'>It is argued that, even if the judgment against Mrs. Blumberg is not supportable on an agency theory, it is proper to “pierce the corporate veil.” We do not agree.</p>

In this case the reasons advanced for the position that justice and public policy would be served by “piercing the corporate veil” are not persuasive.</p>
    <p id="b405-4" data-blocks='[["BL_405.5",405,[183,763,1147,929]]]'>The appellee attaches great significance to the testimony that the stock of H.R.B., Inc. was never issued. In determining whether the corporate entity should be disregarded, this factor may be considered, but it is seldom sufficient. Annot., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.L.R.%203d%201122" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 A.L.R. 3d 1122">8 A.L.R. 3d 1122</a> (1866). Additional reasons are necessary if justice and public policy are to demand that the corporate veil be pierced. In this ease, the additional reasons are not weighty. Although Mrs. Blumberg had a “personal interest” in the corporation’s charitable activities, this is true of many, if not most, stockholders and functionaries of charitable corporations and yet the legislature has conferred limited liability. The Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289, §§509, 610, 15 P.S. §§7509, 7610. If this personal interest were considered, the corporate entity envisioned by the legislature would truly be “useless.”</p>
    <p id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.6",405,[182,1704,1146,373]]]'>H.R.B., Inc. has not been used as a device to defraud plaintiff. There has been no trickery or deception. The plaintiff should have known from the nature of the material printed that it was for a charitable corporation. Any loss it may incur is as much attributable to its failure to inquire into the corporation’s desires as to the corporation’s lack of resources.</p>
    <p id="b405-6" data-blocks='[["BL_405.7",405,[181,2092,1147,153]]]'>The second question raised by the appellants is whether or not Mr. Pasker was authorized to contract for printing at a cost of more than $3000.</p>

Mr. Paster testified that he did not remember a conversation in which, as Mrs. Blumberg recalls, he told her that the printing would cost no more than $3000. Assuming that such a conversation occurred, Mr. Paster’s estimate of what the printing would cost did not necessarily become a limitation on his authority. The question of whether he could have reasonably believed that his authority was not limited by any dollar figure is a factual question and we cannot say that the lower court erred in resolving it against appellants.</p>

Thus, it would be incorrect to conclude that the disclosure to plaintiff after two job orders was sufficient to make H.R.B., Ine. a disclosed principal throughout the entire printing, including the first two orders. In our judgment it also would be incorrect to link the thirteen orders, treat them as a single contract, and hold H.R.B., Inc. undisclosed on the basis of its status during the first order. As pláintiff’s own officials testified, the thirteen orders were separate transactions. BasicaUy, they are separate contracts.</p>
