However, there, are at least two reasons why this attempt must fail. First, as we construe the contract, it is between CBS and the individual defendants, Dawes, Fried and Dannemann. These individuals signed as individuals and not as members of a group. The funds due under the contract are due to the individuals. ‘The Cyrkle’ seems to be nothing more than a stage name under which Defendants are known and perform.
