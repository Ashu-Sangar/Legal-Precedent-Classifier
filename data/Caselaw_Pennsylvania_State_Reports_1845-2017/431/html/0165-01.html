There were absentee votes yet to be counted, 6,080 of them. 574 ballots were sent in by military personnel and by war veterans; 5506 were mailed in by civilians who were, under the election code, entitled to vote by mail because of inability to get to the polls.

The appellants themselves recognized the importance of absentee balloting by having solicited the votes of those they had reason to believe could not be in their election districts on election day. It is stated in the appellee’s brief, and not questioned in the appellant’s brief, that “appellants-candidates Harte and Cali were elected at the primary elections partially on the strength of absentee ballots solicited by them.”</p>

The appellants do not deny the validity of the 574 military ballots, but they would nullify the votes of 5,506 civilians. Such mass disfranchisement should not be proclaimed except for grave constitutional infirmities, certainly not present here. In <em>Perles v. Northumberland Co.

The disfranchisement of 5,506 citizens for following a procedure laid down by the election authorities would be unconscionable, since the appellants do not contend that they were the victims of fraud, or even mistake. The challenges to absentee ballots were heard by a commission of four able, respected lawyers of Lackawanna County (two from each major political party), appointed by the judges of Lackawanna County. The appellants do not suggest that they were harmed in any way by this bi-partisan, impartial, competent commission. Indeed, the appellants entered into a stipulation, two paragraphs from which indicate the tenor of the acknowledgment that an honest count was made: “The parties hereto specifically agree to withdraw all challenges on any ballots of electors of the City of Scranton and City of Carbondale noted on the face of said mailed ballot envelopes and expressly waive their right to assert hereafter in these proceedings any objection or re-challenge thereto, except for challenged ballots on which hearings have been held or which are held by the Board for future determination, or the general constitutional challenge provided for in paragraph 2, above.</p>

The appellants argue that the counting of absentee votes should be accomplished in the election districts because the members of the district boards are in a better position to personally know the electors than the county commissioners are. But here it is not a matter of knowing the electors; it is a question of determining whether the absentee electors had a legitimate excuse for voting by mail and this, in the event the vote is contested, can only be determined by questioning persons who know the reasons for the elector’s absence from the voting poll on election day. This could involve the testimony of strangers to the district as, for instance, the testimony of people living in the town or place, away from home, where the elector claimed he had to be for business reasons. The impracticality of the plan argued for by the appellants is also very apparent because in its inevitable unfoldment, it would require a multiplicity of tribunals throughout the county, instead of the centralized one in the county board of elections.</p>

In addition, the return board in this particular case was made up of the court of common pleas sitting as a county board of elections, and, in that capacity, the court appointed a board, as already stated (made up of two Republican and two Democratic attorneys), to hear all testimony on the subject of the validity of absentee ballots. Moreover, to say that the common pleas judges sitting as the county election board are “election officers” and thus disqualified to act because of Article VIII, §15 of the Constitution, would mean that the entire election in Lackawanna County, indeed of all Pennsylvania, would be declared illegal, a result so absurd as to need no further comment. In addition, it must be obvious that the Constitutional provision in question outlining qualifications for election officers refers to Article VIII, §14, entitled “Election Officers” and defines the same as “a judge and two inspectors” who comprise district election boards. Thus, Article VIII, §15 was intended <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>to regulate the qualifications of the persons supervising the polling places on election day, and not the county board of elections, operating <em>after </em>election day.</p>
