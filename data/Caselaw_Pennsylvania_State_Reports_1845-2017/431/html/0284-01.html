Such reasons may be summarized: (a) an “increasing recognition of the fact that tenants who lease defective premises are likely to be impecunious and unable to make the necessary repairs which their own safety and that of others may demand; that one who is in possession of the premises only for a-limited term does not have the same incentive to maintain them in good condition as the lessor to whom they will revert at the end of the lease; and that the landlord who receives benefit from the transaction in the form of rent may properly be required to assume in return at least certain limited obligations with respect to the safety of others”;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (b) by reason of the special relation between a landlord and a tenant, there is a likelihood that the latter -will rely upon the former to make repairs and be induced to forego efforts which he would otherwise make to remedy dangerous conditions on the premises; (c) while the landlord retains no right to exclude anyone from the land or control its use and his right to enter arises only from an agreement to repair the land, at least to the extent of his undertaking, the landlord retains a form of “control” over the premises; (d) <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>while the landlord does not insure the safety of the premises, he does have a duty which, although founded on a contract, is a duty cognizable in tort and the landlord should be liable if his failure to make repairs in accordance with his undertaking is due to his failure to exercise reasonable care to that end; (e) by analogy to a situation where an apartment or office can be used with safety only if light and heat is provided and in the lease the landlord agrees to provide such service, the landlord should be subject to liability for bodily harm caused by a failure to exercise reasonable care to make the premises safe.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> With the possible exception of the fictitious “control” theory under (c) supra, the reasons advanced are sound.</p>

The majority do this because all of a sudden the landlord-to-be and the tenant-to-be do not negotiate a lease on an “arm’s length” basis, and the position of the average tenant vis-a-vis the landlord is today inferior — as if this situation were different than ever before. If premises are in bad condition, it not only affects and lowers their sale value but likewise their rental value. There is no acute housing shortage (as the majority assert), and, if there were, it would not have arisen suddenly in the last three months after this Court decided <em>Kolojeski v.

This has been recognized for centuries by English-speaking peoples. Lord Coke, Chief Justice of England, thus wisely expressed (circa 1600) these truths: “The knowne certain tie of the law is the safetie of all.” This has been a beacon light for Anglo-American Courts, for text authorities, and for law-abiding Americans ever since the foundation of our Country. In the realm of the law it is usually expressed in the principle known as Stare Decisis. Stare Decisis is one of the bed-rocks upon which the House of Law has been erected and maintained.</p>
