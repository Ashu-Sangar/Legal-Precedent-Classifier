Since the remarriage would not affect Mrs. Mallory’s ownership of the property decreed to her on the prior divorce, possession of it by the wife at the time of her husband’s death could in no way affect her right to participate in the division of his estate under the law of Pennsylvania, and the court below properly so decided. We agree with the court below also that, irrespective of the law of the state where Nellie Mallory lived at the time of the separation between her and her husband, or of the law of the state where she lived at the date of his death, William J.

Suffice it to say that the great weight of the evidence does not sustain the auditor’s findings that Nellie Mallory deserted her husband, and it does sustain the findings of the court below to the contrary. The separation here involved was, as the court below states, either brought about by those acting on behalf of the husband, or wa-s by “mutual consent.” The governing rule in this class of cases is stated by the Superior Court in Braum’s <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>Est., <a href="/pa-super/88/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="88 Pa.

Superior Ct. 109</a>, 112, in language which is applicable to the present case: “The mere fact that the husband and wife had been living apart was not controlling. Desertion is an actual abandonment of matrimonial cohabitation, with an intent to desert, without cause or the consent of the other party. Separation is not [necessarily] desertion. The vice of appellant’s contention is the assumption that the separation amounted to a desertion by the wife. The court below found as a fact that the separation in this case was by mutual consent and that the decedent never made any effort to induce his wife, the appellee, to resume marital relations. This finding is based upon competent evidence, and nothing appears in the case which would warrant us in disturbing it. The separation......lacked the elements of a wilful and malicious desertion.” See also Mr. Justice Kephart’s opinion in Lodge’s Est., <a href="/pa/287/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="287 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1099599" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0184-01">287 Pa. 184</a>,186-8.</p>

Appellants contend that, when Nellie Mallory claimed the $500 exemption, allowed to a widow by the law of Pennsylvania, and it was denied to her by the court below, such denial was tantamount to a finding that she was a deserting spouse, and that fact, being thus established, should be treated as res judicata of her present claim. With this contention we cannot agree, for the opinion of the court below in the exemption proceedings plainly states that it does not determine the right of the claimant to participate in the ultimate distribution of her late husband’s estate, and shows clearly that the exemption was not denied on the ground of desertion by her; on the contrary, even at that early stage, the court stated that William J. Mallory and his wife “parted on good terms,” and that the exemption was denied solely on the ground that, at the time of decedent’s death, Nellie Mallory was not a member of his family. On the law involved, the court below correctly ruled that this statutory “exemption is......allowed......to tide over the necessities of the family when the head of it is stricken <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>down,” and, to succeed in such a claim, a widow “must be a member of the family of decedent at his death unless prevented from occupying that relation by the fault of the husband,” paraphrasing the opinion of Judge Rowe in Burkett’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Pa.%20C.%20501" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="5 Pa.

In Platt’s App., <a href="/pa/80/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="80 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1042373" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0501-01">80 Pa. 501</a>, 504, not cited by the court below, we squarely ruled that a woman, separated from her husband, may, where, as here, there was no desertion by her, or where the separation was voluntary, participate in the distribution of his estate and at the same time be barred from the widow’s exemption because nothing appeared to show that she had “maintained the family relation as far as was in her power.” In other words, the controlling issues of fact in a widow’s exemption proceeding are not necessarily the same as those which may be involved in her claim to participate in the distribution of her deceased husband’s estate (Arnout’s Est., <a href="/pa/283/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="283 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1090542" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0049-01">283 Pa. 49</a>; Stauffer’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/89/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="89 Pa. Super. 531" data-case-ids="671354" data-case-paths="/pa-super/89/0531-01">89 Pa. Superior Ct. 531</a>) ; though, as shown in our opinion in Holben’s Est., <a href="/pa/299/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="299 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1122282" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0348-01">299 Pa. 348</a>, they may be the same, and their decision in the exemption proceeding may make them res judicata. In Holben’s Estate, the point held to be res judicata by the decree in the exemption proceedings concerned the marriage status of the claimant, which, once decided in her favor, we held to be conclusive of that issue in all subsequent proceedings concerning the distribution of the husband’s estate. In the present case, however, the controlling issue of fact decided in the exemption proceeding, that claimant was not a member of decedent’s family at the time of his death, has, as already shown, ho governing force in determining her right to share in the ultimate distribution of his estate.</p>
