No notice of the sale was given to those interested in the assets as required by the Bulk Sales Act of May 23, 1919, P. L. 262.

After hearing, the trial judge determined that the terms of the Bulk Sales Act had not been complied Avith, fixed the value of the goods transferred, and directed payment of plaintiff’s demand, which it held a valid debt. Thereafter, other creditors intervened, asking that the vendees be held as receivers for the actual worth of the property sold, and that all having accounts due be allowed to share pro rata. As a result, the case was reopened and further testimony taken. The former decree was set aside, and all proving sums owing yere permitted to* participate in the fund determined to be distributable.

This statute was repealed in 1919, and a more detailed presentment of the rights of the parties in such cases was substituted. The time for informing those having claims, so that legal objection might be made, was extended to ten days, and, by the third section, it was provided that if the proper notices were not given prior to the consummation of the transaction, to all creditors “then such sale or transfer shall be fraudulent and void, and such purchaser, auctioneer, or agent shall, at the suit of any creditor, be held liable to the creditors of the said vendor as a receiver for the fair value of all the property so bought or sold by him.”</p>

No obligation on the part of the purchaser to directly pay those holding claims against the vendor is created. The act imposes certain duties upon the purchaser which he must perform, where goods are acquired in bulk, and not in the ordinary course of trade.

This, we think, is clearly not the case.

Young, <a href="/us/211/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="211 U.S. 489" data-case-ids="11927820" data-case-paths="/us/211/0489-01">211 U. S. 489</a>. The making of a purchaser, not conforming to the statute, a receiver for the benefit of the seller’s creditors does not deprive him of property without due process: Kidd, Dater &amp; Price Co. v. Musselman Grocer Co., <a href="/us/217/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="217 U.S. 461" data-case-ids="407797" data-case-paths="/us/217/0461-01">217 U. S. 461</a>. A separation of sales in bulk from ordinary transactions, and the regulation of the details requisite to the passing of title, is a reasonable classification to meet a special situation for which the legislature has the power to provide.</p>

The Bulk Sales Act relates to unusual and extraordinary transfers, affording exceptional chances of fraud, and its enactment is a reasonable exercise of the police power within the discretion of the legislature. The fact that the statute does not embrace all kinds of property, either personal or real, does not void it, for it is sufficient if the selection of articles and property be based on reasonable and just grounds of difference; and the prohibition comprehends all kinds of property within the relation and circumstances which constitute the distinction, extends equally to every citizen and all classes of citizens, and denies to no one a privilege which another is permitted under like circumstances to exercise. The above declarations, with others, upholding the constitutionality of the earlier Bulk Sales Act of 1905, are made in the opinion of Judge Rice in Wilson v. Edwards, <a href="/pa-super/32/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="32 Pa. Super. 295" data-case-ids="866983" data-case-paths="/pa-super/32/0295-01">32 Pa. Superior Ct. 295</a>.

Lawler, <a href="/pa-super/38/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="38 Pa. Super. 578" data-case-ids="878667" data-case-paths="/pa-super/38/0578-01">38 Pa.

J. 886. The defect in appellant’s argument rests on the assumption that the statute under consideration provides a special method for the collection of debts, but this is neither the purpose nor effect. The buyer is merely made a receiver of the money value of the property which he takes over, and becomes liable to account to another for whose use it is received and held. He does not become personally responsible for the indebtedness outstanding, but is compelled to account to the creditors for the worth of that which he has in law fraudulently taken into his possession.</p>

Superior Ct. 299</a>), but the Bulk Sales Act justifiably classifies transfers of property and does not furnish to any creditor or class preference in the collection of their claims. It simply provides that certain steps be preliminarily taken by a purchaser before accepting a transfer, which, by reason of its peculiar character, may lend itself to fraud. If he fails to act, in the <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>manner deemed by the legislature necessary to safeguard legal claimants, he becomes chargeable not with the debt due, but the value of the goods for the benefit of those who are affected and make demand for a share of the proceeds. The requirement that he give notice to those interested before paying the purchase money does not impose an unreasonable burden, and has been deemed necessary to prevent the perpetration of fraud where merchandise is disposed of in bulk. The necessity for such action, to protect claimants under the special circumstances, is a matter for the exercise of legislative discretion, and with its determination we cannot interfere. The constitutionality of acts, such as now under consideration, has been generally upheld in other jurisdictions: 27 C. J. 874.</p>

The later legislation, dealing with cases where an intent to defraud appears and is proven, expressly repealed the Bulk Sales Act of 1905, which had already been supplanted in terms by the Act of 1919, but makes no mention of the latter statute. It, therefore, did not directly annul it, nor can it be said, as urged by appellant, that it impliedly did so because dealing with the same subject-matter. The Bulk Sales Law covers transfers whether the party be solvent or actual fraud is proven, whereas the Fraudulent Conveyance Act applies only where there is a voluntary conveyance made without consideration with intent to defraud. In discussing this question, it was said, in Gibbon v. Arronson, <a href="/pa-super/80/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="80 Pa. Super. 36" data-case-ids="653511" data-case-paths="/pa-super/80/0036-01">80 Pa.

In this we see no error. The vendee violated the statutory requirements, and, instead of distributing the sum representing the worth of the merchandise to creditors, or paying the same into court for distribution, kept the goods, or the proceeds thereof. It was proper to charge the defendants with interest on the value of the property or moneys reduced to their possession. Nor can we see that a mistake was made in awarding a reasonable attorney’s fee for the benefit of those whose services produced the fund for distribution, at the suit of one creditor, for his benefit and all others who became parties and proved their claims.</p>

In the present case, the proceeding was equitable, and one, acting for all, raised the receivership and compelled an accounting of the moneys improperly withheld. This situation makes applicable the distinction pointed out in Whitney v. Jersey Shore Boro., <a href="/pa/266/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="266 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1056097" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0537-01">266 Pa. 537</a>, following Winton’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="87 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="1057867" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0077-01">87 Pa. 77</a>.

In the first instance, the plaintiff, filing the bill within the ninety-day period, was alone awarded payment, and, in full, as the worth of the goods transferred exceeded his total demand. Later, others intervened and claimed a share in the amount for distribution. Upon reconsideration, all claimants were notified to prove their claims, whether presented within the period fixed for adversary action by the Bulk Sales Act or not, and distribution was made pro rata to those who established their demands. Whether those who failed to object and make claim within ninety days could thereafter become parties and demand a proportionate share was questioned, but the court determined the receiver appointed held for all who established their rights as creditors prior to actual distribution. As the statement of questions involved does not suggest the incorrectness of this conclusion it is not necessary to now consider it.</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[169,1490,1152,742]]]'>Only those who claimed a part of the fund for distribution could be considered in determining the total indebtedness. If others were entitled to become parties to the proceeding and share in the amount raised, but declined or failed to take part and make demand, they could not be considered in making the final award. A trust fund was established for the benefit of those having valid demands, but the holders were not compelled to present them if, for any reason, they saw fit not to do so. Ample notice and opportunity was given to any creditor desiring to assert his right, but, in distributing the funds in the hands of the receiver, the equity court could consider only those who made proper proof of their claims.</p>

To the extent of payment, the assignee was properly subrogated (27 C. J. 886), as permitted by the chancellor. He also awarded to the defendants themselves, who were individual creditors of the vendor corporation, a proportionate share in the fund. The right of the latter to an allowance might be questioned, since they were parties to the violation of the Bulk Sales Act, but the pro rata distribution to them is not disputed in the present case. The appellants have no just cause to complain of the allotment finally made.</p>
