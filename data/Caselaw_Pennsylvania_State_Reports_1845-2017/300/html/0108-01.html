There is nothing in the evidence to sustain such finding or the decree of the court holding this one and one-half mill tax to be illegal. Having been made at the time the bonds were issued, that this one and one-half mill levy is a legal tax and must stand during the life of the bonds no matter what may be done by the board of supervisors from year to year in the levy and collection of an annual road tax.</p>

If bonds, issued prior to the passage of the act, for the repayment of which provision was made in accordance with section 10 of article IX of the Constitution and a special tax levied by authority of the Act of April 28, 1915, P. L. 197 (West Pa. Stat. 15723), prior to the passage of this act, are now to depend for their repayment on an annual road tax levy by boards of supervisors, then the bonds in the hands of investors are not the same security they were when the investors bought them. The obligation of the contract of the township to repay has been impaired by substituting an annual tax which the supervisors “may levy” for the tax which they did levy when the bonds were first issued. This, the legislature would have no power to do and therefore, whatever else the “annual road tax,” which the supervisors are empowered to levy, may include, it cannot include within its scope a prior tax levy for the repayment of bonds, laid in accordance with the Constitution and specifically authorized by the Act of April 28, 1915, P.

To permanently improve its roads, in 1926, it borrowed the sum of $30,000, secured by bonds payable in ten years, and, <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>as provided by the Act of April 20, 1874, P. L. 65, supplemented by later legislation, filed a financial statement in the court of quarter sessions. At the same time the municipal authorities levied an annual tax of one and one-half mills to pay the interest and provide a sinking fund sufficient to retire the debt at maturity, — action required by article IX, section 10 of the Constitution. These securities were sold in due course and are outstanding valid obligations of the township. The sums required for their extinguishment must be annually collected, and no attempt to deprive the holders of this fixed right could be sustained, if attempted.</p>
    <p id="b163-3" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[145,1013,1151,1129]]]'>By the Act of July 14, 1917 (P. L. 840, section 420), the supervisors of such townships are directed annually, before the organization meeting in December, or as soon thereafter as practicable, to make a written estimate of the funds needed for corporate purposes during the ensuing year, and file the same with the treasurer. The sum needed for current expenditures, including that required for the payment on account of debt already incurred, is thus fixed and the total must not exceed the amount receivable by the collection of a ten-mill tax. To meet unusual requirements, section 421 of the Code, as amended in 1921 (May 20th, P. L. 959), provides that “the board of supervisors, by unanimous action, shall, upon due cause shown, petition the quarter sessions, in which case the court may order a greater rate, but not exceeding ten additional mills to be levied.” By the same section of the Code, permission is given to collect, without special leave, further sums for the upkeep of a lockup, and town-house, or to support a lighting system, but these clauses have no bearing on the present controversy.</p>

It was said in Georges Twp. v. Union Trust Co., <a href="/pa/293/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="293 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="1111164" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0364-01">293 Pa. 364</a>, any sum received must first be devoted to the payment of current expenses, but the portion already appropriated to pay the bonded debt is designated as part thereof, and necessarily included in the annual budget, and only the balance remaining can be used by the supervisors to meet other requirements.

As was said in Rainsburg v. Fyan, <a href="/pa/127/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="127 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="565727" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0074-01">127 Pa. 74</a>, 77: “That these constitutional provisions are mandatory and not merely directory, and are to be viewed in the light of limitations upon the powers to be exercised by municipalities, seems to us clear. They are safeguards in the interest of the taxpayer that must be observed.” The township code recognized the possible existence of such liability, and provided, in section 420, that an amount necessary to satisfy indebtedness outstanding and due be included in the annual budget. By the next paragraph, the total tax was limited to ten mills, unless the court of quarter sessions should be satisfied that additional funds were required to pay. the existing contractual obligations and properly conduct the business of the township. In 1927, the supervisors of Jenner Township determined the fixed maximum sufficient for all purposes, but, in 1928, permission was asked of the court to collect a greater amount, and, in 1929, a like application was made for five mills additional, both of which applications were refused. Thereafter, the municipal authorities determined to collect two taxes, one of ten mills for general purposes, and a second of one and one-half mills to pay the debt contracted in 1926. The right to demand the total of eleven and one-half mills, without judicial authorization, was attacked in the bill of the plaintiff now before us. The court below restrained the effort to levy more than the maximum allowed by the Act of 1917, and this appeal by the township and its tax collector is from the decree restraining the collection of a greater sum.</p>

This overlooks the fact that the debt charge is to be included in the annual estimate, which sum cannot exceed an amount that will be liquidated by a tax collectible on a ten-mill basis, without special allowance, except in certain instances mentioned and not applicable here. If it is made apparent that the moneys receivable, on the basis fixed, will be insufficient, the court may allow an increase, or even compel, by mandamus, the levy of a special tax to meet an emergency or to provide for some unexpected deficiency: Township Code, section 422 (supplanting the Act of March 31, 1864, P. L. 162, referred to in Lehigh C. &amp; N.

In the present case, the court found the ten mills adequate to supply the funds required for the current year, and a special and additional levy for liquidating the interest and principal of the bonds could not therefore be legally assessed.</p>

Though the original tax for refunding was provided for in December, 1926, it became a debt to be provided for in the annual budget, as already noticed, and it is further to be noted that the Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 707, directed, in express terms, that such a liability should be included in the yearly limited levy. The later legislation eliminates any possible doubt as to the meaning of the Code, when it added, to section 420, the words: “Such annual road tax shall include all levies for road purposes <em>and for the payment of bonds and certificates of indebtedness issued </em>and all other debts incurred for road purposes.” Without this enactment, the tax of 1926 to pay the bond interest and provide for the sinking fund, constituting as it did a debt charge, should have been included within the ten mills collectible, since the annual estimate, upon which <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>the tax limited in amount was based, required that provision should be made for existing indebtedness. Even if the inclusion of such item was theretofore questionable, the duty to so provide cannot be doubted since the Act of 1927 became effective.</p>

By the School Code of 1911, an annual budget was necessary. The annual tax was limited to twenty-five mills, with an additional per capita charge permitted by an amending Act of 1921 (May 11, P. L. 508). In 1922, the district, defendant in the proceeding referred to, borrowed $100,000, and levied a tax of seven mills to pay interest and provide a sinking fund to redeem. One year later, the legislature directed that the rate should not exceed thirty-five mills for all purposes, exclusive of the per capita tax. In 1925, the school board levied the maximum amount allowable, and also endeavored to collect, in addition, the seven mills assessed prior to the passage of the Act of 1923 (May 23d, P. L. 328), to pay the bonded debt. It was held the amount previously- provided for by resolution was necessarily included in the maximum of thirty-five mills levied.</p>

The decision cited, though dealing with a school district, is controlling of the situation now presented, in which a township is defendant, the same general features appearing in the codes controlling both municipal corporations, though the maximum amount of tax collectible differs. Indeed, the right of the latter to make the attempted additional levy is less defensible, since all of its debt was necessarily included as part of the annual budget, not required of the former, under the School Code of 1911. It may further be no<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>ticed that the wording of the Township Act of 1927, requiring that the provision for the bonded debt be included in the annual levy limited to ten mills, is more explicit than found in the Act of 192B, relating to school districts, and passed upon in the G-ilberton Case referred to.</p>
