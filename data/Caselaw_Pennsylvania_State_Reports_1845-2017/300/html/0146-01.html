For this reason, where, in the grant to the first taker, a testator uses apt language to pass a fee, the later words used by him will more readily be held to be precatory, than they will be if the prior language does not express that purpose.

On the other hand, we have probably as often held that, in finding the controlling intention, all the words used by testator should be taken into account, and, if the intent to restrict the gift is clear, it must be given effect: Smith v. Piper, <a href="/pa/231/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="231 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="973863" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0378-01">231 Pa. 378</a>, 384; Schuldt v. Reading Tr.

The present will falls fairly within the last stated rule.”</p>

If the words of the second paragraph thereof are precatory merely, that is, if they only express a wish by testatrix that her sister should distribute the unused portion of the estate in a specified way, then the presumption of a fee, arising by virtue of the Act of 1917, will ripen into a certainty; whereas if, by them, testatrix herself gives the unused portion to her brother, that gift will prevail over the presumption arising from the statute. In our opinion the latter is the effect of the language used. The will says: “Should there be any of my estate, real, personal <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>or mixed, or the proceeds thereof -unused or not required for the support of my said sister Sarah Jane Chesnut remaining over at her decease, then <em>it is my will </em>that such remaining estate, interest or the proceeds...... <em>shall </em>at her (Sarah Jane Chesnut’s) death <em>be given, devised, bequeathed, taken and held </em>by my brother Daniel Chesnut, he to use or do with the said estate, remainder or proceeds of the same <em>as he may think best ” </em>This can only mean that Sarah Jane Chesnut was given a power of consumption of the principal, but what is not used or required for her support “it is my [testatrix’s] will ......shall at her death be given, devised, bequeathed, taken and held by my brother” absolutely. Hence, since the right of the sister to consume for the purpose of her support, did not enlarge her estate to a fee (Tyson’s Est., <a href="/pa/191/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="191 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="907042" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0218-01">191 Pa. 218</a>, 226; Walker’s Est., <a href="/pa/277/0444-02" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="277 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="1079548,1079567" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0444-02,/pa/277/0444-01">277 Pa. 444</a>, and cases cited; Eumsey’s Est., <a href="/pa/287/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="287 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1099662" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0448-01">287 Pa. 448</a>,452), it necessarily follows that the court below erred in holding that the will gave to her a fee simple estate in the property in dispute.</p>

They first claim that testatrix’s will worked a conversion of all her estate into personalty, and hence plaintiffs could not maintain ejectment for the realty. As defendants have no interest under the will, they have no standing to raise the question. They are in possession of the land, as land, claiming to hold it as land against plaintiffs, who have the only outstanding interest in it, at least until successful proceedings are had by the executors or creditors to enforce the alleged conversion. So far as appears, no such proceedings have been taken. Moreover, there was no conversion. Citing Battenfeld v. Kline, <a href="/pa/228/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="228 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="969905" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0091-01">228 Pa. 91</a>, 95, to which other cases might readily be added, defendants admit that conversion will be worked under the following circumstances only: (1) By a positive direction to sell, which does not exist here; or (2) By an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will. The only necessity which could have arisen here wiffilj have been to obtain support for the life ten<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>ant; but this was a conditional and not an absolute necessity, and is no longer existent, because of her death; or (3) By such a blending of realty and personalty as to show clearly that testatrix intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate and to bequeath that fund as money. The realty and personalty are blended so far as necessary for the life tenant’s support, but not otherwise; and there is no attempt “to bequeath the fund as money.” On the contrary, the unused portion of the estate, <em>“real, </em>personal or mixed,” testatrix says is “given, <em>devised </em>and bequeathed” to her brother.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[267,942,1149,694]]]'>Appellees’ final contention is that the life tenant incurred mortgage and judgment obligations for her support, which are unsatisfied, and, in some unstated way, affect plaintiffs’ right to recover in ejectment. This also is no concern of theirs. If such encumbrances exist, the holders thereof doubtless know how to enforce their rights; but neither their action nor inaction can give to appellees a right to retain possession of the land as against appellants, who own it, and will continue to be entitled to possession of it until ousted by proceedings taken by or for such creditors, if any exist, or by others who derive title through a sale made in the legal enforcement of the creditors’ rights.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.6",206,[266,1648,1149,97]]]'>The judgment of the court below is reversed and judgment is here entered for plaintiffs.</p>
