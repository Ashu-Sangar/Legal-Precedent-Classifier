L. 546, had no proper application to a bond given in connection with the construction of a reservoir, and the recital in the bond here sued on plainly shows that this obligation was undertaken on <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>the mistaken theory, entertained by all parties concerned, that the above mentioned legislation, recited therein, required such a bond.
