On such appeal the orphans’ court will take evidence to enable it to determine the issues involved and, if the paper offered for probate is in fact and law the last will of decedent, the court will make an appropriate order so that it may be probated accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[274,866,1149,588]]]'>Prior to the Register of Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 415 (which, generally speaking, is a compilation of then existing law), we decided that, though the decision of a register granting letters of administration on a decedent’s estate would not prevent the probate of a will subsequently discovered (Agnew’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="37 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="418936" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0467-01">37 Pa. 467</a>, 468), yet where a paper had been formally probated as the will of a testator and letters granted thereon, no other alleged testamentary writing could be accepted by the register as the testator’s will unless, on an appeal from the first probate, he was ordered so to do.</p>
    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.6",100,[274,1463,1148,794]]]'>In Cochran v.

In February, 1881, another alleged testamentary writing by McCandless, bearing a later date, was also admitted to probate, but without protest from any one. The matter came before us on an appeal from a judgment of the court below in an action of ejectment for certain real estate lately belonging to the deceased testator. We said (page 336) that “testator could make but one last will”; that (pages 337-8) the first probate of September, 1862, was a judicial act which could not be collaterally impeached, and when the register admitted to probate the paper first offered he necessarily adjudicated that it was “the last will and testament” of the deceased.</p>

The brother died and the joint will was admitted to probate. Subsequently, the sister executed a new will revoking the one already probated, so far as it purported to be her will. She died, and the joint will was again offered and admitted to probate, this time as her will. Later, the executor named in the new will asked that the probate of the joint paper, so far as it was accepted as the will of the sister, should be vacated and that the paper offered by him should be accepted as her last will. The matter came to the orphans’ court on appeal; it adjudged the writing bearing the later date to be “the last will” of Mary Cawley, vacated the second probate of the joint will, and directed the probate of the separate will. On appeal to us, we affirmed this order.</p>

We may add that the statute in question, by paragraph (a) of section 16, particularly provides (in accord with previously established law, above shown) that “the probate of any will, or any other paper purporting to be a will......, shall be conclusive as to all property, real or personal, devised or bequeathed by such will or paper, unless within two years from the date of such probate......those interested shall appeal from the decree of the register.” <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>As before stated, no such appeal in the present case has been entered.</p>

Though, for purposes of disposing of the present appeal, Ave have accepted the basis on which the case was argued, and considered it accordingly, yet it must be understood that nothing said in this opinion is intended to indicate any view on our part as to the validity of the adopted hypothesis. Finally, it should be noted that this case has been treated by all persons concerned on the basis that the previously probated paper and the one now offered for that purpose are antagonistic to one another, not as though the latter were merely supplemental to the former; and this opinion should be read and understood with that fact also in mind.</p>
