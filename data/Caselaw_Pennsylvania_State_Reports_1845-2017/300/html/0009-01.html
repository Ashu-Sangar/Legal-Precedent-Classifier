    <p id="b63-8" data-blocks='[["BL_63.12",63,[135,1336,1155,905]]]'>Wohlsen, a contractor, made an assignment on October 3, 1924, for the benefit of creditors, to Walker, and the deed was recorded on January 14, 1925. The former had agreed to build certain houses for Emerich, the defendant, the work to be performed under a contract, the terms of which had not been reduced to a signed writing and were disputed by the respective parties. The builder insisted that all costs were to be paid by the one who employed him, and, in addition, he was to receive 8% of the cost for his services, while the owner claimed the sum of $2,000 had been fixed as compensation. The dispute as to the oral understanding was submitted to the jury in the proceeding instituted by the assignee to recover the balance demanded as due, and the version of Wohlsen was accepted by it, and a verdict rendered in plaintiff’s favor for the amount claimed, less certain admitted credits.</p>
    <p id="b63-9" data-blocks='[["BL_63.13",63,[138,2259,1150,153]],["BL_64.1",64,[286,356,1157,1017]]]'>Emerich contended the cost of the buildings had been paid, and this was not disputed, but he insisted that his further liability was limited to $2,000, less payments <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>made. Though the jury found that the agreement to recompense was on a percentage basis, as the contractor claimed, yet the question remained as to the amount unpaid, assuming the 8% charge to be the proper measure of the indebtedness due. Checks were offered showing payments on account, but one for $500, dated October 10, 1924, and admittedly cashed by Wohlsen, was not received in evidence as a credit, on the theory that it was given and paid seven days after the assignment for the benefit of creditors had been executed, though the latter was not recorded for more than two months thereafter, and admittedly the defendant had no knowledge of the fact when he turned it over on account of the sum remaining unsatisfied. The learned court below was of, opinion that the transfer to the assignee was effective as of its date, and moneys later delivered to the assignor were not proper subjects of credit. The correctness of this conclusion is the narrow question upon which the present appeal turns.</p>

Caldwell, <a href="/pa/22/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="22 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="413767" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0300-01">22 Pa. 300</a>, 302, a case frequently cited with approval: “It is impossible to conceive upon what principle of justice a debtor should be prejudiced by an assignment of which he knows nothing. If the party whose interest and duty it is to give him notice, so that he can regulate his conduct according to his new relations, makes it a point to keep him ignorant, he should certainly not be compelled to suffer; since one man is not to answer for the default of another. Down to the moment of notice, the debtor may do whatever he could legally have done if no assignment had been made.” It is well settled that the law casts upon the assignee the duty of notifying the obligor or the promisor, in order to protect his rights thereto and prevent the extinguishment of the debt by the payment to the obligee or promisee: May v. Newingham, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Pa.%20Super.%20474" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="17 Pa. Super. 474">17 Pa. Superior Ct. 474</a>.

Of course, the contrary would be true if the holder had actual notice of the assignment of the obligee’s rights (North Penn Iron Co. v.

One making the payment, or having the right to a set-off, may also estop himself from demanding that a credit be allowed, as by executing a certificate of no defense to one who acts on the strength thereof (Fort Pitt R.

The position taken by the learned court below cannot be sustained. It may first be noted that state insolvent laws are enforceable notwithstanding federal bankrupt laws, which do not render the former ineffective and void (7 C. J. 21), as to those excluded from their operation, such as farmers (Miller v. Jackson, <a href="/pa-super/34/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="34 Pa.

By the 9th section of the latter statute, the assignment must be recorded forthwith, and a copy filed within five days in the court of common pleas with the necessary schedules. Creditors must be given notice of this fact within twenty days (section 14). The 10th section requires the assignee also to record his instrument in other counties, where property of the assignor is located, within fifteen days, and provides, as a penalty for failure, a charge against the assignee for any amount <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>lost by outsiders as a result of neglect to do so. Prom this provision, the conclusion seems to have been drawn by the court below that the assignment was effective from the date of delivery as to the whole world, and that innocent third parties who might satisfy their obligations, in whole or in part, thereafter, by transferring amounts due to the assignor, before notice, could not claim credits against the estate, though the assignee might be liable for loss.</p>
