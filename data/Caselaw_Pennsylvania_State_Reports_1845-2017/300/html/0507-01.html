Waxman, being engaged in the real estate business as a corporation under the name of Galanter-Waxman, Inc., on March 16, 1926, obtained a loan of $7,500 from the Union National Bank of Philadelphia, for which they gave a promissory note payable in four months, executed by the corporation as maker and endorsed by Leon R. Yubas and Simon Makransky, the former being the father-in-law of Galanter and the latter the father-in-law of Waxman. The evidence tended to show that the understanding of the <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>endorsers was that they should share equally in the liability thereby incurred. At the maturity of the note (July 16, 1926), it was taken up and a new one given the bank for a like amount and maturing four months thereafter. It was executed by the corporation and endorsed by Yubas alone, as Makransky declined to join therein. The first note was surrendered to the makers and destroyed. Both were accommodation endorsers on the first note and Yubas alone on the second. When the latter matured the corporation had failed and Yubas, being compelled to pay the entire $7,500 on the second note, brought this suit against Makransky to recover one-half the amount thereof. Yubas died before the trial and his executrix was substituted as plaintiff. The above are the facts practically as supported by evidence. The trial judge granted a compulsory nonsuit and, from a refusal to take it off, plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>

Reed was gone. As surety in the first note, it was his right to insist that the debt should be paid by his principal when it became payable. But when the bank took a new note from David Reed, extending the time for payment of the debt, it deprived Samuel M. Reed of the power to compel payment of the debt at the maturity of the note which <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>he had endorsed. It tied up his hands for thirty days. To this arrangement Barnett [the coendorser] became a party. How, after this, could the surety remain liable, either in law or in equity? There had been a change of his contract, so far as it appears, without his consent.” And in Am. Telegraph Co. v.
