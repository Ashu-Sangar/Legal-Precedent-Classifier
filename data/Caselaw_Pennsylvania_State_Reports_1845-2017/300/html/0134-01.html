The original grant was made on January 16,1907, under the provisions of the Act of May 14,1889 (P. L. 211), to the constituent Pennsylvania line, which had the state border as its terminus. By ordinance of January 14, 1913, the right to use additional highways was given; thereafter Midland Avenue has been occupied with a double track. Posts, poles and wires were likewise constructed to carry the necessary electric current, requisite for the operation of the passenger cars passing over the highway. Later, the Ohio Power Company, also a party defendant in the present proceeding, was organized in the adjoining state, and carried its current, by high tension lines attached to the poles of the railway company, through the borough to a substation at the eastern side, erected by the Duquesne Light Company, and electricity passes over these wires to and from the two power companies, as their needs require. The bill is silent as to the corporate home of the Duquesne corporation, though its operation within Pennsylvania is averred. By its petition to intervene it appears to have been chartered in this State; but, as this fact <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>is not set forth in the complaint, we must disregard, for present purposes, the statement to this effect appearing in the pleadings filed by it. We are now dealing solely with an answer raising preliminary objections to the bill, asking that it be dismissed for want of proper parties and lack of averments showing a cause of action, it being insisted that the question raised is not cognizable in equity. The essentials of the defense appearing in the petition of the Duquesne Light Company to intervene and its motion to dismiss, in so far as not responsive to facts set forth in the bill, cannot now be considered. The Equity Eules (No. 48) make this impossible, since the new allegations require production of evidence to sustain them: Cf. Rutherford Water Co. v. Harrisburg, <a href="/pa/297/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="297 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1118163" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0033-01">297 Pa. 33</a>.</p>

It is set forth therein that the power lines are stretched on the poles of the railway, without municipal consent, for the benefit of a foreign corporation, thus constituting a public nuisance, which the equity court is asked to abate by directing their removal, and to declare the erection thereof and transmitting current thereon by an Ohio company ultra vires. It is to be noticed that the prayer does not contemplate the maintenance of the status quo, until the rights of the respective parties are legally determined, but asks for a mandatory injunction to compel immediate destruction of the lines complained of. It is charged that the current passes to and from the Duquesne Light Company, and is shifted from one corporation to the other as necessity may require. In view of this allegation, the last named company was permitted to intervene as a party defendant, and has joined with the railway in asking a dismissal of the bill. Thereafter, amendments were filed by the plaintiff, amplifying the charges already set forth. Permission to serve the Ohio <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>Power Company was given, but no attempt to actually do so has been made, though many months have elapsed since the motion to dismiss was presented.</p>
    <p id="b191-3" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[149,514,1152,1511]]]'>It is clear that the traction company and both the power companies, alleged to be wrongfully using the streets to convey electric current, are not only proper but indispensable parties to the bill, if the mandatory injunction is to be granted. Two have appeared, but the third has not been served, and no real attempt to bring it in has been made. It is well settled that equity will not grant relief, such as here asked, if all immediately affected thereby are not made parties. The Ohio Power Company was named as defendant, but it has not been compelled to appear. The Duquesne Light Company, necessarily interfered with in its operations if the order prayed for is made, was not joined, but, with leave, intervened, and also demands the dismissal of the proceeding. Equity Rule 48 provides that a complaint may be summarily stricken off for want of proper parties, and this has been uniformly held (Geesey v. York, <a href="/pa/254/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="254 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1025446" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0397-01">254 Pa. 397</a>), though an amendment may be permitted in a proper case to join one affected but not brought on the record: Hartley v. Langkamp &amp; Elder, <a href="/pa/243/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="243 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1001554" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0550-01">243 Pa. 550</a>. No real effort has been made to force the appearance of the Ohio Power Company, a necessary party, and for this reason the complaint should be dismissed, for no attempt to serve it has been made though a long period of time has elapsed. Possibly this would not be ordered until a further opportunity was given to make it more than a defendant in name, if other reasons making the decree entered imperative were not apparent.</p>

L. 34, gave to companies, having the right to use them, the power to lease their poles, erected on streets permissibly occupied, to other corporations for the purpose of carrying wires, though the latter had no express municipal consent: Houston Boro. v.

It held that the entire controversy was one requiring action by the public service commission, with the right to appeal from any order it might make, and, in such case, an equity court will not assume jurisdiction to settle the dispute. It is true that in controversies of the character now presented the bill has at times been retained to secure the maintenance of the status quo, pending action of the body designated to pass on the questions raised (Fogelsville &amp; Trexlertown El.

    <p id="b193-3" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[147,672,1153,1189]]]'>The Public Service Company Law (July 26, 1913, P.

It is expressly given the right, in section one, to control the “interchange of facilities between two or more public service companies,” and the term used is expressly declared to include “wires, poles and structures.” Section two directs that it shall see that “safe” appliances are installed. Article V (sections 1 and 2) gives jurisdiction to make such orders as are necessary for the “safety” of the public, where electricity is passed over wires, and shall “regulate the service......of any and all public service companies,......the safety of the facilities, plant and equipment for the carrying on of their business......[and] the quantity of electricity or power supplied.” Article VI (section 6) grants the municipality the right to complain if the situation in question is dangerous, and, from the final order, an appeal may be taken to the Superior Court. If the wires and current carried thereon constitute a danger to its citizens, the commission is empowered to grant the relief required.</p>

But, as was said by Mr. Justice Elkin, in one of the earlier decisions, construing the Act of 1913 (York Water Co. v. York, <a href="/pa/250/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="250 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1017005" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0115-01">250 Pa. 115</a>, 118), “The Public Service Company Law was intended to provide a complete system for the supervision and regulation of public service corporations, and the intention of the legislature to repeal or supply all former acts inconsistent therewith is clearly expressed in the language of the statute....... This [regulation of water meters] is a subject clearly within the powers of the public service commission, and hence we are confronted with the situation that both bodies are vested with the same powers or that one must give way to the other. There should be no difficulty in deciding which horn of the dilemma the legislature intended to be taken. There can be no reasonable doubt that the legislative intention was to make the Public Service Act the supreme law of the State in the regulation and supervision of public service corporations, and, this being so, it follows as a necessary sequence that all laws inconsistent with the powers thus conferred must be held to be repealed or supplied thereby.”</p>

It is clearly within the power of the commission to make such order, upon complaint by the Borough of Midland, as may be required to correct danger which exists, if any, and, as to this question, it is given jurisdiction preliminarily, with the right of the dissatisfied party to appeal. If the service complained of is ultra vires, relief may be granted, or the Commonwealth may secure the prohibition of an unlawful act by quo warranto proceedings. The equity court had no jurisdiction to decree the removal of the wires in the case at bar. No averment makes necessary the retention of the bill under consideration to maintain the status quo, for it is not averred that any change in the present situation is threatened, and further no such relief is asked. It follows from what has been said that the bill was properly dismissed.</p>
