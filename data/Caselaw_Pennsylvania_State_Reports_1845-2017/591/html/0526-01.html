Second, since “opening statements are not considered evidence and jurors are routinely cautioned to regard those statements as non-evidence, it logically follows that actual evidence, that will be entered during trial, should not be used prematurely.” <em><a href="/pa/492/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="492 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1767175" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0389-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis omitted).

To be clear, however, permission from the trial court to display a piece of tangible evidence during a prosecutor’s opening statement will not serve as a license to display tangible evidence in any way that prosecutor sees fit. While nothing prohibits a prosecutor from displaying admissible evidence, the manner by which the prosecutor conducts the display may itself constitute prosecutorial misconduct or result in a mistrial. For instance, where the display goes beyond permissible oratorical flair, is done in a flamboyant, erratic, or frightening manner, or where the prosecutor effectively converts himself into an unsworn witness, such actions may well result in a mistrial. By way of example, <em>see People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em><a href="/ad2d/90/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="90 A.D.2d 193" data-case-ids="5622707" data-case-paths="/ad2d/90/0193-01">90 A.D.2d 193</a>, 196, <a href="/citations/?q=456%20N.Y.S.2d%201008" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="456 N.Y.S.2d 1008">456 N.Y.S.2d 1008</a>, 1010 (N.Y.A.D.1982). In <em>Williams, </em>the concealability of a gun was at issue. To demonstrate that it was possible to hide the gun, the prosecutor hid the sawed-off shotgun under his clothing and pulled it out during his opening statement. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division found this reversible error, holding that the demonstration converted the prosecutor into an unsworn witness. That court concluded that the prosecutor's actions created a substantial likelihood that prejudice resulted that could never be dispelled from the minds of the jury. <em><a href="/citations/?q=456%20N.Y.S.2d%201008" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="456 N.Y.S.2d 1008">Id.</a></em>

There is no basis for such assumptions, and I for one do not believe that jurors are so innocent, inexperienced, or squeamish that the mere sight of a handgun destroys their ability to reason. If this assertion was an accurate assessment of the impact on the jury, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>one could never introduce a firearm at the <em>trial </em>of the matter. It is for this reason, and not the strength of the evidence ultimately produced against Parker at trial, that I believe the display authorized by the trial judge provides no basis to upset the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b792-10" data-blocks='[["BL_792.11",792,[298,1843,1161,528]],["BL_793.1",793,[190,323,1155,852]]]'>Notwithstanding my agreement with the Majority concerning its assessment of the <em>effect </em>of the display in this case, I nevertheless write to express concern respecting the proper place of such displays in opening statements. The purpose of opening statements is limited, as the Majority correctly notes; this part of the trial is intended to apprise the jury of the background of the case, how the case will proceed, and what the parties will attempt to prove. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 919 A.2d at 950, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Montgomery, </em><a href="/pa/533/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="533 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1837460" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0491-01">533 Pa. 491</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="533 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1837460" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0491-01">626 A.2d 109</a>, 113 (1993). The opening statement is a roadmap, and not <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>a dry-run. It is a chance to outline and describe the prosecution (or defense) case, and not an opportunity to pre-try the matter. Trial courts routinely instruct juries that opening arguments are not to be considered evidence, <em>see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Begley, </em><a href="/pa/566/0239-02" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="566 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="706247,706307" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0239-02,/pa/566/0239-01">566 Pa. 239</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0239-02" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="780 A.2d 605" data-case-ids="706247,706307,706337,9482468,9482516,9482650" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0239-02,/pa/566/0239-01,/pa/566/0238-01,/a2d/780/0605-01,/a2d/780/0605-02,/a2d/780/0605-03">780 A.2d 605</a>, 627 (2001), but this restraint is diluted by allowing the jury to view the actual instrument of the crime for which the defendant is on trial. In addition to the fact that there is always a risk that the piece of evidence the party would display may ultimately not be admitted at trial, there is the more fundamental administrative concern that the limited role of the opening <em>statement </em>is being abused. Perhaps lawyers feel that our society today has a shorter attention span than previous generations; or, perhaps, lawyers feel a need to entertain as much as to inform. Or it may be simply that lawyers seek to add drama to their otherwise dry presentations. But the courts need not bow down to such perceived necessities.</p>
    <p id="b793-5" data-blocks='[["BL_793.5",793,[186,1195,1157,854]]]'>The Majority is correct that there is no statute, rule of procedure, or case law, which prohibits such displays. In addition, as I have already noted, I do not believe that such displays are inherently prejudicial. Nevertheless, as a supervisory matter, I believe that this Court should discourage such displays and should remind trial courts to enforce the important, but limited, purpose of the lawyers’ opening arguments. <em>See Commonwealth v. DeJesus, </em><a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="580 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1100728" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01">580 Pa. 303</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="860 A.2d 102" data-case-ids="1100728,9145847" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0303-01,/a2d/860/0102-01">860 A.2d 102</a>, 119 (2004) (relying, in part, on this Court’s supervisory power over attorneys to fashion a judicial rule that it is impermissible to ask a jury to sentence a defendant in order to “send a message” to society). Thus, I cannot agree with the Majority’s assessment that the display here was “wholly proper.” Majority at 537-38, 919 A.2d at 950. Whether proper or not, it was not harmful, and for that reason, relief is not due. But, as a supervisory matter, I would disapprove of trial courts authorizing such displays.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
