Throughout the course of the events leading to her death, White lived at home with her parents and drove her new black Jeep Cherokee to work, as well as to her classes at Harrisburg Area Community College (“HACC”), where she was a freshman. White had a particular interest in art and photography, and was pursuing studies in these subjects. The prior year, her parents gave her a camera costing approximately $600, which she continued to use.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[199,819,1153,1150]]]'>During her first day of employment at Wal-Mart on August 2, 2000, White met Appellant’s co-defendant, William Housman, who also started working at the store that day. White and Housman struck up a friendship, which eventually became romantic in nature. Unbeknownst to White, however, Housman had been involved with Appellant for some time, and was living with her in a trailer park in Newville, Cumberland County. In fact, Appellant and Housman had cohabited for nearly two years, including a period of time in which they previously had resided in Virginia. Some time in August of 2000, Appellant discovered that Housman was dating White, which led to a series of escalating arguments between Appellant and Housman. Around this time, Appellant’s friends and co-workers noticed that Appellant began showing dark bruising around her eyes, neck, and arms, which Appellant attributed to fights between herself and Housman.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Several individuals testified that Appellant also became increasingly temperamental, and expressed her anger toward White by referring to her as a “f — ing bitch” and stating that she would “kick her ass” or “kill her” if she ever got hold of her. At one point, Appellant called White at work, and White appeared frightened immediately afterward.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[199,1995,1149,146]],["BL_514.1",514,[294,322,1162,738]]]'>By the end of August, when Appellant realized that Housman had not terminated his relationship with White, she evicted him from the trailer and changed the lease to reflect <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>her name only. She also called the domestic violence hotline to obtain a protection-from-abuse order due to her fear that Housman might retaliate, and mentioned an incident in which he had previously broken into the trailer. No order was issued, however, because Appellant failed to attend the requisite in-person interview. Moreover, approximately two weeks later, in mid-September of 2000, Appellant and Housman reconciled and she permitted him to move back in. Still, Appellant did not place Housman’s name back on the lease, and she told her probation officer that Housman would have to earn back her trust. Appellant’s probation officer testified that Appellant wanted White to come to the trailer so that Housman could finally terminate his affair with White in Appellant’s presence.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[293,1084,1163,1117]]]'>Within a week after reconciling, Appellant and Housman made plans to move back to Virginia where, it was thought, their relationship would improve. On September 21, 2000, they traveled to an area of southern Virginia where Housman used to work, and told friends that they anticipated relocating to that region. However, shortly after returning to Pennsylvania after this brief visit to Virginia, Appellant suspected that Housman was trying to resume relations with White. Whether or not this was true, it is fairly certain that Housman and White were no longer dating each other at this time. Indeed, White had become involved in with a fellow student at HACC. Nevertheless, there was evidence that Housman had not fully accepted this state of affairs, and Appellant caught Housman in several apparent lies concerning his whereabouts and his dealings with White. Appellant thus concluded that Housman was not being forthright concerning his intentions, which led to another series of altercations culminating on October 2, 2000, when Appellant again required Housman to move out of the trailer. That evening, Housman disabled Appellant’s car by removing wires from the engine; after the police were called to the scene, Housman replaced the wires.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[293,2226,1159,149]],["BL_515.1",515,[216,325,1154,627]]]'>Two days later, on October 4, 2000, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Appellant was seen driving her car, with Housman in the front passenger’s seat, to a local Sheetz gas station/conven<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>ience store. They parked, proceeded to the pay phone, and called White at Wal-Mart to lure her to the trailer (at this time Appellant’s trailer did not have telephone service). Housman placed the call and stated, falsely, that his father had died; he asked White to come to the trailer to console him. According to Appellant, Housman told White that Appellant had gone out of town, and hence, only he (Housman) would be at the trailer when White arrived. This ploy was effective, as White became concerned that Housman might be suicidal over the supposed loss of his father. Thus, she left her shift early at 6:16 p.m. and drove her jeep to the trailer to comfort him.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[211,986,1158,1282]],["BL_516.1",516,[297,336,1152,87]]]'>When White arrived, Housman admitted her into the living room, and the two began to talk. Appellant remained in the bedroom with the door closed, and White initially did not know she was there. Subsequently, while White and Housman were sitting on the couch conversing, Appellant came out of the bedroom and stood by the front door. Appellant testified that she did this because she was having trouble breathing due to her asthma, and needed fresh air.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> She also stated that, just before coming out of the bedroom, she heard White cry out because Housman had hit her on the hand with a hammer, and her hand appeared swollen. In any event, shortly after coming out of the bedroom and standing by the door, Appellant acted together with Housman to subdue White, binding her hands and feet with speaker wire, and placing a large piece of cloth in her mouth, as well as a tight gag over her mouth and around the back of her neck to secure the cloth. With White bound and gagged, Housman and Appellant stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and discuss the situation. Upon returning to the trailer, Appellant held the victim down, while Housman strangled her with speaker wire and the crook of his arm, killing her. During the struggle, White reached up and scratched Appellant on the neck, leaving dark red marks. According to the medical examiner, White died of asphyxiation caused by Housman’s strangulating actions together with the <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>blockage of air due to the cloth stuffed in her mouth. <em>See </em>N.T. 555-56.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[296,454,1158,571]]]'>After the killing, Appellant retrieved a canvas tent from a shed near the trailer while Housman waited inside. She and Housman wrapped the body in the tent and placed it in the back of White’s jeep. They then drove in two cars — with Housman driving White’s jeep, followed by Appellant in her own Buick sedan — to Housman’s father’s home in Franklin County, Virginia. They ultimately disposed of White’s body by placing it in the trunk of an abandoned car in a remote area of neighboring Floyd County, on land owned by Housman’s mother; they also discarded White’s personal effects, except for her camera, which they sold to a pawn shop.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[293,1049,1160,882]]]'>Housman and Appellant remained in southern Virginia for several days, staying alternately with friends of Housman and with Housman’s father, and continuing to drive White’s black jeep, which Housman held out as his own. After White’s parents filed a missing persons report, however, authorities tracked the jeep to Housman’s father’s house. Franklin County Police Officer Brian Vaughn went to the house to investigate, and interviewed Housman and Appellant separately in his patrol car concerning the jeep. At this time, nobody except Housman and Appellant knew that White was dead. While in the officer’s vehicle, Housman indicated that the jeep was borrowed from a friend; he then went back inside his father’s house, and Appellant came out and sat in the police vehicle to answer questions. She did not contradict Housman’s claim that he had borrowed the jeep from a friend; in response to the officer’s questions, she also denied that Housman had ever been abusive toward her.</p>

Notwithstanding these efforts to conceal the evidence, the police soon discovered the jeep, as well as White’s partially-decomposed body in the abandoned car, still bound and gagged. They arrested Appellant and Housman at a friend’s house the evening of October 11, 2000, exactly one week after the <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>murder. The police also retrieved White’s camera from the pawn shop and developed the film inside of it. The film contained several photographs, taken after the murder, that were described for the jury; in one of these photos, Appellant appears to be laughing while Housman pretends to choke her. <em>See </em>N.T. 477.</p>

Each separately confessed to having participated in killing Leslie White. The confessions were recorded on audiotape and transcribed. Housman admitted that he killed White by strangling her, but claimed that Appellant had instigated the homicide to eliminate the source of one of their problems so they could start their relationship anew. He maintained that Appellant had directed him to tie White up and strangle her, and that Appellant forced compliance by hitting him with a hammer that she had in her possession, and then spinning it around in her hand in an apparent threat to use it again if he did not obey her orders. He stated that, after the victim was killed, Appellant, a certified nursing assistant, used a stethoscope to verify the absence of a heartbeat before wrapping the victim’s body in the tent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> For her part, Appellant also conceded that she had participated in the killing, stating that she initially bound and gagged the victim, and later held her down while Housman strangled her. She insisted, however, that Housman concocted the murder scheme in order to steal White’s jeep, and that Housman had coerced Appellant into aiding him in this endeavor by threatening to kill her with a hunting knife if she did not obey his orders. Appellant contended, moreover, that Housman also wore down her resistance by threatening and terrorizing her throughout the previous night, holding a knife to her throat and forcing her to remain naked in the bedroom of the trailer. She omitted any mention of a stethoscope, and stated that she only realized the victim had passed away when <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>the latter’s trousers became wet, indicating a loss of bladder control.</p>

Housman elected not to testify during the guilt phase of the trial. During this phase, the Commonwealth played for the jury an audiotape of Housman’s confession, referenced above. The tape was altered so that references to Appellant were redacted: a different voice from Housman’s, stating, “the other person,” was dubbed over these references.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Before the tape was played, Appellant objected that allowing the jury to hear it in an obviously-redacted form would violate her Sixth Amendment confrontation rights. <em>See </em>N.T. 434-35, 442; <em>see also <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">at 572, 613</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a> (continuing objection).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the jury to hear the tape.

She repeated her specific allegations of coercion on the night of the murder, placing them in the context of a broader pattern of longstanding physical abuse by Housman. She also added significant details concerning the crime, including an assertion that Housman had terrorized her for two lull days prior to the murder, during which time he had cut her clothes off with a knife, repeatedly raped her, and threatened to “put a .45 in [her] head” or “send [her] home in pieces to [her] daughter” if she did not do as he instructed or tried to escape the trailer, and ordered her to write a letter to White stating that she (Appellant) had moved to Virginia and was no longer involved with Housman. <em>See </em>N.T. 985-86, 990, 1006. She stated as well that, when she and Housman went to the Sheetz convenience store, she was not aware that Housman was planning to call White until he actually called her, <em>see </em>N.T. 999, 1169, and that when they returned to the trailer, she tried to escape twice, but each time Housman prevented her from doing so in a violent manner. <em>See </em>N.T. 1005-06. Appellant stated further that, even after White was bound and gagged, she (Appellant) did not know that Housman actually planned to kill her. <em>See </em>N.T. 1003, 1012, 1016, 1107. In this regard, Appellant testified that when she and Housman returned to the trailer after smoking a cigarette, White’s gag had slipped down from her mouth and White requested some water. When Appellant went to the kitchen to get her a glass of water, Appellant heard screaming as Housman began to choke White. According to Appellant, at that point Housman ordered her to come back to the living room and pull the gag back up over White’s mouth. Appellant complied and, after Housman continued to strangle White, it ultimately became apparent that White had died. Appellant maintained that she obeyed Housman during this time and did not attempt to prevent him from choking White because she was afraid that he might kill her as well. <em>See </em>N.T. 1017-18. As for her <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>statement to Officer Vaughn that Housman had never been abusive, she explained that she was only trying to protect Housman. Finally, concerning the photograph, she stated that she was laughing because Housman was poking her in the side and she is ticklish.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[297,617,1162,841]]]'>Based in part upon the above testimony, Appellant requested an instruction on the defense of duress. The trial court refused this request, and the jury ultimately found both defendants guilty on all charges, including first-degree murder. At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury found, as to Appellant, the aggravating circumstance proposed by the Commonwealth — that the killing was committed in perpetration of the felony of kidnapping, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6)— and two mitigating circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The jury determined that the single aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and set the penalty at death.

Presently, it is undisputed that White was not immediately killed after being tied up, and that she was left alone inside the trailer while the perpetrators stepped outside to retrieve cigarettes, smoke them, and discuss what to do next. If White had not been confined as she was, she could have escaped or at least cried out for help; also, the confinement period was sufficient to cause an increased risk of harm due to the blockage of oxygen from the wadded-up rag in her throat. Indeed, the medical examiner identified this blockage as contributing to White’s death at the time she was strangled.

The <em>DeMarco </em>Court determined that there was some basis to conclude that the defendant had acted recklessly, but that there was also evidence tending to negate recklessness. In that matter, DeMarco made statements to the police, and in court, corroborating the allegations of Frank Lawra that a third individual had vandalized Lawra’s automobiles. After it became evident that these allegations were false, DeMarco was charged with several offenses, including perjury and false swearing. He defended himself by claiming that Lawra had coerced him into corroborating the latter’s story. In support of this claim, DeMarco offered proof that he was borderline mentally retarded, and that Lawra had shot him with a B.B. gun, choked him, and threatened to deprive him of his social security checks or kill him if he did not comply. On the other hand, there was evidence that DeMarco failed to seek the assistance of law enforcement authorities in dealing with the alleged duress when he was in the presence of police officers. This Court concluded that this latter evidence raised the possibility that DeMarco was reckless in placing himself in a situation where duress was probable, but did not “ma[k]e it completely obvious, as in <em>Pelzer, </em>that that was the case.” Thus, it was deemed a question of fact for the jury to determine whether DeMarco had acted recklessly. <em>See <a href="/a2d/809/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="809 A.2d 256" data-case-ids="11423686,270285" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0256-01,/pa/570/0263-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/809/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="809 A.2d 256" data-case-ids="11423686,270285" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0256-01,/pa/570/0263-01">at 275-76</a>, <a href="/a2d/809/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="139" data-cite="809 A.2d 256" data-case-ids="11423686,270285" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0256-01,/pa/570/0263-01">809 A.2d at 263-64</a>.</p>

This was corroborated in part by Deborah Baker’s testimony, the two witnesses who observed Appellant’s distraught condition, as well as Housman’s conduct on October 2nd when he disabled Appellant’s vehicle. On the other hand — and similar to <em>DeMarco </em>— Appellant failed to take advantage of potential opportunities to escape Housman’s control. For example, while standing at the payphone, Housman had allegedly placed the knife back in his pocket; thus, Appellant may have been able to run into the store and ask that the police be called. Furthermore, after returning to her trailer, Appellant did not flee the scene when she went to the kitchen to obtain the cloth gag, when she and Housman went outside to smoke a cigarette, or when Housman was choking White and Appellant was close enough to the front door to run out of the trailer and seek help. <em>See </em>Trial Court op. at 85. As in <em>DeMarco, </em>these missed opportunities raise a question of fact as to whether Appellant acted recklessly. It cannot be overlooked, however, that there was also evidence to the effect that: Appellant had been subjected to terrorization, assaults, and death threats over a two-day period immediately prior to these events; she had already tried to escape through both the front and back doors of the trailer, and each time had been violently restrained from doing so by Housman; and Housman was at all relevant times in close proximity to Appellant and in possession of a hunting knife. These factors make this case qualitatively different from <em>Pelzer, </em>in which the defendant admitted that he had entirely removed himself from the alleged coercer’s influence by leaving the scene and going to another house, and then had voluntarily returned to a location where he knew that a violent crime was in progress. We conclude, therefore, that there was conflicting evidence on the issue of whether Appellant was reckless, and thus, Appellant’s actions did not remove the duress issue from the jury’s purview.</p>

We find that, in the circumstances of this case, any connection between the offenses under review and Appellant’s acts or omissions long before they occurred is too attenuated to provide a basis for removing the duress issue from the jury. Although one might argue that Appellant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that she would be physically assaulted by Housman in the future, neither party contends that being the victim of domestic violence, in itself, suggests a probability of being coerced into victimizing a third party.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> Moreover, there is no record <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>basis to think that Appellant would have had reason to believe, as early as mid-September of 2000, that Housman was forming any plans to victimize Leslie White; rather, her suspicions, if anything, were directed to the possibility that Housman might try to resume his relationship with WTiite.</p>

While these omissions may provide circumstantial evidence of recklessness at the time of the kidnapping and murder, we note that Section 303(b), by its terms, focuses upon the acts or omissions of a defendant in placing himself into a duress situation in the first instance. The evidence of Appellant’s actions contemporaneous with the offenses, as noted, was in conflict. Thus, under these circumstances, Appellant’s failing to withdraw from efforts to cover up the completed crimes after they occurred do not constitute a firm enough basis to remove the question of duress from the jury.</p>

In support of its assertion that introduction of the redacted confession was harmless, the dissent also posits that the jury would have understood the “other person” to be Appellant even if the redactions had been completed properly. <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion at 615 ("Under the circumstances, the jury would surely be aware who ‘the other person' was, no matter how obvious or discrete the redaction.”). However, severance is required “if there is a serious risk a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants!.]” <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em><a href="/us/506/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="506 U.S. 534" data-case-ids="11925396" data-case-paths="/us/506/0534-01">506 U.S. 534</a>, <a href="/us/506/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="506 U.S. 534" data-case-ids="11925396" data-case-paths="/us/506/0534-01">113 S.Ct. 933</a>, 938, <a href="/us/506/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="163" data-cite="506 U.S. 534" data-case-ids="11925396" data-case-paths="/us/506/0534-01">122 L.Ed.2d 317</a> (1993). Here, the “specific trial right” is the Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses. <em>Bruton </em>is based on the proposition that the prejudice associated with a blame-shifting statement of a non-testifying codefendant cannot be cured by a jury instruction. <em>Gray </em>rests on the theory that severance is not required if such prejudice is ameliorated through proper redactions. Thus, the dissent’s argument favoring harmless error — that any such amelioration was impossible due to the nature of the case — proves too much; if accepted, it would suggest that Appellant was entitled to a separate trial or exclusion of Housman's statement. Ultimately, however, we need not reach those issues because, in the <em>Bruton </em>context, the Supreme Court has drawn a clear distinction between inferences based on the face of the confession due to improper or missing redactions, and those grounded solely on contextual implication, that is, evidentiary linkage extrinsic to a properly-redacted confession. While the latter category may be acceptable under the Sixth Amendment, the former is not. <em>See Gray, </em><a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="164" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">523 U.S. at 196</a>, <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. at 1157</a>. This distinction is premised on the presumptive efficacy of curative instructions where the jury need not perform the "mental gymnastics” required to consider a facially incriminatory statement only against the nontestifying codefendant. <em>Frazier v. Cupp, </em><a href="/us/394/0731-01" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="394 U.S. 731" data-case-ids="6179959" data-case-paths="/us/394/0731-01">394 U.S. 731</a>, 735, <a href="/us/394/0731-01" class="citation" data-index="167" data-cite="394 U.S. 731" data-case-ids="6179959" data-case-paths="/us/394/0731-01">89 S.Ct. 1420</a>, 1423, <a href="/us/394/0731-01" class="citation" data-index="168" data-cite="394 U.S. 731" data-case-ids="6179959" data-case-paths="/us/394/0731-01">22 L.Ed.2d 684</a> (1969). Because these principles have been set down by the United States Supreme Court, moreover, we must adhere to them notwithstanding the dissent's argument concerning inevitable prejudice. We also note, in this regard, that where the Supreme Court or this Court has judged a <em>Bruton </em>violation to be harmless, it has been due to the presence of overwhelming evidence of guilt apart from the improperly redacted statement, and not because proper redactions would have been ineffectual in any event. <em>See, e.g., Brown v.

Sentencing, 11/5/01, at 1442 (emphasis added). “In deciding whether aggravating or mitigating circumstances exist ... you should consider the evidence and the arguments offered by both the Commonwealth and each defendant. This includes the evidence that you heard during the earlier trial, and any statements [at the penalty phase].” <em>Id., </em>at 1444. "When voting on the general findings, you are to regard a particular aggravating circumstance as present only if you all agree that it is present.” <em>Id., </em>at 1446. "Remember, the <em>Commonwealth must prove any aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., </em>at 1447 (emphasis added).</p>
