Appellee contends that the provisions of the Interlock Law which were struck down and severed by <em>Mockaitis </em>included the provisions that required a driver to install an interlock device, and those provisions formed the sole predicate for PennDOT’s authority to issue an interlock restricted license. Absent those provisions, appellee posits, a recidivist DUI offender cannot be required to install such a device because there is no explicit authority for any entity to order installation. Thus, the predicate conditions for the necessity for an interlock restricted license did not exist following <em>Mockaitis. </em>Appellee notes that the Interlock Law has since been amended and perhaps cured of its substantive defects. However, he argues that it is not this Court’s role to achieve a particular result to control one particular recidivist offender, but rather this Court’s role is to declare the original version of the Interlock Law to be so flawed as to be incapable of proper application.</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[205,1564,1156,801]]]'>This Court’s task is to determine the relationship between Section 7003(2) and <em>Mockaitis </em>to achieve a reasonable reading of the statute as it was affected by the severance of the provisions excising the trial courts’ delegated executive role in the imposition of the interlock requirement. As Penn-DOT argues, the plain language of Section 7003(2) clearly dictates that a person subject to the Interlock Law must apply to PennDOT for an interlock restricted license as a condition of the restoration of his driving privileges, or suffer a further term of license suspension. The question then becomes whether, as PennDOT urges, that requirement necessarily assumes authority in PennDOT to enforce the interlock requirement or whether, as appellee claims, the predicate authority for imposing the interlock requirement ceased to exist when this Court decided <em>Mockaitis.</em>

Any interpretation of Section 7003 is necessarily complicated by the fact that this Court struck and severed the provisions in the prior Interlock Law requiring the trial courts to order installation of ignition interlock devices when sentencing DUI offenders.

The General Assembly plainly intended that individuals whose licenses are suspended because of a second or subsequent DUI conviction must install interlock devices in their vehicles prior to the restoration of their operating privileges. In addition to mandating that trial courts impose the interlock requirement at the time of DUI sentencing (well in advance of any application for license restoration), the legislation also provided a failsafe mechanism for ensuring compliance under Section 7003(2). Section 7003(2) thus directed that a driver who would have his driving privileges restored at the conclusion of his license suspension must apply to PennDOT for an interlock restricted license. These dual provisions were designed to maximize the chances that the purpose of the legislation would be furthered — that is, that habitual DUI offenders would not be able to start and drive their cars without first demonstrating, <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>through use of the interlock device, that they were not intoxicated.

Moreover, when the <em>Mockaitis </em>Court severed the provisions mandating that the sentencing court order the installation of the interlock device and monitor compliance, we made clear our view that the Interlock Law could still be implemented.

      <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>We noted in <em>Mockaitis </em>that our holding that the Ignition Interlock Law improperly delegated executive responsibilities to the sentencing court did not require striking the Act in its entirety. With the unconstitutional provisions severed, we determined that the remaining portions of the statute, specifically § 7003(2), still required recidivist DUI offenders seeking restoration of driving privileges to apply to the Department for an ignition interlock restricted license. Furthermore, we concluded that § 7003(3), which was not severed, precluded an offender in possession of such a restricted license from operating any motor vehicle on a highway in the Commonwealth unless that vehicle was equipped with an approved ignition interlock system. <em>Mockaitis, </em><a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="575 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="630448" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01">575 Pa. at 29-30</a>, <a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="834 A.2d 488" data-case-ids="630448,9080480" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01,/a2d/834/0488-01">834 A.2d at 502-503</a>. Accordingly, since the remaining provisions of the Interlock Ignition Law prevented recidivist DUI offenders from lawfully operating motor vehicles unless they possessed an approved limited license and drove a properly-equipped vehicle, we concluded that “the remaining provisions of the Act still authorize the Department to impose an ignition interlock restriction upon serial DUI offenders who seek restoration of their operating privileges at the expiration of the one-year mandatory suspension of their licenses.” <em><a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="834 A.2d 488" data-case-ids="630448,9080480" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01,/a2d/834/0488-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="575 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="630448" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01">575 Pa. at 31</a>, <a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="834 A.2d 488" data-case-ids="630448,9080480" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01,/a2d/834/0488-01">834 A.2d at 503</a>.</p>

I respectfully disagree. In <em>Mockaitis, </em>we determined that the Ignition Interlock Law improperly delegated executive responsibility to the courts. Thus, the provisions of the Ignition Interlock Law which delegated this authority were severed by this Court from the remainder of the statute. Accordingly, the Ignition Interlock Law was left without procedure granting any entity the authority to order installation of ignition interlock devices.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> To permit the Department to order offend<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>ers to install ignition interlock devices would be to read into the statute language that the Legislature did not include or intend to include. In enacting the former Ignition Interlock Law, the Legislature expressly, albeit improperly, placed in the courts alone the authority to order offenders to install ignition interlock devices. The determination in <em>Mockaitis </em>that the courts were precluded, by the doctrine of separation of powers, from ordering installation of ignition interlock devices and certifying compliance with those orders, does not permit this Court to substitute the statutory language of the former Ignition Interlock Law and place authority in the Department to order installation of such devices where the Legislature awarded the Department no such authority. “We may not supply words which are not to be found in the statute and so give to it a meaning which it otherwise does not have.” <em>Calvert Distillers Corp. v.

As we determined in <em>Mockaitis, </em>however, this does not leave the statute incapable of execution. The Department may employ the remaining valid portions of the Ignition Interlock Law to effectuate the legislative requirement that serial DUI offenders must obtain an ignition interlock restricted license in order to have their driving privileges restored. <em>Mockaitis, </em><a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="575 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="630448" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01">575 Pa. at 9</a>, <a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="834 A.2d 488" data-case-ids="630448,9080480" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01,/a2d/834/0488-01">834 A.2d at 490</a>; 42 Pa.C.S. § 7003(2).
