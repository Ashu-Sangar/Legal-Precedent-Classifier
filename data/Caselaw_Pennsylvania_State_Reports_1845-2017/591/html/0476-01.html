The court reasoned that Claimant was only aggrieved after he attended the IRE, when Employer sought to reduce his benefits. Therefore, Claimant did not waive the issue of timeliness by waiting until he obtained the results of the IRE to object to its timeliness. However, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that the Workers’ Compensation Act did not preclude an employer from filing its IRE request prior to the expiration of the 104 week period. The court determined that Claimant was not prejudiced by the timing of Employer’s IRE request, particularly in light of the fact that the actual medical examination did not occur until after 104 weeks. Furthermore, the Court reasoned that following the IRE, Claimant could have filed an appeal directly contesting the change of his disability benefits, and therefore Claimant was not without an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the court affirmed the decision of WCAB. The Commonwealth Court did not address any of the issues surrounding Employer’s second IRE request.</p>

In <em>Gardner, </em>the employer attempted to obtain an automatic reduction in the claimant’s benefits by submitting an IRE request over two and a half years <em>beyond </em>the date that the claimant had received total disability benefits for the statutory period of 104 weeks. This Court engaged in statutory interpretation of Section 511.2(1) to determine the precise obligations the section placed on employers seeking an IRE. We found that the language in Section 511.2(1) created a mandatory requirement that an employer seeking an automatic reduction in benefits request an IRE within sixty days from the date a claimant had received total disability benefits for 104 weeks, citing the <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>General Assembly’s repeated use of the word “shall.” <em>Gardner, </em><a href="/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="888 A.2d 765">888 A.2d 765</a>-66. This Court noted that, if Section 511.2(1) were deemed “merely directory” and did not impose an obligation on both the employer to request an IRE and the claimant to attend, a claimant could decline to attend the IRE and thus “frustrate the cost-containment objectives of Section 511.2.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="888 A.2d 765">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="888 A.2d 765">at 765</a>. Furthermore, the <em>Gardner </em>Court observed that while other sections of the Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> permitted an employer to request an evaluation of a claimant’s condition beyond the statutory time-frame in Section 511.2(1), relief in such instances could only come through an adjudication if it were determined in an evaluation that claimant’s condition had improved. <em><a href="/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="888 A.2d 765">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="888 A.2d 765">at 766</a>.</p>
    <p id="b739-4" data-blocks='[["BL_739.5",739,[198,1053,1158,1236]]]'>An early IRE request (as here) does not pose the same issue as the belated request at issue in <em>Gardner. </em>Just as principles of statutory construction guided us in <em>Gardner, </em>we are obliged to utilize those principles in this matter. Section 1922(1) of the Statutory Construction Act sets forth a presumption that the General Assembly did not intend a construction of a statute that is “absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1). In my mind, it is absurd to rule against an employer based upon a premature IRE request, and it is particularly absurd to so hold under the particular circumstances in the case <em>sub judice. </em>An early request for an IRE does not prejudice a claimant in the same way that a belated request does, so long as the IRE is conducted after the 104-week statutory period, because Section 511.2(1) places claimants on notice as to when they might expect an evaluation and subsequent modification of benefits absent a hearing. Indeed, the Claimant is not particularly prejudiced at all. Claimant could not have been surprised or prejudiced by Employer’s request, as it was made approximately two months prior to the ending date that the WCJ determined he had received total disability benefits for 104 weeks, and the IRE was scheduled and took place over a month following Claimant’s receipt of benefits for 104 weeks.</p>
    <p id="b740-3" data-blocks='[["BL_740.4",740,[294,330,1163,1360]]]'>
      <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>Moreover, as this very case illustrates, it is particularly absurd to mindlessly punish an employer because there was a dispute respecting the proper calculation of the 104-week period. In this case, Employer requested an IRE based on credible evidence that Claimant had received benefits for 104 weeks. However, the parties disputed from the start of litigation the beginning date on which Claimant had received benefits with respect to the statutory period. The Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) noted that Claimant had begun receiving total disability benefits starting on April 18, 1997. Despite Employer’s argument that the 104-week period from April 18, 1997 ended on April 14, 1999, Claimant’s contention that the correct ending date was July 23, 1999 prevailed. The WCJ’s reasons for finding Claimant’s calculation more persuasive than Employer’s calculation are not apparent, but it is obvious that Employer’s calculation was fair and not an attempt to circumvent the plain language of Section 511.2(1). In a circumstance like this, it is indeed absurd to invalidate Employer’s technically valid IRE request, particularly based on unexplained findings from the WCJ. I cannot see how the purpose of Section 511.2(1) is offended, or the parties harmed, where Employer, according to the WCJ’s finding, requested an IRE just prior to the date that Claimant had received total disability benefits for 104 weeks, and the IRE occurred after Claimant had received benefits for the statutory period.</p>

Even assuming that the WCJ’s finding with respect to the date that Claimant had received total disability benefits for 104 weeks was correct, allowing an Employer to receive the benefit of automatic statutory relief under the circumstances presented here does not offend this essential lesson. Based on the foregoing reasons, I would find that Employer submitted an IRE request in accordance with the <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>statutory time-frame established in Section 511.2(1).

Although § 511.2(l)’s language requires a claimant to submit to an IRE, the employer is being penalized because it did not request such examination within 60 days “upon the expiration” of the 104 weeks of total disability compensation. The statute is clearly intended to have an employer make the relevant request promptly, yet the employer here is being penalized for acting <em>too </em>promptly. The employer requested the IRE May 20, 1999, which was prior to the July 28 expiration of the 104-week period. Knowing this, Claimant nevertheless attended the IRE September 1, 1999, without objection to the exam, much less the timeliness of the request. Claimant filed a Petition to Review Compensation Benefits in response to employer’s Notice of Change of Workers’ Compensation Disability, and only then asserted employer requested the IRE too soon; by the time he objected, he had undergone the IRE, thus waiving any objection to the timeliness of the request.</p>

To hold the IRE is void because of Claimant’s tardy claim that it was requested too soon — timely conducted, but requested too soon — is affording Claimant a remedy for which he has no prejudice or damage. It is ironic that Claimant here is the tardy one; he complained too late about Employer giving too much notice, and somehow prevails.</p>
