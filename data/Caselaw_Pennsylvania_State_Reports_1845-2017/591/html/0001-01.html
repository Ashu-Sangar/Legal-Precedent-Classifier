The evidence presented at trial and the penalty phase hearings demonstrates that Eichinger stabbed Heather Greaves in the abdomen with a knife. He then slashed the throat of Avery Johnson who called for help. He then stabbed Lisa Greaves 35 times, returned to Avery to stab her in the back and finally stabbed Heather in the diaphragm and then slashed her throat. Based on his own admissions there is no question that it was Eichinger who killed the victims, and that he did so with premeditated intent. Eichinger further confirmed his actions and their deliberate nature in a 90-page-personal journal that he published to his brother from his prison cell.

The Commonwealth does not respond to this argument, but the trial court, although it cited to New Jersey law, found that New Jersey has no jurisdiction over the homicide charges and related offenses in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and that, therefore, <em>State v.

It is necessary to first inquire if there is, in fact, a conflict between the substantive laws of interested states. Here the key phrase is “interested states.” In matter of substantive criminal law, as in the civil context, Pennsylvania seeks to apply the policy of the jurisdiction most immediately concerned with the outcome of the legal issue.

The Due Process Clause prohibits a state from applying its substantive laws to a set of facts which have no substantial connection with the state. Leflar, <em>supra </em>at 48. In the area of criminal law, this substantial connection has long been grounded in the concept of a state’s sovereignty over its own territory, therefore requiring a physical connection between the state and the incident in question in order to invoke a state’s interest in applying its <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>law. <em>Id. </em>at 45.

The only possible connection to the State of New Jersey was Eichinger’s physical presence there on March 25 through the 28th, 2005. The record demonstrates that Eichinger talked to the police during his ride from New Jersey to Pennsylvania, so logically we can postulate that it is possible that some of that conversation may have occurred physically in New Jersey. But the record is entirely devoid of any proof on this point. Eichinger adopted the testimony presented by the Commonwealth at the PreTrial Hearing of September 15, 2005, but there was no mention during that hearing by the Commonwealth’s witness, Detective Nilsen of exactly where they were when Eichinger made his statement. Although we will only consider the Commonwealth’s evidence because of Eichinger’s stipulation, it is notable that when Eichinger took the stand at the PreTrial Hearing, he also made no mention of his location when he made his statement. We have only a bald assertion in Eichinger’s brief to this Court that the statement was made while Eichinger was still physically in New Jersey. This represents a failure of proof on Eichinger’s part. He did not meet his burden to establish, as a matter of fact, that there was any nexus between the state of New Jersey and the transaction at issue. The Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution requires not only a mere connection, but a substantial one in order to apply New Jersey law. As there is no connection of any sort established on the record, we need go no further in a conflict of law analysis, and we will apply the law of Pennsylvania.</p>

In a false conflict situation, it appears facially that the laws of two states directly conflict with one another. But deeper inquiry reveals that although one state has a conflicting law, the purposes behind that law demonstrates that the state does not in fact have an interest in the question. Courts have recognized that there are many factual situations where, although two jurisdictions have nominal contacts with the transaction, only one jurisdiction is truly concerned with the result. <em>See, e.g. Kuchinic v.
