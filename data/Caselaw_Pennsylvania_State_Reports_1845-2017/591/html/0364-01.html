The Superior Court disregarded the first part of this inquiry, and summarily disposed of the latter part with a single sentence: “As Appellant’s claim implicates the legality of his sentence, Appellant may appeal as of right.” Super. Ct. Slip Op. at 2 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Were the latter proposition unproblematic, we might well decide similarly; if the sentence clearly implicates the legality of sentence, whether it was properly preserved below is of no moment, as a challenge to the legality of sentence cannot be waived. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Aponte, </em><a href="/pa/579/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="579 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1370939" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0246-01">579 Pa. 246</a>, <a href="/a2d/855/0800-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="855 A.2d 800" data-case-ids="12254885,1370939" data-case-paths="/a2d/855/0800-01,/pa/579/0246-01">855 A.2d 800</a>, 802 n. 1 (2004).

He then quotes an exchange in which he argued that “applying the mandatory minimum takes away the discretion of the court to impose a lesser sentence” and that his case called for precisely the sort of downward deviation precluded by a mandatory sentence. Reply Brief for Appellant at 3 (quoting N.T., 3/25/02, at 3-4). The court, however, cut off Appellant’s argument, observing, “I think case law is supportive of the Commonwealth’s position. I have no discretion.” N.T., 3/25/02, at 4. Focusing on the trial court’s statement precluding further argument on the application of the mandatory minimum sentence, Appellant argues that “[w]here, as here, the trial court correctly recognized [A]ppellant’s claim in its nascency <em>[sic </em>], but cut [A]ppellant off before it could be fully articulated based upon a clear line of extant appellate authority, it would be unreasonable and unfair to hold the claim waived.” Reply Brief for Appellant at 4.</p>

In context, the relevant colloquy reveals that Appellant exhausted his argument regarding whether the conspiracy conviction concerned the underlying theft or robbery charges, and indeed the court resolved any uncertainty when it stated on the record that the conspiracy charge applied to robbery. Upon losing that argument, Appellant shifted gears to make a brief argument under <em>Apprendi </em>and then segued seamlessly into his argument that <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>the consequence of the mandatory minimum was more harsh than this case warranted.</p>
    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[296,450,1159,1008]]]'>The Commonwealth is correct insofar as Appellant never explicitly argued that § 9712 cannot apply in this case because Appellant was not armed. Whether this deficiency occurred because counsel did not entirely appreciate the issue or because the court cut counsel off mid-argument to preempt any further discussion is something we cannot know at this time. What we do know is that counsel argued that Appellant’s conduct differed from his co-defendant’s to an extent counsel believed should have taken Appellant’s case outside application of the mandatory minimum. The trial court clearly ruled it had “no discretion.” N.T., 3/25/02, at 5. The court having made itself clear, we will not punish counsel for declining to resist the trial court’s unequivocal effort to cut off conversation on this point. Accordingly, because we disagree with the Commonwealth’s characterization of Appellant’s argument before the trial court, and find implicit in that argument the § 9712 argument raised before the Superior Court and now this Court, we conclude that Appellant preserved the issue for appellate review.</p>

The trial court declined to impose the five-year minimum sentence on Williams in part because Williams never visibly possessed the gun during the commission of the cilme. <em>Id. </em>at 1293.

Finding no dispositive Pennsylvania caselaw concerning the section’s applicability to an unarmed co-conspirator, the court moved directly to an analysis of foreign jurisdictions’ resolutions of similar questions under their corollary statutes. Having reviewed the cases, and identifying no conclusive trend in favor of either disposition, the court concluded that it was “persuaded by the case law in those jurisdictions which impose the minimum sentence of confinement on an unarmed accomplice who has knowledge that a firearm is employed in the commission of the pertinent felony.” <em>Id. </em>at 1295. The court, in rationalizing its conclusion, found it “anomalous to sentence the armed felon in accordance with the minimum sentence, while not similarly punishing an accomplice who is otherwise legally accountable for the actions of the armed felon,” especially where the unarmed accomplice “saw the gun in question, knew it was to be used in perpetration of the robbery and pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and the robbery.” <em>Id. </em>Without addressing ourselves to the court’s analysis of foreign caselaw in <em>Williams, </em>which we find unnecessary to the disposition of the instant question, we have reservations about a holding couched exclusively in terms of the potentiality of “anomalous” outcomes that ignores the <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>statutory language in question.

It argues that because sometimes a party guilty of solicitation to commit a crime will not be present at the scene, the legislature must have intended that even a co-conspirator not present during the commission of the offense might incur the mandatory minimum sentence where his cohort brandished a firearm during the commission of the underlying crime. That one soliciting a criminal act often will not be present at the scene of the crime, however, does not preclude such a party from actively participating in the crime.

If the legislature intended to accede to existing caselaw expanding § 9712 to apply beyond its terms to parties who themselves did not visibly possess firearms during the commission of the offense, <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>its addition of co-conspirators to the definition would be redundant, as Superior Court precedent already provided for application of the mandatory minimum to unarmed co-conspirators. To the extent this connotation creates uncertainty regarding the legislature’s intent, we are bound by 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928 and <em>Wooten </em>to construe § 9712 strictly in favor of the defendant. Nor does this reading render the new categories of offenders added to the definition furnished by § 9714(g) gratuitous or ineffective. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2). By its terms, the § 9714(g) definition is applicable to its use “in this section.” A review of the balance of § 9714, which provides various mandatory sentences for repeat offenders, reveals that the term “crime of violence” is used repeatedly therein in ways that do not bear on § 9712. Moreover, had the legislature intended to modify the definition of “crime of violence” expressly for purposes of § 9712, it seems unlikely that it would have done so by burying the amendment in another, largely unrelated section, instead of merely modifying the definition that had until then been contained within § 9712 itself. Nothing in the 1995 amendments suggests that we should not read § 9712 by its plain terms to require <em>both </em>that the offense in question constitute a crime of violence (as defined in § 9714(g)) <em>and </em>that the particular offender in question have visibly possessed a firearm to incur the mandatory minimum.</p>

It is true that in 1995, the legislature moved the description of to whom the § 9712(a) mandatory minimum sentence would apply to § 9714(g) and modified that definition to include the inchoate crimes of conspiracy and solicitation, the latter at least suggesting that one need not even be present at the commission of the crime in question to be guilty of a “crime of violence,” just as the Commonwealth has observed. Nevertheless, § 9712(a) provides in unequivocal and unambiguous language that it applies to a person convicted of a crime of violence <em>“if the person </em>” visibly possessed a firearm or firearm replica during the commission of the crime. To read the language for what it appears to say neither brings any two sections of the statute into conflict nor renders any part of either section legally ineffective, in light of the fact that the § 9714(g) definition does double duty, furnishing a relevant definition for itself as well as § 9712(a). Reading these provisions together, according to their plain meaning, requires us to agree that a crime of violence occurs even in case of the solicitation by an absent party. Under § 9712(a), however, unless that soliciting party “visibly possesses” a firearm or <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>firearm replica “during the commission of the crime” he does not fall within the class of offenders to which § 9712(a) applies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

Mr. Chief Justice Cappy raises valid concerns regarding the soundness of our decision in <em>Lock. </em>That we acknowledge those concerns as valid, however, does not mean, as Mr. Justice Castille assumes, that we believe <em>Lock </em>was wrongly decided. Our disposition of this case, rather, does not depend on resolving these concerns, as it hinges solely on the plain language of §§ 9712(a) and 9714(g). As noted, where the plain language of a statutory provision clearly signals legislative intent, we do not disregard that language in pursuit of its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). We have addressed the parties' arguments from extra-textual indicia of legislative intent only to reject them as failing to demonstrate any reason to depart from the plain language of the relevant provisions. Moreover, because we find the statutory language conclusive of legislative intent, we need not reach questions concerning the effect of 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(4) and the meaning and validity of our decision in <em>Lock, </em>because § 1922(4) and <em>Lock </em>speak to one of several means by which we discern legislative intent when the language in question is less than conclusive. We find it ill-advised, generally, to consider substantial questions not squarely presented and fully argued by the parties below and before this Court. <em>See Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/588/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="588 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="3788063" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0019-01">588 Pa. 19</a>, <a href="/pa/588/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="902 A.2d 430" data-case-ids="3788063,8413579" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0019-01,/a2d/902/0430-01">902 A.2d 430</a> (2006). Although the Commonwealth argues in its Brief for Appellee that <em>Lock </em>dictates our affirmance in this case, neither the Commonwealth nor Appellant in his Reply Brief argues that <em>Lock </em>be abrogated. Denied the benefit of argument on this question, and finding <em>Lock </em>inapplicable in any event, we choose not to reach outside the ambit of our review in this case to upset a case of considerable vintage.</p>

Section 1922(4) of the Act focuses on an interpretation of a statute by the “court of last resort.” There is no question that the Superior Court is not the “court of last resort” in Pennsylvania-it is the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

As noted by the Majority, this approach fails to appreciate that our denial of allocatur of an intermediate court decision is not an endorsement of or rejection of the intermediate appellate court’s decision. Majority Opinion at 384-85 fn.14, 918 A.2d at 108 fn.14; <em>see also Commonwealth v.

Section 9712 is not obscure or rarely applied, nor is it rarely applied to unarmed confederates in a crime; the mandatory sentence literally is applied on a daily basis in courts throughout the Commonwealth. The General Assembly has had twenty years to undo the holding in <em>Williams, </em>if it thought it incorrect and thought that criminal confederates deserved more lenient treatment than the person who brandished the firearm. I do not believe it strained or ephemeral to conclude that the Legislature’s failure to alter the statute, under these circumstances, signifies its satisfaction with the prevailing construction. Accordingly, I would not recast the jurisprudence today, but instead would leave any amendment to the judgment of the General Assembly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>

It should not alienate a trial judge that a lawyer seeks to protect his client’s interest; and I trust in the professionalism of our trial judges to recognize what is an exercise of prudent caution and not to react adversely thereto.” In this case, the failure was not one of non-repetition; rather, appellant simply never forwarded the relevant objection. A proper objection could easily and candidly have been phrased thus: "Your Honor, I concede (as is my duty) that the law at the Superior Court level (which binds you), is settled, is against me, and affords you no discretion but to impose the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Respectfully, however, I wish to register an objection to the application of the mandatory minimum against my client, who was but an unarmed co-conspirator, so as to preserve that issue in the hope that, upon further review, I can convince our Supreme Court to rule upon the issue, which it has not expressly done to date.”</p>
