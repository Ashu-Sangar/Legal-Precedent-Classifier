Section 1921(a) of the Statutory Construction Act instructs that we interpret a statute as a whole.

Such a purchase of UM/UIM coverage occurred under the facts presented in this case, but the insured was denied the opportunity to waive the increased amount of available stacked UM/UIM coverage.

Prior to July 25, 2000, the Appellants, Victor M. and Diana L. Sackett, insured two vehicles on an automobile insurance policy issued by Appellee Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. Mr. <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>Sackett was the first named insured under the policy issued by Appellee. On July 26, 2000, the Appellants acquired a third vehicle, a 2000 Ford Windstar, which required the Sacketts to purchase additional insurance. On August 5, 2000, Appellant Victor M. Sackett was injured in a motor vehicle. Mr. Sackett was riding as a passenger in a vehicle driven by Robert J. Bulger. The Bulger vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by an underinsured motorist, Charlynne A. Dicks. Mr. Sackett sustained injuries as a result of the accident.</p>

While the conclusion in <em>Smith </em>was required by the relevant statutory language of Sections 1731 and 1791, the instant matter raises a different question, because <em>Smith </em>did not involve <em>stacking </em>of UM/UIM coverage, or Section 1738 of the MVFRL in any way. The addition of another vehicle to a policy <em>with </em>UIM coverage raises different concerns than those addressed by Sections 1731 and 1791. Finally, the <em>Smith </em>decision, issued by a lower court, has no binding effect on this Court. For these reasons, we find that <em>Smith </em>has no bearing on the outcome of the instant matter.</p>

      <em>Rupert, </em>like <em>Smith, </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Rupert, </em>the Third Circuit faced a different but related question of whether a valid waiver of stacked UM/UIM coverage remains effective after the current “first named insured” changes, or must a new waiver form be issued and new rejections executed by the new “first named insured” in order for the validity of the original waiver of stacked UM/UIM coverage to continue. In <em>Rupert, </em>the original first named insured died. The surviving husband, who was added to the policy after the waiver was made, claimed the insurer was required to provide him with a waiver form when he became the first named insured following his wife’s death. Because he executed no such waiver, the surviving husband argued, “the waiver of stacking was not valid as applied to him.” <em>Rupert, </em><a href="/f3d/291/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="291 F.3d 243" data-case-ids="9429766" data-case-paths="/f3d/291/0243-01">291 F.3d at 245</a>.

Adding a vehicle to an existing policy constitutes a purchase within the meaning of the statute and entitles insureds who select UM/ UIM coverage the opportunity to waive the new sum of available stacked limits of that coverage. Only in the area of stacking is the sum of available coverage dependent on the number of vehicles on the policy. This sum, of course, is increased each time an insured purchases coverage for an additional vehicle.

Stated otherwise, under the language of Section 1738 it was not possible at the inception of the policy, when the Sacketts had just two vehicles, for Mr. Sackett to waive the stacked limits for three vehicles. This is because the new sum of stacked limits became available only <em>after </em>the <em>purchase </em>of UM/UIM coverage for the Ford Winds-tar occurred. Prior to the addition of the Ford Windstar, the available sum of stacked UM/UIM coverage limits under the Sacketts’ policy was $200,000.00. Yet, the available stacked limit increased substantially to $300,000.00 when the Sacketts purchased UM/UIM coverage lor the Ford Windstar.

However, in Section 1738, the provision of stacked UM/UIM coverage is the default coverage limit established by the General Assembly. An insured must affirmatively waive stacked coverage in order to pay a reduced premium. Thus, it is incorrect to state there is no remedy. Rather, without the waiver, coverage is provided by the statute itself.</p>

This question is driven by the need to assess the continued viability, if any, of the initial waiver of stacked UM/UIM coverage, which Mr. Sackett executed on August 5, 1998. Section 1738(a) provides that the limits of UM/UIM coverage, absent a valid waiver, “shall be the sum of the limits for each motor vehicle as to which the injured person is an insured.” As explained above, the sum of stacked coverage limits available to the Sacketts, after purchasing coverage for the Ford Windstar, was $300,000.00. As set forth above, there was no valid waiver of <em>this </em>sum. Nationwide failed to inform the Sacketts of the new sum of available coverage.

At the inception of their policy, appellants had insured two automobiles with Nationwide and had specifically rejected stacking their UM/UIM benefits, a selection which reduced their premium payments. On July 26, 2000, appellants added a third vehicle to their existing Nationwide policy. Appellants did not request a stacking option for the new vehicle, and Nationwide did not seek or secure a new waiver of stacking at that point. Ten days later, Victor Sackett was injured in the accident that gave rise to this litigation. After collecting the policy limits on the policies insuring the two drivers involved in the accident, appellants sought underinsured motorist benefits under their Nationwide policy, asserting that they were entitled to stacked benefits because they did not reject stack<a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>ing when they added the third vehicle to the policy. Nationwide responded that coverage was unstacked for all three vehicles in accordance with the stacking waiver appellants had executed at the inception of the policy.</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.5",684,[297,568,1160,636]]]'>The crux of appellant’s argument on appeal is that when a new vehicle is added to an existing policy, the insurer must offer a new waiver of stacking form, and the failure to do so automatically results in the insurer being deemed liable for stacked benefits. Nationwide counters that there is nothing in the language of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (“MVFRL”) that requires the execution of a new waiver when a new vehicle is added to an existing policy, and that the waiver appellants executed at the inception of the policy applies, resulting in unstacked benefits. I agree with Nationwide that the statute does not require a new waiver, and this Court should not interpose such a requirement.</p>

      <em>75 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1738(a)-(c). Nothing in the statutory language explicitly addresses the factual scenario presented <em>here </em>— i.e., the statute does not state that when an insured adds an additional vehicle to an existing policy, new waivers must be executed. Nevertheless, the Majority today reads such a requirement into Section 1738(c) by concluding that the addition of the third vehicle to appellants’ existing multi-vehicle policy constituted an entirely new purchase of insurance, reasoning that appellants could not have purchased insurance for the third vehicle prior to acquiring that vehicle. It follows, according to the Majority, that appellants could not have waived stacked benefits relative to the third vehicle at a time when they only owned two vehicles. Because Nationwide failed to provide appellants with an opportunity to waive stacking when they added the third vehicle, the Majority finds that appellants did not waive stacking for the third vehicle.</p>

      <em>75 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1791 (emphasis supplied). The Majority dismisses the clear language of this Section as irrelevant because the Section does not explicitly discuss the effect of adding a vehicle on an existing waiver of stacking. Such a facile dismissal of clear legislative intent is, in my opinion, unwarranted.</p>

      <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>The legislative branch is not obliged to list all possible, specific applications of a general statutory provision or principle. Section 1791 is an unambiguous expression of the General Assembly’s intention that insurers need only provide insureds with notices or rejections relative to their coverage at the inception of the policy. Section 1791 obviously was intended to ease the burden on insurers by expressly not requiring them to provide new notices or rejections on every occasion when an insured makes some change to existing coverage. Insured motorists typically make many changes in their insurance policies during the lifetime of a given policy: substituting a new vehicle for an insured vehicle; adding an additional vehicle, deleting a vehicle, adding or deleting insured family members; increasing or decreasing coverages or deductibles. In very plain language, Section 1791 directs that an insurer is not required to provide new notices or rejections whenever such an event occurs. Although Nationwide could have sought new rejections of coverage when appellants added the third vehicle to their policy, nothing in the statute obliged them to do so. The failure of the General Assembly to require such administrative redundancy makes logical sense as appellants did not purchase a new policy, but simply added a vehicle to an existing policy. The same policy appellants purchased in 1998 remained in effect, and the original waiver of stacking was part of that policy.</p>

In this instance, the Majority’s decision thwarts this policy in two ways. First, requiring insurers to provide new rejections when an insured makes a policy change imposes a burden on insurers that could, and likely will, result in costs of compliance being passed on to insureds. Second, the Majority awards appellants a benefit <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>for which they did not pay premiums. The costs to insurers of providing benefits to insureds for which premiums were not paid will certainly increase premiums for other insureds.
