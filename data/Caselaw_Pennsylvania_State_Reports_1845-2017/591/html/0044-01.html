Thus, Appellants possessed both the payments made under the contract as well as the property itself. Assuming such cause of action is viable, it is at this point that the right to maintain the unjust enrichment action arose. At this time neither Appellants nor James were able to maintain an action to enforce the contract or to recover contractual damages because the contract as a source of rights and obligations between the parties ceased to exist. As such, Appellants could expect no further payment from James. “As long as the seller remains ready, able, and willing to perform a contract for the sale of real property, the breaching vendee has no right to restitution of payments made prior to his default.” <em>Lancellotti, </em><a href="/pa-super/341/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="341 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="631061" data-case-paths="/pa-super/341/0001-01">491 A.2d at 121</a>, citing 5A <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>§§ 1122-1135, 1130 (1964). Thus, any <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>right to restitution arose when the contract between the parties ceased. The Superior Court’s analysis of the limitations question improperly placed the focus on the computation of damages. In the event the property did not sell within four years from the date the contract was terminated, the breaching vendee could prove the amount of the vendor’s windfall through the expert testimony of an appraiser that would establish the property’s present value.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
