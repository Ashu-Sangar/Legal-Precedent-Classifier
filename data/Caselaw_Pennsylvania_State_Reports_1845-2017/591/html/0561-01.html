Commissioner Kenneth T. McCabe suggested that background investigations be outsourced, and the Board discussed three private firms as potential investigators.

Petitioners assert that their challenge is of a constitutional dimension. They argue that the Board must be deemed a legislative body, citing its composition and the statutory requirements regarding what constitutes a voting majority as proof of the correctness of that characterization. In petitioners’ view, the Board’s composition — four members appointed by the General Assembly, three by the Governor — proves that it is a legislative agency because a majority of its members are legislative appointees, it exercises a legislative prerogative in its rule-making function, it provides for legislative regulation of the gaming industry, and it serves as a legislative oversight within the gaming structure. <em>See 4 </em>Pa.C.S. §§ 1201, 1202. Petitioners further maintain that the Board’s exemption from the provisions of the Administrative Code buttresses its view that the Board is a legislative agency. <em>See <a href="/pa/583/0274-02" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="877 A.2d 383" data-case-ids="687750,687765,687766,8955098,8955131,8955235" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0274-02,/pa/583/0274-01,/pa/583/0275-01,/a2d/877/0383-01,/a2d/877/0383-02,/a2d/877/0383-03">id.</a> </em>§ 1203.

Those executive powers and functions, petitioners claim, include the powers of law enforcement implicit in the Board’s duty to conduct background investigations and to require fingerprinting of all applicants for licenses or permits.

First, the Board argues that the law of Pennsylvania requires that a complaint define the issues presented sufficiently to convey notice of the grounds for such suit so that the defendant is not left to guess at the substance of the allegations. Here, according to the Board, petitioners failed to satisfy this burden in that they failed to plead that the Act is unconstitutional. Instead, the four counts of the Petition for Review seek: a declaratory judgment concerning the propriety of the Board’s actions in entering into procurement contracts with outside investigation firms (Counts I and II); <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>an order in mandamus compelling the Board to rescind its approval of the emergency and competitive procurement processes (Count III); and an order enjoining the Board from awarding any contracts on the ground that such contracts violate the Commonwealth Procurement Code, 62 Pa.C.S. § 101 <em>et seq. </em>(Count IV). Thus, the Board contends, it is clear that each count of the Petition for review challenges the Board’s conduct, not the constitutionality of the Act, and no count expressly requests that this Court find any part of the Gaming Act to be unconstitutional. The Board argues that the substance of the Petition for Review makes clear that this Court lacks jurisdiction because no constitutional challenge is posed.</p>
    <p id="b821-4" data-blocks='[["BL_821.5",821,[190,1039,1153,900]]]'>With respect to <em>Stackhouse, </em>the Board claims that the decision in that case actually supports a finding that this Court lacks jurisdiction. In <em>Stackhouse, </em>the plaintiff claimed that its request for declaratory and injunctive relief brought the claim within the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. A majority of this Court disagreed, finding that the essence of the complaint sounded in trespass, and therefore was properly within the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas Court. The Board notes that a fair reading of the Petition for Review in the case <em>sub judice </em>reveals that the substance and essence of petitioners’ complaint is that the Board acted improperly under the Act by outsourcing background investigations, rather than assigning them to the State Police. The Board argues that the existence of tangential averments in the petition that the Board is a legislative agency usurping executive powers does not transform the petition into a challenge to the constitutionality of the Gaming Act.</p>

University of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/220/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="220 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1005863" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0328-01">220 Pa. 328</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%20861" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="69 A. 861">69 A. 861</a> (1908).

If the Board’s composition and its exercise of the function of requiring background investigations were found to violate the Constitution, the Board notes, the result would be that it would be unable to act at <em>all </em>— meaning the Board could not utilize the State Police or any other entity to conduct the investigations. Indeed, the Board would be unable to conduct the investigations at all. The Board avers that this result is directly contrary to the result petitioners actually seek and, in fact, a finding of unconstitutionality would make all of the relief that petitioners actually seek unavailable.</p>

Thus, the parties do not dispute that petitioners are required to assert a constitutional challenge to the Gaming Act in order for this Court to be vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to hear any challenge to or to render a declaratory judgment. The issue is simply whether the Petition for Review raises a constitutional challenge to the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> We agree with the Board that petitioners have not challenged the constitutionality of the Act expressly, nor does the substance of the Petition for Review articulate a constitutional challenge to the Act.</p>

However, beyond this generic observation, petitioners never specifically aver that the Gaming Act is unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds, nor do they seek a declaration to that effect. Thus, petitioners failed to raise an express challenge to the constitutionality of the Act. Instead, petitioners turn to the Board’s actions in undertaking the performance of what petitioners characterize as purely executive functions, specifically the Board’s approval of procurements for negotiating and entering into contracts with <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>outside firms to conduct background investigations. With respect to relief, Count I seeks a declaration that: (1) the Board’s actions in approving negotiations and entering into contracts with three private firms to conduct background investigations are “duties and powers exclusively vested to [the] Executive Branch of Government;” (2) the Board, as a legislative agency, “has exercised powers and duties exclusively vested to the Executive Branch of Government;” and (3) the Board’s actions violate the separation of powers doctrine. Despite invoking the separation of powers doctrine, petitioners never assert nor do they seek a declaration that the provisions of the Gaming Act — as opposed to the conduct of the Board— are unconstitutional. Instead, petitioners complain that the Board misconstrued the Gaming Act and that a proper construction would compel the Board to retain the State Police to conduct all background investigations. Therefore, petitioners allege, the Board <em>violated the Act </em>by entering into negotiations with three outside firms instead of retaining the State Police for investigative purposes. The true gravamen of petitioners’ complaint is not that the statute should be deemed unconstitutional and thus unenforceable, but that the Board misconstrued the statute to petitioners’ detriment, and its construction should be overturned.</p>

Petitioners neither allege that the Gaming Act is unconstitutional, nor do they seek a ruling that it is unconstitutional. Their challenge is to the Board’s interpretation and application of the Act: Petitioners disagree with the Board over the question of whether the Act authorizes the Board to outsource background investigations to any entity other than the State Police. Further, petitioners claim that the Board’s actions in looking to retain outside firms to conduct background investigations violate the Gaming Act. Far from seeking to have the Act, or some portion of the Act, declared unconstitutional, petitioners essentially seek <em>enforcement </em>of the Act, albeit pursuant to their interpretation of its terms.</p>

The State Police filed preliminary objections, arguing that original jurisdiction was in the Commonwealth Court. The trial court agreed and transferred the matter. The Commonwealth Court, however, disagreed and dismissed the case for lack of original jurisdiction, concluding that “the complaint was in essence a tort action in the nature of trespass for money damages as redress for an unlawful injury, and that such actions are properly commenced in the courts of common pleas.” <em>Stackhouse, </em>882 A.2d at 1006 (recounting procedural history).</p>

    <blockquote id="b824-5" data-blocks='[["BL_824.6",824,[340,1817,1118,564]],["BL_825.1",825,[236,333,1107,85]]]'>The sum and substance of Appellant’s complaint, then, is that her privacy and reputational interests were invaded when state police officials unlawfully delved into her intimate inter-personal relationships during an internal affairs investigation, and that she is entitled to compensation accordingly. In these circumstances, we do not believe the inclusion of a count for declaratory or injunctive relief premised upon the same events can properly be understood to transform the complaint from one sounding in trespass into the type of matter contemplated by <em>Fawber [v.

Plainly and simply, petitioners challenge the Board’s implementation of the Act’s provisions, and not the constitutionality of the Act itself.
