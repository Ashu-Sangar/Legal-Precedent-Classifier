    <p id="b798-6" data-blocks='[["BL_798.7",798,[302,653,1161,411]]]'>In this appeal by allowance we consider whether an employer may be represented at an unemployment compensation hearing before a referee of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review by an individual who is not an attorney. A majority of the Commonwealth Court determined that an employer may not be so represented. We respectfully disagree, and thus, for the reasons set forth below, reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b798-7" data-blocks='[["BL_798.8",798,[301,1109,1163,848]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal, as found by the Unemployment Compensation Referee S. Harold Geld (Referee), are as follows: Claimant Lani Harkness (Claimant) was employed by Federated Logistics t/a Macy’s Department Store (Macy’s) as a beauty advisor for Estée Lauder products. On August 11, 2003, a customer became rude with Claimant in a discussion regarding an eye concealer product which was not presently available. The customer informed Claimant that she did not want a “b-” like her to wait on her. The customer also made gestures such as kissing sounds, which Claimant found offensive and asked Claimant how old she was. Claimant, despite the “accelerated” confrontation, did not attempt to obtain a supervisor or a manager nor request that a nearby co-employee make such a contact. While Claimant considered calling security, she did not do so. Ultimately, Claimant told the customer to “get your fat a — out of here.”</p>
    <p id="b798-10" data-blocks='[["BL_798.9",798,[303,1995,1160,364]],["BL_799.1",799,[206,327,1152,86]]]'>Claimant was aware, based upon the employee handbook, that the use of lewdness and/or use of obscenities or vulgarities towards a customer could be grounds for immediate termination without prior warning. Claimant was not immediately disciplined by her department manager who intervened to appease the customer. On August 22, 2003, however, after Claimant returned from a one week vacation, the store manag<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>er terminated Claimant from her employment for her remarks to the customer.</p>
    <p id="b799-4" data-blocks='[["BL_799.5",799,[206,448,1153,93]]]'>On August 24, 2003, Claimant filed for unemployment compensation benefits.</p>
    <p id="b799-5" data-blocks='[["BL_799.6",799,[205,567,1154,148]]]'>Approximately two weeks later, on September 11, 2003, the Allentown Unemployment Compensation Service Center found Claimant to be ineligible for benefits.</p>
    <p id="b799-6" data-blocks='[["BL_799.7",799,[205,741,1155,516]]]'>The Claimant appealed and a hearing was held on October 9, 2003 before Referee Geld. The hearing was attended by Claimant, Claimant’s counsel, and a representative for Macy’s. Macy’s representative, William Forrest, was an employee of TALX UC EXPRESS, a company located in St. Louis, Missouri that is in the business of representing companies in unemployment compensation matters. Forrest was not an attorney. Initially, Claimant objected to Macy’s being represented by a non-attorney. This objection was overruled by Referee Geld.</p>
    <p id="b799-7" data-blocks='[["BL_799.8",799,[201,1291,1156,514]]]'>By decision/order dated November 4, 2003, Referee Geld concluded that Claimant violated Macy’s’ customer service policy and that this rose to the level of willful misconduct. Section 402(e) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law provides that a claimant shall not be eligible for compensation for any week in which her unemployment is due to her discharge from work for willful misconduct connected with her work. 43 P.S. § 802(e). Thus, Referee Geld found that benefits were properly denied under Section 402(e) of the Law.</p>
    <p id="b799-8" data-blocks='[["BL_799.9",799,[201,1839,1154,526]]]'>Claimant appealed this decision to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board). The Board concluded that the determination made by Referee Geld was proper under the Unemployment Compensation Law and adopted the Referee’s findings and conclusions. Furthermore, with respect to the issue <em>sub </em>judice, the Board found that the Law “permits parties to be represented by legal or non-legal advisors. As such, the Referee did not err in allowing the employer to be represented by a non-legal advisor.” Decision of Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, at 1.</p>
    <p id="b800-3" data-blocks='[["BL_800.4",800,[296,330,1160,307]]]'>
      <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>Thereafter, Claimant appealed to the Commonwealth Court. On February 3, 2005, a divided <em>en banc </em>Commonwealth Court concluded that it was error for the Referee to permit Macy’s to be represented at the hearing by a non-attorney “tax consultant.” <em>Harkness v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/a2d/867/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="867 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="9027331" data-case-paths="/a2d/867/0728-01">867 A.2d 728</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2005).</p>
    <p id="b800-4" data-blocks='[["BL_800.5",800,[295,661,1162,1271]]]'>Specifically, the court engaged in a two-fold inquiry. The majority first determined that Forrest was engaging in the practice of law as he appeared before the Referee and acted as an advocate of Macy’s contending that Claimant was discharged due to willful misconduct. In support thereof, the majority noted that Forrest conducted “cross-examination” of witnesses, “made decisions regarding evidentiary matters,” and offered a “closing legal argument.” <em><a href="/a2d/867/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="867 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="9027331" data-case-paths="/a2d/867/0728-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/867/0728-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="867 A.2d 728" data-case-ids="9027331" data-case-paths="/a2d/867/0728-01">at 731</a>. The court majority then found that Forrest’s engaging in the practice of law was unauthorized, based upon the proposition that generally, a non-attorney may not represent parties before Pennsylvania courts or administrative agencies. While acknowledging exceptions, the majority pointed to the Unemployment Compensation Law, as well as regulations promulgated pursuant to the Law, that in the majority’s view only permits the claimant to be represented by a non-attorney in an unemployment compensation hearing. 43 P.S. § 862. The Commonwealth Court majority concluded that despite the informal nature of unemployment compensation proceedings and the relatively small amounts in controversy, it was erroneous for the Board to allow non-lawyer employer representation. Thus, the Commonwealth Court vacated the Board’s order and remanded the case to the Board, for remand to a referee for a new hearing consistent with the court’s opinion.</p>
    <p id="b800-5" data-blocks='[["BL_800.6",800,[296,1957,1159,418]],["BL_801.1",801,[191,325,1154,420]]]'>Judge Bonnie Brigance Leadbetter, joined by Judge Renée Cohn Jubelirer, dissented. The dissenters first opined that even if Forrest was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, any error was harmless. Second, the dissenters found the majority’s analysis to be overly broad in that not all non-lawyer representatives in these proceedings are engaged in the practice of law; they often assist in clarifying issues. Furthermore, according to the dissenters, the Board demon<a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>strated sound policy reasons for permitting non-lawyers to participate in unemployment compensation hearings: the proceedings are informal and relatively small amounts of money are in controversy. Finally, the dissenters questioned whether the majority’s conclusion that non-lawyers could not represent employers but could represent claimants, in essence requiring the Board to discriminate between parties, could withstand equal protection scrutiny.</p>

As stated by our Court in <em>Dauphin County, </em>“The threads of legal consequences often weave their way through even casual contemporary interactions. There are times, of course, when it is clearly within the ken of lay persons to appreciate the legal problems <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>and consequences involved in a given situation and the factors which should influence necessary decisions.

    <p id="b803-7" data-blocks='[["BL_803.6",803,[197,1012,1161,1235]]]'>When considering the public interest, our Court has focused on the character of the activities at issue. In <em>Shortz, </em>our Court set forth three broad categories of activities that may constitute the practice of law: (1) the instruction and advising of clients in regard to the law so that they may pursue their affairs and be informed as to their rights and obligations; (2) the preparation of documents for clients requiring familiarity with legal principles beyond the ken of ordinary laypersons; and (3) the appearance on behalf of clients before public tribunals in order that the attorney may assist the deciding official in the proper interpretation and enforcement of the law. <em><a href="/pa/465/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="465 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1712685" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0545-01">Id.</a> </em>More recently, our Court expressed that the practice of law is implicated by the holding out of oneself to the public as competent to exercise legal judgment and the implication that he or she has the technical competence to analyze legal problems and the requisite character qualifications to act in a representative capacity. <em>Dauphin County, </em><a href="/pa/465/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="465 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1712685" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0545-01">351 A.2d at 232-33</a> (considering whether licensed casualty adjuster’s representation of third parties constituted the unauthorized practice of law).

As a general proposition, providers of services such as the management of payroll, tax, and employee benefit operations will also attend unemployment compensation proceedings to provide appropriate personnel records and other documents and assist in the fact-finding process so as to aid the referee in his or her determination. These individuals are more akin to facilitators rather than legal practitioners.

Rather our narrow holding merely permits lay representation of parties to assist in the preparation and presentation of their cause in order to facilitate the hearing process. We believe board hearings should not be turned into adversarial proceedings since they are legislatively designed to function as an informal mechanism through which the referee, in a participatory capacity, ascertains the facts involved. In light of the serious detriment to claimants and employers which would result if the current system were unnecessarily disturbed, we deem this to be an appropriate and <em>limited setting </em>in which to authorize lay representation by granting due deference to the statute and agency rule.</blockquote>

Due to our determination that non-lawyer employer representatives are not engaging in the practice of law we need not consider whether the “practice of law” is “authorized” in the Unemployment Compensation Law. Yet, we must nevertheless engage in a statutory inquiry as to whether the Law permits an employer to use a non-lawyer representative under the statute.

Specifically, the court pinpointed the language regarding the limitations on fees to be imposed upon claimants. Quoting the sentence “Any individual claiming compensation in any proceeding before the department, the board, or referee may be represented by counsel or other duly authorized agent; but no such counsel or agent shall charge or receive any greater fee for such services than is approved by the board,” 43 P.S. § 862, the Court came to the conclusion that only the claimant may be represented by a non-lawyer and thus, an employer may not be represented by a non-lawyer.</p>
    <p id="b808-5" data-blocks='[["BL_808.6",808,[300,1373,1162,733]]]'>The Commonwealth Court’s reliance upon this section is troublesome. First, Section 702 is entitled “Limitation of fees” and does not speak to the right <em>of </em>representation. Furthermore, in Section 702, the General Assembly clearly spoke to a claimant’s right to be assessed a fee by counsel or authorized agent no greater than that approved by the Board. Yet while Section 702 unmistakably protects a claimant from excessive fees, it is plainly silent as to the fees to be assessed an employer and in no way addresses an employer’s right to non-lawyer representation.
