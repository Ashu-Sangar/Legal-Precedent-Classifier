In February 1996, then-thirty-six-year-old Lynda Carrozza went to St. Agnes Medical Center for a baseline screening mammogram. Radiologist Roy Greenbaum, M.D., examined Carrozza’s scans and observed calcifications in her right breast. He found the calcifications insufficiently “suspicious” to warrant further testing at that time, concluding that <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>they likely were benign.

Like Greenbaum before her, Evers concluded that the calcifications were benign, and recommended that Carrozza return one year later for another mammogram.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

On September 24, 1999, an oncologist examined Carrozza’s right breast, noting a 9 by 10 cm mass and an abnormal lymph node. Subsequent needle biopsies, performed in three locations in Carrozza’s breast, all tested positive for carcinoma. From September 1999 into spring of the following year, Carrozza endured eight cycles of aggressive chemotherapy, a radical mastectomy, numerous reconstructive procedures, and radiation therapy.</p>
    <p id="b455-6" data-blocks='[["BL_455.7",455,[212,1485,1153,577]]]'>In June 2000, Carrozza filed a medical malpractice complaint against Greenbaum, Evers, and their respective practices and associated hospitals. In February 2002, during pendency of this suit, PHICO Insurance, which insured Evers and her practice group, declared bankruptcy. Pursuant to its statutory mandate, PPCIGA stepped into the shoes of PHICO for purposes of the instant litigation, assuming PHICO’s defense and its liability up to PPCIGA’s statutory damage cap. Thus, the relevant parties included the defendant physicians and hospital, PPCIGA in place of PHICO for Evers, and MIIX Insurance Group (MIIX) on behalf of Greenbaum.</p>

After deliberating for a day and a half, the jury, responding to special interrogatories, found Greenbaum and Evers equally liable (50% / 50%) for Carrozza’s harm, and awarded her $4 million. The court molded the jury verdict to include the named physicians’ practice groups and associated hospitals on the basis of vicarious liability.

MIIX and PPCIGA filed petitions to intervene, which were granted. Carrozza also filed a post-trial motion seeking delay damages. Argument commenced May 28, 2003, following which, by Opinion and Order dated June 13, 2003, the court denied the defense motions, granted Carrozza delay damages, and molded the verdict to impose joint and several liability for the entire verdict — $4 million plus $482,000 in delay damages — across all defendants collectively rather than in two equal portions respectively over the group of defendants associated with each doctor. In so doing, the trial court specifically noted that its prior allocation “was in no way meant ... to reflect a decision that joint and several liability among all Defendants did not exist.” Tr. Ct. Op., 6/13/03, at 14-15. In support of its ruling combining joint and several liability with an express 50% / 50% allocation of responsibility between the two groups of defendants, the court quoted our decision in <em>Allen v.

In that case, plaintiff Sands was injured as a passenger in a car driven by Davis when it collided with a car driven by Patton, who lacked insurance. Sands released Davis’s insurer from all claims for consideration of $10,000, and then sought to recover from his own insurer for uninsured motorist benefits due to Patton’s lack of insurance. Sands’s insurer initially refused to pay, but Sands successfully sued the insurer and was awarded $10,000. During the litigation, Sands’s insurer was declared insolvent. Sands then applied to PIGA for payment in <em>lieu </em>of the insolvent insurer, but PIGA refused to pay.</p>

First, the court noted that in the posture of the case there was no way for the court to discern whether Davis had been negligent to begin with, and without such a finding it could not be determined whether Sands had any claim to exhaust even if such were required. Assuming Davis had been negligent, however, the <em>Sands </em>court held that “the most that could then be said would be that Sands was ‘a person having a claim against’ Davis; he would not be a person having a claim against Davis’s ‘insurer’.... ” <em>Id. </em>at 1227.

Indeed, it emphasizes the legislature’s failure expressly to provide for the situation before us or in any way to address the interplay of joint and several liability with the Act’s non-duplication provision. The Superior Court reasoned from this omission to the conclusion that the legislature thereby intended to leave the <em>Sands </em>holding intact.

In declining first in 1970 with the PIGA Act and again in 1994 with the PPCIGA Act to expressly account for joint and several liability, the legislature evinced no intent to <em>disturb </em>joint and several liability as conventionally understood. This is no small matter. Joint and several liability as a principle of recovery for an indivisible injury caused by multiple tortfeasors lies at the very heart of the common law of tort, and also has a solid foundation in Pennsylvania’s statutory law. <em>See </em>Uniform Contribution Among Tort-feasors Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8321, <em>et seq. </em>(providing for the allocation of responsibility among joint tortfeasors). Contrarily, the legislature, both in the former PIGA Act and in the current PPCIGA Act, clearly has attempted to establish the Association as an entity subject to the same “rights, duties and obligations of the insolvent insurer” but for enumerated <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>limitations, <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 991.1803(b)(2),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> none of which provides for a modified status where the insolvent insurer is subject to a claim on behalf of its insured who is jointly liable with another party as to whom insolvency plays no role.</p>

After careful review of the PPCIGA enabling legislation in tandem with the commonlaw tradition of joint and several liability, we find no reason to believe that the legislature intended PPCIGA to be treated any differently than the insurer it replaces for purposes of joint and several liability, where applicable. When the insurer, if solvent, would have been subject to the consequences of joint and several liability, PPCIGA must be subject to those same consequences in the insurer’s place, unless a manifest duplication of recovery will occur.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a>

To the contrary, on that topic precedent is as silent as the statute itself. Further, in <em>Bell, </em>where the Court was presented with the real prospect of a duplicative recovery, we protected PPCIGA’s recourse to the non-duplication provision as consistent with the policy of the larger statute and the express concern protected by that provision. Here, however, PPCIGA does not have a legitimate duplication to bemoan; rather, it seeks to compel Carrozza to seek an alternative source of recovery so that it <em>thereafter </em>can point to a recovery that it need not duplicate. Neither the larger Act nor the non-duplication of recovery provision, in express or implied intent, appears to us to require such a move in derogation of the claimant’s traditional prerogative to seek recovery in full from any one among two or more joint tortfeasors, leaving the burden of wrangling over proportionate responsibility to the wrongdoers (or their insurers). <em>See generally Baker, </em><a href="/a2d/755/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="755 A.2d 664" data-case-ids="11209982,225956" data-case-paths="/a2d/755/0664-01,/pa/562/0290-01">755 A.2d at 669-71</a>.</p>

That is to say, because multiple defendants increase substantially the likelihood that a judgment will be joint and several, in a multiple-defendant case, PPCIGA will be best advised, in protecting its coffers, to leave resolution of the case to any solvent insurers and the plaintiff, which in turn very likely will substantially increase the cost of settlement (not to mention trial and verdict, should the case go so far) for those solvent insurers whose policies are implicated in the case, and / or lead to a greater proportion of cases going to trial.
