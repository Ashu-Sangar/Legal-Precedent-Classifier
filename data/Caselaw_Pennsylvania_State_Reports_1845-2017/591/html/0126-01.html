Following the penalty hearing, Appellant was sentenced to death for each of the murder convictions, as the aggravating circumstances were found to outweigh the sole mitigating circumstance. The aggravating circumstances found with regard to both victims were that Appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7), and that Appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). Concerning the murder of Mr. Outterbridge, the jury also found that Appellant had been convicted of another offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10). With regard to both murders, the sole mitigating circumstance noted by any juror was that Appellant was “under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2). Two days after he was formally sentenced, on June 14, 1987, Appellant escaped from custody. Appellant filed a pro se notice of appeal while a fugitive.</p>

In this regard, the Committee emphasized that Appellant was removed from Canada within hours of the Superior Court of Quebec’s decision not to stay his deportation, <em>see Judge III, </em>at ¶ 10.8, and concluded that, since appellate review was available but precluded by the deportation, sufficient consideration of Appellant’s right to life was not afforded by the State-Party. <em>See Judge III, </em>at ¶ 10.8-10.9. The views of the Committee were adopted on August 5, 2002, and formally published on August 13, 2003. Following publication of the Committee’s views, Appellant filed the present petition, asserting jurisdiction under either the PCRA or the statutory and constitutional right to habeas corpus relief and arguing that Canada’s asserted violation of his human rights under the ICCPR requires that his sentence be reduced to life imprisonment or that he be returned to Canada to be deported or extradited in compli<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>anee with the Committee’s ruling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The post-conviction court, assuming that Appellant’s claims were cognizable under the PCRA, dismissed his contentions regarding the ICCPR on the ground that habeas proceedings raising the same arguments were pending in federal court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

In this regard, Appellant contends that a petition for habeas corpus is the most appropriate method for challenging his execution on the ground that his deportation from Canada to face a sentence of death <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>violated his rights under the ICCPR. Appellant observes that the legislative intent in enacting the PCRA was to address, in a single petition, all claims related to the legality or constitutionality of the proceedings by which an individual has been convicted and sentenced. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9542. He concludes, however, that the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus remains separately available in situations, like the present matter, where the basis of the arguments is not contingent upon the presence of error in either the guilt or penalty phases of a trial. This is due to the constitutional and statutory protection of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. Art. I, § 14 (“[T]he privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.”); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6501 (same). Further, Appellant asserts that the traditional purposes of habeas corpus are advanced by addressing his claims regarding his deportation from Canada in violation of the ICCPR outside the framework of the PCRA, as the writ of habeas corpus is at the core of protecting fundamental rights, including the inherent right to life. <em>See, e.g., Stander v. Kelley, </em><a href="/pa/433/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="433 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1921072" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0406-01">433 Pa. 406</a>, 425, <a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20474" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="250 A.2d 474">250 A.2d 474</a>, 485 (1969) (Roberts, J., concurring) (noting that the writ of habeas corpus is “the ultimate and essential safeguard of individual rights and that the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania must and will continue to make its protections available”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

First, Appellant asserts that his execution, which he believes would violate the ICCPR, undermines the truth-determining process such that the sentence cannot be deemed reliable. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(i). Next, Appellant speculates that his death sentence is greater than the lawful maximum because, in his view, the lawful maximum sentence under international law is life imprisonment. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(vii). Further, Appellant argues that his petition is not time barred, as his claims fall within two of the exceptions to the one-year limitation contained within the PCRA. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1). In this regard, Appellant contends that government officials, specifically the Canadian officials who deported him and the United States officials who accepted him upon his deportation, interfered with his ability to present his claims previously because he was not afforded the opportunity to challenge his deportation before he was transferred to the Commonwealth’s custody. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i). Appellant also asserts that the facts upon which his claims are based, namely, the Committee’s ruling that Canada violated the ICCPR by deporting him to face a death sentence, could not have been known prior to the publication of the Committee’s views in 2003. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(ii).</p>

Accordingly, the Commonwealth argues that, even if the Legislature intended for foreign officials to be encompassed within the governmental interference exception, Appellant has not set forth how Canada’s actions prevented him from filing a timely PCRA petition, especially in light of the fact that he did file a timely petition before his deportation and amended it upon his return to the United States. Similarly, the Commonwealth asserts that Appellant’s reliance on the Committee’s published determination as a new fact that could not have been discovered previously is misplaced, as the fact underlying his claims is his deportation itself, of which Appellant must have been aware at the time he filed his amended PCRA petition, from the United States, in 1999. Thus, the Commonwealth concludes that Appellant’s claim that his deportation from Canada violated his rights under the ICCPR is both untimely and waived, as it could have been raised in his first PCRA petition. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b).</p>

Indeed, the boundaries of cognizable claims under the PCRA can only be extended so far as is consistent with the purposes of the statute, and we believe that Appellant’s claim concerning his deportation from Canada to face a death sentence falls outside the intended scope of the PCRA. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9542 (“This subchapter provides for an action by which persons convicted of crimes they did not commit and persons serving illegal sentences may obtain collateral relief.”); <em>Peterkin, </em><a href="/pa/554/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="554 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="765982" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0547-01">554 Pa. at 557-58</a>, 722 A.2d at 643 (“The purpose of the law is not to provide convicted criminals with the means to escape well-deserved sanctions, but to provide a reasonable opportunity for those who have been wrongfully convicted to demonstrate the injustice of their conviction.”). Appellant is not asserting his innocence of the underlying crimes or that his sentence was illegal when imposed; his claim is that executing him would violate international law because the Committee found that Canada violated his rights under the ICCPR by deporting him to face a sentence of death without obtaining assurances <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>that the sentence would not be imposed. The Committee’s determination and the facts upon which it is based, regardless of their validity, have no connection to the truth-determining process and do not render the underlying adjudication of guilt or innocence, which took place in the United States more than ten years earlier, unreliable. <em>See, e.g., Coady v.
