A setoff provision, generally, provides for the reduction of a claimant’s potential recovery under one part of an insurance policy, such as underinsured motorist coverage, by the amount the claimant recovered under another portion of the same insurance policy, such as bodily injury liability coverage. We conclude that the setoff provision at issue does not violate public policy. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court and reinstate the order of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

Myers (John) and owned by his mother, Diane E. Myers, collided with an automobile driven and owned by Todd L. Jamison (Jamison). John and his passenger, Eric L. Black (Eric), died from injuries sustained during the accident. Jamison suffered injuries but survived. As discussed in detail below, the parents of Eric,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> acting in their own capacity and as representatives of their son’s estate, claimed that Eric’s death resulted in part from Jamison’s negligence in driving his car at an excessive speed. Accordingly, they sought recovery based on Jamison’s negligence pursuant to various insurance policies. The Blacks also claimed that the accident resulted in part from John’s negligence in failing to observe a stop sign. Consequently, the Blacks sought recovery based on John’s negligence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>The dispute before this Court arises from a declaratory judgment action filed by the Myers’ insurer, Appellant Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (Penn National), regarding the limits of coverage under the Myers’ policy available to the Blacks as a result of Eric’s death while a passenger in the Myers’ car. The Blacks seek recovery from Penn National under the Myers’ policy’s bodily liability coverage provision based on John’s negligence, in accord with traditional tort principals permitting a victim to recover from a tortfeasor. The Blacks also seek recovery from Penn National under the Myers’ policy’s underinsured motorist coverage provision, based on Jamison’s negligence, the insufficiency of Jamison’s (and Black’s) insurance to recompense the Blacks fully, and Eric’s status as a “class two insured”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> by virtue of his being a passenger in the Myers’ car.</p>

Progressive tendered the per person limit of $15,000 to the Blacks in July 1999. Similarly, State Farm Insurance Company, which insured the Blacks, tendered to them $60,000, which was the limit of the underinsured motorist coverage under the Blacks’ insurance policy. It is undisputed that the losses suffered by the Blacks exceeded the aggregate $75,000 paid under the Progressive and State Farm policies. Accordingly, the Blacks sought coverage under the Myers’ insurance policy issued by Penn National providing, <em>inter alia, </em>bodily injury liability coverage with a limit of $100,000 per accident and underinsured motorist cov<a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>erage with a limit of $100,000 per accident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> As previously noted, under the policy, Eric qualified as a class two insured because he was a guest passenger in the Myers’ ear.

The policy defined “underinsured motor vehicle” to exclude vehicles “for which liability coverage is provided under ... this policy.” <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the vehicle driven by John, within which Eric was a passenger, could not be considered an underinsured motor vehicle under the Myers’ policy because it was covered by that policy. Prior to recovery under the underinsured motorist provision, the policy also required that the party seeking recovery first exhaust “[t]he limits of liability under any applicable bodily injury bonds or policies.” <em>Id. </em>The policy also prohibited duplicate payments: “No one will be entitled to receive duplicate payments for the same elements of loss under this coverage and ... [a]ny Underinsured Motorist Coverage provided by this policy.” R.R. at R23a. Significantly, the “setoff’ provision of the underinsured motorist coverage at issue provided, “The limit of liability under this coverage is reduced by any amount paid to the same person for the <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>same accident under Part A [Liability Coverage] or Part C.

Additionally, Penn National offered to settle the Blacks’ bodily injury liability claims premised upon John’s negligence by offering the remaining $99,000 of available coverage. Penn National later offered to settle the Blacks’ claims for underinsured motorist coverage for $1,000, arguing that the remaining $99,000 of underinsured motorist coverage had been properly setoff by the $99,000 already tendered to the Blacks under the policy’s bodily injury liability coverage.</p>

Penn National cites our caselaw rejecting the policy of “maximum feasible restoration” of the injured party under the No-Fault Law and embracing the MVFRL’s aims of reducing premiums and allowing consumers to choose their level of insurance. <em>See Paylor v. Hartford, Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/536/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="536 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="1843209" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0583-01">536 Pa. 583</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="640 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="1843209,7871724" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0583-01,/a2d/640/1234-01">640 A.2d 1234</a>, 1235 (1994).

Moreover, Penn National observes that MVFRL does not define “insureds” to include guest passengers, <em>see 75 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1702, but requires only that the term include named insureds and resident relatives of the named insureds. Accordingly, it asserts, “the MVFRL does not require that insurers even offer [underinsured motorist] coverage for guest passengers.” Brief for Appellant at 11.

For example, in this case, Penn National offered to pay Jamison $1000 under the liability coverage for damages due to John’s negligence, thus leaving $99,000 of liability coverage payable to the Blacks. The Blacks may then recover another $1000 under underinsured motorist coverage for Jami-son’s negligence. Significantly, Penn National suggests the potential of a fact pattern whereby Penn National could have paid Jamison $99,000 of liability coverage as compensation for John’s negligence and the Blacks $1000 of liability coverage for John’s negligence. Under that scenario, there is no indication that the Blacks would not have recovered $99,000 under the underinsured motorist policy based on Jamison’s negligence after applying the setoff provision. Under either scenario, the Blacks would receive $100,000.</p>

While we accept the analysis presented by Chief Justice Cappy in support of the conclusion that the MVFRL favors the provision of “excess" rather than “gap” underinsured motorist coverage, it would still require several assumptions to conclude that the setoff provision, as applied in this case, is contrary to a long-standing and clearly expressed public policy sufficient to justify the voiding of the unambiguous language agreed to by the parties. <em>See Colbert, </em><a href="/pa/572/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="813 A.2d 747" data-case-ids="716438,9381218" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0082-01,/a2d/813/0747-01">813 A.2d at 750</a>.

Indeed, in this case, the Blacks received from Penn National a tender of coverage in excess of the amount they received from the third-party tortfeasor, Jamison, and in excess of the amount they received under their own underinsured motorist coverage. The only reduction in the limits was based on amounts tendered under the same policy.</p>

This statement makes no reference to guest passengers. Absent any statement by the legislature requiring a minimum of underinsured motorist coverage to guest passengers or forbidding setoff provisions and in the absence of a previous expression of a clear public policy against such provisions, we are unwilling to declare the unambiguous set-off provision in this policy void as against public policy.</p>

The majority upholds the set-off because of the MVFRL’s cost containment objective. Although enactment of the MVFRL grew out of a legislative concern for the spiraling costs of automobile insurance, <em>see Progressive Northern Ins. Co. v. Schneck, </em><a href="/pa/572/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="572 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="716515" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0216-01">572 Pa. 216</a>, <a href="/pa/572/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="813 A.2d 828" data-case-ids="716515,9381418" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0216-01,/a2d/813/0828-01">813 A.2d 828</a>, 832 (2002), the cost containment objective cannot be permitted to contradict or undo the nature of UIM insurance that the General Assembly enacted. Further, as this Court has recognized, since the policy concern of cost containment can be used to defend virtually any contractual provision that restricts coverage, it cannot lead to the validation of any and every contractual term that arguably results in less costly insurance. <em>Burstein, </em><a href="/a2d/809/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="809 A.2d 204" data-case-ids="11423293,270333" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0204-01,/pa/570/0177-01">809 A.2d at 208</a>. “ ‘[R]ather, it functions to protect insurers against forced underwriting of unknown risks that insureds have neither disclosed nor paid to insure.’ <em><a href="/a2d/809/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="809 A.2d 204" data-case-ids="11423293,270333" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0204-01,/pa/570/0177-01">Id.</a> </em>If the Policy’s set-off provision were to be invalidated, Penn National would not be forced to underwrite an unknown risk for which it received no premium, as would have occurred in <em>Burstein, </em>had <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>we held that the contract provision at issue was unenforceable. <em>See <a href="/a2d/809/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="809 A.2d 204" data-case-ids="11423293,270333" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0204-01,/pa/570/0177-01">id.</a> </em>([I]f this Court were to void [the regularly use, non-owned car] exclusion, insureds would be empowered to regularly drive an infinite number of non-owned vehicles, and receive gratis UIM coverage on all those vehicles, if they merely purchase UIM coverage on one owned vehicle.”) Further still, having reviewed the record, I have found no evidentiary support for the contention that if insurers are not permitted the set-off in cases like this one, the cost of insurance will significantly increase or for the proposition that it is impossible for insurers to develop an economically feasible premium structure that accommodates the General Assembly’s policy choice in this area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

The standard form states that “any payment made under this endorsement [related to uninsured motorist coverage] to or for any insured shall be applied in reduction of <em>the amount of damages </em>which he may be entitled to recover from any person under the Bodily Injury Liability Coverage of the policy[,]” <em>See </em>31 Pa.Code § 63.2 Exh. C (emphasis added). I am not persuaded. I have no reason to conclude that in this context, the MVFRL’s provisions for UIM and UM coverage reflect public policies that are coextensive; therefore, I do not believe that the Department’s form has any bearing on this matter. Moreover, the reduction that the Department’s form authorizes differs fundamentally from the reduction the Policy’s set-off allows. While the Department’s form calls for a reduction in “the amount of damages” that an insured may recover under a policy’s liability coverage by the UM payments he has received, thereby appropriately preventing the insured from <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>securing a windfall or double recovery, the set-off provision reduces the Policy’s UIM limits themselves by any liability coverage amounts the insured receives under the Policy, without regard to whether the insured has been fully indemnified for his losses.</p>

Under excess UIM coverage, the injured insured's total recovery is $70,000, with UIM coverage of $50,000 being paid in addition to the amount the insured receives under liability coverage, $20,000.
