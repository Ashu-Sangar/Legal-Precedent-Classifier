Specifically, we are asked to consider whether a public employee has the right to be accompanied by a union representative of his or her choosing during such an investigatory interview. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the right of accompaniment during an investigatory interview includes the employee’s choice of union representative — when the union representative is reasonably available and there are no extenuating circumstances. Thus, for the reasons stated herein, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Donald Vogel worked for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the Commonwealth) as a State Correctional Officer. On November 13, 2001, Officer Vogel was instructed to report to his immediate <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>supervisor, Captain Soroko<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> for counseling. Before he entered Captain Soroko’s office, Officer Vogel met with Officer Paul Lennert concerning the reason for his meeting with Captain Soroko. Officer Lennert was a member of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association’s (the Association) local executive board. When he entered Captain Soroko’s office, Officer Vogel requested to be represented by Officer Craig Panko instead of Officer Lennert. Officer Vogel knew that Officer Panko had been counseled for missing roll calls and that Captain Soroko referred to Officer Vogel’s roll call record while counseling Officer Panko. Furthermore, at the time of the counseling session, Officer Panko was a union steward; Officer Lennert did not hold such a position.</p>
    <p id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[293,1051,1158,257]]]'>Captain Soroko denied Officer Vogel’s request. Officer Lennert offered to relieve Officer Panko so that he could attend the counseling session. Captain Soroko rejected Officer Lennert’s offer and insisted that Officer Lennert stay to represent Officer Vogel during the session.</p>
    <p id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[291,1333,1159,419]]]'>During the counseling session, Captain Soroko accused Officer Vogel of being late for roll call fifteen times and Officer Vogel responded that there was no truth to these allegations. At the end of the meeting, Captain Soroko indicated that he possessed the records to prove that Officer Vogel had been late for roll call and informed Officer Vogel that he would “get [Captain Soroko’s] decision later.” Ultimately, Officer Vogel was not disciplined as a result of the alleged missed roll calls.</p>
    <p id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.7",432,[292,1778,1157,309]]]'>Thereafter, the Association filed a charge of unfair labor practices with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (the Board or PLRB). The Association alleged that by refusing to permit Officer Vogel to have Officer Panko represent him during the counseling session, the Commonwealth violated Section 1201(a)(1) and (5) of PERA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>The Board issued a complaint and a hearing was held on May 17, 2002 before a hearing examiner. On June 26, 2002, the hearing examiner issued a Proposed Decision and Order dismissing the charge of unfair labor practices. The hearing examiner determined that the Union had failed to establish that Officer Panko was readily available and did not show that Officer Vogel was entitled to Officer Panko’s representation. Thus, the hearing examiner dismissed the charges filed pursuant to Section 1201(a)(1). The hearing examiner also dismissed the Association’s claim under Section 1201(a)(5) finding that the Association’s collective bargaining rights were not violated. The Association filed exceptions to the hearing examiner’s decision and order.</p>

Specifically, the Board first looked to Captain Soroko’s accusation of past misconduct which could lead to the imposition of discipline coupled with his lack of decision regarding whether to impose discipline. This led the Board to conclude that Officer Vogel was subjected to an investigatory interview which implicated Officer Vogel’s <em>Weingarten </em>rights. The Board then questioned whether an employee, in exercising his <em>Weingarten </em>rights, has the right to choose from available representatives in the work place. The Board concluded that an employee is entitled to an available representative of his or her choosing, absent extenuating circumstances. Based upon Officer Lennert’s offer to permit Officer Panko to attend the interview, the Board opined that Officer Panko was present and available to attend the counseling session with Captain Soroko and Officer Vogel. Therefore, the Board determined that the Commonwealth had <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>violated Section 1201(a)(1) of PERA. The Board, however, rejected the Association’s contention that the Commonwealth had violated its bargaining rights pursuant to Section 1201(a)(5), concluding that a <em>Weingarten </em>right was a right of the employee and not the Association. The Board ordered the Commonwealth to cease and desist from interfering with the employees’ rights under PERA and to post a copy of the Board’s Final Order. The Commonwealth appealed the Board’s Final Order to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[289,826,1162,414]]]'>The Commonwealth Court agreed with the Board that Officer Vogel’s counseling session constituted an investigatory interview implicating Officer Vogel’s <em>Weingarten </em>rights. This conclusion was based upon the court’s determination that not only did Captain Soroko note the potential disciplinary action to be taken as a result of the session, but also he explained that he was deferring a decision regarding discipline until a later time.</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[286,1281,1162,1014]]]'>The Commonwealth Court, however, rejected the Board’s conclusion that during an investigatory interview, an employee may have his or her choice of representative absent extenuating circumstances. The court found that decisions arising from the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> such as <em>Weingarten, </em>were not necessarily applicable to issues under PERA. Specifically, the court reasoned that decisions under PERA impact not only public employers and public unions, but also the public; this is unlike decisions rendered under the NLRA which impact only private employers and private unions. Taking a circumscribed view of the nature of rights under PERA, the court went on to instruct that, “Nothing in PERA gives the Board the power to vest in any particular employee any particular collective bargaining rights because PERA is a collective bargaining statute vesting all rights in a union, and only it and no individual employee has any individual collective bargaining right <em>vis-d-vis </em>the employer.” <em>Office of Administration v.

The Commonwealth Court’s rejection of the adoption of the federal standard was supported by the reasoning that a grievance and arbitration procedure is mandated under PERA but not under the NLRA. Related thereto, the Court characterized management’s right to punish an employee as inherent, and offered that because the right to discipline is a managerial prerogative, all that is required under <em>Weingarten </em>is that a union representative be present to protect the union’s rights for future grievance-arbitration proceedings. According to the Commonwealth Court, the employer is under no obligation to honor an employee’s request for a particular union representative unless the collective bargaining agreement contains such a requirement. As the relevant collective bargaining agreement did not require the employer to honor such a request, the choice of representative was not available to Officer Vogel. <em><a href="/a2d/848/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="848 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="9250036" data-case-paths="/a2d/848/1063-01">Id.</a> </em><a href="/a2d/848/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="848 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="9250036" data-case-paths="/a2d/848/1063-01">848 A.2d at 1069</a>.

He offered that even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the right of representation belonged to the union, the majority’s approach permitted <em>the employer </em>to select Officer Vogel’s representative.

According to the Court, an employee’s Section 7 right to have union representation during an investigatory interview benefited both employee and employer.

The National Labor Relations Board’s recent decision in <em>Anheuser-Busch, </em>is particularly instructive. In <em>Anheuser-Busch, </em>an employee was confronted with an investigatory interview. The employee requested representation. The employer provided representation, but not the union representative chosen by the employee. An administrative law judge found that the requested representative had been available, and thus, that the employer had violated the employee’s <em>Weingarten </em>rights. The National Labor Relations Board affirmed on appeal. While recognizing that early decisions by the National Labor Relations Board denied the right of an employee to choose a <em>Weingarten </em>representative, more recent decisions rejected such an approach and embraced the right to select a specific representative. By adopting the administrative law judge’s decision, the National Labor Relations Board held: “[I]n a <em>Weingarten </em>setting, an employee has the right to specify the representative that he or she wants, and the employer is obligated to supply that representative absent some extenuating circumstances.” <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em><a href="/citations/?q=337%20N.L.R.B.%203" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="337 N.L.R.B. 3">337 NLRB at 8</a>.
