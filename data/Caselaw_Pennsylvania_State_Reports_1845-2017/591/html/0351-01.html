Once a person has been duly elected, the right to exercise the authority of office is not to be lightly disturbed. A complaint in quo warranto is aimed at the right to exercise the powers of the office, which is a public injury, rather than an attack upon the propriety of the actions <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>performed while in office, which would be a private injury.

It states that these limitations placed on private parties’ standing to bring actions in quo warranto are simply not applicable to it as it is not a private party; rather, Petitioner sees itself as being on an equal <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>footing with a public prosecutor insofar as the ability to bring an action in quo warranto.</p>
    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[294,449,1162,1105]]]'>Petitioner correctly characterizes itself as possessing functions similar to that of prosecuting attorneys in the criminal justice system. The investigation and prosecution of complaints of judicial misconduct are its assigned task within the defined structure described in Article V, § 18. Yet, unlike the Attorney General or a district attorney, Petitioner is not an elected official charged with an obligation to the public at large. Rather, Petitioner is an appointed entity of limited scope, created within the judicial system itself and granted a deliberately precise function. Pa. Const, art. V, § 18(2), (6) &amp; (7). Although the Petitioner functions in ways similar to a public prosecutor, the differences in origin of authority and scope of jurisdiction set it sufficiently apart from public prosecutors negating its assertion that it possesses standing to proceed in quo warranto similar to that of any public prosecutor. Additionally, nothing within its constitutional framework invests Petitioner with the power and authority to act in a public manner outside the confinement of its constitutionally-limited role, and this court would be remiss if we were to extend to Petitioner standing to pursue quo warranto on a par typical of that of public prosecutors.</p>

In support of this argument, Petitioner relies heavily on <em>Com., Pennsylvania Game Comm’s v. Com., Dept. of Environmental Resources, </em><a href="/pa/521/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="521 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1817477" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0121-01">521 Pa. 121</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="521 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1817477" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0121-01">555 A.2d 812</a> (1989) and <em>In re T.J., supra. </em>In both of those matters, the issue was whether a legislatively-created administrative agency had standing even though it had not met the traditional standing requirements of being aggrieved or adversely affected.

In 1993, the electorate approved of a constitutional amendment creating a brand new entity — to wit, Petitioner. From its inception, Petitioner’s powers and authority were carefully delineated. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. Art. V, § 18. The constitutional provision at issue describes a self-contained system for the investigation, prosecution, and imposition of discipline in cases of judicial wrongdoing. Art. V, § 18(a)(7) (setting forth the investigative tools of the Judicial Conduct Board); Art. V, § 18(b)(5) (describing the functions of the Court of Judicial Discipline); Art. Y, § 18(d)(1) (setting forth the available array of potential disciplinary actions within the authority of the Court of Judicial Discipline). Yet, the electorate, in approving this amendment, did not grant Petitioner the power and authority to pursue actions in quo warranto. <em>See Firing v. Kephart, </em><a href="/pa/466/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="466 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1714961" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0560-01">466 Pa. 560</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="466 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1714961" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0560-01">353 A.2d 833</a> (1976) (A provision of the constitution will be interpreted not in a strained or technical manner but as understood by the people who adopted it). As we find it to be improper to augment Petitioner’s powers beyond that which the electorate granted via the constitutional amendment, we conclude that Petitioner does not have standing to pursue an action in quo warranto.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
