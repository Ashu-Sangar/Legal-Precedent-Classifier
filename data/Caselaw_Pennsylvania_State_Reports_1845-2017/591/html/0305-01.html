Ultimately, we held that the common pleas court erred in holding that a rolling provision exempts Appellees’ claims from GARA repose by virtue of Appellant’s status as original manufacturer, type certificate holder, and/or designer, with regard to alleged defects associated with replacement parts that they did not physically manufacture or supply.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Further, we held that Section 400 of the Second Restatement of Torts does not give rise to continuing liability on the part of a defendant/manufacturer over and against GARA with regard to replacement parts that the defendant/manufacturer did not actually supply. We also noted that the litigation is complex, and other grounds were asserted by Appellees in their efforts to avoid summary judgment, and we remanded to the common pleas court without foreclosing the possibility that the cases might proceed to trial in light of such grounds.</p>

Although Appellees did brief the matter extensively in the common pleas court, and we considered this briefing in the initial appeal, their point is well taken. <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Because we agree it is best for the parties to an appeal to be afforded the opportunity to make a direct presentation to an appellate court concerning issues that will be addressed in the appeal proceedings, we granted reargument to allow for this presentation, tailoring the issues according to the holding in the initial opinion.

    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[289,714,1159,1485]]]'>Appellees contend that we erred in our initial opinion by adopting too narrow an approach to GARA’s rolling provision. The linchpin of Appellees’ argument is that GARA contains no language limiting application of the rolling provision exclusively to the physical manufacturer or seller of a particular replacement part. Appellees highlight that the hierarchical structure of responsibility assigned by the Federal Aviation Act and associated regulations demands that the aircraft engine manufacturer ensure the safety of all engine components that can affect safe operation, regardless of who physically manufactures them. Therefore, according to Appellees, the common pleas court correctly held that GARA’s eighteen-year period of liability exposure began anew in 1996 for any claims brought against Appellants relative to the engine parts for which they would otherwise bear manufacturing responsibility. Appellees recognize that there are decisions from other jurisdictions that are in tension with their broad-scale approach to the rolling provision, but they contend that these can be reconciled with their perspective if the term “manufacturer,” for purposes of this provision, is not limited to the physical builder or seller. In addition, Appellees argue that Appellants should be deemed liable for component defects just as the part’s physical manufacturer under Section 400 of the Second Restatement of Torts, because, although Appellants did not actually supply the replacement parts, they put the components out as their own, and the replacement parts alleged to have caused the accident were installed according to manufacturer requirements.</p>

All parties to the appeal have acknowledged, in various passages of their presentations, that it is <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>appropriate to consider Congressional purposes and GARA’s legislative history in interpreting this remedial legislation. As reflected in our prior opinion, the legislative history makes clear that Congress enacted GARA to ameliorate the impact of long-tail liability on a declining American aviation industry in furtherance of the national interest. <em>See Pridgen, </em><a href="/pa/588/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="588 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="3787443" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0405-01">588 Pa. at 415, 422</a>, <a href="/pa/588/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="905 A.2d 422" data-case-ids="3787443,3787565,3787744,8467266,8467288,8467330" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0405-01,/pa/588/0403-02,/pa/588/0404-01,/a2d/905/0422-01,/a2d/905/0422-02,/a2d/905/0422-03">905 A.2d at 429, 433</a>. A key assumption underlying GARA was the notion that any design defects in aircraft components generally will be discovered within the eighteen year period preceding repose. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 103-525(1), at 3 (1994), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1638, 1640 (“It is extremely unlikely that there will be a valid basis for a suit against the manufacturer of an aircraft that is more than 18 years old.

Further, it was certainly understood that component parts are subject to regular replacement under preventative maintenance regimens in the aviation industry.</p>

Because we believe that the status of type certifícate holder and/or designer fall under the umbrella of manufacturer conduct for purposes of GARA, it would wholly undermine the general period of repose if original manufacturers were excepted from claims relief for replacement parts under the rolling provision by virtue of that status alone. <em>Cf.

We reaffirm our decision rejecting the common pleas court’s suggestion that Section 400 could apply to displace GARA repose relative to Appellants, who did not supply the assertedly defective replacement components. Certainly, we agree with Appellees’ observation that Appellants “sit at the top of the aviation food chain with respect to all components comprising the type certificated engine.” Appellees’ Supplemental Brief In Further Support of Their Application for Reconsideration at 22. Thus, in the absence of GARA repose, Appellants might indeed be liable for design defects in replacement parts and/or the aircraft systems within which such components function. Again, however, consistent with the approach of a number of other jurisdictions as referenced in our original opinion and above, we believe that it would undermine Congress’s purposes to hold that GARA’s rolling provision is <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>triggered by the status of original aircraft manufacturer, type-certificate holder, and/or original designer alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

For example, Congress specified that misrepresentation, concealment, or withholding by a manufacturer of material information concerning aircraft performance, maintenance, or operation would give rise to continuing liability. <em>See </em>GARA § 2(b)(1), <a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040101" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 40101">49 U.S.C. § 40101</a>, Note.
