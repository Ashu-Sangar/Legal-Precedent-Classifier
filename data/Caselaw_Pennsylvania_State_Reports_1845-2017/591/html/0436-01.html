Appellant, Chapel Pointe, owns and operates a licensed continuing care retirement community (“CCRC”) that includes a skilled nursing facility, an assisted living facility, and an <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>independent living apartment facility. Appellant had previously been determined to be an institution of purely public charity and both its skilled nursing facility and its assisted living facility had been deemed exempt from real estate taxation. The dispute in the case <em>sub judice </em>arises from the propriety of the determination of the tribunals below that appellant’s independent living facility, which they viewed in isolation from the rest of the corporate community, did not qualify as an institution of purely public charity and, therefore, the parcel of property occupied by the independent living facility was not tax exempt. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b691-4" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[210,969,1157,947]]]'>Appellant is a non-profit corporation that was formed in 1944 to provide care for the elderly and infirm. Appellant’s CCRC includes a 59-bed skilled nursing home, a 53-bed assisted living compound, and 93 apartments that function as an independent living community. In 1997, appellant requested a tax exemption for the parcel consisting of the independent living community. The Cumberland County Board of Assessment (“Board”) denied the request, and appellant did not appeal. In 2001, following the enactment of Act 55, appellant again petitioned the Board for a real estate tax exemption for its independent living community. Appellant argued that its institution, as an entire entity, satisfied both the constitutional and statutory requirements for tax exemption by providing residents with, <em>inter alia, </em>uncompensated goods and services in excess of five percent of the cost of such goods and services. The Board denied the request concluding that the issue was controlled by the <em>res judicata </em>effect of its 1997 decision.</p>

The December 6, 2001 hearing <em>de novo </em>revealed that the minimum age requirement for admission to the independent living apartments is 62. Prospective residents are required to provide appellant with detailed financial statements, and appellant does not admit anyone who cannot pay the entrance fee initially, or whose financial information suggests an inability to pay the ensuing monthly fees. The <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>entrance fee ranged from $37,000 for an efficiency apartment to $73,000 for some two-bedroom apartments. Once accepted, apartment residents are given priority should a need arise to move either <em>to the </em>assisted living compound or to the skilled nursing facility. Appellant’s Executive Director, John Hendrickson, explained the entrance fee as follows:</p>

We’re not a large facility with a huge endowment that can provide benevolent care without using monies coming in from operations. So we want to look at and be sure that we’re going to be able to provide the benevolent care that we’ve already committed to, and so we have to be sure that there are people who are coming in [who] are private pay. The other reason is that we want to be sure that we have something to compare a disclosure to now should they apply for a different level of living down the road and there is a significant difference in the amount of assets that are there. Again, we do not want to give charity to just anyone. We want to give charity to or financial assistance to people that truly qualify for financial assistance.</blockquote>

    <p id="b692-6" data-blocks='[["BL_692.7",692,[296,1583,1161,797]]]'>Appellant reserved one apartment unit as a model. The total amount of entrance fees generated by the remaining 92 apartments was $5,721,000. Appellant placed each apartment on a 40-year depreciation schedule with the average stay for a resident being 3 to 4 years. Residents are permitted to stay in their apartments for as long as they are safe, as determined by appellant. Appellant amortizes entrance fees over the life expectancy of the resident and there is a recalculation each year so that, for accounting purposes, a resident never outlives his or her life expectancy. Appellant amortizes the entrance fee at 20% each year prorated monthly for 5 years. Thus, if a resident leaves his apartment within 5 years, a prorated amount of the entrance fee is refunded; but after 5 years, no portion of the fee is refunded. All income earned on entrance fees is retained by appellant.</p>

Thus, monthly fees are increased as needed. As of the hearing date, the monthly fee was $599 for one person and an additional $130 for each additional occupant. Appellant provides financial assistance to residents who have difficulty meeting their monthly obligation, albeit with the understanding that appellant could seek reimbursement. Residents struggling financially are also required to apply for financial assistance from their families, churches, and public welfare agencies.</p>
    <p id="b693-4" data-blocks='[["BL_693.5",693,[201,926,1152,467]]]'>Residents are further required to prepare and submit an annual financial statement and a statement of physical and mental health. Failure to make such disclosures constitutes grounds for residential termination. However, no resident had ever been asked to leave an apartment because of financial problems. Also, some residents facing financial problems had not had their monthly fee raised by appellant, and several residents received some financial assistance from appellant toward their monthly fees.</p>

Appellant produced testimony that, for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, it realized an operating loss and had relied upon contributions and bequests to offset that loss. The Board and Cumberland County introduced evidence that the assessed value of the 93 apartments in the year 2000 was $2,593,350. A survey of rental <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>prices in the area revealed that the average rental was $350 per month and $450 per month for 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments, respectively.</p>

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/507/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="507 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1792355" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0001-01">507 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="507 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1792355" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0001-01">487 A.2d 1306</a> (1985) <em>(“HUP”), </em>and two subsequent Commonwealth Court cases involving similar types of facilities, where exemption was denied for independent living components of retirement communities, <em>i.e., Appeal of Lutheran Social Services, </em>114 Pa. Cmwlth. 628, <a href="/pa-commw/114/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="539 A.2d 895" data-case-ids="1370773" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/114/0628-01">539 A.2d 895</a> (1988), and <em>Appeal of Bethlen Home, </em>125 Pa.Cmwlth. 315, <a href="/pa-commw/125/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="557 A.2d 828" data-case-ids="1387409" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/125/0315-01">557 A.2d 828</a> (1989). The trial court did not then return to the question it initially posed, <em>i.e., </em>whether appellant, as a corporate entity, qualified as an institution of purely public charity, but instead focused on the <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>independent living apartments in isolation from the rest of the institution. The court concluded that appellant had “not proven by credible evidence, under any standard” that it donated or rendered gratuitously a substantial portion of its services to the apartment residents. The court noted that appellant provided no assistance respecting its entrance fee, charged a monthly rental fee which was substantially higher than the norm for rental in the Carlisle area, and provided minimal assistance to but a few residents by adjusting their monthly fees. The court also noted financially insignificant ancillary program benefits, which were provided for residents who chose to participate. In the trial court’s view:</p>

The majority concluded that it did not need to decide this question because appellant’s status as an institution of purely public charity was conceded, while the disputed issue <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>was “whether the independent living apartments are being used for charitable purposes.” <a href="/a2d/852/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="852 A.2d 428" data-case-ids="9232490" data-case-paths="/a2d/852/0428-01">852 A.2d at </a>432 n. 3.

      <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>In <em>Appeal of Lutheran Social Services, </em>taxpayer Lutheran Social Services appealed the denial of a real estate tax exemption for a 96-unit apartment building and 81 cottage units it operated as part of a retirement community, which also contained a nursing facility. The local Board of Assessment reclassified the apartment building and cottages from tax exempt to taxable but did not change the status of the nursing facility from tax exempt. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court determined that the apartments were tax exempt as well because apartment applicants did not pay an admission fee and the fees they did pay did not cover the operating expenses of the apartments. Moreover, many residents were forgiven from paying increases in monthly fees and the apartments operated at a deficit. As for the cottages, however, the court noted that applicants were required to pay an entrance fee ranging from $38,500 to $46,000, depending on the type of unit, and no resident was ever admitted without paying the entrance fee. The entrance fees were placed in a reserve account, from which a one percent per month deduction per unit was made as a bookkeeping matter. If a cottage resident died, any balance of his entrance fee became the property of Lutheran Social Services. Finally, residents paid a monthly maintenance fee plus utilities. The court found that, because the cottage complex realized a substantial profit, it did not donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its services, and therefore, the cottage portion of the real property was not a purely public charity entitled to the real estate tax exemption.</p>

The county assessed the retirement cottages and the land on which they were erected for real estate taxes and Bethlen Home appealed. The local Board denied the appeal, but on further review, the trial court held that the cottages were tax exempt. The Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the cottage operation was not a purely public charity because: residents were <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>required to be 65 years or older to reside in a cottage; they had to submit evidence of their financial ability to sustain independent living; they had to pay an entrance fee ranging from $25,000 to $45,500; no applicant ever took occupancy without paying the fee; and residents paid a monthly service fee of $25 plus their utilities.

To hold otherwise, the majority stressed, would mean that “any use” could be placed on property of an entity that already had received a charitable tax exemption without negating that exemption. The majority then turned to the question it deemed controlling: whether the independent living apartments and the land they occupy on their own met the definition of a purely public charity. The only prong of the <em>HUP </em>/Act 55 test at issue respecting the apartments, the majority noted, was whether appellant donated or rendered gratuitously a substantial portion of its services.

Taxes, including real estate taxes, generate the revenue necessary to provide for governmental services. The permissive language in Article VIII, Section 2(a)(v) of the Pennsylvania Constitution authorizes, but does not require, the General Assembly to exempt certain property of certain charitable organizations from real estate taxes. <em>See also City of Philadelphia v. Barber, </em><a href="/pa/160/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="160 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="852129" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0123-01">160 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.%20644" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="28 A. 644">28 A. 644</a>, 644-45 (1894) (“The constitution exempts nothing; it merely permits the legislature to exempt, within the lines laid down for its guidance”) (construing Constitution of 1874); <em>Appeal of Donohugh, </em><a href="/pa/86/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="86 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1056636" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0306-01">86 Pa. 306</a>, 309 (1878) (same). Article VIII, Section 2(a)(v) thus allows for a legislatively-approved exception to the general rule that all real estate in Pennsylvania is to be taxed uniformly upon the same class of subjects. The general rule of tax uniformity is embodied in Article VIII, Section I of the Constitution: “All taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.” Like many other constitutional provisions first adopted in the Constitution of 1874, the Uniformity Clause sought to address and eradicate specific legislative practices of the then-recent past. As this Court noted in <em>White v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa/189/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="189 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="903479" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0222-01">189 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20125" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="42 A. 125">42 A. 125</a>, 125 (1899): “Previous to the constitution and Act of 1874, the legislature, by special act, relieved from taxation just what property it saw fit, whether the property was charitable, religious, or even devoted solely to purposes of corporate or private gain. The legislative habit had grown into a great abuse. Then came the new constitution, which at once put a stop to the abuse of power by the legislature.” <em>Accord Fox’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20A.%20149" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="4 A. 149">4 A. 149</a>, 153 (1886) (Uniformity Clause “was intended to and does sweep away forever the power of the legislature to impose unequal burdens upon the people under the form of taxation.

The proper interplay between taxpayers’ shared and uniform obligations, and the constitutional recognition that it may be appropriate, in the judgment of the General Assembly, to exempt certain charitable organizations that provide a level of public, quasi-governmental service, has been described by this Court as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b703-4" data-blocks='[["BL_703.5",703,[253,766,1115,907]]]'>Taxes are not penalties, but are contributions which all inhabitants are expected to make (and may be compelled to make) for the support of the manifold activities of government. Every inhabitant and every parcel of property receives governmental protection. Such protection costs money. When any inhabitant fails to contribute his share of the costs of this protection, some other inhabitant must contribute more than his fair share of that cost. There are substantial reasons why an institution wholly devoted to public charity should be exempt from taxation, since one of the duties of the government is to provide food and shelter for the poor. Any institution which by its charitable activities relieves the government of part of this burden is conferring a pecuniary benefit upon the body politic, and in receiving exemption from taxation it is merely being given a “quid pro quo” for its services in providing something which otherwise the government would have to provide.</blockquote>

Thus, the parcel in question need not independently appear to serve, in and of itself, a charitable purpose in order for it to qualify for the tax exemption. Rather, the proper substantive inquiry here is limited to whether appellant’s independent living facility is actually and regularly used for the purposes of appellant’s institution as a whole, <em>i.e., </em>the purpose for which appellant is organized and operated.

Appellant also emphasizes that, where a purely public charity’s property is at issue, the parcel clause of Act 55 expressly requires the taxing authority to determine only whether the particular parcel is “being used to advance the charitable purpose of an institution of purely public charity” or instead is used “for purposes other than the charitable purpose of that institution.” 10 P.S. § 875(h)(1).

Appellees contend that appellant was required to demonstrate, as a preliminary matter, that the parcel in question, on its own, serves a purely public charitable purpose in order to qualify for exemption. Appellees posit that the restriction on the real property tax exemption represented by the “only that portion” clause of Article VIII, Section 2(a)(v) requires the institution to demonstrate that charitable activity occurs on the specific parcel of land for which the exemption is sought. Appellees construe the constitutional restriction as intended to provide that any property devoted to a charitable use would be exempt, while any parcel not in itself used for charitable purposes would not be, irrespective of how closely the parcel might be connected to, or be deemed in furtherance of, the entity’s overall charitable operation. Appellees thus contend that the initial inquiry in this case properly focuses solely on the independent living complex, and whether that facility possesses a wholly eleemosynary characteristic. In appellees’ view, the fact that appellant is an institution of purely public charity with respect to other facilities, and the fact that it may appropriately be deemed a single charitable tax entity for purposes of sales and use taxation, does not change the fact that, for purposes of the real estate tax, the inquiry is whether the parcel at issue is devoted to a charitable use. Appellees stress that the “purpose” which triggers the charitable exemption must be to render charity, and not to operate a CCRC which happens to include a charitable component.</p>

In an amicus brief in support of appellant, the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Homes for the Aging (“PANPHA”) argues that the General Assembly has authority to define terms left undefined by the Constitution and that Act 55 exercises that authority, adopting a definition of the term institution of purely public charity. PANPHA notes that the definitions section of Act 55 (Section 3) defines an “institution” as “[a] domestic or foreign nonprofit corporation, association or trust or similar entity,” and that the term “institution of purely public charity” is then defined as “[a]n institution which meets the criteria under section 5.” 10 P.S. § 373. PANPHA submits that these definitions make clear that the components or divisions of a single, corporate institution are not to be viewed separately for purposes of determining whether the entity as a whole is an institution of purely public charity. PANPHA contends that the exemption inquiry is limited to the question of whether a specific parcel advances the charitable purpose of the qualifying institution. PANPHA maintains that appellant <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>here supplies a continuum of care throughout the remaining lifetime of its residents in a single, community-like setting, and it therefore should be viewed as a single entity for purposes of determining its eligibility for tax exemption.

PANPHA notes that, among other things, the CCPRDA requires continuing care providers to submit a Disclosure Statement containing the certified financial statements of the provider for the operation of the facility, but does not require a provider to submit financial statements regarding the individual components of the facility. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20125" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="42 A. 125">id.</a> </em>§ 3207(a)(9)and (10). PANPHA further notes that the CCPRDA regulates the agreements between a provider and its residents and requires the specification of the services to be provided such as food, shelter, nursing care, medications, burial and incidentals. <em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20125" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="42 A. 125">Id.</a> </em>§ 3214(a)(2). PAN-PHA stresses that the CCPRDA defines each continuing care provider as a single entity providing a continuum of care to its residents. Moreover, since the definition of the term facility under the CCPRDA includes places (plural) where care is provided, PANPHA contends that the CCPRDA contemplates a campus type of location providing housing and various levels of care services. PANPHA argues that appellant’s independent living units are part of a licensed CCRC, and the units therefore are operated in furtherance of appellant’s charitable purpose; accordingly, the parcel is tax exempt.</p>

PANPHA then cites case law for the proposition that the exemption is justified if the property contributes in a reasonable manner to the institution’s function as a <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>purely public charity. PANPHA does not dispute that the statute allows the taxing authority to conduct a parcel-by-parcel review of the property of an institution of purely public charity, but it argues that this review is limited to determining whether each parcel is used to advance the charitable purpose of the institution.

The League argues that the Pennsylvania Constitution requires uniformity in taxation and exemptions do not promote uniformity. The League maintains that the lower courts correctly determined that Article VIII, Section 2(a)(v) requires that the portion of real property for which a taxpayer seeks exemption must meet the threshold constitutional test and the taxpayer’s corporate status as an institution of purely public charity is not determinative in deciding whether a particular tract of real estate is exempt. The League asserts that, if the usage of the tract does not possess some eleemosynary characteristic, exemption would violate the Constitution. Because appellant does not donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its services relating to the independent living facility, the League contends, the lower courts correctly held that this particular parcel is not entitled to charitable exemption. The League also takes issue with appellant’s argument that the continuum of care concept is a proper charitable purpose for real estate tax exemption. The League argues that, in addressing the needs of an aging population, there must be a balance between the long-term care needs of certain individuals and the needs of local government to fund services for a growing, actively participating, and older community of residents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Appellant explains that no part of its continuing care is for commercial purposes or for any purpose other than the charitable purpose for which appellant is organized and recognized as an institution of purely public charity. The fees charged for the assisted living and skilled nursing facilities do not cover the services provided for such continuing care, and surpluses from the independent living apartments help to fund such shortages. Appellant further maintains that the prospect of such continuing and progressive care allows the residents, including those in the independent living units, to live more independently, thereby reducing the need for government service, including government-supported home and community-based programs. Appellant urges that its organizational structure pools the resources of all residents receiving each level of care combined with the charitable resources of appellant in order to assure that all residents have the full continuum of care available as needed, at rates kept reasonable by the combination of charitable giving and resident-provided funds. Appellant reiterates its view that the parcel clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires only that the parcel at issue is actually and regularly used by appellant, an admitted institution of purely public charity, for the purposes of the institution, and such is the case here.</p>

On the other hand, however, the constitutional command restrains the scope of exemption that may be legislatively authorized.

Since a single constitutional term — “institution of purely public charity” — applies with respect to all such exemptions, the presumption promotes uniformity, consistency, and predictability. The declaration and findings of legislative intent attending Act 55, while not binding upon this Court, make clear that the General Assembly was concerned with a perceived inconsistent application of eligibility standards for charitable tax exemptions. Act 55 found that the inconsistencies had led to “confusion and confrontation” among traditionally tax-exempt institutions and political subdivisions to the detriment of the public, a detriment which included the “unnecessary] diver[sion]” of “charitable and public funds ... from the public good to litigate eligibility for tax-exempt status.” 10 P.S. § 372(b). If the Act 55 presumption and test would lead to a holding that a taxpayer qualified as “an institution of purely public charity,” where the <em>HUP </em>test would not, fundamental and foundational questions could arise concerning whether: (1) the <em>HUP </em>test, which was adopted in the absence of legislation addressing the constitutional term, occupied the constitutional field concerning the exemption, or instead left room for the General Assembly to address the matter; (2) the legislative scheme as adopted comported with the constitutional command and displaced the <em>HUP </em>test; and/or (3) if <em>HUP </em>were deemed authoritative and comprehensive, whether the legislative findings and scheme set forth in Act 55 gave reason to reconsider the contours of the test thus distilled from judicial experience with individual cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

First, the Act defines, where Article VIII, Section 2(a)(v) does not, the term “institution,” as follows: “[a] domestic or foreign nonprofit corporation, association or trust or similar entity.” 10 P.S. § 373. The definition is significant, as the dissenting opinions in the Commonwealth Court recognized, because it makes clear that, in conducting statutory parcel review, the individual parcels owned by a single qualifying institution of purely public charity are not to be evaluated as if the parcels represented separate institutions or corporate entities subject to the full-blown HUP/ Act 55 test. <em>See Chartiers Valley Sch. Dist., </em><a href="/a2d/794/0981-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="794 A.2d 981" data-case-ids="9444026" data-case-paths="/a2d/794/0981-01">794 A.2d at 984</a> (“Act 55 defines the basic unit of evaluation as a corporation, association or trust or other similar entity.

Thus, the statute does not suggest that an institution of purely public charity is entitled, by virtue of that status alone, to a presumption that all parcels, or contiguous parcels, of real estate it owns qualify for the charitable exemption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Nor does the statute purport to place the burden on the taxing authority to prove that a parcel is not exempt; to the contrary, the Act reserves to the taxing authority the power of both “filing challenges” and <em>“making determinations </em>” concerning parcel review. Accordingly, as with other claims of exemption, the property of the taxpayer in an instance such as this is presumed to be taxable and the affirmative burden, in the first instance, rests upon the taxpayer to prove entitlement to exemption. <em>Southeastern Pa.

Considering the unique nature of the institution at issue <em>(ie., </em>a CCRC operated as a charitable institution), we have no doubt that the independent living facility is indeed actually and regularly used for the purposes of the institution.

Appellant’s status as a CCRC has been recognized and licensed and, as such, it is subject to the restrictions and regulations placed upon such communities by the CCPRDA. Although the independent living facility, if it were viewed in isolation or as a separate institution, might not on its own qualify as a purely public charity, its role in the comprehensive care scheme provided by appellant is consistent with, is <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>tied to, and advances appellant’s charitable purpose. The independent living facility is not a public restaurant, movie theater, golf course or some other unrelated business entity existing solely as a revenue stream to finance a different and charitable endeavor. Instead, as Judge Leavitt emphasized in dissent below, the independent living units offer entry into a community which promises to provide for the future needs of the elderly and infirm, needs that may change over time to include assisted living and skilled nursing care. In the CCPRDA, the General Assembly recognized that such “continuing-care communities have become an important and necessary alternative for the long-term residential, social and health maintenance needs for many of the Commonwealth’s elderly citizens.” 40 P.S. § 8202.</p>

One of the great fears facing citizens as they age is how to care for themselves, if age or circumstance threatens their physical, mental, and financial independence. In return for the capital investment required to enter the facility and the maintenance fees thereafter, residents of the independent living facility receive both a measure of current service and, more importantly, a promise of priority consideration for placement in appellant’s assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, if the need should arise. That need for greater and possibly subsidized care could arise in a day, a year, or never.

In appellant’s case, whatever surplus one part of its integrated community may generate is used to offset other expenses within the community.

The Constitution authorizes exemption of such institutions from taxation, and the General Assembly has long elected to provide for exemption, thus determining as a matter of policy to provide a subsidy to those charitable organizations who themselves assume some of the burden of government. The question of when and where best to draw that line is one that reasonable people might debate. Much of the argument in the briefs of the taxing authority’s amici is devoted to such questions of policy. However, that argument is better made to the General Assembly.</p>

The lower courts divided on the <em>HUP </em>question and thus had to confront some of the complexities described in text. This Court’s holding on further review — that the taxpayer qualified under <em>HUP </em>— avoided the conflict.</p>

Appellant argues at multiple points in its brief that the "presumption process” and Section 375(h) operate to "shift the burden” from a qualifying institution of purely public charity to the taxing authority to prove that the disputed parcel does not qualify for exemption. Brief for Appellant, 16, 40, 50. Appellant’s amicus goes so far as to suggest that an entity that qualifies as an institution of purely public charity under Act 55 "is entitled to assert a rebuttable presumption of entitlement to tax exemption." Brief for PANPHA, 26. This argument is belied by the plain language of the provision, as discussed above. The statutory presumption and burden shifting in the portions of the Act invoked by appellant are limited to the determination of an institution’s status as a purely public charity, and do not encompass parcel review.</p>

We do not suggest that a purely public charity could successfully claim exemption for any separate money-generating facility and property, so long as it proved that the proceeds were diverted to its charitable facilities. We recognize the force in the observation of the <em>en banc </em>majority below that such an approach could encompass almost "any use” of the property.</p>

We recognize that the decision below was consistent with prior decisions from the Commonwealth Court such as <em>Appeal of Lutheran Social Services </em>and <em>Appeal of Bethlen Home. </em>However, Judge Leavitt's points in distinction are well taken, including that those cases do not appear to have involved an argument by the taxpayer institutions that they were required to be evaluated as a single entity, for purposes of parcel review, nor does it appear that the courts in those cases were presented with an argument stressing the nature of charities operating as CCRCs. In any event, decisions of the Commonwealth Court, of course, do not bind this Court, and to the extent those decisions are inconsistent with our analysis and holding today, they are disapproved.</p>

The <em>Lock Haven </em>panel examined whether certain real property of the Lock Haven University Foundation ("Foundation”), an institution of purely public charity organized essentially to approve and coordinate all fundraising activities carried out on behalf of the University, was entitled to the real estate tax exemption for a student housing complex located adjacent to the University. In holding that the Foundation was entitled to the exemption, the panel found that the lower tribunals erred in examining the student housing complex in isolation from the Foundation as a whole. The panel explained that the proper legal analysis requires a determination of whether the Foundation as a whole meets the constitutional criteria for an institution of purely public charity, and second, a determination of whether the whole institution satisfies the criteria in Section 375(b)-(f) of Act 55. The panel also sought to distinguish the Commonwealth Court decision in <em>Alliance Home, </em>while recognizing that the further appeal in that case was pending here. We offer no view on the ultimate propriety of the <em>Lock Haven </em>decision noting only that, of course, the decision in this case controls to the extent that the <em>Lock Haven </em>decision could be said to be inconsistent with it.</p>
