Because we conclude that an attempt crime is necessarily a lesser-included offense of the substantive offense, we hold that a defendant may be convicted of an attempt crime even if the Commonwealth charged him with the substantive offense but not attempt. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand the matter to the Superior Court for consideration of appellee’s sufficiency claim.</p>

Officer Jones and another officer picked up appellee and seven or eight other prisoners from the Prison Detention Unit and went to the Central Holding Center located at 421 North 21st Street in Philadelphia. All of the prisoners sat in the back of the van and wore handcuffs. Upon arrival at the Central Holding Center, Officer Jones put the van in park and brought another prisoner to the van. Because of the logistics of fitting the prisoners into the van, Officer Jones asked for a volunteer to abandon his seat in the back of the van and move to a seat that was closer to the front. Appellee offered to move, exited the van, and stood between Officer Jones and the door to the van to allow for the other prisoner to enter the van. Officer Jones reached behind appellee and put his hand on the van’s door so that his arm was placed on the small of appellee’s back. As the new prisoner got into the van, appellee tried to duck under the officer’s arm. Officer Jones turned and forced appellee against a wall that was two or three feet away, grabbed him, and brought him back to the van. Appellee was subsequently charged with escape, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 5121. N.T., 1/23/04, at 10-34.</p>

Applying these standards to the facts <em>sub judice, </em>the Commonwealth argues, attempted escape clearly is a lesser-included offense of escape because attempted escape is proven by less than all the facts required to prove the crime of escape. Specifically, the Commonwealth clarifies, attempted escape requires proof of all the same elements of the crime of escape except that the attempted escape need not be successful. Furthermore, the Commonwealth argues, attempted escape clearly meets the second factor of the <em>Garcia </em>test because attempted escape, by definition, constitutes an attempt to commit the charged crime of escape.</p>

The Commonwealth claims that the Superior Court’s decision transplants the law back to a time when courts would <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>abort meritorious prosecutions on technical defects in indictments. The Commonwealth argues that such a system is unjustifiable because a defendant is necessarily on notice to defend against the elements of any lesser-included offense, because, by definition, those elements must be extant in proving the charged offense. Accordingly, the Commonwealth contends, a defendant cannot claim to be harmed or deprived of due process of law. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues, a defendant would actually be denied due process under federal precedent if the Superior Court’s decision were permitted to stand. Specifically, the Commonwealth explains, defendants will have no right to lesser-included offense instructions in cases where the Commonwealth has not separately charged the lesser-included offense. Under precedent from the Third Circuit, the Commonwealth continues, due process guarantees criminal defendants the right to receive instructions on lesser-included offenses. Therefore, the Commonwealth concludes, convictions obtained pursuant to the standard announced by the Superior Court would be overturned on federal habeas review as being unconstitutional.</p>

He contends that the plain language of 18 Pa.C.S. § 5121 only criminalizes completed acts of removal or failures to return, not attempts at such. Therefore, he concludes, to obtain a conviction for his failed attempt at escape, the Commonwealth had to have charged him with the inchoate offense of criminal attempt under 18 Pa.C.S. § 901.

Although Pennsylvania has consistently approved of the doctrine, the more difficult question has always been determining what constitutes a lesser-included offense. Traditionally, there have been three varying approaches in making such determinations: the statutory-elements approach, the cognate-pleadings approach, and the evidentiary approach. 5 Wayne R.

Under this approach, the trial court is required to identify the elements of both the greater charge and the lesser charge and determine whether it is possible to commit the greater offense <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>without committing the lesser offense.

Rather, it is sufficient that the two offenses have certain elements in common. The focus of this approach is on the pleadings as the trial court must determine whether the allegations in the pleadings charging the greater offense include allegations of all of the elements of the lesser offense. If so, the lesser charge is considered a lesser-included offense of the greater charge. As this approach centers on the pleadings of the case, notice and due process violations are not generally grave concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 579-81.</p>

First, as the question is presented here, the inquiry arises in situations where a defendant is convicted of a crime that was not actually charged. <em>See, e.g., Carter, </em><a href="/pa/482/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="482 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1749595" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0274-01">393 A.2d at 661</a> (finding that because criminal trespass is not a lesser-included offense of burglary for notice purposes, defendants could not be convicted of criminal trespass where they had not been indicted for that crime).

Finally, the question is presented in the double jeopardy context, <em>i.e., </em>whether imposing two sentences for the two crimes violates the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

By charging a defendant with the more serious offense, the Commonwealth provides the defendant with notice that it will seek to prove that he committed that offense.

We recognize that a defendant may not wish to put on a defense against the more serious offense if it requires him to concede guilt as to the less serious offense.
