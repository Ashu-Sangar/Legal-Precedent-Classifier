At its essence, this case centers on the meaning of the word “cost” as used in PURTA. PECO alleges that the plain language of PURTA indicates that the cost to be used is the cost “as shown by the books of account of a public utility.” 72 P.S. § 8101-A(4). Additionally, PECO contends that the Act caused a significant decrease in the value of their electric generation assets which made it necessary for them to restate the cost of those assets on their books. However, the Commonwealth disagrees, and alleges that “cost” in accounting terms means “original cost.” The Board of Finance and Revenue agreed. The Commonwealth Court determined that PECO had incorrectly used a cost for assets which was reduced due to stranded costs,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> rather than the original cost of the item. Because the plain language of the statute indicates that the cost used to compute PECO’s PURTA tax shall be the cost reflected on the books of account of the company, and because PECO, in its original PURTA tax return, used the cost correctly reflected on its books of account, we reverse.</p>

In April 1998, PECO filed its 1997 PURTA tax report pursuant to Section 1102-A(b) of PURTA, showing the amount and manner of computation of the state taxable value upon which it based its payment of utility realty tax. PECO reported the 1997 state taxable value of its utility realty to be $184,246,005 for a tax of $7,738,332 (for comparison, in the 1995 tax year, PECO reported a state taxable value of $1,441,558,601, and for 1996 it reported a state taxable value of $1,396,441,347). The Department of Revenue audited PECO’s 1997 PURTA return, and as a result, it settled PECO’s 1997 utility realty tax at $63,480,824 based on a settled state taxable value of $1,511,448,190.</p>

Additionally, the Commonwealth Court noted that although PECO adopted the accounting changes for the 1997 year, “the PUC did not issue its initial or final restructuring order until 1998,” <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>thus PECO could not “reasonably or reliably determine how deregulation would effect its electric generation business” at the time the accounting systems were changed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Therefore, the three-member panel held that PECO was not entitled to use any form of extraordinary deduction to determine its taxable value for purposes of PURTA and the court affirmed the Board of Finance and Revenue. <em>PECO Energy Co. v.

She noted that while <em>Thor Power Tool </em>did determine that GAAP did not control in that case, the statute at issue in <em>Thor </em>indicated that GAAP would only control if the Commissioner believed that the method used clearly reflected the income of the company. Thus, the statute itself contained language which trumped GAAP. <em>PECO Energy Co. </em>at 1100-01. No such language exists in the PURTA statute at issue here.

Specifically, the Court determined that GAAP did not control because, although the section of the U.S.Code at issue indicated that “[tjaxable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis of which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books,” the statute went on to indicate that “[i]f the method used does not clearly reflect income, the computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, does clearly reflect income.” <a href="/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20446" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="26 U.S.C. § 446">26 U.S.C. § 446</a>.

In view of the demand for the regulated services or products and the level of competition, direct and indirect, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover the enterprise's costs can be charged to and collected from customers. This criterion requires consideration of anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition during the recovery period for any capitalized costs.</blockquote>
