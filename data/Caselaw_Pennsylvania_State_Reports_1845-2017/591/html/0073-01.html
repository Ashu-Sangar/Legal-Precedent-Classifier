Moreover, the DEP requested an updated calculation of the proposed amount of bonding for the tires at the Facility.

TJS’s supplemental filings also failed even to mention the existence of TDP. TJS further supplemented its application by including a revised bond calculation. TJS maintained that bonding was needed only for waste tires. Relying on its theory that most or all of the tires at the Facility were not waste tires, TJS then claimed that only a minimal amount of bonding was required.

Thus, TJS reasons that a material is not “waste,” but rather a raw material, if the material that would otherwise be considered “waste” is going to be used as an ingredient in an industrial process to make a <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>product.

TJS maintains that the shredding and cutting at its Facility merely changes the size and shape of the tire and does not change its essential make-up. TJS argues that the processing exception was included in the regulation to make clear that the exception applied to simple types of processing. TJS claims that a material that requires sizing, shaping or sorting before it can be used as an industrial process or as a substitute for a commercial product is not considered “waste” under the regulation, and thus is not subject to DEP permitting regulations. Therefore, TJS contends that if the processing operations of a facility are limited to sizing, shaping and sorting of the waste material, that facility is exempt from obtaining a permit.</p>

Thus, TJS argues that its activities fall within the exception to the definition of “waste” because its used tires are either recycled into a substitute for a commercial product or are utilized as an ingredient in an industrial process after they arrive at the Facility. However, the plain language of the exception to the definition of “waste” provides that such material is not “waste” “when recycled[,]” not before the material is recycled. 25 Pa.Code § 287.1. Therefore, we agree with the DEP that, because the used tires that TJS accumulates cannot immediately be employed as an effective substitute for a commercial product without some form of processing, and because the used tires at the facility are not an ingredient in an industrial process, TJS’s used tires do not <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>meet the requirements for the exception to the definition of “waste.”</p>

While recognizing that there may be some types of waste material that may immediately be employed as an effective substitute for a commercial product or as an industrial ingredient, used tires are not such a material. All used tires at the Facility must be processed in some fashion before they can become effective substitutes for commercial products or ingredients in an industrial process. When a tire reaches the Facility, processing begins through visual inspection and pressure testing. Some of the tires are then further sized, sorted, shaped, cut, shredded and baled. If waste material must be processed, it cannot fall within the exception to the definition of “waste.” We therefore agree with the DEP that TJS’s handling of each used tire at the Facility constitutes “processing” under the RWRs because TJS employs methods or technology “used for the purpose of reducing the volume or bulk of municipal or residual waste or a method or technology used to convert part or all of the waste materials for offsite reuse.” 25 Pa.Code § 287.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a>

The DEP maintains that there is nothing in TJS’s operations that involve a mixture or a compound. We agree with this interpretation. The used tires are processed <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>into new, distinct products via cutting and shredding of the used tires.</p>

As mentioned above, the whole used tires at the Facility do not meet this requirement. If a material must be sized, sorted or shaped to become ready to use as an effective substitute for a commercial product or as an ingredient in an industrial process, then the exception does not apply. For whatever use, TJS processes every whole used tire at the Facility through inspection, testing, sizing, sorting, shaping, cutting or shredding. TJS does not merely size, shape and sort the used tires into reusable tires of smaller dimension.

Massive quantities of used tires pose a particular threat to the public health, safety and welfare, and also the environment, especially when not bonded adequately. It is for these reasons that the SWMA requires a permit for the operation of tire recycling facilities. The DEP’s power to enforce the law, and thereby to protect the public interest, would be eviscerated if tire recycling facilities, such as the one TJS operated and expanded while avoiding licensure, were not required to obtain a permit and could process used tires without proper regulatory oversight.</p>

Under the definitions of “processing” and “transfer facility,” the relevant provisions here, the lists of materials do not include used tires. <em>See </em>25 Pa.Code § 287.1.

[Pignataro] did not identify himself or provide any information concerning [TJS] or the operations at the [Facility].
