    <p id="b376-10" data-blocks='[["BL_376.12",376,[282,1362,1159,411]]]'>First, as pointed out in the dissent in <em>Lussi, </em>there are different elements in the tax statute and the Crimes Code statute: perhaps most significantly, the latter requires intent, while a conviction for the former may be based solely on negligence.

    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[216,866,1152,827]]]'>There is no effort in <em>Lussi </em>to construe the two “if possible, so that effect may be given to both” — the two are approached as “either/or,” and not as possibly coexisting. Further, the penultimate phrase of this statute is not mentioned by the <em>Lussi </em>Court. It says that special provisions prevail <em>unless </em>the general provision is enacted later, and there is manifest legislative intent that the general prevail. The embezzlement provision was codified as part of the Local Tax Collection Law in 1945. In 1972, the legislature enacted the Crimes Code, including §§ 3922 and 3927; these general provisions were enacted later. Section 107(b) of the 1972 Crimes Code expressly states the legislature’s intent that the Code supersede existing criminal statutes and that common law crimes be abolished. 18 Pa.C.S. § 107(b). Thus, both prongs of § 1933’s exception are met, and if there is an irreconcilable conflict here, the general provisions prevail.</p>

Is it not absurd for an individual who has violated a position of public trust by embezzling taxpayer funds to be shielded from the felony theft charges she would otherwise face but for her position as a tax collector? As the legislature does not intend such an absurd result, <em>Lussi </em>should be rejected when properly framed for this Court’s attention. As the parties did not raise this issue, however, I concur in the majority’s holding with regard to the issue before us, <em>i.e., </em>that § 9303 cannot be applied retroactively.</p>
