When Irma Colon answered the door, she found Appellant dressed in a Philadelphia Gas Works uniform and representing that he was there to check the gas meter. After being let into the house, Appellant took hold of Irma Colon’s neck and demanded that she give him the key to admit an accomplice into the house. Appellant and his accomplice proceeded to the bedroom in which Mr. Ortiz, Carmen Colon and their son were sleeping. He threatened to kill Irma Colon unless Ortiz let him into the bedroom. Appellant then <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>demanded money, jewelry, and drugs. Appellant forced Ortiz and Irma Colon to the floor, threatening to kill them if he did not find what he was seeking. The accomplice proceeded to ransack the house. Appellant beat Irma Colon in the head with his gun until she lost consciousness. Carmen Colon watched as Appellant and his accomplice beat Ortiz and bound his hands and feet. Her eyes were closed when she heard a gunshot. When she opened them, she saw Ortiz laying on the floor with a gunshot wound to the head.</p>

At the penalty phase, the jury found three aggravating circumstances: the murder occurred in the perpetration of a felony (burglary); defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another; and defendant had a significant history of violent crime felony convictions. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), (7), (9). The jury found two mitigating circumstances: defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the crime; and the defendant’s circumstances fit within the catch-all mitigating circumstance. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), (8). As the mitigating circumstances were out weighed by the aggravating circumstances, the jury sentenced Appellant to death for the murder of Jose Ortiz.

In Pennsylvania, we begin with the presumption that counsel is effective. <em>Commonwealth v.

In order to overcome this presumption, an appellant must establish three elements: (1) the underlying claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for his action; and (3) the petitioner was prejudiced by the ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 975-76 (1987). In determining whether counsel’s actions were reasonable, we do not question whether there were other more logical courses of action which counsel could have pursued: rather, we must examine whether counsel’s decisions had any reasonable basis. <em>Rollins, </em><a href="/a2d/738/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="738 A.2d 435" data-case-ids="11564986,838563" data-case-paths="/a2d/738/0435-01,/pa/558/0532-01">738 A.2d at 441</a>. Further, in order to establish prejudice, it must be demonstrated that “but for the act or omission in question, the outcome of the proceedings would <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>have been different.” <em><a href="/a2d/738/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="738 A.2d 435" data-case-ids="11564986,838563" data-case-paths="/a2d/738/0435-01,/pa/558/0532-01">Id.</a> </em>If a defendant fails to set forth evidence sufficient to meet any of the three elements, his ineffectiveness claim will be denied. <em>Pierce, </em>786 A.2d at 221-22. Further, we have held that “[i]f it is clear that Appellant has not demonstrated that counsel’s act or omission adversely affected the outcome of the proceedings, the claim may be dismissed on that basis alone and the court need not first determine whether the first and second prongs have been met.” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <blockquote id="b863-6" data-blocks='[["BL_863.6",863,[241,1012,1116,1073]]]'>This hyper-technical semantical claim is rejected on a plethora of bases. First, although we have historically considered the language contained in these standard instructions to be an aid in our review, we have not placed our imprimatur upon them. See generally, <em>Commonwealth v. Tilley, </em><a href="/pa/528/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="528 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1829784" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0125-01">528 Pa. 125</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="528 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1829784" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0125-01">595 A.2d 575</a>, 583 (1991). Second, even if we had adopted this specific instruction, it is an unquestionable maxim of law in this Commonwealth that a trial court has broad discretion in phrasing its instruction, and may choose its own wording so long as the law is clearly, adequately, and accurately presented to the jury for its consideration. <em>Commonwealth v. Ohle, </em><a href="/pa/503/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="503 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1785935" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0566-01">503 Pa. 566</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="503 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1785935" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0566-01">470 A.2d 61</a>, 70 (1983). In this matter the distinction between “hesitate” and “restrain before acting” is <em>de minimis </em>and clearly such a subtle variation in phrasing would not be an abuse of the trial court’s discretion. Finally, this court has actually approved of a reasonable doubt instruction which tells the jury that it is “the kind of doubt that would restrain a reasonable man (or woman) from acting.... ” <em>Commonwealth v.

Her statements do not meet this definition. Rather, they were merely facts that painted a full picture of the incident at issue to aid in the jury’s understanding of the crime. The fact that Ms. Colon was romantically involved with the decedent establishes a reason for her presence in the room at the time of the incident. Her son’s age is relevant to explain his lack of participation as a witness. Her pregnancy shows a reason for remaining on the bed rather than actively resisting. That she was merely wearing a bra and panties explain why she requested time to put on clothes before admitting Appellant into the bedroom.

First, only one line can be construed as even arguably misleading, when Jacinto Rios testified that he had never “been in trouble.” Jacinto Rios’ criminal record, attached to Appellant’s PCRA Petition, reveals that he had, in fact, one eight year old conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and criminal conspiracy at the time of his testimony. While he was also being prosecuted for a drug related offense at the time of his testimony he was not yet convicted. In his closing argument, the prosecutor did not argue that Jacinto Rios had never been in trouble, rather, he argued that Jacinto had never killed anyone. As such, taken in context, Jacinto Rios’ testimony as to his criminal record was not misleading. In addition, Appellant has set forth nothing to prove that, even if these comments were improper, they caused him prejudice. A bald assertion of improper questions in the course of cross examination is insufficient, absent a showing of prejudice, to support a claim for ineffectiveness. <em>See Albrecht, </em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">720 A.2d at 701</a>.</p>

This distinction is immaterial here, however, in that as explained <em>supra, </em>the conduct complained of was not improper, as such there is no arguable merit as to a claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness.</p>

On the life-history aspect, the majority indicates that Appellant specifically instructed trial counsel not to present additional family witnesses and threatened counsel. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 619-20, 920 A.2d at 811. The PCRA court, however, did not rest its decision on this evidence or make a credibility assessment in this regard. Moreover, there was evidence of additional discussions with Appellant, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T., April 4, 2000, at 67-68; trial counsel further testified at the post-conviction hearing that he did not believe that he was impeded from presenting all of the mitigating evidence that he had available to him, <em>see </em>N.T., April 4, 2000, at 141-42; and counsel did secure family witness testimony.

Dr. O'Brien did, however, render a mental-health diagnosis of alcohol and mixed substance abuse by history, which is recognized under the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ("DSM-IV"). <em>See </em>N.T., July 25, 2000, at 92. Further, he indicated that he did not have enough information concerning whether Appellant suffered from any condition under the DSM’s Axis II categorization. <em>See </em>N.T., July 25, 2000, at 90 (“I think that he has a variety of problems, but that does not render an Axis II, because I don’t feel I have enough information.”); <em><a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="266" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">id.</a> </em>("I'm not concluding he doesn't suffer from other problems....”). Various aspects of Dr. O’Brien’s testimony also highlighted the potential value of mental-health evidence in terms of providing context. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 103 (reflecting Dr. O'Brien’s explanation that neglect and abandonment is "[o]ftentimes connected with development of his behavior and problems with the law”).</p>

Counsel testified that he did not believe that he knew what a schizophrenic reaction was, other than it was some type of a psychiatric problem, "probably having something to do with some type of split or bipolar personality.” N.T., April 3, 2000, at 51. Further, despite that the reference to a ten-year-old "schizophrenic reaction” was the sole source of evidence concerning mental-health mitigation, counsel testified that he did not consider it important that the jury be advised as to what the reference meant. <em>See id. </em>at 59-60.</p>

I find the majority's decision particularly troubling to the extent that it can be read as suggesting that a finding of any catch-all mitigating circumstance by at least one juror will foreclose a challenge based upon a capital attorney's failure to investigate and present other reasonably available catch-all-type evidence of a different character. Measured against their facts, neither <em>Scott </em>nor <em>Marshall </em>supports such a proposition.</p>

In light of the calculated nature of Appellant's crimes and his criminal history', I recognize that this was a particularly difficult case for the defense at the penalty phase of trial. Nevertheless, I believe that the judicial review in this case should fairly reflect an acknowledgment that trial counsel’s penalty-phase presentation was very weak, and that there was considerable information available that would have presented a better case of mitigation. Concerning the weight of the latter, I would leave the assessment to the PCRA court in the first instance, upon correction of the deficiencies noted above.</p>
