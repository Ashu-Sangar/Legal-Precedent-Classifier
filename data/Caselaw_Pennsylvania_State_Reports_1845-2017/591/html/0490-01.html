On July 12, 1993 Workers’ Compensation Judge Martin Burman denied the petition, finding that Appellant was suffering from a C8-T1 radiculopathy and that he had an underlying congenital syrinx and an Arnold-Chiari formation that had been aggravated by the work-injury. On January 4, 1994 Employer filed its second petition to terminate benefits, again alleging full recovery. Workers’ Compen<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>sation Judge Susan Kelly denied this petition by an August 28, 1997 decision. In addition to the earlier recognized disorders, Judge Kelly accepted that Appellant was also suffering from an L5-S1 radiculopathy that was related to the work injury. Employer filed a third termination petition on April 19, 1999. Appellant, in turn, filed a Petition to Review Notice of Compensation Payable seeking a determination that his left knee injury was caused by his work related injuries. On November 30, 2001, Workers’ Compensation Judge Phethuvuyo Gagai issued a decision denying Employer’s petition and adding Appellant’s left knee condition as a causally-related injury. Employer appealed and on December 9, 2002, the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board affirmed Judge Gagai’s decision.</p>

Deposition of Dr. Herbert Stein, 4/29/2003, p. 37. According to his assessment, Dr. Stein opined that Appellant’s work-related injuries were limited to an acute cervical spine sprain and an acute lumbosacral spine strain, both of which had healed. <em>Id. </em>at p. 27. Dr. Stein asserted that Appellant’s Arnold-Chiari malformation and syrinx were completely unrelated to the work injury. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Stein also testified that he saw no objective evidence for Appellant’s radiculopathy. <em>Id. </em>at p. 29. Further, Dr. Stein opined that Appellant’s knee injury was caused by patellofemoral degenerative osteoarthritis, and was thus not work-related. <em>Id.</em>

The court also rejected Appellant’s argument that Dr. Stein’s testimony does not support a termination of benefits because it was not based on new diagnostic studies, but rather, merely reassessed those already taken in prior proceedings. The Court held that whether to take new diagnostic studies is within the discretion of the medical professional. Finally, the Court rejected the contention that Dr. Stein’s testimony does not support the termination of benefits because it was not unequivocal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The prior cases apply the <em>Kachinski </em>test to require an employer seeking modification based on improved condition to show a change in claimant’s physical condition since the last adjudication. The cases decided subsequently require the same. Although this Court adheres to the principle of <em>stare decisis, </em>it will not be bound by a decision that in itself is clearly contrary to the body of the law. <em>Mayhugh v.

In such instances, it is consistent with the principle underlying <em>stare decisis </em>to purify the body of law by overruling erroneous decisions. This is one of those cases. By overruling <em>King </em>we are not ignoring controlling jurisprudence, but rather, merely removing an anomaly from an otherwise healthy body of law. As such, to the extent that <em>King </em>suggests that an employer need not establish a change in a claimant’s physical condition since the last disability adjudication in order to successfully raise a modification or termination petition due to a decrease in claimant’s physical disability, it is overruled.</p>

In the fourth termination petition, the Employer’s expert, Dr. Stein, was free to present evidence that Appellant had recovered from these injuries. He did not. Instead, Dr. Stein recharacterized Appellant’s injuries in a manner inconsistent with the prior adjudications. He claimed that Appellant’s knee injury was caused by a degenerative condition and is completely non-work related. He stated the same regarding Appellant’s syrinx and Arnold-Chiari malformation. As to the radiculopathies, Dr. Stein opined that there was no objective evidence supporting their existence. Dr. Stein’s diagnosis was that Appellant’s work-related injuries were limited to an acute cervical spine sprain and an acute lumbrosacral spine strain, from which he had completely recovered.</p>

Dr. Stein’s opinion merely attempts to recharacterize the cause of those conditions, which, as explained above, is barred by issue preclusion. As such, Employer has not predicated its fourth termination petition on medical evidence of a change in Appellant’s physical condition as required by <em>Kachinski. </em>Without doing so, Employer lacked sufficient grounds to maintain the fourth termination petition.

Because pulmonary disease is an irreversible condition, to hold that claimant no longer suffers therefrom would merely be a relitigation of the already settled diagnosis. This Court held that collateral estoppel bars such relitigation. The Court reasoned: "If it did not, disability victims could be continually harassed with petitions and heatings where they would be repeatedly forced to redemonstrate or redefend their claim of occupational disease and consequent disability.” <em>Hebden, </em><a href="/pa/534/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="632 A.2d 1302" data-case-ids="1839682,1839705" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0326-01,/pa/534/0327-01">632 A.2d at 1304</a>.

Consistent with <em>Ilebden, </em>however, an employer cannot, in a later action, concede that the claimant is still suffering from the previously-adjudicated injuries, but that those injuries are not work related.

The Concurring Opinion suggests that an employer should be permitted one challenge of an award of workers compensation benefits based upon "purely subjective physical complaints" without having to show a change in physical condition. This position is problematic for two reasons. First, once a Workers’ Compensation Judge makes an adjudication of disability, the claimant’s condition is not subjective as a matter of law. Rather, it is an adjudicated work-related injury. This determination is appealable as of right. Second, to allow an employer the chance to collaterally dispute an adjudication of disability under<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>mines the finality of judgments and rewrites the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>

This Justice has suggested that the timing of an otherwise valid repeat termination or modification petition within an unreasonably short period of time from a prior petition may very well indicate bad faith on the part of the Employer, which may invalidate the petition. <em>See King, </em><a href="/a2d/700/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="700 A.2d 431" data-case-ids="11899512,18324" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0431-01,/pa/549/0075-01">700 A.2d at 436</a> (Cappy Concurring).

However, we added in <em>Hebden </em>that “[w]e do not lose sight of the fact that the Workmen’s Compensation Act at section 413 (77 P.S. § 772) expressly provides that an award may be terminated based upon changes in the employees disability.” We held that where an employee’s condition is changeable, that condition may be re-examined at a later time to see if he is still disabled, but where the condition is irreversible, an attempt to re-examine the employee’s condition is precluded by res judicata and constitutes an attempt to re-litigate what has already been settled. <em><a href="/pa/534/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="632 A.2d 1302" data-case-ids="1839682,1839705" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0326-01,/pa/534/0327-01">Id.</a></em>
