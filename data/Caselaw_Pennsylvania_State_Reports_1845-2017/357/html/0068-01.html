    <p id="b109-11" data-blocks='[["BL_109.18",109,[267,1448,1151,488]]]'>This is an appeal of Mildred Thomas from a conviction of murder in the first degree, with life sentence imposed. Her brother, Mike Bubna, ivas at the same trial convicted of the same murder in the same degree, with the death penalty imposed. The defendants did not demand separate trials. The facts relating to the murder of Bobert Fisher are set forth in the opinion this day filed in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Bubna, </em><a href="/pa/357/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="357 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="472097" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0051-01">357 Pa. 51</a>, and it is not necessary to repeat them.</p>
    <p id="b109-12" data-blocks='[["BL_109.19",109,[269,1951,1150,383]]]'>The proof that Mrs. Thomas was an accessory after the fact to Fisher’s murder was overwhelming. One may be an accessory after the fact to a murder yet not be guilty as a principal. The circumstances that the murder of Fisher took place in her house and that she witnessed it did not in themselves make her guilty of the crime. See <em>Com. v. New, </em><a href="/pa/354/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="354 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="467421" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0188-01">354 Pa. 188</a>, at 198, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.2d%20450" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="47 A.2d 450">47 A. 2d 450</a>.</p>

      <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Mrs. Thomas’ actions in cutting the hair and eyebrows of Fisher before he was killed and her actions in resuming the cutting of his hair after he was killed and her actions in destroying his wallet and all papers found therein are, as testified to, set forth in the opinion this day filed in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Bubna, </em><a href="/pa/357/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="357 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="472097" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0051-01">supra.</a> The fact of her cutting Fisher’s hair <em>before </em>the homicide would be as consistent with her claim that it was done as a joke as it would be with the Commonwealth’s claim that its purpose was to make more difficult the identification of Fisher after he was done to death. But the fact that she <em>immediately after </em>the shooting of Fisher in the cellar <em>resumed </em>the cutting of his hair cancels her claim that the hair-cutting <em>before </em>the homicide was a “joke”. When Fisher was murdered in her presence the joke phase of this case had ended. <em>At that time </em>there could have been no intention on her part to “make him the laughing stock of Erie” (as she testified she said when in the kitchen she cut his hair). The jury was justified in concluding that Mrs. Thomas’ tonsorial treatment of Fisher was in its inception more homicidal than humorous.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[233,1474,1153,865]],["BL_111.1",111,[238,271,1149,594]]]'>The hair cutting and eyebrow shaving of Fisher were probably based on the assumption that Mike Dominic would do a much more thorough job than he did do in disposing of Fisher’s body. It could not have been within the calculations of the conspirators that Dominic in executing the order to get rid of the body would merely place it on the ground in a not very secluded spot and cover it lightly with leaves and dirt. If Dominic had so disposed of the body as to delay its discovery there might have been such a change effected in Fisher’s features that with his hair clipped and his eyebrows shaved he could not have been easily identified. Mrs. Thomas after Fisher’s killing not only resumed the clipping of his hair but she also took his purse, removed papers from it, tore them up and threw them and the purse into the furnace. These papers probably contained <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>identifying data. She also cast into the furnace the scissors with which she cut Fisher’s hair and flushed that hair down the toilet. She also took off Fisher’s stockings and when Dominic asked her why she did these things she replied: “So you don’t find any identifications.” When Dominic returned to the house after disposing of Fisher’s body, Mrs. Thomas told him to “change his clothes.” He did so and she later told him that she had taken the changed clothes “down and burned them in the furnace”. Fisher’s collar was cut off by Bubna and also burned.</p>
    <p id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[242,874,1148,595]]]'>Ordinarily the close clipping of a man’s hair does not radically alter his appearance for his hair is usually thin. But we have the testimony of the victim’s wife that his hair was “long and wavy” and that when she saw him in the morgue “his hair was viciously cut off— it was just whacked off in hunks — it was very short.” Cutting the <em>long and wavy </em>hair of a man substantially alters his appearance and Mrs. Thomas obviously knew this. When Fisher’s body was discovered only two days after his death his features were not spoiled but the plot was.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[243,1479,1148,702]]]'>Furthermore, the zeal which Mrs. Thomas exhibited in covering up the traces of this crime, such as her promptness in washing the mud and blood off the car, indicates that she had advance notice of the murder scheme and approved of it. There is no allegation that she acted under duress. The evidence warrants the conclusion that Mrs. Thomas and her brother had planned the murder of Fisher when they knew he was coming to the former’s home to air his grievances and to answer charges of “double-crossing” in the car stealing racket. The first act in the perpetration of this crime was stupifying Fisher with liquor. The second act was the alteration of his appearance.</p>
    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[243,2191,1148,153]],["BL_112.1",112,[260,277,1152,1126]]]'>When <em>after </em>the killing of Fisher, Mrs. Thomas <em>resumed </em>the cutting of his hair and burned the papers in his wallet, her purpose was no longer in doubt. These and <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>other post-murder acts directed towards the concealment of Fisher’s murder made her an accessory <em>after the fact, but </em>her clipping of Fisher’s “long, wavy” hair and her shaving of his eyebrows <em>before </em>the murder so fitted into her subsequent criminal conduct as to reveal that the purpose of <em>both </em>the “before” and the “after” hair clipping was the same. The hair cutting and eyebrow shaving before the murder, with <em>this </em>purpose, made her a party to this murder plan. We said in <em>Commonwealth v. Strantz, </em><a href="/pa/328/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="328 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1179695" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0033-01">328 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2075" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="195 A. 75">195 A. 75</a>: “One is an aider and abbettor in the commission of any crime, i. e., he has ‘joined in its commission,’ if he was an active partner in the intent which was the crime’s basic element . . . ‘The least degree of concert or collusion between parties to an illegal transaction makes the act of one the act of all.’ . . . when- two or more persons conspire or combine with one another to commit any unlawful act, each is criminally responsible for the acts of his associate or confederate committed in furtherance of the common design.

The legitimate inference is that she had already been apprised of the “messy”, i. e., bloody, work which was afoot and that her brother’s “blue print” for Fisher’s murder had her approval. In that “blue print” the part assigned to her <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>was to proceed without delay to make the victim’s identification doubtful and'both <em>before and after </em>the murder she showed promptness and zeal in carrying out her assignment. She even went in the cellar to witness her brother’s performance of his “messy” job, and so that no time should be wasted between Fisher’s “taking off” and the destruction of identification indicia, she resumed her work without further orders from the director. She needed none for she had already performed a preliminary part of the felonious work before its consummation. ■</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[238,827,1152,373]]]'>Her “before the fact” activities in attempting to make difficult the-identification later of the man marked for slaughter so dove-tailed with her “after the fact” activities directed to the same end as to constitute them a perfect unit in her and her brother’s plan of murder— a plan conceived in greed and executed with brutality and dispatch.</p>
    <p id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[242,1212,1150,583]]]'>In her own defense Mrs. Thomas testified that when Fisher left her home at about 8 P. M. on March 4th, after a “friendly conversation” with her brother, Bubna.went to bed and later got up when Dominic returned. Bubna then laid on the davenport. She denied (1) asking Eleanor for any shears, (2) cutting Fisher’s hair and eyebrows, (3) going into the cellar, (4) taking Fisher’s wallet or (5) removing his stockings. She said she heard no shots and did not see Fisher’s dead body. She denied advising Dominic later in the evening to “change his clothes” and stated that she burned no clothes of his.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>There are six assignments of error in this ease and all of these are dismissed as being without merit.

It would have been advisable for the court to have explained more fully the nature of circumstantial evidence, but on this phase of the case there was no such inadequacy of instruction as to amount to reversible error.
