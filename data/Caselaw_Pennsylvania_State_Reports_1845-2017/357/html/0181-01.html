The jury convicted them of murder in the first degree and imposed the death penalty. On the night of July 13, 1946, the defendants while in a taproom in Chester, Pa., “decided to go out and rob a filling station or some place.” Byron, armed with a .32 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver and Moyer, armed with a .32 caliber Boyal auto-, matie pistol, cruised along MacDade Blvd., Delaware County, in a car which they had previously stolen, with the specific intent of carrying out their conspiracy. At or about 11 P. M. they selected as a suitable site to rob, a gasoline station located on MacDade Blvd. and Sylvania Ave., Delaware County, which was owned and operated by one Earl Shank. They drove their stolen car into the gasoline station, between the curb and the “island”, where they were approached by Harvey Zerbe, who was employed as a gasoline attendant. Byron was behind the wheel and Moyer was slumped in the front seat beside Byron so that he was unobserved. When Zerbe inquired of their needs, Moyer pushed open the car door, pointed his weapon at Zerbe and informed him it was a “hold-up”. Moyer got out of the car and put his loaded gun against Zerbe’s person and ordered him to advance toward the building. Byron remained in the car. At the time, Earl Shank, the owner of the station, was leaning in front of the doorway of thé building on the premises. He was not immediately observed by Moyer whose vision was obscured by a large Panama hat which he wore pulled down over his eyes.</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.8",223,[238,2090,1149,268]],["BL_224.1",224,[233,264,1152,1412]]]'>As Moyer was marching Zerbe toward the building, Zerbe moved sidewise to the left. Moyer then looked up and saw Shank. Moyer immediately fired at Shank but missed. Shank who had a .38_caliber revolver in his left pocket, which he obtained from Zerbe five minutes prior <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>to the perpetration of the robbery,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> fired at Moyer five times. Two of the shots hit Moyer, one in the shoulder and the other in the chest. Moyer then shot twice at Shank and retreated to the automobile. When he reached the car he shot again and about that time Byron shot. Moyer’s last shot was aimed at Shank but it was alleged by the Commonwealth that the bullet hit Zerbe, who'was then in the line of fire. Zerbe fell mortally wounded. Shank testified that while the exchange of shots took place, he “picked up a three-pound maul, and as I did a shot came in the doorway ... I dropped the maul and grabbed the telephone.” He was asked: “When you picked up the telephone had you seen Zerbe go down?” He replied: “No, sir.” He stated: “Before I completed the call, when I was telephoning the police, Mr. Zerbe was looking in the window at me when I started to make the telephone call to the police.” When he was asked what happened after he finished making his call, he answered: “I went to go out the door and Mr. Stauffer was standing in front of the door and he said: ‘. . . Are you hurt, are you hurt?’ I said to him: ‘No.’ ... I didn’t know he [Zerbe] was hit yet. Just then someone said there was a man shot.” I looked over to see who it was and telephoned to get the Milmont ambulance.” It was “Harvey Zerbe . . . lying on his back.” After the shooting, Byron and Moyer escaped in the stolen car.</p>
    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[232,1688,1149,525]]]'>Zerbe faced Shank throughout the shooting. Zerbe was shot in the back from the direction of Byron and Moyer. The bullet passed completely through his body. An eye-witness, Marion Stauffer, saw Moyer’s arm drop immediately after the shooting (as having just completed the shot) and saw Zerbe then fall to the ground. After Zerbe was shot, a bullet that was identified as having come from Moyer’s gun was found underneath Zerbe’s prostrate body. Shank did not shoot in Zerbe’s direction.</p>

      <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>In Moyer’s confession he said that when he was at the gasoline station and saw Zerbe approach the car, he [Moyer] said “Put your hands up; this is a hold-up.” This man “was sweeping up or doing something like that.” Moyer said he “pointed the gun at him” and told him he “wanted his money.” Byron was then at the wheel of the car. The man that came whom Moyer had addressed, replied “all right” and then Moyer marched him towards the building and he told him to get the money. Moyer said, “I was walking behind him with the gun on him . . . then the other fellow started to shoot.” By “the other fellow” he evidently meant Shank, who was “in the doorway.” He said he [Shank] shot twice and Hit him both times, once in the shoulder and in the chest. Zerbe, who had been ahead of Moyer, started to run toward the left hand corner of the building. Moyer then started shooting. He fired four times in rapid succession. He said he “was aiming at the fellow in the doorway.” He was askéd: “While you were firing what did you notice happen if anything?” “A. I saw the fellow that was hit falling. Q. That is the fellow that you had been marching along with the gun pointed at him? A. Yes.” Moyer was also asked: “Then what happened?” He answered: “I turned around, ran around, jumped up, got inside of the car, and we pulled away.” As he pulled away, he heard the man who had been shot and who was then lying on the ground “moaning.”</p>

After Zerbe was shot down and these two defendants escaped from the scene, a .32 caliber bullet was found beneath Zerbe’s body. The inference was legitimate that this was the bullet that passed through Zerbe’s body. M. E. Williams, special agent of the F. B. I., testified as follows: “Of the three weapons I examined, this bullet, State’s exhibit 9 [the .32 caliber, Boyal bullet found beneath Zerbe’s body] <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>could only have been fired in the automatic pistol, State’s exhibit 11 [Moyer’s gun].” Defense counsel asked: “Could you tell us whether or not the laboratory of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is equipped to test bullets that have gone through objects?” He answered: “Certainly.” “Q. Such as wood? A. Yes, sir. Q. And bodies? A. Yes, sir.” As we hereafter point out in this opinion, it is quite immaterial in the question of the guilt of these defendants whether or not the fatal bullet was fired by Moyer or by Zerbe’s employer in repelling Moyer’s murderous attack upon him and Zerbe in the attempted perpetration of a robbery.</p>
    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[228,930,1152,1192]]]'>Dr. John H. Turner testified for the Commonwealth that an examination of Zerbe’s body disclosed “a bullet wound on his back and penetrating through the abdomen on the left side; it went in on the right and came out on the left.” He was asked: “Will you tell us where the point of entrance was?” He answered: “The point of entrance was two inches to the right of the fourth lumbar vertebrae on the right side.” He distinguished the entrance “because of the dark area on the skin” which was “in the back on the posterior surface, and on the front there was none at all.” He also testified that the powder burns indicated that the victim was not at “close range” and that the revolver shot in relation to the object shot was “from a distance”. The witness further stated that a “reflected bullet” could not have caused the victim’s mortal injury. John Daniel Stauffer a resident near the gasoline station, testified that he had heard the exchange of shots and saw the deféndants’ car “coming out of the station”, it “was going very fast, as fast as it could go.” He went over as fast as he could and saw Zerbe “lying on his back.” He said Shank was still on the telephone when he got into the doorway.</p>

Such a rule is essential to the protection of human life.” In that case we held, as we had previously in <em>Commonwealth v. Lessner, </em><a href="/pa/274/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="274 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1072990" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0108-01">274 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.%2024" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="118 A. 24">118 A. 24</a>, that “when in the commission or attempted commission of a robbery there is ‘no break in the chain of events’ between the felony and the shooting which caused death, even though ‘the discharge [of the gun] was unintentionally caused [by the felon] while struggling with his victim, or with a third party who came to the latter’s assistance,’ the defense of accidental killing is inadmissible and the homicide is, under the statute, ‘murder of the first degree.’ ”</p>

It is equally consistent with reason and sound public policy to hold that when a felon’s attempt to commit robbery or burglary sets in motion a chain of events which were or should have been within his contemplation when the motion was initiated, he should be held responsible for any death which by direct and <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>almost inevitable sequence results from the initial criminal act. For any individual forcibly to defend himself or his family or his property from criminal aggression is a primal human instinct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is the right and duty of both individuals and nations to meet criminal aggression with effective countermeasures. Every robber or burglar knows when he attempts to commit his crime that he is inviting dangerous resistance. Any robber or burglar who carries deadly weapons (as most of them do and as these robbers did) thereby reveals that he expects to meet and overcome forcible opposition. What this court said in <em>Commonwealth v. LeGrand, </em><a href="/pa/336/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="336 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="1195614" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0511-01">336 Pa. 511</a>, 518, about burglars, applies equally to robbers: “Every burglar is a potential assassin and when his felonious purpose encounters human opposition his <em>intent to steal </em>becomes an <em>intent to Mil </em>and any weapon he finds at hand becomes a weapon of murder.” Every robber or burglar knows that a likely later act in the chain of events he inaugurates will be the use of deadly force against him on the part of the selected victim. For whatever results follow from that natural and legal use of retaliating force, the felon must be held responsible. For Earl Shank, the proprietor of a gas station in Ridley Township, Delaware County, which at 11 P. M. on July 13,1946, <em>was </em>being attacked by armed robbers, to return the fire of these robbers with a pistol which he had at hand was as proper and as inevitable as it was for the American forces at Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, to return the fire of the Japanese invaders. The Japanese felonious invasion of the Hawaiian Islands on that date was in law and morals the proximate cause of all the resultant fatalities. The Moyer-Byron felonious invasion of the Shank gas station on July 13,1946, was likewise the proximate cause of the resultant fatality.</p>

If, for example, a father sees his child being kidnapped and opens fire, as any normal father would be expected to do if he had a gun available, and if the bullet which he fires at the kidnapper inadvertently kills the child, the death of the child is properly attributable to the malicious act of the kidnapper. The principle which sustains this conclusion is expressed by Bishop on Criminal Law, 9th Ed., Vol. 2, section 637, page 480, as follows: “It is a rule both of reason and law that whenever one’s will contributes to impel a physical force, whether another’s, his own, or a combined force proceeding from whatever different sources, he is responsible for the result, the same as if his own unaided hand had produced it.

It was the causa causans which set in operation every agency that contributed to the destruction. It created the military necessity for the destruction of the military stores in the city hall, and made it the duty of the commanding officer of the Federal forces to destroy them. His act, therefore, in setting fire to the city hall, was directly in the line of the force set in motion by the usurping power, and what that power must have anticipated as a consequence of its action. ... It was one of a continuous chain of events brought into being by the usurped military power, —events so linked together as to form one continuous whole.” The court held that the loss by the fire which destroyed plaintiff’s property was excepted from the risk undertaken by the insurers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In that case, there Avas instituted an action of trespass for tossing a lighted squib against the infant plaintiff and striking him on the face and so burning one of his eyes that he lost the sight of it. The facts were that on the 28th of October 1770, defendant threw a lighted squib made of gunpowder from the street into the market house. A large concourse of people Avere assembled there. One Willis to prevent injury to himself and to the goods of one Yates, grasped the lighted squib and threw it across the market house where it <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>fell upon one Ryal. Tlie latter, to save his own goods from being injured, took up the lighted squib and threw it to another part of the market house and struck the plaintiff in the face, putting out one of his eyes. In that case, Justice Gould said, “. . . the defendant may be considered in the same view as if he himself had personally thrown the squib in the plaintiff’s face. The terror impressed upon Willis and Ryal excited self-defense, and deprived them of the power of recollection. What they did therefore was the inevitable consequence of the defendant’s unlawful act.” Chief Justice DeGrey said, “The throwing the squib was an act unlawful and tending to affright the bystanders. So far, mischief was originally intended; not any particular mischief, but mischief indiscriminate and wanton. Whatever mischief therefore follows, he is the author of <em>it; </em>— Egrediturper<em>sonam, </em>as the phrase is in criminal cases. And though criminal eases are no rule for civil ones, yet in trespass I think there is an analogy. Every one who does an unlawful act is considered as the doer of all that follows; if done with a deliberate intent, the consequence may amount to murder . . .” The court held that an action of trespass was maintainable against the defendant Shepherd whose unlawful act started the squib on its journey through two other hands to the eyes of the plaintiff.</p>
