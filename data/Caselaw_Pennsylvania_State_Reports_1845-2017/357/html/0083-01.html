Plaintiff sought to restrain the defendants from conducting the business of a funeral home, an undertaking establishment, upon defendants’ premises at 984 Centre Avenue, Reading. Plaintiffs own and reside in private dwellings in the vicinity of the proposed funeral home and they aver that the district is exclusively residential and the operation of a funeral home will constitute a nuisance. The defendants filed an answer denying that the section is exclusively residential and denying that the operation of a funeral home would be a nuisance. A trial was had on Bill and Answer before Chancellor Mays. He made certain findings of fact. Among the findings are these: The defendant proposes to have his home on the second and third floors of the building and the funeral home will be on the first floor. He proposes to employ a competent landscape architect to arrange proper plantings on the grounds. Defendant does not propose to floodlight the premises. The distance from the curb of the premises at 934 Centre Avenue (this being the number of the proposed funeral home) to the building is 67 feet. The defendant conducts an average of 102 funerals per year, 15 per cent of which are held at private residences. Centre Avenue is a busy and much traveled highway. For example, on October 17, 1945, from 8:00 A. M. to 12:20 P. M., and from 1:20 P. M. to 5:00 P. M., 1452 pleasure cars, 470 trucks, 15 buses and 91 trolley cars traversed Centre Avenue. There was equally heavy traffic on other days. Noises caused by the coming and going of pleasure cars, buses, trolleys, coal and other trucks in the neighborhood were almost continuous throughout the day and night and funeral processions on Centre Avenue were almost a daily occurrence. An average of 690 funeral processions traversed Centre Avenue annually. Funerals are frequently held at St. Margaret’s Roman Catholic Church, which is a <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>relatively short distance from one of the plaintiff’s residence. The southern boundary of the Charles Evans Cemetery is approximately 150 feet away from it. The twenty-fifth finding is that “The said Charles Evans Cemetery occupies 120 acres, contains approximately 53,400 graves, and has a crematory building and a columbarium within a few blocks of the plaintiffs’ residences.” The Chancellor found as a fact that the presence of a funeral home will not depreciate the value, of property in its immediate vicinity and that other residents in the immediate neighborhood favor the establishment of the funeral home at 934 Centre Avenue.</p>

(4) An injunction should not issue, but the bill should be held pending the defendants’ placing upon the record an agreement that the sign shall not be erected upon the lawn but upon the building itself, and. that the use of the entrance to the driveway at Centre Avenue shall be merely for their private purposes and not for the moving of funeral cars into or from Centre Avenue over and across the said driveway.”</blockquote>

By what appears to be the weight of modern authority, however, it is held that the location of such a business in a residential district is sufficiently objectionable to make it a nuisance.

It is true that the objection to the business must be something more than imaginary, or an individual aversion to the proximity of the establishment and to the thought of death superinduced by its nearness and the activities carried on in connection with it. The annoyance complained of must be something real, substantial and tangible — one that affects the normal person, not the overnervous or supersensitive, nor yet the hardened and stoical, but the ordinary man, with ordinary sensibilities, tastes and feelings. The maintenance of an undertaking establishment under circumstances that produce such a result upon such a person goes beyond mere mental disturbance — it involves the physical enjoyment and comfort of the home, with which no business, however lawful and necessary, has the right to interfere.”</p>
