They defended on adverse possession. At the trial it was held that they had not overcome the presumption that George, the grantor, had remained in possession on behalf of the grantee, Zachariah, and that the defense of adverse possession by defendants claiming as heirs of George, was not made out. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff, Mrs. McMinn: see <em>McMinn v. Cummings, </em><a href="/pa-super/56/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="56 Pa.

They defaulted and the mortgage was foreclosed by sheriff’s sale August 13, 1943, to Giovini Greumelli, now a defendant, who took title from the sheriff by deed duly recorded. Later in August, 1943, the defendant, Greumelli, mortgaged the farm to Solomon and Mary Kachel, also defendants, to secure a loan of $2,600.</p>

    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[258,835,1147,1066]]]'>The learned court from which the appeal comes, refused plaintiffs’ prayer for relief, stating that as “The Eden property is not specifically mentioned in the will and is not included among the assets of the estate of Zachariah Oatman, deceased” at the time his estate was settled in the Orphans’ Court, decedent died intestate as to the Eden farm. The learned judge also said: “The conclusion that Zachariah Oatman died intestate as to the Eden property is justified under the will and the unusual circumstances of this ease. If so, then the Eden property descended to Elizabeth McMinn as the only child and heir of Zachariah Oatman, deceased.” It is of course true that if she took under the intestate law, instead of by her father’s will, her title in fee passed by the foreclosure sale to defendant, Greumelli, and plaintiffs would have no right to a-decree. The learned court was also of opinion that “the circumstances indicated a lack of diligence” on the part of plaintiffs in proceeding against the defendants and for that reason relief must be denied.</p>

But testator owned only two farms, the Eden and the Home farm, and dealt with both of them in his will. The comprehensive phraseology “and all other Beal Estate I may have at the time of my death” can refer to nothing except the Eden farm because, in the same sentence, he also deals with the “farm I now live on,” the Home farm. While he directed a conversion for purposes of distribution, the Eden farm was not sold. He specified his daughter’s interest by repeating that “The estate, which I leave, to be considered as being in Trust for my said daughter, Elizabeth McMinn, during her lifetime.” The judgment in the ejectment action against defendants who were keeping her out of possession, did not increase her estate; it entitled her to possession only of what she received by the will of her father. The rights of her children have not been lost by the executor’s failure to bring the Eden farm into the administration. Although their interests were vested, they were not entitled to possession until their mother’s death which occurred October, 1943. At that time the defendant, Giovini Greumelli, had taken title from the sheriff and the defendants Kachel had received their mortgage. The record was notice to the defendants; the life tenant’s children did nothing to mislead defendants; there was no lack of diligence on the part of the children. The executor’s failure to comply with the testamentary direction to sell the Eden farm and invest the proceeds in the Home farm did not take from the beneficiaries what the testator gave them.</p>
