In dealing with their contract it is necessary to see what intention the parties have expressed. The words of the option show that both parties intended that appellant’s offer to sell the mine must be accepted by defendant during the term of. the lease. The optionee is described as the “lessee” which implies an existing lease; the amount payable on the exercise of the option is specified by reference to royalty payable on the remaining tonnage as of that time, and in that connection, reference is also made to the <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>annual minimum tonnage to be mined, elements which show the parties had in mind an existing tenancy. The requirement that the lessee must pay “to the Lessor a sum equivalent to the then present worth of the rent and royalty which would have become payable ... if the remaining recoverable tonnage had been mined and removed at the average annual rate at which coal has been mined and removed prior thereto . ., .” is an express stipulation by the parties that the option must be exercised while the lease was in effect, otherwise,- it would have no meaning.</p>

When this was done the parties agreed “that if defendant thereafter exercised the option to purchase the remaining acreage of recoverable coal, granted to it under the lease, the purchase price thereof should be reduced by, and defendant credited with, the sum of $69,000, the amount of the purchase price for the surface tracts and houses . . . otherwise, the said lease and escrow agreement should remain in full force and effect.” At that time, it may be noted, plaintiff apparently had no thought of suggesting that its option to defendant was void for any reason.</p>

The question is whether, in the words of the Arbitration Act, there was “a controversy thereafter arising out of said contract or refusal to perform any part thereof”? “Thereafter arising,” in the context, means arising after defendant notified plaintiff that it exercised the option to buy the mine. What were the facts at that time? Defendant was mining coal and paying royalty to the plaintiff pursuant to the contract; there was no controversy about those two facts. The next fact to be noted is that defendant gave notice that it exercised the option by accepting plaintiff’s offer to sell the unmined coal at the specified price. The acceptance of the offer required the plaintiff to convey. All that remained open was to measure the amount of the coal remaining to be mined. There was no controversy about plaintiff’s obligation to convey, laying aside for the moment, its claim that the option was void, an objection not suggested by plaintiff in 1945 when it conveyed to defendant for $69,000 the surface rights to certain tracts of land in which defendant was mining coal. Plaintiff’s denial of the validity of the option did not present a controversy within the terms of section X; the validity of the option is not within the terms of section X. The only undetermined element in the transaction was the quantity of coal and there was no dispute about that quantity and there could be none because the parties had long before provided that the quantity of coal to be paid for was to be deter<a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>mined by Eavenson.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> There was no controversy, within the meaning of the word as used in the Arbitration Act, to be settled by an arbitrator.
