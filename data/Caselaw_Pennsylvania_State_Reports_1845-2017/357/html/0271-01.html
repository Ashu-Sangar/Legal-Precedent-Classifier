This is also the “main headquarters” (as he describes it) of nine stores he maintains at other places. In April 1927 he leased the basement storeroom at 62% South Main St. from the agent of Jennie Weitzenkorn.

In 1941 he leased the front half of the second floor of the “Schneider property” at 60 South Main St. In February 1944 he purchased this No. 60 property.

Since that time he has been using part of the second floor of <em>60 </em>South Main St. for “storage” of goods taken from No. <em>62. </em>He testified that “the maximum percentage” of merchandise which he stores at 60 South Main St. is about “10 percent” and “the minimum about <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>3, 4, or 5 percent.” Raub testified that he receives merchandise into his stores at 62-62%-64 South Main St. “anywhere from once or twice and sometimes ten times a day” by means of trucks which come up the alley and deliver merchandise in cartons at the rear of 62 South Main St. and which reach his unloading platform<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> at No. 62 by coming “in over the driveway alongside Mr. Brown’s market.” He testified that he takes in “about ninety to ninety-five percent of” his merchandise “in the back way”, and “eighty percent” of these goods are “distributed to his nine other stores.”</p>

He complained to Raub “several times” about Raub’s “unloading cartons and blocking us up.” He said he told Raub: “You sneaked in there and put the opening there Avithout any right to do it” and Raub said, “I will fix it.” Mr. Brown added: “I called him [Raub] three times after that, and he didn’t answer that, so the next time I called him, I said, I am through Avith you, and I am going to take you to Court.”</p>

Mr. Brown put up the barrier permanently in 1938 after Landau went out of the building. This barrier did not affect the premises at 62; it only prevented delivery of goods through the door at No. 60, No. 60 being athwart the alley.

The court below made the following statement: “If the defendant, after having transported goods through the alley and unloaded them into No. 62 South Main Street, should, through an interior passageway or hall, remove them into a building located a half block distant, instead of to the adjoining premises, as is here done, could such conduct be restrained upon the contention that the building to which the goods were ultimately removed and stored was improperly made or treated by the defendant as appurtenant to the alley? We think not.”</p>

If, for example, the defendant Raub would convert his huge building at No. 60 South Main St. into a warehouse and, if he brought large quantities of goods up the alley and unloaded them at No. 62, and then stored them in the warehouse at No. 60, he would be unduly enlarging his rights in the alley as a tenant of No. 62. The court below in support of its position, cites the case of <em>Benner v. </em>Junker, <a href="/pa/190/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="190 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="905122" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0423-01">190 Pa. 423</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.%2072" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="43 A. 72">43 A. 72</a>. That case is distinguishable from the case at bar. In that case plaintiff and defendant OAvned properties on Locust St., Philadelphia. When the houses were built an alley three feet wide was <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>left open between them. The division line ran in the center of the alley. The defendant’s father converted his house into a bakery and shop for the sale of bread. Later the defendant bought a property in the rear of his Locust St. property and bread baked in that property was carried across into the Locust St. property ‘Where it is assorted, placed in baskets and carried out through the alley, and then loaded in the delivery wagons.” This court held that while “one occupant could not by the use of the alley so obstruct it as to prevent its reasonable use in view of the original purpose by the adjoining occupant” that this use by the defendant of the three-foot alley to convey bread to the delivery Avagons after the bread had been assorted and packed in property No. 1 was not surcharging the alley. In other words, property No. 1 was not used as a mere conduit for bread from property No. 2 but something essential to the retail sale and distribution of the bread was done on property No. 1. That was a “close case” and since the alley in controversy was only three feet Avide, there was no inconvenience caused the plaintiff by reason of any vehicular traffic on that alley. In the instant case, the defendant used the alley for large delivery trucks. As the tenant at 62, he has the right to use the alley with trucks but he does not have the right to use the alley for trucks <em>whose cargo is destined for No. 60; </em>and in no case can the defendant use the alley to such an extent as to prevent its like convenient use by others who also have an easement therein. The law is settled that those who have the same rights over an easement must exercise those rights fairly and reasonably so as not to interfere Avith the fair and reasonable exercise of the same rights by others who possess them.</p>

Where a way is appurtenant to an estate it may be used by those who own or lawfully occupy any part thereof, and by all persons lawfully going to or from such premises, whether they are mentioned in the grant or not.” (citing numerous cases) : 19 C. J. 977, section 224. In <em>Com. v.

In other words, an easement appurtenant to a dominant tenement can be used only for the purposes of that tenement ; it is not a personal right, and cannot be used, even by the dominant owner, for any purpose unconnected with the enjoyment of his estate. The purpose of this rule is to prevent an increase of the burden upon the servient estate, and it applies whether the easement is created by grant, reservation, prescription, or implication.” (Citing numerous cases) : 9 R. C. L. 786, section 43. “The use of an easement must be confined strictly to the purposes for which it was granted or reserved”: 9 R. C. L. 787, section 44. “The right of the easement owner [or easement owners] and the right of the landowner are not absolute, irrelative, and uncontrolled, but are so limited, <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>each by the other, that there may be due a reasonable enjoyment of both . . . nothing passes as an incident to the grant of an easement except what is requisite to its fair enjoyment ... if an easement is used for any purpose inconsistent with that for which it was granted, the grantee becomes a trespasser to the extent of the unauthorized use. No definite rule can be stated as to what may be considered a proper and reasonable use as distinguished from an unreasonable and improper use. The question is usually left to the jury or the trial court as one of fact.”: 17 Am. Jur. 993, 994, 995, section 96. In <em>Ellis v. The Academy of Music, </em><a href="/pa/120/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="120 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="559863" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0608-01">120 Pa. 608</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20A.%20494" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="15 A. 494">15 A. 494</a>, this court, is an opinon by Chief Justice Gordon, said in respect to a controversy as to the use of an easement: “no man may trespass upon another’s right however insignificant that right may be. . . . The right . . . was common to both parties, so that neither, without the assent of the other, had the right to alter the character of the alley in any particular.” The court held when by several grants to the parties, their properties are bounded by a private alley in controversy and the same use of the alley is made appurtenant to each property, neither party has the right to alter the character of the alley in any particular without the assent of the other.</p>
