The learned auditing judge, agreeing with appellants’ contention, eliminated Sloan from participation.

Section 1 of that statute provides: “. . . illegitimate children shall take and be known by the name of their mother, and the common-law doctrine of <em>nullius films </em>shall not apply as between the mother and her illegitimate child or children. But the mother and her heirs, and her illegitimate child and its heirs, shall be mutually liable one to the other, and shall enjoy all the rights and privileges one to the other, in the same manner and to the same extent, as if the said child or children had been born in lawful wedlock.” In speaking of this statute, this Court said, in <em>Patterson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/282/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="282 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1088403" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0396-01">282 Pa. 396</a>, 402, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.%20100" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="128 A. 100">128 A. 100</a>: “. . . the Act of 1901 undertook to place illegitimate children of a deceased testatrix in the category of legitimates.” We also said, in <em>Commonwealth v.

Testatrix provided: “Upon his [William McDaniels’] death, I order and direct that the principal of this Trust Fund, as well as any unpaid accumulations of income shall be paid to his <em>issue, </em>absolutely . . .” (Italics added). “A bequest to a number of persons not named, but answering a general description, is a gift to them as a class, where a contrary intention does not appear from the will”: <em>Wood’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/321/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="321 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1165833" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0497-01">321 Pa. 497</a>, 500, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%2013" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="184 A. 13">184 A. 13</a>. No such contrary intent here appearing, appellee clearly falls within the class of “issue” set forth in the will, in that he was the natural issue of the life tenant, and either avus born in laAvful Avedlock or was legitimated by <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>the Act of 1901, supra. In <em>Russell's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/284/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="284 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1092069" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0164-01">284 Pa. 164</a>, 166, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.%20319" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="130 A. 319">130 A. 319</a>, this Court, in interpreting the word “issue” as contained in Section 15 of the Wills Act of 1917, not here involved, held that an adopted child is “an ‘issue’ of his <em>natural </em>parents only.” Therefore, appellee takes by virtue of the testamentary designation of a class to which he belongs, notwithstanding his adoption, and does not take by right of inheritance. We think the following statement in the opinion of President Judge Van Dusen, for the court en banc, is conclusive: “Neither Section 16 (b) of the Intestate Act of 1917 nor the Act of April 13,1887, P. L. 53, Sec. 1 . . . attempts to do more than to regulate the right of inheritance. As said in Anderson’s Estate, 23 D. &amp; C. 332, the question is one of identity and not of the right of inheritance. The claimant is still the legitimated child of Rachel, and his status as such is not changed by the adoption. The limited effect of the statutes relating to adoption brings out by contrast the wider effect which we think should be given to section one of the Act of 1901. Of course the testatrix had the right to make her bequest to claimant either by name or class description, so the real question is whether he comes within the description of ‘issue’. Physically he is certainly within the description and legally he has been made so by Section 1 of the Act of 1901 so far as the mother’s family is concerned. Patterson’s Estate, <a href="/pa/282/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="282 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1088403" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0396-01">282 Pa. 396</a>, is an analogous case. There it was held that since the Act of 1901 an illegitimate child was to be regarded as an afterborn child under Section 21 of the Wills Act, even though before 1901 it had been held that in absence of some qualifying expression the word ‘child’ in legislative enactments, <em>as in legal </em>parlance, means only and exclusively a legitimate child (citing Overseers v. Overseers, <a href="/pa/176/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="176 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="882196" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0116-01">176 Pa. 116</a>, 121). It remains but to be said that in absence of statute directing a different construction, the fact of adoption does not change the claimant’s description as issue of William McDaniels whether being construed as made <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>before or after the adoption. We are fortified in this conclusion by the fact that Section 16 (b) of the Intestate Act of 1917 expressly provided that an adopted person was not to be entitled to take from or through his natural relatives, whereas Section 16 (b) of the Wills Act of 1917 makes no such exclusionary provision.”</p>
