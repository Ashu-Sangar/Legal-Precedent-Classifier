Giving effect to them renders inescapable the conclusion that his intention was to create a trust during the lifetime of the widow or until her remarriage and to give his entire residuary estate to his daughter. Had testator intended to create an active trust to be measured by the life of the daughter, he would have evidenced such intention by the use of the words “for life”, rather than by words of inheritance.
