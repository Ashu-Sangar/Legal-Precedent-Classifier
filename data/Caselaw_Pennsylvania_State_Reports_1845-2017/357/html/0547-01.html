It was described by metes and bounds, as fronting 60 feet on the western side of South Main Street and extending westward of that width 240 feet. It was bounded by property of a railroad company on the south, several other named properties on the north and in the rear by a named property. On the front along South Main Street there was erected a three story brick hotel building, with additions, extending west 130.2 feet from the property line on the street. The premises were not enclosed by a fence or other structure.</p>

There was a gate in the fence opening to the property of the railroad company on the south. The property of the railroad, the south boundary of the land, was a 25 foot wide brick paved driveway.</p>

Paul M. Wiley, the defendant, filed his answer claiming ownership of the premises under the clause in the will now in question. Mr. Wiley died, testate, in 1946.
