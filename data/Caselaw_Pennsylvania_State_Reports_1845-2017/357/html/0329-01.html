The plan must set forth the boundaries of the area, information concerning its buildings and population, a statement of the existing uses of the real property therein, a statement of the proposed uses following redevelopment, a statement of the proposed changes in zoning <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>ordinances and street layouts, an estimate of the cost of acquisition of the area and other costs necessary to prepare it for redevelopment, and a statement of such continuing controls as may be deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act. Thereupon the Authority prepares a “redevelopment proposal” for the redevelopment of all or part of such area, including the proposed redevelopment contract and the selection of the redeveloper, and submits this proposal to the planning commission for review. The proposal, together with the planning commission’s recommendations thereon, are then certified to the governing body, which, after a public hearing, approves or rejects the proposal and the redevelopment contract; in the event of the proposal being approved the Authority is empowered to execute the contract and to take such action as may be necessary to carry it out. The contract provides for the amount of the consideration to be paid by the redeveloper to the Authority and for the necessary continuing controls. Any deed or lease to a redeveloper in furtherance of the contract must contain such provisions as the Authority may deem desirable to run with the land in order to effectuate the purposes of the act. The Authority is granted the right of eminent domain and title to any property thus acquired shall be an absolute or fee simple title unless a lesser title shall, be designated in the eminent domain proceedings. The Authority may issue bonds for any of its corporate purposes, the principal and interest of which are payable from its revenues generally; such bonds may be secured by a pledge of any of its revenues or by a mortgage of any of its property; the bonds and the income therefrom shall at all times be free from taxation for State or local purposes.

      <em>Dornan v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, </em><a href="/pa/331/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="331 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1184280" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0209-01">331 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%20834" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="200 A. 834">200 A. 834</a>, may be regarded as the prototype of the present case since all the arguments now presented on this subject were there fully considered. The Urban Redevelopment Law closely parallels the provisions of the “Housing Authorities Law” of May 28, 1937, P. L. 955, with which the <em>Dornan </em>case was concerned. The fundamental purpose of both these acts was the same, namely, the clearance of slum areas, although the Housing Authorities Law aimed more particularly at the elimination of undesirable dwelling houses whereas the Urban Redevelopment Law is not so restricted. But the Housing Authorities Law had an important additional objective in that, as ancillary to the slum clearances, there were to be provided “decent, safe, and sanitary urban or rural dwellings, apartments or other living accommodations for persons of low income”; these were to be constructed and acquired by the Housing Authorities and leased out by them to the class of tenants for whose use such accommodations were designed. In the case of the Urban Redevelopment Law the operation of clearing and rehabilitating the “slums”, now called “blighted areas”, is not to be followed by a continuing ownership of properties by the Redevelopment Authorities for any such further and ulterior social-welfare purpose as that of providing low rental homes for persons in moderate circumstances. In this additional feature of the Housing Authorities Law there was implicit the modern recognition of an enlarged social function of government which called for an advance over previous legal conceptions of what constitutes a public use justifying the exercise of the power of eminent domain, but this court sustained the constitutionality of that act, and the courts of numerous other States have, without exception, upheld similar legislation. In the case of the Urban Redevelopment Law, therefore, the <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>justification of the grant of the power of eminent domain is even clearer than in the case of the Housing Authorities Law, there being in the present act only the one major purpose of the elimination and rehabilitation of the blighted sections of our municipalities, and that purpose certainly falls within <em>any </em>conception of “public use” for nothing can be more beneficial to the community as a whole than the clearance and reconstruction of those sub-standard areas which are characterized by the evils described in the Urban Redevelopment Law. It has long been clear that those evils cannot be eradicated merely by such measures, however admirable in themselves, as tenement-house laws, zoning laws and building codes and regulations; these deal only with future construction, not with presently existing conditions. Nor, as experience has shown, is private enterprise adequate for the purpose. The legislature has therefore concluded — and the wisdom of its conclusion is for it alone — that public aid must accompany private initiative if the desired results are to be obtained. The great cities of Europe have been improved and largely rebuilt through the expenditure of public moneys by the edicts of monarchs and dictators; if the governing bodies in our own democratic Commonwealth are to be held unable, under our constitution, to plan and support such reconstruction projects, our cities must continue to be marred by areas which are focal centers of disease, constitute pernicious environments for the young, and, while contributing little to the tax income of the municipality, consume an excessive proportion of its revenues because of the extra services required for police, fire and other forms of protection.</p>

Nothing, of course, is better settled than that property cannot be taken by government without the owner’s consent for the mere purpose of devoting it to the private use- of another, even though there be involved in the transaction an incidental benefit to the public. But plaintiff misconceives the nature and extent of the public purpose which is the object of this legislation. That purpose, as before pointed out, is not one requiring a continuing ownership of the property as it is in the case of the Housing Authorities Law in order to carry out the full purpose of that act, but is directed solely to the clearance, reconstruction and rehabilitation of the blighted area, and after that is accomplished the public purpose is-completely realized. When, therefore, the need for public ownership has terminated, it is proper that the land be re-transferred to private ownership, subject only to such restrictions and controls as. are necessary to effectuate the purposes of the act. It is not the object of the statute to transfer property from one individual to another; such transfers, so far as they may -actually occur, are purely incidental to the accomplishment of the real or fundamental purpose. However, it is of passing interest to note that there are some cases in which the constitutionality of statutes was sustained the very object of which was to effect such transfers of ownership. Thus in <em>State of Washington v. Clausen, </em><a href="/wash/110/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="110 Wash. 525" data-case-ids="688205" data-case-paths="/wash/110/0525-01">110 Wash. 525</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20P.%20538" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="188 P. 538">188 P. 538</a>, it was held to be a valid public purpose for the State to purchase and improve tracts of undeveloped agricultural lands and subdivide and dispose of them to individual farmers and settlers. And in <em>People of Puerto Rico v. Eastern Sugar Associates, </em><a href="/f2d/156/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="156 F.2d 316" data-case-ids="1135052" data-case-paths="/f2d/156/0316-01">156 F. 2d 316</a> (cert. den. <a href="/citations/?q=67%20S.%20Ct.%20190" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="67 S.

Indeed, so far from it being legally objectionable that property acquired by eminent domain be resold or retransferred to private individuals after the purpose of the taking is accomplished, the laiv actually requires that property be taken by eminent domain ■ only to the extent reasonably required for the purpose for which the poAver is exercised <em>(Bachner v.

Nor does the taking lose its public character merely because there may exist in the operation some feature of private gain, for if the public good is enhanced it is immaterial that a private' interest also may be benefited.</p>

One of these assaults is directed against an alleged delegation of <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>legislative powers contrary to the provision of Article II, section 1 of the Constitution, it being claimed that insufficient standards are set up in the statute to guide the Authority in exercising the powers with which it is vested. The fact is, however, that the act contains as definite a description of what constitutes a blighted area as it is reasonably possible to express; in regard to such factors as the selection and the size of the areas to be redeveloped, the costs involved, and the exact form which the redevelopment in any particular case is to take, it was obviously impossible for the legislature to make detailed provisions or blueprints in advance for each operation. It is to be borne in mind that all the powers given to the Authority in regard to the making of the redevelopment proposal, including the redevelopment contract and the selection of the redeveloper, are subject to the approval of the city council or the county commissioners, and only after all the details of the particular project are formulated is the ultimate decision made by those governing bodies as to whether the proposed redevelopment is to be carried into effect. The planning necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act must necessarily vary from place to place within the same city or county and from city to city and county to county. All that the legislature could do, therefore, was to prescribe general rules and reasonably definite standards, leaving to the local authorities the preparation of the plans and specifications best adapted to accomplish in each instance the desired result, a function which obviously can be performed only by administrative bodies. While the legislature cannot delegate the power to make a law, it may, where necessary, confer authority and discretion in connection with the execution of the law; it may establish primary standards and impose upon others the duty to carry out the declared legislative policy in accordance with the general provisions of the act.
