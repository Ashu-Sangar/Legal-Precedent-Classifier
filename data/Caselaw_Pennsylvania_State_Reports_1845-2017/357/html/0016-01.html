The next morning Bay repented of his bargain and tried to induce plaintiffs to relinquish it but they refused to do so. On April 5 they demanded of him a deed, but then, for the first time, he told them that on December 1, 1944, he had sold part of the farm for $200 to his brother Albert Swope (later joined as a defendant in this action and hereinafter referred to as Albert) consisting of a tract of some 7 or 8 acres fronting on the State highway, and he notified them that he Avould not give them a deed of the farm unless this portion was excepted. The following day, April 6, he executed and delivered to Albert a deed cov<a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>ering this tract as well as a plot of approximately 2 or 3 acres known as the “school house lot” which he had allegedly agreed to sell to Albert for $200 some eight years before. On that same day, April 6, plaintiffs filed the present bill in equity. On April 10 Bay tendered them a deed of the farm which excepted the two portions conveyed to Albert, but plaintiffs refused to accept it. A hearing was had in the equity proceedings and the court entered a decree ordering Bay to execute and deliver to plaintiffs, upon payment of the balance of the purchase money, a deed for the farm as described in the bill (which copied the deed under which Bay had acquired it), but excepting thereout a small plot which had been conveyed by him some years before to the Sinclair Befining Company together with two rights of way for the company’s pipe lines, and also excepting the school house lot sold to Albert. The decree further provided that Albert should execute and deliver to plaintiffs a quit-claim deed for the land conveyed to him on April 6 other than the school house lot. Defendants appeal.</p>

This contention cannot be sustained. It is true, of course, that a contract for the sale of land is unenforceable if the property is not designated with sufficient definiteness to determine what is intended to be conveyed, nor can <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>parol evidence be accepted to overcome the failure of the writing to locate the subject of the sale. But the ancient maxim still prevails: Certum est quod certum reddi potest, and, as was said in <em>Peart v. Brice, </em><a href="/pa/152/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="152 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="838115" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0277-01">152 Pa. 277</a>, 279, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.%20537" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="25 A. 537">25 A. 537</a>, “parol evidence to describe the land intended to be sold is one thing, and parol evidence to apply a written description to land is another and very different thing, and for that purpose is admissible.” The designation “my farm”, under the circumstances of the present case, is clearly sufficient to satisfy the statute. Bay owned only one farm and the parties well knew that what was intended by “my farm” was the farm next to which plaintiffs had lived for many years and for the purchase of which they had long been in negotiation with him; if there was anything to be excepted out of it and if Ray wished to limit the generality or the term he employed it was incumbent upon him to do so expressly and not to rely upon any secret design or intention of his own. The identity of the property is certain and all that is necessary is to refer to the deed by which Ray acquired title in order, purely for conveyancing purposes, to ascertain the metes and bounds.</p>

But in the present instance this principle gives way to an overriding one which becomes applicable by reason of the fact, as the learned chancellor found, that at the time when the receipt was executed by Ray and the $50 paid to him on account Albert was present, saw and understood exactly what was being done, and said not a word about his having purchased the portion of the farm along the State highway. Although he knew of plaintiffs’ negotiations for the purchase, and although he told them, of his rights in regard to the school house lot, he never said anything to them concerning his alleged purchase of the other part of the farm; his first disclosure in that regard was on April 5 when plaintiffs demanded a deed from Ray. Where the circumstances are such as to raise a duty to speak, the failure to do so may weli amount to fraud. “There is no principle better settled, nor one founded on more solid considerations of equity and public utility, than that which declares that if one knowingly, though he does it passively by looking on, suffers another to purchase and spend money on land, under an erroneous opinion of title, without making known his claim, he shall not afterwards be permitted to exercise his legal right against such person”: <em>Carr v.
