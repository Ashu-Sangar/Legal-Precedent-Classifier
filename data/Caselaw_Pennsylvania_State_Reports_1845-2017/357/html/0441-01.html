The libellant was then a minister of the Evangelical denomination and was, or soon thereafter became, pastor of the Calvary Evangelical Church; the parties lived in the parsonage supplied by the congregation of that church at 574 W. Dauphin Street, Philadelphia. On or about May 5, 1944, they separated and respondent went to ■ the home of her parents in Bangor, Northampton County, where she has since resided.

Libellant was then about 43 years of age and respondent about 42. There was personal service of the subpoena and libel on December 9, 1944, together with a rule to appear and answer on the first Monday of January, 1945. Vincent P. McDevitt, a lawyer of wide experience, was appointed master. Respondent ■ admitted receiving notice from him on or about February 27, 1945, fixing a time, March 20, 1945, and place for hearing, but she did not appear. The hearing Avas duly held and the libellant and three witnesses testified. The master filed a report on May 1, 1945, recommending a decree. The report was approved by the court and on May 15, 1945, a final rule issued, returnable May 28th, directing respondent to show cause why a decree of divorce a. v. m. should not be granted. This rule was served on the re<a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>spondent in her home in Bangor. Thereafter, on June 4, 1945, counsel for respondent filed an appearance on her behalf. She also filed an answer to the libel and petitioned the court to vacate the rule for final decree and to refer the proceeding back to the master to take testimony in defense. The court granted that petition. At this supplementary hearing, Judge Milner sat with the master and participated in the hearing. The respondent and witnesses on her behalf were examined and cross-examined, and the libellant was cross-examined by respondent’s counsel. The master then filed a supplementary report in which he concluded that the respondent had produced no defense to the case made out by the libellant and again recommended that the decree prayed for be granted. The respondent filed exceptions to the master’s reports. Argument on these exceptions was heard by the three judges of the common pleas who dismissed the exceptions in an opinion written by Judge Milner. A final decree followed in due course.</p>

The answer to that question must be found by applying to the record the cold tests of common experience and not by emotional approach.

Respondent obtained a reopening of the case and the supplementary hearing on an averment, inter alia, that at the time she was served with process and when she received the master’s notice she was too ill <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>to <em>attend to the </em>defense of the suit. But her own evidence shows that statement was not true; she misrepresented a material fact and that misrepresentation casts suspicion and doubt on her testimony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> At that time she was engaged in teaching<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> a public school near Bangor in. Northampton County. After the separation she had been ill for some time during the summer of 1944, but she recovered sufficiently to begin teaching with the opening of the fall school term and to continue teaching right along except for holiday vacations and short absences not material on the point now being-considered. Respondent’s father, who was called as a witness on her behalf, participated in the same misrepresentation of fact. He said, when process was first served, he considered with respondent, what should be done about defending the suit and consulted counsel but nothing came of it. After some uncertainty in his evidence concerning respondent’s failure to appear at the hearing in March, the master asked him, “Well, why didn’t you communicate with me that fact, in response to my letter?” His answer was not helpful; he replied, “Well, it looks very much to me as if we had the wrong lawyer.” He testified that respondent “was teaching school in February and in March” when the master’s hearing was held.</p>

In 1939 respondent moved libellant’s bed and belongings from the second floor to the third floor bedroom which he occupied until the separation in 1944. He made his own bed and cleaned his own room. In 1940 Libellant found glass in stewed rhubarb served to him and thereafter “the Libellant ate no meals at the family table for fear that she would threaten his life as he felt she did at that time.” In the same year she declined to do his laundry and “told him to get it done elsewhere, which he did.” “The Respondent on various occasions told the Libellant she hated him and would have nothing to do with him.” The master referred to other matters and noted that in some respects the libellant was corroborated. Mrs. Seney, described as a friend of both parties and a member of libellant’s church, testified. Her evidence shows that apparently after the friction between the parties had become acute, the witness, while in the parsonage, was treated very impolitely by the respondent. She testified that during church services the respondent talked and laughed “loud enough for people around to hear”; <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>respondent was in the habit of ¡doing that and did it while her husband was preaching and during prayer services especially. She specified an occasion on which “the District Superintendent was there and she kept that up until he stopped and glared at her until she stopped talking, and then he continued.” Her testimony also shows that the strained relations existing between the pastor and his wife were common knowledge among the members of the congregation and led to his not being reappointed minister of the Calvary congregation. Another member of the congregation, Mrs. Fry, testified to respondent’s frequent misbehavior during prayer meeting. “Q. What did she do in prayer meeting? A. In prayer meeting, when he would have the prayer, she would make faces. Q. And that would get people laughing, I suppose? A. Yes, and then he would stop the service and look down at her and she would stop for a minute and then start all over, she would cough and do whatever she could to annoy him. And I have seen her stick her finger up to her nose at him as she was walking out.” Another witness, Mrs. Heller, testified that she had. seen respondent “make faces at the” libellant during prayer meeting. She said, “A. Well, I seen her one evening get up right in the midst of his preaching and she walked across the room and just slammed the door so hard that everybody looked around. That was while he was preaching. And I saw her in church making fun of him as he passed, and she had a great fashion when she would see him coming, she would take her handkerchief out and blow her nose. Q. Everybody in church could hear her do that? A. Yes.” Eespondent agreed that these three witnesses were not unfriendly to her but denied or did not recall the misconduct detailed by them and called several members of the congregation who, in substance, testified either that they did not observe the acts complained of, or that the acts did not occur while they were in church. During the last few years respondent was not a regular <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>attendant at the church services. With respect to part of this evidence the Superior Court said, erroneously, we think: “But the complete answer is that there is not a particle of evidence that these actions had ever been reported to libellant . . .” It was not necessary to report to him what he could see or hear. Mrs. Fry’s evidence, quoted above, shows respondent’s interruption of the prayer meeting “causing him to stop the services and look down at her . . .”</p>
    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[201,756,1147,1237]],["BL_490.1",490,[256,274,1149,1772]]]'>The master, in his supplementary report, dealt with the evidence offered at the second hearing and concluded that respondent had not made out a defense to the course of conduct constituting the indignities complained of. Some of respondent’s witnesses made positive denials of particular instances; others said they had no recollection of the incidents. Some of the evidence was positive and some of it clearly within the category called negative evidence. The master, perhaps inaccurately, referred to all of this evidence as negative. In dismissing respondent’s exceptions to the master’s reports, the court in banc, instead of discriminating between positive and negative evidence, quoted from the supplementary report of the master the passage in which the evidence offered on behalf of respondent was referred to as negative. The error was doubtless inadvertent and was immaterial to the decision. We now refer to it only because the Superior Court appears to have attributed great importance to this confusion in terminology ;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> the Superior Court said, after quoting the passage from the opinion of the court below: “This was fundamental error, and by it they [the master and the judges of the court below] precluded themselves <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>from giving respondent’s case the weight to which it was entitled.” We find in the record no support for the proposition that the common pleas and the master did not give “respondent’s case the weight to which it was entitled.” The opinion of the court shows that respondent’s case was considered. In his supplemental report the master said: “The Master was unfavorably impressed by the testimony of the Respondent. Her allegations were unconvincing and on the other hand the Libellant was sincere and impressed the Master with the character of his testimony.” The common pleas court referred to that quotation from the master’s report and said: “We are in accord with the Master’s appraisal of the testimony of the parties and their witnesses. The Court having reviewed all the testimony and having seen and heard the parties and the respondent’s witnesses, is of the opinion that the libellant’s testimony is credible and worthy of belief and acceptable as true when in conflict with the respondent’s testimony.” Later in its opinion the court said: “We are convinced that the atmosphere created by her in his church activities was responsible for the failure of the church authorities to reappoint him to his charge and to relegate him to a position as superintendent of a church institution. . . . We are in accord with the Master in the opinion that the quality of the libellant’s evidence greatly surpassed the quality of respondent’s evidence and that libellant has made out his case by the Aveight of the evidence and a fair preponderance thereof, and that respondent’s conduct rendered the libellant’s condition intolerable and his life burdensome, - and we agree with the conclusion of the Master that he was justified in resorting to court to sever a relation no longer endurable.”</p>

Many are flagrant, and although libellant was present while respondent and her witnesses testified, he did not contradict them. Triers of fact are not required to believe uncontradicted testimony, but the absence of contradiction is always significant, especially in divorce cases. A libellant can have a divorce only if he is an innocent party, and' if he chooses to permit serious charges to remain in the record without contradiction we are warranted in accepting the testimony as true, especially where the credibility of the witnesses has not been questioned.”.</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[202,921,1147,1262]],["BL_492.1",492,[252,276,1145,151]]]'>We do not find in the record these flagrant charges by witnesses whose credibility has not been questioned. As we understand the record the respondent began making unwarranted charges concerning women within a year of their marriage and continued doing so; her accusations were general; she repeated the charges in varying forms until the break in their relations came. As we shall show later in this opinion, when the master required her to be specific about these charges, she finally reduced the accusations to conduct involving two women but stated that she had no basis for and did not make any charge<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> of immorality with respect to either. The Superior Court not only speaks of flagrant charges but of flagrant charges “made by witnesses whose credibility has not been questioned.” The charges were made by respondent whose credibility has been shaken by her own admission considered earlier in this opinion. Not only do we have her admitted misrepresentation of illness from January to May, 1945, when she was teaching school, but we have, in addition, the agreement of the master and of Judge Milner who saw and heard her testify, that they were “unfavorably impressed by the testimony of the respondent,” a fact, as <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>Judge Reno said, “entitled to the fullest consideration . . . especially in a contested case.” <em>Smith v.

Asked by the master to be specific about charges involving women, she referred to Mary O’Con-nor, a member of their church. The Mary O’Connor episode accurred in 1934, six years before they separated. The other instance specified involved a Mrs. Miller, a married woman whose age was given as 65 years. Mrs. Miller was the parish visitor, a position to which she was elected by the Church Board. The respondent was asked, “Q. Who is the parish visitor? A. Mrs. Miller.

Would it be unusual for that discussion or conference to take place in your home? A. No. Q. Or in the parsonage? A. No.”</p>

Q. And when these two women would do the things that you testified here to today, did that make you jealous? A. To a degree, yes. Q. And you voiced your opinion? A. That’s right. Q.

Did Mary O’Connor cease being a member of the congregation? A. No, not to my knowledge. Q. She stopped coming to the parsonage after you told her — A. Yes. Q. — that you did not want her there any more? A. Yes. Q. Is that right? A. Yes. Q. You told her that? A. Yes, we had an understanding. Q. And your sole reason for telling her not to come there any more was because she was giving gifts to you, the children, and your husband? A. I felt it was disrupting our family life, for her to come in several times a week. Q. But there was not any intimation on your part that she and your husband were intimate, was there? A. No. Q. Was that right? A. I never made any accusations about that. Q. Did you tell any other parishioners that you did not want them to come to the parsonage to see your husband? A. No. Q. If there was not anything intimate between this Mary O’Connor and your husband to give you any suspicion, why did you bar her, if she was a parishioner in good standing? A.

They are trifles light as air, imponderables, but for all that they are luminous integrants which ineluctably enter into the calculation by which trustworthiness is appraised. The spontaneous gesture, the lifting of an eyebrow, the shrug of the shoulders, the intonation of the voice, the flash of the eye, the facial expression,— these are a few of the vital and influential indicia of credibility which the master observes and by which he is guided.” This entire opinion should be read.</p>
