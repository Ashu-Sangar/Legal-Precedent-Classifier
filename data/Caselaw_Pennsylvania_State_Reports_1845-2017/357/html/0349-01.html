Before the legislature passed the Act of May 24, 1945, P.

When after H. J. Shapiro on February 6, 1946 made the “highest bid” of $61,000 and the court accepted his bid and authorized the fiduciary to execute a deed for the property upon certain terms and conditions, both vendor and vendee believed <em>(as the agreement of sale stated) </em>that “the Vendor in its fiduciary capacity is legally obliged to accept any higher or better offer which it receives prior to the approval of the within sales agreement by the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, Pa.” This agreement was signed by the Commonwealth Trust Company and its seal attached and also by H. J. Shapiro. After Shapiro’s name appeared the word “(Seal)”. This agreement also set forth that the Vendor “has the right to revoke the within Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>within sale and to refund the payment made on account of the purchase price without further liability to the Vendee.”</p>

        <em>Blackstone, </em>Lewis’s Ed., Book 2, section 306, refers to the fact that “the Normans, a brave but illiterate nation, at their first settlement in France, used the practice of sealing only, without writing their names, which custom continued when learning made its way among them, though the reason for doing it had ceased ... At the conquest, the Norman lords brought over into this kingdom their own fashions; and introduced waxen seals only, instead of the English method of writing their names and signing with the sign of the cross.”</p>

The whole theory of the solemnity of a seal is totally unsuited to the business methods of the present day, and the constant tendency of courts and legislatures is to ignore the distinctions formerly founded upon its use.”</p>

    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[225,316,1151,1298]]]'>The Act of May 24, 1945, P. L. 944, provides that “. . . when the court shall hereafter approve a contract of a fiduciary requiring approval of court, neither inadequacy of consideration, nor the receipt of an offer to deal on other terms shall, <em>except as otherwise agreed by the parties, </em>relieve the fiduciary of the obligation to perform his contract or shall constitute ground for any court to set aside the contract, or to refuse to enforce it by specific performance or otherwise.” (Italics supplied.) Thus the statute permits the parties to agree, if they so desire, that the fiduciary shall be relieved of his contractual obligation upon receiving a higher offer. Even if, therefore, as the majority opinion asserts, the approval by the court of Shapiro’s bid operated to vest in him an equitable title to the property, he could, under the Act, agree to a modification of his rights. That he did in fact so agree appears from the provision in his contract with the Trust Company that “If the Vendor receives a higher or better offer than the terms of the within Agreement it has the right to revoke the within Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the within sale and to refund the payment made on account of the purchase price without further liability to the Vendee.”</p>

In <em>Conrad’s Estate, </em>it was said (p. 563, A. p. 699) : “It is well settled that a seal <em>imports </em>consideration. This is more than <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>a mere presumption; the seal takes the place of proof of consideration and in the absence of fraud makes the promise enforceable without it. The defense of <em>want </em>of consideration is not available in an action on a sealed instrument.” The sole exception to this rule is where there is evidence of <em>fraud; </em>only in that event will proof of consideration be required: <em>Conrad’s Estate </em>(p. 563, A. p. 699) ; <em>Yulsman v. DuBois </em>(p. 312, A. p. 324). In the present case there is no suggestion of fraud; the most that can be said is that the parties misunderstood the law, but a mistake of law, whether unilateral or bilateral, does not relieve parties of their contractual obligations. The majority opinion cites <em>Jeffers v. Babis, </em><a href="/pa/304/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="304 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1132395" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0281-01">304 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.%20878" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="155 A. 878">155 A. 878</a>, but there the court pointed out that the defendant was guilty of <em>fraud, </em>thus bringing the case within the recognized exception; moreover the plaintiff in that case proved <em>failure </em>of consideration on the part of the defendant which, as distinguished from <em>want </em>of consideration, is a permissible defense in the case of <em>every </em>contract.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[261,1362,1148,878]]]'>My disagreement with the majority does not depend solely on the fact that the agreement between Shapiro and the Trust Company was under seal. The agreement itself reveals that there was consideration for whatever concessions Shapiro made therein. The order of the orphans’ court accepting his bid did not pretend to cover all the terms of the sale; on the contrary it provided for a “new agreement” to be entered into by the parties, and, as finally executed, the agreement contained numerous provisions not embodied in the court’s order. To pick out now a single clause and assert that there was no consideration for that particular covenant violates in my opinion, an elementary principle of contract law, namely, that <em>all </em>of the clauses of a written agreement must be regarded as constituting consideration <em>for one another.</em>
