The lease was of real estate situate in the City of Jeanette. The term was 3 years from December 1, 1944 and for an additional 3 year period from December 1, 1947, at a certain rental. The option to purchase was incorporated in the lease in the following terms: “The lessor hereby gives the lessees the first option to buy the said property described herein, for the consideration of $13,000. The lessor will take $3,000.00 cash as down payment and take the mortgage himself for the balance of $10,000.”</p>

Defendant refused to comply with these requests. On May 29, 1946, defendant married co-defendant Albina Yorio Capone. Three days later, on May 31, 1946, plaintiffs notified Salvatore Capone in writing of their desire to exercise the option and offered to pay the full amount of the agreed purchase price in cash or to pay $3,000 in cash and give a mortgage to defendant for the balance as set forth in the option to purchase. Defendant again <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>refused to act upon plaintiffs’ notice of election whereupon the latter filed a bill in equity against Capone for specific performance of the agreement and against his wife praying that any claim of right, title, or interest by her in said premises be extinguished.</p>

The rule is that when property is encumbered by a husband prior to his marriage, the woman who becomes his wife acquires no inchoate right of dower in it (or what is referred to as “a widow’s share in lieu of dower” since the enactment of the Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 429, sec. 3, 20 PS 31) by virtue of her marital status.

An option to purchase is analogous to a contract for the sale of land; it is in nature an encumbrance on the land pledged. In such case the husband is a trustee of the legal title for the benefit of the purchaser, and as such the wife cannot claim dower against the vendee. Equity regards the person bound to convey as having done what he should have done, i.e. made the conveyance, and treats him as trustee for the optionee. <em>McClure v.

    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[264,491,1152,1788]]]'>The court in support of its decree ruled that plaintiffs’ notice of their election to exercise the option to purchase was not equivalent to “an unqualified election to exercise an option.” It declared that the letter addressed by plaintiffs to defendants, to wit: “The lessees, Messrs. Detwiler and Fox, now desire to exercise the option which you granted them and are ready and willing to pay the sum of $3,000.00 . . . Will you kindly advise us when and where you desire to close the transaction.” constituted nothing more than a mere expression of a wish to exercise the option at some indefinite future time. The principle that no particular form of notice is required in the absence of a provision to that effect in the instrument granting the option is established. In <em>Smith &amp; Fleek’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/69/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="69 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1026415" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0474-01">69 Pa. 474</a>, this court said: “Nor was it necessary that notice of the plaintiffs’ election to take the land, under the option given in the contract, should be in writing . . . The verbal notice given by the plaintiffs was sufficient, and their election to take the land, like the happening of any other contingency on which performance of the agreement rests, rendered the contract as absolute and binding as if no option had been given to the plaintiffs.” Plaintiffs were under no obligation to serve written notice upon the defendant. Oral notice given by them prior to receipt of their letter by defendant was sufficient valid notice of their election. See 35 C.J. 1041, section 184. Unless there was a waiver of performance by plaintiffs by their conduct or continued payment of monthly rentals, the landlord-tenant relationship between the parties ceased to exist upon verbal communication of plaintiffs’ election and the lease was converted into a contract of sale. The record does not disclose any waiver of performance.</p>

This construction is captious. We do not believe that appellees had any doubt of plaintiffs’ intention to exercise the option when notified that plaintiffs “now desire to exercise the option”. If, for example, a prospective purchaser of an automobile after looking at the automobile in the salesroom said to the salesman, “I now desire to buy that car” the salesman would be justified in concluding that he was about to make a sale. The phrase “now desire”, so far as it expresses intent to do anything, expresses a present intent and not a future one to do that thing. It was held in <em>Cates v.

The option was subject to acceptance at any time during the duration of the lease. 35 Corpus Juris 1043, section 188 states: “An option in a lease to purchase the land demised is a continuing obligation on the part of the lessor Avhich the lessee may accept at any time . . .

The agreement in question contains all the essential terms of a valid contract. The parties, property and consideration are clearly identified. Justice Williams, speaking for this court in <em>Smith é Fleek’s Appeal, </em>supra, said: “Equally unfounded is the objection that the contract is incomplete in its terms. It sets out the parties and the consideration, and sufficiently describes the subject matter . . . But it is further objected that the plaintiffs are not entitled to specific execution of the contract, because they did not tender performance within the time limited by the agreement. It is a sufficient answer to the objection that by the terms of the contract no time is fixed for its performance. The agreement provides that four thousand dollars of the purchase-money shall be paid at the time the deed is made, and two thousand in one year. But no time is fixed for the making of the deed, and therefore the law implies that it was to be made Avithin a reasonable time.. .. Nor was <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>tender of performance absolutely essential to tbe maintenance of a bill for tbe specific execution of tbe agreement by the defendants.”</p>

The plaintiff in <em>Heights Land Co. v. Swengel’s Estate, </em>supra, started an action in assumpsit for the balance of the purchase price of real estate located in Florida. The suit was brought after a long lapse of time and the court held that recovery would be denied where the defendant could not have obtained performance of the contract. Plaintiff never tendered the deed and was guilty of laches in enforcing performance of the agreement. In our opinion we stated that “an action to compel payment of the purchase money cannot be maintained by the vendor without tender of a conveyance before suit brought. [Citing cases] . . . all that it [the statement of claim] sets forth is the veiled averment that ‘The plaintiff has always been and still is ready, willing and able to perform its agreement.’ ” In the instant case when the defendant expressed his disavowal of the option agreement, tender on the part of the plaintiffs would have been a vain thing.

The court below in sustaining this objection cited the case of <em>Barton v. </em>Thaw, <a href="/pa/246/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="246 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1006208" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0348-01">246 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.%20312" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="92 A. 312">92 A. 312</a>.

The court in its opinion in that case, in reply to the argument that “it was intended that the option should be exercised within a reasonable time” said: “This option was intended.to be unlimited as to time.

The agreement plainly states that “the lessor hereby gives the lessees the first option to buy the said property described herein”. The plaintiffs would be lessees during their tenancy of the leased premises. The duration of this tenancy was three years from December 1, 1944, with the privilege of three years extension from December 1, 1947. When plaintiffs should cease to be the lessees of Salvatore Capone, their option would cease to have any legal force.
