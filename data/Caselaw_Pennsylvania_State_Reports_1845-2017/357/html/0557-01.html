Specifically, under the general welfare clause, or by virtue of general grant of power . . . municipal corporations are authorized to enact appropriate and reasonable ordinances, ... to abate nuisances and regulate various kinds of occupations that may become nuisances or detrimental to the public health McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, 2nd ed. sec. 950 (895), pp. 116, 117.

The only limitation of this power is, that it must be exercised in a reasonable, lawful-and constitutional manner.” In <em>The Borough of Warren v.

L. 568, Art. V, sec. 3, cl. 46, — which was even less broad than that in the Act of 1931. Where the power exists to enact an ordinance as an exercise of the police power there necessarily exists also the concomitant power to impose a license fee to cover the expense of regulation and supervision if such regulation and supervision are necessary or desirable for the public good: McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, 2nd ed., sec. 1089 (989), p. 645. Of course, any restriction imposed by such an ordinance on the use of property must be reasonably conducive to the safety, health, morals or general welfare of the public, for the exercise of the police power is always subject to judicial review and a law based upon it must not be patently beyond the necessities of the case but must bear some rational relation to the end to be attained: <em>Bryan v.

The record discloses, and indeed it is a matter of common knowledge, that juke boxes are placed principally in restaurants, <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>taprooms and dance halls some of which are operated until the wee hours of the morning or even all night. It would appear to be entirely in order for a municipality to make sure, by periodic inspections, that they do not become a public nuisance by reason of their being located in a part of the establishment so near a public thoroughfare as to disturb pedestrians, or their being operated noisily or at improper hours, or because of their playing vulgar or obscene records. While it is doubtless true that the operation of these juke boxes has been heretofore generally conducted in a harmless and inoffensive manner, the municipality is nevertheless justified in protecting its citizens against any future possible lapses in that regard. Theatrical, operatic and musical performances and motion picture shows have always been recognized as proper subjects of police inspection and control, and, in comparison with them, the necessity for the supervision and regulation of the music and songs furnished by juke boxes commercially operated is, at best, merely a question of degree. We cannot judicially declare that an ordinance which aims at such regulation and inspection is so patently arbitrary, and so unreasonable an interference with a legitimate business, as not to be warranted by any rational considerations of public safety, morals and general welfare. As a court we are not concerned with the merits or wisdom of legislation but only with the power of the legislative body to enact it.</p>

It appears that some of the stores in New Kensington selling ordinary phonographs and records occasionally play them near the doorways of their establishments in order to attract customers, but the use of juke boxes is in all respects so different from these occasional advertising demonstrations of phonographs that they can scarcely be said to be in the same class as respects the legislative power to discriminate between them in requiring a license for their possession and operation.</p>

Plaintiff is mistaken, however, in his interpretation of this provision of the ordinance. It does not vest in the Chief of Police the power to make any final or binding decision as to whether the operation of the machines amounts in any instance to a public nuisance, but merely imposes upon him the duty which a police officer is always called upon to perform, namely, to investigate whether a violation of the law is apparently being committed; it is only as the result of judicial proceedings before a magistrate that a licensee may be convicted of operating machines in violation of the ordinance. As to the provision that every application for a license must be referred to the Chief of Police for investigation and approval, without any specification in the ordinance of standards to govern his approval or disapproval, the time to attack that provision will be if, and when, a license is arbitrarily refused to any applicant.</p>

The complaint is that the acts the district attorney was proceeding against did not amount to a violation of the criminal laws. In other words, the corporation pleads ‘not guilty’ to the charges filed against it and demands that a <em>court of equity </em>try that issue. This a court of equity cannot do.” It was pointed out, however, that the jurisdiction of equity in such cases does exist where, in the attempt to enforce an invalid statute or ordinance, there is a direct invasion of property rights resulting in irreparable injury.</p>
