They sue for the death of their child, aged two years and eleven months, drowned in a pond maintained by defendant. They lived in a house on the east side of Fern Street, in the Borough of Freeland. Defendant’s.land is on the west-side <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>of tlie street, Fern Street being the boundary between the borough and Foster Township. The pond, about 75 feet wide and 1000 feet long, has remained on the land from which coal was removed by a stripping operation many years ago. Almost the entire pond is surrounded by a bank of dirt and rock about 35 feet high. At the eastern end of the pond, at a point nearest plaintiffs’ house, there is neither bank nor barrier. The distance from that point to plaintiffs’ house is 410 feet and it is at that point where the child is said to have drowned. Between the west side of Fern Street and the pond is open ground. A path extends from Cedar Street (a borough street northwest of plaintiffs’ house) across defendant’s land in a southeastward direction and passes the end of the pond at a distance variously given; one witness stated it to be five feet. That path is less than 400 feet from plaintiffs’ house and has been used for many years by school children going to and from the borough to the Foster Township Grade School in the township a short distance south of plaintiffs’ house.</p>

Defendant did nothing to clarify the issues but went to trial on the issues made’by the statement of claim and the affidavit of defense which neither answered nor denied the averments of plaintiffs’ statement. When plaintiffs proposed to show that their child was on- the premisés by defendant’s implied permission, defendant objected on the ground that the fact was not averred in the statement of claim. -Plaintiffs’ counsel asked about the pathway across defendant’s premises, passing the pond and about children of tender years playing there. On defendant’s objection to proof of the fact, plaintiffs moved to amend-<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> by averring that the premises were uséd as a playground. Leave to amend was given, defendant’s counsel stating that he would Pot plead surprise. After some testimony supporting the fact averred by the amendment had been received, counsel for the defendant renewed his objection “. . . in view of the fact that this is an attempt to establish a permissive way, and a permissive way is distinct from a playground. THE COURT: If I recall correctly the amendment included the pathway used by the children. MR. SLATTERY : No, the amendment did hot, your honor, please, but it is now introduced in this testimony showing the accessibility of children to the playground. THE <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>COURT: We won’t permit permissive use of the right-of-way unless there is an averment. MR.

Apparently, plaintiffs proposed to show that part of defendant’s land between Fern Street and the accessible end of the pond had been frequented by playing children for such a long time as to fix defendant with knowledge of that fact and to impose the measure of care stated in section 339 of the Torts Restatement. Defendant objected on the ground that the statute of limitations had run and that to allow the plaintiffs to show that children played on defendant’s premises would introduce a new cause of action after the period of limitation. We must reject the contention. The learned court -was right in its first ruling that plaintiff might show that the child was on defendant’s premises by implied permission. While it is elementary that a plaintiff may not amend to introduce a new cause of action after the period of limitation has expired, the general rule is that he may simplify or make his statement of claim more specific at any time so long as he does not introduce a new agency as the cause of action: compare <em>Slother v.

Defendant was required to meet the averment that it had failed to exercise reasonable care in the circumstances. It was a matter of defense that the child had no right to be there if that was the fact. The excluded evidence tended to support plaintiffs’ contention of implied permission. Whether it was sufficient to support a finding of the fact cannot now be considered because we cannot know what the witnesses, whose evidence was excluded, will say at the trial.</p>
