The appeals followed. No substantial dispute is presented concerning the principles of law enunciated by this Court relating to the statutory requirement, nor are the facts in controversy. The narrow question is whether the law was correctly applied to the proven facts.</p>

She is said to have been survived by a sister, nephews and nieces, and grandnephews and a grandniece. Her estate, consisting of real and personal property, is estimated at $80,000. Upon the death, custody of the house and its contents was assumed by Miss Wessell, a close friend and neighbor of decedent, who had been the fianceé of decedent’s predeceased son. Miss Wessell immediately notified decedent’s sister residing in Akron, Ohio, by telephone, of the death. The sister and certain members of the family came to Pittsburgh and lived in the house until after the funeral. Other relatives also came to Pittsburgh from Ohio, staying with neighbors, but took their meals in decedent’s home. With the consent of decedent’s lawyer, the sister, upon her return to Akron, turned over a set of house keys to Miss Wessell who thereafter continued in custody of the premises.</p>

The box was opened and the contents examined in the presence of bank officials. No will was found in the box. The lawyer and Miss Wessell then went to the decedent’s residence and searched for a will. They looked with particular care in the unlocked bottom drawer of a Winthrop desk in the living room <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>where decedent had always kept her private papers.

While the two employes were listing the household goods, Mr. Williams searched through the Winthrop desk. He testified that he found the three papers (offered for probate) in the bottom drawer rolled up with a gum band around them. The papers in the drawer were “arranged in order; it was not helter skelter.” No other articles were piled on top of the papers. They were . . . “lying a little off right center in the middle of the drawer ...” As the papers were not in the drawer when examined by the attorney and Miss Wessell on June 19th, but were found by Mr. Williams in a conspicuous position in the drawer on July 28th, it is apparent that they had been placed in the drawer between those dates. The learned hearing judge in his opinion said “Counsel for proponent admits that someone took this purported will from the residence of the decedent and then returned it. The record does not disclose the identity of the person or persons who did so.”</p>

The test was early stated by Chief Justice Gibson in <em>Wikoff’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/15/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="15 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="408707" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0281-01">15 Pa. 281</a>, 290: “It is a rudimental principle, that a will may be made on distinct papers, as was held in the Earl of Essex’s Case, cited 1 Show. 69. It is sufficient that they are connected by their internal sense, by coherence or adaptation of parts.” The question was again raised in <em>Maginn’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/278/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="278 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1080644" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0089-01">278 Pa. 89</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.%20264" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="122 A. 264">122 A. 264</a>. The rule was stated to be: while a will need not be signed at the physical or spatial end, and pages need not follow in numerical order, there must be the sequence of pages or paragraphs which relates to its logical and internal sense, and the signature <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>must be placed at tbe sequential end; and this end must not permit the substitution or interpolation of pages in advance unless they are connected as indicated. Chief Justice Maxey, in <em>Covington Estate, </em><a href="/pa/348/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="348 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1220350" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0001-01">348 Pa. 1</a>, 10, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.2d%20235" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="33 A.2d 235">33 A. 2d 235</a>, said: “From the leading cases cited from our own State ... it is established (1) That a valid will may be written on separate, not physically united, sheets of paper only the last one of which is signed; (2) That it is not necessary to the testamentary validity of such papers that a specific reference be made on the signed page to the preceding pages; (3) That for the probate of such papers as a will it is not necessary that the separate sheets be verbally united by the completion on a successive page of a sentence or paragraph begun on the preceding page. ... (4) That the test . . . is . . . : Are the papers ‘connected by their internal sense, by coherence or adaptation of parts?’ ” As the rule is so firmly established we need not cite the many cases reviewed in the above cases and attempt to classify or distinguish them. It will suffice to say that each case must be examined in the light of the particular facts. Under varying circumstances, the rule applied to one set of facts does not necessarily control an entirely different factual situation.</p>

However, the facts in that case were quite dissimilar to those presently before us. That was a case of a joint will executed by a husband and wife. The will consisted of three sheets of unfastened papers, identical in form, taken from a pad of bill heads used by the husband in his business. They were in handwriting. The first page was titled “Last Will” of decedents. Then followed devises of real estate and bequests of personalty and direction for payment of funeral expenses. The second sheet contained a devise of real estate and personal <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>property. Tlie third sheet provided for the disposition of proceeds of life insurance, bequest of personal property and gave the combination of the safe. At the end of this sheet appeared the signatures and the date. All three papers were found in a sealed envelope on a kitchen table in the room where the bodies of decedents were found — joint suicides. A majority of the Court decided, on the facts of that case, that the papers were sufficiently ‘“. . . connected in their internal sense or coherence by adaptation of parts” ’ to establish that the will was signed at the end thereof. The fact that all three papers were enclosed in a sealed envelope was regarded as equivalent to a physical fastening.</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[190,986,1151,1085]]]'>The facts in the instant case are distinguishable from those in <em>Covington Estate, </em>supra. Here the signed testimonium clause is on a separate detached remnant of paper, and has no internal reference to the two preceding-sheets. In <em>Covington Estate </em>the signatures were on the bottom and formed part of the third sheet with its dispositive provisions. It is established that here the remnant was not even part of a similar legal form, and of the same printing, as the other two. In <em>Covington Estate </em>all sheets were taken from the same bill pad. Furthermore, while in the present case the three sheets were found with a rubber band around them, yet it could not be shown, when the band was removed and after the signed clause fell to the floor, whether the signed testimonium clause was on the top or bottom of the three sheets. Had the signed clause been at the beginning or top, under any circumstance, the alleged will could not be held to have been signed at the end but at the beginning. Such an execution would have been invalid: <em>Coyne Will, </em><a href="/pa/349/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="349 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="458395" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0331-01">349 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20509" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="37 A.2d 509">37 A. 2d 509</a>.</p>
