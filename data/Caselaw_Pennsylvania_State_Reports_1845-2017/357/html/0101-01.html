The City Board of Bevision of Taxes in making assessments of appellant’s lands and improvements for taxation purposes for the year 1945 included the appraised value of certain tanks maintained on appellant’s premises. Appellant objected to the inclusion of a number of specifically designated tanks among the assessed realty and appealed from the assessment on the ground that such property was improperly taxed in violation of section 1 of the Act of June 3,1915, P. L. 787,53 PS, 4742, which provides that; “. . . in cities of the first class, the assessment of real estate for taxation, the machinery and tools used in manufacturing in any mill or manufactory shall not be considered or included in determining the value of real estate . . .”</p>

The Board concluded that the tanks on the property were part of the real estate and not machinery. The taxpayer appealed to the Common Pleas Court. There were two appeals by the taxpayer and these were tried together before Judge Mawhinney on June 6,1945. The court dismissed the appeals on October 25, 1945, whereupon exceptions were filed on November 18, 1945, by the taxpayer.

The manufacture of these products, according to appellant, comprehend generally (1) cleaning the crude oil by removing water, salt, dirt and other impurities, (2) fractionating off uncracked gasoline, distillate fuel oils and unrefined lubricating stocks, (3) cracking the resulting oil and distillates into gasoline and residual fuel oil, (4) chemically treating the various oils and waxes resulting from the fractionation and cracking, and, finally, blending, dyeing and adding various chemicals to meet specifications for marketable product. Appellant maintains that the great majority of the tanks included in the assessment are used to remove water and sediments from crude petroleum before it is or can be charged to the stills, by heating the oil in tanks equipped with steam coils and settling the oil; as receptacles for the products of various batteries or groups of stills designed to process certain specific types of crude oils, prior to and for the purpose of drying the products of the stills to remove traces of moisture; for the purpose <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>of adding chemicals to complete the finished product; and for other manufacturing purposes. Circulating pumps, pipe lines, valves and heating, steam and air blowing systems are connected directly to the tanks, which altogether constitute integral parts of appellant’s manufacturing machinery. Appellant also avers that the few remaining tanks, used as receptacles for finished products, contain valves, pipes, pumping equipment, measuring devices and other equipment, that these tanks are necessary to the manufacturing process of appellant as receptacles for the products of its stills, and that the same constitute parts of appellant’s manufacturing machinery.</p>

The latter, in appellant’s estimation, fall within the classification of “machinery used in manufacturing” and thus are entitled to the benefits of the tax exemption conferred by the Act of 1915, supra. This witness in explaining the function of tanks in refining-crude oil used a chart, exhibit No. 1, which showed the position, function and the necessity of each tank in the manufacture or processing of gasoline and the various petroleum products produced at the plant. This witness stated: “I have only one thing to say, that might sum up this whole dissertation, or whole description, and that is, with the exception of these thirteen tanks which we say are shipping tanks, that if you were to remove the rest of these tanks from the refinery, you could no more manufacture a product than if you did not have any stills or pumps. In other words, to me it is just as much machinery as your cracking units or your pumps or anything else that you have got in your refinery. They are absolutely necessary.”</p>

The court asked this witness this question: “Doctor, the tanks which are not treated as storage tanks, for the purpose of shipment either by truck or otherwise to the plant of this company, is there any manufacturing process that goes on in these tanks in addition to, as you say, that they are used as storage tanks?”</p>

Now I did not call any of these tanks in which some process went on manufacturing, because a process is not a machine. I can explain that if I am questioned further ... I state that blending tanks are essentially storage tanks unless they are equipped specifically and only for the purposes of mixing by means of stirrers or air currents and the like. The material being blended being immediately or continuously withdrawn into storage elsewhere, merely allowing mixing to take place during storage, only underscores the fact that the storage period is long enough to accomplish that. Mechanical mixing can be accomplished at the junction of feed pipes fed by proportion pumps and does not require the entire storage tank for the purpose . . . And the question at issue, it seems to me is what is going on within that tank: is there a manufacturing going on? or is there a process of change going on? and is that what is done when you run a machine like a cracking unit or a still?”</p>

The court said: “It is evident that the appellant is engaged in refining oil and therefore [is] a manufacturer: Com. v. National Oil Co., Ltd., <a href="/pa/157/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="157 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="846613" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0516-01">157 Pa. 516</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> By its process, through the various types of tanks, crude oil is made into the products already enumerated. The evidence shows that these tanks are very large, that they rest upon concrete bases, making use, because of their enormous weight, of the law of gravity to hold them in place on heavy concrete bases erected on and in the land beneath them; that they have been placed there as a necessary part of the operations conducted by the appellant and are there to carry out the permanent purposes of the manufacturing plant.”</p>

The majority of the tanks are used for storage purposes primarily, although it was testified that in certain of them certain processes take place — such as heating, settling, blending and filtering. But, the fact that a process of some kind takes place in the oil that is stored in the tanks, does not make them machines ... In Denning Wire &amp; Fence Co. v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of New Jersey, <a href="/f/169/0793-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="169 F. 793" data-case-ids="3886499" data-case-paths="/f/169/0793-01">169 F. 793</a>, 795, the court said: ‘The term “machine” includes every mechanical device or combination of mechanical powers <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>and devices to perforin some function and produce a certain effect or result. But where the result or effect is produced by chemical action, by the operation or application of some element or power of nature, of one substance to another, such modes, methods, or operations are called “processes”.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b147-3" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[239,595,1152,1085]]]'>But the <em>Denning Wire &amp; Fence Co. </em>case cited by the court below was a <em>patent </em>case which decided “That the mere function or operations of a machine, or other device itself, are not the subject of a patent.” This is <em>not </em>the question <em>before us. </em>The opinion in the <em>Denning </em>case cited <em>Corning v. Burden, </em><a href="/us/56/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="56 U.S. 252" data-case-ids="3481838" data-case-paths="/us/56/0252-01">56 U.

The question now before us is <em>whether or not certain parts of a manufacturing establishment called tanks in which there take place functions, both chemical action and mechanical action, which are essential to the production of the thing (refined oil) for which the manufactory was built constitute a part of the machinery of that establishment as the word machinery is used in the Act of 1915, supra.</em>

That language is that the term “machine includes every mechanical device or combination of mechanical powers and devices to perform some function and produce a certain effect or result.” The tanks in question <em>were </em>a combination of mechanical powers and devices whose function was to produce a certain effect or result.</p>
    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[245,2182,1148,152]],["BL_148.1",148,[251,269,1150,1081]]]'>But the court below (following the line of argument of Professor Malisoff) took the second half of the excerpt from the <em>Denning Wire &amp; Fence Co. </em>case as the <em>second </em>
      <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>basis for its conclusion. It decided that since what took place in the tanks was “chemical” action and not “mechanical” action, the name to apply to it was “processing” and that processing was not manufacturing and since it was not manufacturing, the tanks which were necessary to this processing were not machinery. This conclusion was inconsistent with the court’s earlier statement that “these tanks” are “a necessary part of the operations conducted by the appellant.” This statement by the court is supported by witness Edgley’s uncontradicted testimony that “until these chemicals are added the gasoline is not a marketable product ... because you can’t finish manufacturing the gasoline until these chemicals are added; and the addition of those chemicals is as much of a manufacturing procedure as your cracking stills are.” Since the tanks in whose contents chemical changes are mechanically made are a necessary part of the appellant’s oil refinery, it follows that they are an integrated part of the machinery of manufacturing.</p>

The criterion of physical attachment has long been rejected in the solution of that problem. Chief Justice Gibson in <em>Voorhis v. Freeman, </em><a href="/watts-serg/2/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 116" data-case-ids="1853586" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0116-01">2 W. &amp; S. 116</a>, said in 1841 that in “the old criterion” of “physical attachment” which “was adapted to fixtures and dwellings before England had become a manufacturing country” there was “want of adaptation to the business and improvements of the age” and that the true test was whether the machinery “was palpably an integrant part of a manufactory or a mill”, i. e. “was necessary to constitute it and without which it would not be a manufactory at all.” See also <em>Defense Plant Corporation Tax Assessment Case, </em><a href="/pa/350/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="350 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="461139" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0520-01">350 Pa. 520</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20713" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="39 A.2d 713">39 A. 2d 713</a>.

    <p id="b149-3" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[240,443,1150,1586]]]'>The testimony of Professor Malisoff that “some processing was going on in these tanks”, does not warrant the conclusion that the tanks are <em>not </em>machinery. The fallacy that tanks or containers in which processing takes place cannot be either machines or machinery proceeds from the erroneous premise that nothing is machinery that does not “apply [physical] force or involve the quality of motion.” Before and at the very dawning of the “machine age” when the machinery best known to the public were saw mills and grist mills and later cotton gins and steam engines, it was natural to entertain the concept that all machinery involved motion and anything which did not move was not machinery. The modern “machine age” has outgrown that concept. Much of the machinery today has only passive or motionless functions to perform in manufacturing. For example, in the manufacturing of metal from iron ore, the blast furnace in which smelting takes place is composed of a fire brick lining encased in a steel shell. The ore is reduced to iron by chemical reaction in which certain gases permeate the molten iron. This chemical reaction is a <em>process </em>and is expressed in a chemical formula. In the process of smelting, gases permeate the iron ore completely and the freshly reduced iron in the blast furnace picks up the carbon necessary to convert it into the more fusible pig iron, either by physical contact with the hot carbon, or by the gas reaction. The blast furnace in which this process takes place is clearly a part of the machinery of iron manufacture.</p>

Professor Malisoff testified: “Things do happen in the tanks. . . . All storage tanks will settle material that contains moisture, oily materials that contain moisture . . . Yery often things are done in the tanks to the extent of adding some ingredient or agitating the contents for a purpose. I would call that processing.

Steel making is done in a steel vessel or converter weighing from 10 to 25 tons in which is placed pig iron. This is subjected to great heat and certain elements are eliminated and certain elements are added to the molten mass. What <em>takes place therein </em>is a <em>positive </em>process but while the function of the <em>steel vessel itself </em>is <em>negative, </em>yet this converter is clearly a part of the <em>machinery </em>of steel production. In steel making a metal mixer is always used. That is also a part of the machinery of <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>steel production. Professor Malisoff in his testimony referred to the mixing which takes place in the blending tanks. He contended that: “Mechanical mixing can be accomplished at the junction of feed pipes fed by proportion pumps and does not require the entire storage tanks for the purpose.” Whether this mechanical mixing <em>can </em>be accomplished as Professor Malisoff testified it can is entirely immaterial. The fact is it <em>is </em>accomplished in the “blending tanks.” Professor Malisoff characterized certain other tanks in question as “charging tanks” and “surge tanks”. Appellant’s witness, Mr. Edgley, when testifying, said of what takes place in the blending tanks that it was done “to correct boiling range and vapor pressure for shipment by vessel to white gasoline laboratory tests.” He also testified in very technical language as to what takes place in “charging tanks” and “surge tanks”. His testimony makes it clear that what takes place in those tanks is all a part of the process of refining oil and that without these tanks “you could [as he said] no more manufacture a product than if you did not have any stills or pumps . . . They are absolutely necessary [to the business of oil refining].” Professor Malisoff said: “I have no reason to question Mr. Edgley’s statements at all — I think they have been remarkably accurate — as to what these tanks are, where they belong in the system, and what they are used for.” The purport of Professor Malisoff’s testimony is that what does take place in these tanks is essential to oil refining but since it is processing, the tanks in which the processing is done are not machinery. If that were so, the smelters used in making iron and the converters used in making steel are not parts of the machinery of, respectively, iron and steel manufacture. We must reject these conclusions.</p>

    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[268,665,1147,906]]]'>The court added that the term processing is sometimes “used subjectively or passively as applied to the material operated on, and not to the method or mode of producing that operation, which is by mechanical means, or the use of a machine, as distinguished from a process”; the term processing sometimes “represents the function of a machine, or the effect produced by . . . the machine, . . .

In the laundry we have the same combination of boiler and engine or other mechanism by which a desired result is obtained, and the fact that the boiler is not mounted on wheels or that union between the boiler and other mechanism is effected through a greater length of pipe makes the entire apparatus none the less a single system of machinery.”</p>
