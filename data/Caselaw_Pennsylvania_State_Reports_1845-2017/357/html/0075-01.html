L. 415, 20 PS 1981. Contestant charged that decedent lacked testamentary capacity and that the will was obtained by undue influence. No testimony was produced as to undue influence and this charge is not pressed. The sole question is whether the testimony relating to testamentary incapacity was sufficient in quality and quantity to raise a substantial dispute of fact requiring the grant of an issue: <em>De Laurentiis’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/323/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="323 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="1169575" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0070-01">323 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.%20359" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="186 A. 359">186 A. 359</a>; <em>Lare Will, </em><a href="/pa/352/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="352 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="464137" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0323-01">352 Pa. 323</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.2d%20801" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="42 A.2d 801">42 A. 2d 801</a>.

The widow of her deceased brother Daniel still survives. The contestant, Dr. John D. Sturgeon, has four living children: William, John, Bailey and George. One son, Robert, predeceased his aunt (the decedent) leaving a widow and two children surviving. Decedent’s estate consists of real and personal property, the amount of which, while substantial, does not appear in the record.

Pursuant to the appointment, decedent came into the lawyer’s private office, unaccompanied, and directed him to prepare her will. She was questioned concerning the nature and extent of her estate and her family relations, and gave accurate and comprehensive answers to all inquiries. She gave instructions concerning the disposition of her estate. She stated that Avhile her relations with her brother (contestant) had been pleasant, he possessed property and that it would not be necessary for her to give him any part of her estate. She stated <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>that her relations with the nephew, Dr. John D.

She discussed with the lawyer her relations with the other members of the family.' The lawyer inquired concerning her acquisition to the title to her Kensington Street property, to which she accurately replied. Her answers were verified by the public record and the chain of title was inserted in the will. Decedent came to the lawyer’s office at least on two occasions before the will was executed and discussed on each occasion the nature of her property and the persons to whom she desired to bequeath it. On each occasion the decedent was interviewed by the attorney in his private office and she was unaccompanied. The lawyer dictated the will to his secretary and a carbon copy was mailed to decedent on May 24, 1945. On May 26, 1945, decedent came into the lawyer’s office, unaccompanied, and the lawyer in her presence and in the presence of his secretary read the entire document to her. She expressed her satisfaction with it. Decedent then signed the will and at her request the lawyer and his secretary witnessed it, in the presence of decedent and of each other.

All expressed their opinion that decedent possessed testamentary capacity. The <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>bank records revealed that decedent kept two accounts, one a “House account” and tbe other a “Personal account”.
