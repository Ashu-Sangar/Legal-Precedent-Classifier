Sixty-five or seventy minutes later he was dying in front of the home of Mrs. Barnak’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Schiffner, 211 South Car-lisle Street, Allentown, with a thirty-two caliber bullet in his head.</p>

As the night was cold, Miss Fisher suggested that they close the door so that the driver could-go up half a block and turn the ear around and pick up Lt. Bowman and return him to Lehigh University. As the car made the “U” turn, Miss Fisher and the driver heard two shots and saw a man running two houses north from the home of Mr. and Mrs. Schiffner, toward Hanover Avenue. The driver, with Miss Fisher, tried to follow the man who was running, but the latter quickly disappeared from view. The man they saw was described by them as short in stature, with broad shoulders, broad hips, and a narrow waistline. “He wore a broad brim hat and a dark overcoat; he ran very awkwardly.” This description in its entirety fits John Barnak. Because of an <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>injury to his leg when he was seven years of age, his left leg was three quarters of an inch shorter than his right leg.</p>

He heard the machine stop and heard two shots fired. He ran out and saw a man with a brown overcoat and brown hat running down the street. The man turned at the corner and looked back. At the corner there was an electric arc light, eighteen and a half feet above the street. Schiffner said: “I recognized him as John Barnak. I recognized him the minute he turned his face that I could see him.” At that time the moon was shining.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> There was snow on the ground.</p>

I could not identify him right clearly because he was right in front of me, but the minute they took him away from me I could just picture that was the same image I seen running <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>December 20th, a few houses from Mr. and Mrs. Schiffner’s home.”</p>

Barnak said: “Yes.” Barnak.then gave him a slip of paper and wrote down the name of Madge, 211 South Carlisle Street, evidently referring to Barnak’s wife. Granitz said he came back to Barnak in about three, quarters of an hour and Barnak asked him, Granitz, “if he was over.” Granitz, in a “kidding” way replied: “Yes.” He said that Barnak told him, “It’s lucky you didn’t go over. That’s my wife. I’d beat you up, and beat anybody else up that goes with her.” When Barnak was asked on cross-examination whether he had said that he’d punch anybody on the nose that he saw with his wife, he said: “Gne nian.” When asked who that was he stated: “I don’t remember his name, but he was on this witness stand.”</p>

She said Madeline Barnak, her sister, left the house at quarter of nine to meet some friends, and that she did not return until approximately ten minutes of twelve. She said that her mother and father and “my one sister and I were sitting in the living room”; that a car pulled up outside; and that her sister said: “Madeline’s coming.” She said she looked at the clock and it was ten minutes of twelve, and just a short time after that there were two shots. When Mrs. Blank got outside her sister was staggering across the pavement and said: “Oh, daddy, come and help.” She said: “this figure caught my eye, approximately two doors down from our home, he wasn’t standing and he wasn’t running, he was sort of hesitating, and he was turned around more to the front, and I recognized him as John Barnak, and he started to run immediately, and as he néared the corner he turned to the side, and I saw him again. My father went to this boy that was lying in the street, and I said, ‘Here’s Madeline,’ she was right by the steps —he went off the side and I went directly down — and he came over and started to pick her up, and I said, ‘I’ll help you,’ so Ave both carried her in and laid her on the davenport.”</p>

He testified: “I might have gotten there, I imagine, close onto 12:40.” Officers O’Donnell and Arndt were already there. When they took Barnak to the police station, he was wearing a brown overcoat. Shortly after Barnak reached the police station, Mr. Schiffner and his daughter came in. Mr. Schiffner said that Barnak was the man “that run away from over there.” That was about 1 a.m.</p>

He was asked: “Did you tell him what he was wanted for?” He answered: “I don’t be-live so.” On cross-examination, he was asked about the condition of Barnak’s bed. He said that the bed clothes “looked as if they had been disturbed.” He did not feel the bed to ascertain whether it had just been slept in.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Officer Arndt testified that according to the record made of his order to go to Barnak’s home the night of the homicide and his compliance with it, he received the order at 12:18 a.m. and arrived at the Barnak home at 12:25 a.m. On cross-examination, he was asked this question: “12:18 was the time you arrived at Barnak’s home?” He answered: “Yes.” In making that answer he was obviously confused, for the answer is erroneous. The record of the order and its execution, which was put in evidence as Exhibit “C”, shows the “time of arrival” at Barnak’s home was 12:25 a.m. This is in accord with the testimony of Captain Sperling, who testified as above noted, that he, the Captain, put in a call from 211 South Carlisle Street to police headquarters “in the neighborhood of 12:20, might have been 25”; and that he, Captain Sperling, got to the Barnak home “close onto 12:40,” after the other two officers had arrived there. Since this homicide did not take place any later than 11:55 p.m. (according to the clock in the home of Mrs. Barnak’s parents, it took place at 11:50 p.m.), Barnak had thirty or thirty-five minutes to travel the distance, which was a little less than a mile and a half, between 211 South Carlisle Street and G34 North Bryan Street.</p>

This court has frequently stated that an alibi does not have to be supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but only by a fair preponderance of the evidence. The court below so instructed the jury and then said: “it will be for you, if you are otherwise convinced of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to take into consideration the defense of alibi that has been raised by the defendant.” What he meant by the phrase “take into consideration” he showed when a few minutes later in his charge he said: “even though you might find that the alibi does not exclude the possibility of John Barnak having committed the crime, [which was equivalent to saying that if the evidence as to the alibi was not established by a fair preponderance of the evidence] <em>you have the right to use the shortness of time as creating in your mind a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s </em>guilt, <em>if the </em>

    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[227,379,1152,1087]]]'>By “shortness of time” the trial judge obviously meant the time that elapsed between the shooting (11:55 p.nu) and the time Barnak was found in his father’s and mother’s house (12:25 a.m.). This excerpt just quoted made it clear to the jury that if the “shortness of time” created a doubt of Barnak’s guilt he was entitled to the benefit of that doubt. This was all the instruction the jury was entitled to on that point. But the trial judge went a great deal further in his charge, for at least nine times he told the jury that the burden was upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt <em>every material averment </em>of the charge. For example, the trial judge said: “Under all the law and the facts in the case the burden of proof never shifts, but remains with the Commonwealth throughout the trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, each and every, all and singular, the material averments in the indictment. If all of this is not clearly and satisfactorily shown beyond a reasonable doubt in this'(fase the jury should acquit the defendant.”</p>

If he does not do this, his defense of alibi falls completely.” This was assigned for error. Justice Kephart, speaking for this court, said: “In Rudy v.

The facts in such defense are almost exclusively within the knowledge of the accused. In viewing this testimony as arrayed against the Commonwealth’s case showing guilt, the court should instruct the jury as to its nature, its purpose and the degree of persuasion necessary to establish it. There is a reason of public policy that justifies such a conclusion. An alibi is frequently used as a defense. The facility with which testimony to support it may be procured from well-meaning or designing persons . . . make it necessary that some rule should be laid down, designed to inform the defendant of the quantity and quality of proof necessary to establish such defense. . . . If evidence of alibi is offered to fortify the presumption of innocence which still stands with him, it must appear to a certain degree of persuasion in order to sustain the defense or raise a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt (Turner v. Com., <a href="/pa/86/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="86 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1056643" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0054-01">86 Pa. 54</a>, 73, 74) ; but this requirement does not take from the accused the benefit of his presumption of innocence, for though the alibi be not established to the satisfaction of the jury as a fact, the presumption of innocence is still with the defendant, and the evidence in the case may be enough to raise a reasonable doubt as to guilt. . . . The whole charge shows that the court below did not take from the jury any consideration of the evidence on alibi as bearing on doubt as to the guilt of the accused. In the end of the charge the trial judge said: ‘If, however, the alibi as produced by the defendant does satisfy you or if you find that the Commonwealth has failed to convince you of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reason<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>able doubt, then your verdict must be an acquittal.’ The charge read as a whole does not offend our rules as laid down ... the judgment of the court below is affirmed ...”</p>

Some of these questions were: “Q. Do you remember when she [Mrs. Barnak] was asked, ‘Why did you leave your husband?’, and she said ‘For beating me; the day after my baby was buried, the next night, he gave me such a terrible beating and accused me of killing the child.’?” Barnak remembered these allegations. He was asked if he remembered that his wife testified, “We lived together from October until November, and then he knocked me out a number of times when I was carrying my first baby and I had to be moved; so 1 went to my mother’s home and I called in Dr. Bachman, and Dr. Bachman told me to stay in bed the rest of my time of pregnancy.” Barnak remembered that she had made these allegations. The District Attorney asked: “Do you remember, in that habeas corpus proceeding, this question — ‘Did he physically abuse you otherwise by beatings?’ Her answer, ‘All of the time I had beatings’.” Barnak remembered these allegations. In his trial for <em>murder </em>he denied them but the District Attorney showed that in the <em>habeas corpus hearing </em>Barnak did not deny any of his wife’s testimony concerning his use of physical violence against her.

In the latter case, the accused was not a party to any litigation trying in court when allegations were made against him which he did not answer. Vallone was seated in the district attorney’s office when a girl told a state policeman about Vallone’s taking her from place to place for immoral purposes. Vallone at that time was not represented by counsel and he apparently deemed it prudent to say nothing, in the absence of his counsel. In the instant-case when Barnak and his wife were litigating in habeas corpus proceedings, the question whether or not he was a fit person for the custody of his and his wife’s children was <em>the fact in issue </em>and she made accusations showing that he was totally unfit. His failure to answer charges such as any normal man would answer under like circumstances if the charges were not true, <em>was </em>evidence which tended to prove those charges. When Barnak was tried for a murder which took place only 10 days after the habeas corpus proceedings and which was obviously motivated by hatred and revenge and when in that trial for murder he <em>asserted </em>his love for his wife, it was the district attorney’s duty to show the defendant’s silence in the face of that wife’s then recent allegations as to his ill-will and malice toward her. The court in refusing a new <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>trial in this case correctly stated: “. . . it was obvious that the motive for the slaying related to Madeline Barnak and not to Bowman.

The situation that night was favorable for the assassin’s identification; it was a moonlight night; an arc light was shining about 15 feet above the murderer’s head; the lights from the taxicab were turned on the murderer; the snow on the ground helped visibility. It was inconceivable that any other person than Barnak had any motive for killing Mrs. Barnak and her escort. Barnak admitted on the witness stand that he had threatened to “beat up” any person who “goes with his wife.” Barnak was identified as the man who had been prowling recently at night in the neighborhood of the house where his wife resided.

To leave Pitea’s store and go to the “subway” where the murder was committed and then to go to the spot where Delfino placed the revolver and to return to the store, he would have to travel a distance of four fifths of a mile. A witness twenty-nine years of age who traveled this route of four fifths of a mile at an “ordinary rapid gait, such as a man would use in ordinary walking,” testified that he was able to cover the entire distance and spend half a minute to a minute at the “subway” where the murder took place and return to the Pitea store, in a period of ten minutes. Pour witnesses testified that Delfino was not out of Pitea’s store “about five minutes.” When the District Attorney cross-examined these witnesses he prolonged his cross-examination so that the entire time each witness was on the stand was from eighteen to twenty minutes. The last question he then asked each of them on cross-examination was: “How long have you been on the witness stand?” Each of them answered: “About five minutes.” The District Attorney argued to the jury that the “five minutes” which the witnesses testified Delfino was <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>away from Pitea’s store was actually eighteen to twenty minutes.

      <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.9",465,[215,1603,1151,771]]]'> The charge in its entirety in this connection was as follows: “The defendant has offered another defense, what we call a positive defense, and that is the defense of alibi. An alibi, as we use it in common parlance, is an excuse that is <em>fabricated </em>to get ourselves out of a difficulty. In law it does not mean anything of the kind; in law it means a proof that the defendant was at some other place at the time the crime was committed and, being at some other place that he necessarily could not have been at the place where the crime was committed. If the Commonwealth has convinced you of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt excepting for the alibi that has been set up, then the burden of proving an alibi is on the defendant. But the burden of proving an alibi is not beyond a reasonable doubt, the burden of proving an alibi is only by a fair preponderance of the evidence, and <em>it will be for you, if you are otherwise convinced of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to tahe into consideration the defense of alibi that has been raised by the defendant.’’ </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>

    <p id="b466-6" data-blocks='[["BL_466.9",466,[263,1408,1149,484]]]'>I cannot accept the decision of the majority as a correct interpretation of the facts and law of this case. I think it the very opposite of that, and in effect a denial of the fundamental and constitutional right of defendant to a fair and impartial trial. After a thorough examination of the voluminous record in the case, I not only am in complete agreement with the dissent of Mr. Justice Jones, but am further of the opinion that a new trial should be granted defendant for the following reasons.</p>
    <p id="b466-7" data-blocks='[["BL_466.10",466,[262,1901,1149,427]],["BL_467.1",467,[209,262,1151,488]]]'>It was error for the Commonwealth to be permitted to offer evidence, over defendant’s objection, that on October 18, 1945, over two months before the fatal shooting, defendant’s wife instituted a criminal prosecution against him, even though no conviction resulted. This clearly was directly contrary to the rule enunciated by this Court in the recent case of <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/355/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="355 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="468874" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0594-01">355 Pa. 594</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="50 A.2d 342">50 A. 2d 342</a>. In that case we held that mere <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>evidence of a prior arrest, without proof of conviction, is not relevant evidence in a murder trial. There we said (pp. 597-598): “Even if it is definitely proved to a jury that a man has been arrested, of what probative value is that fact? Unless convicted, a man remains innocent and the law cannot in justice cast a shadow on his character for a mere arrest. It could not help the jury to know what manner of man the accused was, because the mere fact of an arrest does not prove or disprove anything.”</p>
    <p id="b467-3" data-blocks='[["BL_467.4",467,[215,762,1152,1032]]]'>It was error for the learned trial court to admit in evidence the record of a habeas corpus proceeding instituted by defendant for the custody of his children. “It is fundamental that no testimony is admissible unless it is relevant, i.e., unless it is of a nature to afford evidence tending to prove or to disprove the matters in issue”: <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>supra. A habeas corpus proceeding involving the custody of children is a civil action and the fact that defendant availed himself of his legal right to bring such a suit against his wife was irrelevant in this trial. The district attorney, during cross-examination of defendant, was permitted to read testimony given by defendant’s wife in that proceeding, wherein she accused him of unnatural sexual practices and other physical abuse, which accusations defendant had denied. The total effect was extremely harmful to defendant, because while being tried for the murder of Bowman, he was called on to defend himself against collateral issues of a highly inflammatory and prejudicial nature.</p>

Although they were found near the scene of the crime no testimony connected them in any way with the bullets found in the victims’ bodies or with defendant. The admission of this evidence was prejudicial to the defense. .</p>
