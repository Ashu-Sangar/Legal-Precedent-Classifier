Suit was instituted by the administrator of the decedent and by his father and mother against the City charging the negligent operation of the vehicle. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiffs, which the court set aside by its judgment for defendant n. o. v.</p>

Locust Street was a west-bound one-way street. It is 34 feet wide from curb to curb and there is a 3 per cent upgrade westward between 43rd and 44th Streets. On that afternoon the street was wet, but not frozen. The vehicle involved was a combination tractor and trailer with automotive power. When coupled together it was 44 feet 6 inches long. The tractor was 7 feet 8 inches wide and the trailer 7 feet 10 inches in width. There is no allegation or evidence of mechanical defects in the vehicle or that it was driven at an excessive speed or in violation of trafile regulations. No objects were projecting from its side or rear.</p>

The boys skated from the building to the curb. Because the sidewalk was littered and the middle of the street was clear, the boys decided to skate in the middle of the street. They stepped down from the curb and started to “trudge” westward on Locust Street about one foot south and parallel with the curb. At this <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>timé the vehicle was proceeding northward on 43rd Street and turned westward into Locust Street on the north side of the street. The boys observed the vehicle as it came north on 43rd Street and made the turn into Locust Street and while it was proceeding west on Locust Street. In the street, as above indicated, decedent was about 8 feet in front of his companion de Haas. The boys stood still in front of 4305 Locust Street to permit the vehicle to pass them. The vehicle was passing the boys about one foot south of. them. While the vehicle was passing both boys started to walk or “trudge” westward. The entire vehicle passed the companion de Haas. The tractor and most of the trailer passed decedent, when the vehicle turned “slightly” toward the southwest, i. e. to the left and away from decedent. The movement was made to pass a horse and wagon standing on the north side of Locust Street, along the curb. At or about that time the trailer, about 8 feet from the rear, came in contact with decedent who fell under the wheels and was run over. It was testified by de Haas that the slight turn by the tractor caused the rear of the trailer to “sway”, which occasioned the accident.</p>
    <p id="b411-4" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[232,1470,1147,544]]]'>The witness described what he meant by “swaying.” On cross examination he.was asked: “Q. It did not skid or slide over to strike (decedent) did it? A. I didn’t watch it that closely, but . I know it swayed. Q. The vehicle just sort of rocked a little from side to side? You have used the word “swayed” — is that it? A. I guess that is what swayed means. As it came over, as it struck (decedent), it moved quite a distance, I know, and'maybe you would call that skidded. <em>By the Court: </em>Q. Well, you might call it swinging? A. Yes, it swung.”</p>

There a pedestrian was struck by iron pipes projecting from a speeding truck. The accident is described by Justice Kephart (later Chief Justice), at page 202: “As plaintiff came to the curb she stepped down two feet, and waited for the truck to pass. The truck pulled out of the car tracks to get around a street car, and then swung back toward the tracks. This caused a fan-like motion of the pipes in the rear of the trailer, with the projection out two feet as a hook; <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>its movement was like the swinging of a scythe, mowing down objects in the way.

The car then turned away from the boy causing him to fall upon or against it to his injury. Such a situation is wholly different from the facts here presented.</p>

The fact is that the defendant’s causative fault in the premises appears with a greater certainty than is ordinarily to be found in accident cases. That certainty logically results from applying to the facts, to which the plaintiffs are now entitled, the rule of law which prescribes that it is the duty of an operator of a modern <em>tractor-trailer </em>on a public highway to be mindful <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>of the safety not only of those in front of him (in the direction of his travel) but also of those who may come within “the zone of apprehensible danger” along the sides of the trailer, i.&amp;, “within the swinging, swaying or swerving radius of the trailer”, — a condition Avhich is especially pronounced on. wet or icy roads and streets: <em>Dorris v.

The opinion for this court advances no other reason for denying plaintiffs their right to recover. I am wholly at a loss to understand Iioav the duty of an operator of a present day tractor-trailer can possibly be so narrowly restricted. In our own pertinent decision in <em>Dorris v. Bridgman &amp; Co., </em>supra, Mr. Justice Kephart laid down Avhat seems to me to be the reasonable and obviously necessary rule that “Where a truck <em>and trailer </em>travel on a highway, <em>the zone of apprehensible danger </em>includes not only objects immediately in front, but such objects as may come within <em>the swinging, swaying or swerving radius of the trailer”. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>

Actually, the length of the radius afforded by the pivoted trailer in the instant case was seven feet longer than the radius of the trailer <em>and </em>the extended pipe .in the <em>Dorris </em>case. Even so, improper loading was only one of two independent elements making for the defendant’s negligence in the <em>Dorris </em>ease. The other element, viz., the defendant’s negligent operation, of the tractor-trailer furnishes the rule pertinent to the facts of this case. The principle <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>here applicable is implicit in the <em>Dorris </em>decision which plainly recognizes the possibility of negligence in “the operation of [a] truck and trailer” to be derived from the side movement of the trailer when sufficient to cause injury to a pedestrian standing nearby but out of the vehicle’s normal line of travel.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[218,591,1152,1782]],["BL_416.1",416,[273,270,1149,1061]]]'>This development in the law of negligence, as thus recognized by Mr. Justice Kephart in the <em>Dorris </em>case, is but an illustration of the natural growth of tort law which of necessity resides in court decisions. Because of the relative standard for determining the existence of negligence, the decisional rules for testing whether the care required in a given instance has been exercised must necessarily be altered at least to the extent of adapting them to the changing circumstances of modern transportation and communication. That the advent of the tractor-trailer, originating from the development and expansion of business, has resulted in the greater use of public highways and that the hazards to which the ordinary person must expose himself daily in his use of the highways have been thus greatly increased are facts self-evident and were understandingly so recognized in the <em>Dorris </em>case. A tractor-trailer in combination is not rigid, as an operating unit, like a truck which, on a single chassis, with front and rear wheel contacts with the highway, constitutes the entire automotive vehicle. The nature of the fastening device of a tractor-trailer enhances its very danger by increasing the potential swing or sway and therefore necessitates utilization of a greater highway space. The immensity of these vehicles (likened to a train running down the street by Mr. Justice Kephart) adds further to the incident dangers. Indeed, it has been recognized by this court that the bulky dimensions of these cumbersome vehicles is a pertinent factor to be considered in the determination of care in their operation, because their length and width may be among the conditions and circumstances attending the alleged negligent act charged. In this connection Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Maxey pertinently ob<a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>served in <em>Nevin Bus Line, Inc. v. Hostetter Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/305/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="305 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1134634" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0072-01">305 Pa. 72</a>, 78, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.%20872" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="155 A. 872">155 A. 872</a>, “The jury had a right to consider this excessive width, [viz., eight feet] not for the purpose of convicting the defendant of violating the provisions of the Vehicle Code relating to the width of trailers, but for the purpose of considering that fact with the other evidence in the case as one of the circumstances by which the care exercised by the defendant was to be measured”. The trailer in the instant case was seven feet ten inches wide and, together with the tractor, was forty-four feet six inches long. On the not uncommon sixteen foot roads of this Commonwealth such a vehicle would occupy completely one-half of the highway exclusive of incidental swing or sway emanating from its radial movement or thrust upon being deviated from a straight line of direction, e.g., in doing no more than turning a curve or even a slight bend in the road. But, the majority opinion holds that the operator of the tractor is under no duty to consider a possible lateral movement of an attached trailer.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[270,1354,1149,907]]]'>It seems not unreasonable to suggest, as the <em>Dorris </em>case envisioned, that the operator of a tractor-trailer owes a duty to persons coming within the zone of apprehensible danger along the side of the trailer due to the operator’s sudden deviation from the line of travel. Here, for the asserted purpose of avoiding a vehicle parked on the north side of Locust Street, the driver suddenly veered the tractor diagonally in its course,— a movement which the jury was justified in finding was the cause of the trailer’s wide swing. There is certainly no arbitrary legal standard on the basis whereof the trial court could say, as a matter of law, that the evidence did not justify a finding of negligence merely because a witness had not gone on and given his opinion that the wide swing of the trailer was due to the diagonal veering of the tractor. That matter was peculiarly for the jury.</p>

Craighill, </em>at most a per curiam affirmance of a judgment n. o. v. for the defendant, is readily distinguishable on its facts, — the distinguishing feature being that the injured pedestrian in that case, when last observable by the driver of the truck, was in a place of safety and moving away from the truck. The judgment n. o. v. for the defendant, there entered, is logically explainable on the basis of the pedestrian’s contributory negligence which is not involved here. In passing, it may also be noted that the <em>Dorris, </em>decision likewise distinguished and thereupon disregarded the <em>Craighill </em>case. The advent of a new era of tremendously increased vehicular traffic with its large trucks and buses and huge tractor-trailers and the consequent complexity of modern driving renders <em>Osterheldt v. Peoples, </em>involving a horse and wagon accident of 1902, practically useless as a guiding principle to the situation presented by the facts of the instant case. More in line with the facts and circumstances here present is the case of <em>Clark v. Philadelphia Transportation Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/156/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="156 Pa.

In that case it was recognized that the swerve and sidewise sagging of a bus, as well as the play in.the springs under the force of a sudden turn, may be so great as to cause the body of the bus to extend over the curb line and thus become the proximate cause of injury to a person standing on Hie sidewalk. No further showing of negligence in the operation of the bus was required to support a verdict for the injured person in the <em>Clark </em>case. The fact that Conrad Header and his companion were standing in the cartAvay did not serve to render the defendant immune from liability for the negligence of the tractor’s operator Avho was aAvare of their presence at the side of the trailer.
