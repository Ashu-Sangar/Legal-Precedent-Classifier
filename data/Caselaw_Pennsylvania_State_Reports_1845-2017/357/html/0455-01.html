His services were satisfactory and he was paid the agreed compensation. In October 1944, Dickerson contemplated sending Broder to South America on a second trip when it was discovered that Broder had breached his agreement to render service <em>exclusively </em>to Dickerson. It was disclosed that Broder had entered into an agreement with a competitor company, in which Broder was interested, to be its exclusive sales agent in South America; also that Brodei had been marketing one of his own inventions to increase power of gasoline and had, in addition, been employed by a chemical company to survey chemical industries in South America. Broder admitted his violations of the agreement but excused himself because he was indebted to the majority stockholder of the competitor corporation in the sum of $10,000 and was unable to repay his indebtedness. Dickerson was desirous of continuing the employment but was insistent that Broder should serve him <em>exclusively. </em>He required an “iron clad” agreement, with provisions for his protection, in the event that Broder again violated his agreement.</p>

Dickerson agreed to pay off the indebtedness of 'Broder, who in turn agreed forthwith to relinquish all other outside business activities.

What they proposed to do was to set up on Dickerson’s books fictitious expense payments aggregating $10,000, which, in effect, would transfer Dickerson’s payment of Broder’s indebtedness to a <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>Federal income tax allowance. Apparently realizing the irregularity of such fictitious procedure, and as a cautionary measure against Federal civil or criminal liability, the' <em>agreement was made conditional upon its approval by Dickerson’s Washington tax lawyer.</em>

Compensation was fixed at 6% on the gross sales in 1944 and thereafter until the contract was terminated. <em>However, on the date of the actual execution of this agreement, December 31,1944, Broder had already performed all his services for that fiscal year and had already been paid in full. It was shown that 6% of the gross sales from July 24, 1944 until December 31,1944, amounted to the $10,000 indebtedness plus the compensation Broder had already received. </em>It is thus readily discernible that if such a nefarious device had been approved by the tax expert and passed by the Federal Income Tax Department, it would have resulted in Dickerson passing the payment of Broder’s indebtedness over to the United States Government as an expense allowance and leaving the parties in the same position as they were before.</p>

Did the agent and the insured <em>intend </em>the former’s manual delivery of the policy to the latter, to be an absolute delivery and acceptance? The answer to this is to be found not only in what was <em>done </em>but in what was <em>said. </em>What was merely done being not conclusive of the issue, what words accompanied the deeds of manual delivery and acceptance, respectively, become important. These deeds <em>unaccompanied by words </em>would indicate an absolute delivery and acceptance.

In other words, it pulls itself up by its own bootstraps — it commences its reasoning with the conclusion as its premise.
