Defendant is an unregistered foreign corporation in the business of the manufacture and sale of optical lenses and optical machinery. Its manufacturing plant and home office is located at Columbus, Ohio. Prior to May 26, 1943, plaintiff had been a territorial sales representative of defendant and had maintained his OAvn office in Philadelphia. By the <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>terms of the written agreement plaintiff was employed by defendant “in the capacity of Assistant to the General Manager, with direct responsibility for all Government contracts; and procurement of vital materials used in production; and. any other matters needing special attention; under the direction of the General Manager.” Plaintiff’s compensation was fixed “on the basis of total net sales, at the rate of 1%.”</p>

Incidental office expenses were paid through a petty cash fund set up and maintained by defendant. While all of the activities of plaintiff beyond the mere solicitation of business need not be enumerated, among them appear: that plaintiff estimated on and attended to the delivery of machinery to the Frankford Arsenal, including inquiries and complaints relative thereto; he disposed of lenses from his office to customers serviced by him and said sales were invoiced by his office direct to the customer; he was charged with the procurement of equipment and priorities for defendant corporation; he adjusted all rejects from the payments due the corporation from the Frankford Arsenal; he assisted in the collection of overdue accounts; he was charged with the handling of the corporation’s advertising from May, 1943, to October, 1944; when “rush orders” needed to be filled, they were filled from the stock plaintiff kept on hand at the Philadelphia office; payments for orders were sent either direct to the home office or were given to plaintiff, who <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>forwarded them through the Philadelphia office. In December, 1945, besides working on a Certificate of Necessity for the purchase of a new building for the Columbus office, plaintiff was engaged in matters pertaining to termination of war contracts at the Frank-ford Arsenal, and in sales promotion of peacetime articles not yet being manufactured. All such activities were carried out through the Philadelphia office and were <em>continuous, systematic and habitual. </em>Plaintiff’s activities at the time of service of process, December 14,1945, although considerably reduced following the conclusion of the war, were substantially the same as they had previously been. It was not until four days after service of process that defendant mailed a letter to plaintiff, advising him that “as of December 31, 1945” commission credits would cease and the territory handled by plaintiff would be handled as factory business.</p>
