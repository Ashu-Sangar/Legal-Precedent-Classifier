Lebanon and partly in the Twentieth Ward of the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny Co., Pennsylvania. The grantees named therein were his children, Mazie B. Schaefer, Robert J. M. Jones and Walter D. Jones, appellants in the present case. The real property consisted of 50 unimproved lots valued at about $300 each and 2 improved lots upon which were erected a <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>duplex valued at approximately $9,000, with a monthly rental of $75, and a bungalow valued at approximately $7,000, with a monthly rental of $74.50.

The defendants on or about the same date procured plaintiff’s signature on Traveler’s Checks of the Mellon National Bank totaling approximately $150, cashed the checks and retained possession of the money therefrom and retained possession of all of his United States Savings Bonds amounting to $1200.

That night plaintiff failed to return home and nothing was known of his whereabouts until December 26th when his son Robert, through a Christmas card addressed to plaintiff, Avas able to locate him in the room of a friend, Mrs. Mary Scaris, with whom he had been staying since December 24th. Mrs. Scaris Avas a roomer in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Chubarov at 1300 Hartwell St., West-wood, Pittsburgh, and Avas very friendly with plaintiff.

Dr. O’Neill testified that on December 31st plaintiff’s condition was “considerably worse” and “he had symptoms of bronchial pneumonia” and he “wasn’t totally rational”. “He wouldn’t follow instructions. He wouldn’t stay in bed and he talked in a manner that wasn’t wholly sensible.” Plaintiff also had an auricular fibrillation (irregular heart beat). On January 3rd and 5th, plaintiff was still irrational and the condition of Ms bronchial pneumonia and heart remained the same. His answers to the doctor “weren’t sensible answers” and he was also somewhat “hard of hearing”. As to the patient’s impaired hearing, Dr. O’Neill testified: “I had to speak louder than a normal tone of voice”. Dr. O’Neill, when cross-examined as to his January 9th visit, stated that plaintiff “was improving at that time”; he was “not totally rational, but he showed definite improvement”. He said that on January 12th the patient’s condition was much improved. The doctor testified: “I was real surprised how much better he was”. “He understood what I told him regarding medical matters”. The physician then was asked if his patient “had his full faculties at that time”. He answered: “He seemed to have.” “That time” was January 12, 1946, five days before Jones executed the challenged deed and checks. He did not see Jones again until after the 19th. He described his condition then as being “about average for his age”. Jones had no trained nurse in attendance but his son and daughter-in-law took care of him.</p>

So, he asked me to get things straightened up, that he wanted to pay his taxes again, and he wanted to turn the deed over to us to have the deed written up for the three of us and he told me to get his check book, his bank books, out of the drawer and for the West End Bank he signed a check for $130 made out to my brother and I, and he signed the tax check and he signed the traveler’s checks and he signed the check for the $130 made out to my brother and I, and he signed the tax check and he signed the traveler’s checks and he signed the check for the First National Bank on the North Side.” She was asked: “At the time he signed them what conversation did you have?” She replied: “he said . . . he was getting too old to take care of them [the properties] and he wanted us children to have them.” “Q. Was there anything said as to the amounts of his money or accounts? A. Yes. He seemed to know how much he had . . .” The witness said that on the 16th of January plaintiff gave her signed checks drawing out money from Ms accounts and transferring the account from the First National Bank of Pittsburgh, Federal Street Branch, to an account in the joint names of Robert and herself. The witness further stated that a new deed was made in accordance with her father’s instructions by defense counsel, Mr. Pratt, that “I [Witness] took it up and showed it to my father and ... he looked at it and he read it and I asked him then if it would .be all right to get a Notary. That was in the early evening [January 17th].

I told him, ‘Why certainly.’ So, I went down to Robert Jones’s house. I didn’t know what it was all about. So, he was telling me the story of what it was about. Of course, his dad had been sick. He was still upstairs but he had been feeling much better then and Bob says . . . but Bob showed me a Will that Mr. William H. Jones had made out. He told me he desired that the children should have everything and in case anything should happen to them he would like to have everything split up as close as they could. ... So, we went upstairs and Mr. William H. Jones rvas sitting up there and the Notary read the deed off to him and he wanted him to sign it and he says yes, he would. He says, ‘Well, do you know what you are signing?’ He says yes, he knows he is signing a deed; that he didn’t want to be bothered any more; that it was too much work for him; that he couldn’t take care of it, and of course, he signed his name. He wasn’t going to sign it the way the notary wanted him to. He Avanted to abbreviate the ‘William’ and the notary insistéd that he Avrite ‘William’ out in full. He says, ‘No, I always did sign my name “Wm” ’, but in this case the Notary told him it Avould have to be ‘William H.’ So, he wrote it out that Avay and, of course, I witnessed the signature and the rest of them Avent downstairs.” The will referred to in the witness’ testimony Avas one executed by plaintiff on.

Plaintiff testified that he demanded the return to him of his moneys and other personal property and that this demand was refused. On April 2,1946 he filed a bill in equity. When questioned about his signature on the various checks and on the deed, he repeated “I must have signed it when I was out of my mind.” On February 21, 1947, plaintiff entered into an Agreement of Trust with the Peoples First National Bank and Trust Company of Pittsburgh, substituted plaintiff, conveying his right, title and interest in his real and personal property to the latter. On March 14,1947, plaintiff died and his trustee was therefore substituted as plaintiff in this action. The court decreed on April 2,1947, that the deed in question was null and void and should be set aside and the transfer from plaintiff to defendants of the sum of $2065.39 (not $2740.70, the amount incorrectly set forth in plaintiff’s bill) was obtained by fraud, undue influence, etc., and was null and void and defendants should be required to return to the substituted plaintiff all and every part of said money.</p>

They said they agreed to collect the rents and turn them over to the plaintiff, although no reservation to that effect was incorporated in the deed, and in fact they did collect the rents and turn them over to their father.

With respect to the United States Savings Bonds, plaintiff admitted that he had entrusted them to his daughter Mazie for safekeeping in her safe deposit <em>box; </em>that an equal share was made out in the joint names of plaintiff and each of the defendants. The defendants, at the time of the trial, surrendered custody of the bonds and relinquished them to the plaintiff. Throughout the trial defendants freely acknowledged their participation in the preparation of the instruments in question, admitting all facts with regard thereto, and disclosed that the moneys transferred were, during the pendency of the action, still on deposit in their account. There was no attempt at concealment by them and the record is barren of any evidence of coercion, deception, or any imposition in any form practiced by these defendants upon their father. The defendants, particularly Walter D. Jones and Bobert J. M.

Since, as his physician testified, he “seemed to have his full faculties” on January 12, 1946 and he was then so “much better” that the doctor told him that he “didn’t think he needed to come back for another week” and since on the 19th the doctor found him “still more improved than on the previous visits” we find in this record no support for the basic findings <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>of the court below, to wit, (1) Defendants procured (on January 17,1946) the transfers of the real and personal property of plaintiff to themselves by undue influence; (2) That at the time, plaintiff was “completely subject to the directions, order and influence of those about him”. (3) Plaintiff was “unable to understand and comprehend the nature, consequences and effects of the deed, papers and documents by which the transfer was made of plaintiff’s real and personal property to the said defendants” and (4) “said deed and transfers were fraudulently procured from plaintiff by defendants.”</p>

Jones’ age and the fact that he was suffering from a “kidney disturbance” and from an “enlargement of one of the glands of his body” and from “generalized arteriosclerosis”, he was in a legal sense, as capable of transacting business at the time he executed the documents in question as any other man would have been. The facts cited did not so reduce his mental capacity to transact business as to justify a court’s deciding that his acts at the time can be given no legal effect. This court has frequently in its decisions manifested its respect for the integrity of written instruments, and such instruments are not to be set' aside except upon convincing testimony that their execution was tainted with fraud, either actual or constructive, or that the person so executing them did not have what the law considers sufficient mental capacity to do so.</p>
