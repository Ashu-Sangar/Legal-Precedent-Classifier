Trustees of the Estate of Lucy C. Carnegie, appellants in Appeal No. 118, and owners of said property, appealed to the Board of Property Assessment Appeals and Review, <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>asserting that the valuation placed upon said building was excessive. Appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County from the Board’s refusal to modify said assessment. The City of Pittsburgh, appellant in Appeal No. 116, was permitted to intervene. After hearing, the trial judge reduced the assessment of the building $133,250.00. Exceptions filed by the owners, the City of Pittsburgh, and the County of Allegheny, appellant in Appeal No. 117, were dismissed by the court <em>en banc. </em>These appeals followed.</p>

The owners contend that (1) the court below erred in considering rental value under the lease, and (2) the only property subject to taxation was the difference between the market value of the property with the lease attached, and the value of the lease itself. The appeals of the City and the County must be sustained.</p>

What, in your opinion, is the actual value of this property in the fall of 1942 without the lease on it to the Carnegie Company? A. I figure the property would have a land value of $528,000.” McDowell testified: “Q.

Mr. Abernathy, have you formulated an opinion as to the actual value of the Carnegie property in the fall of 1942, taking the property as you found it, that is, subject to the lease from the Carnegie heirs to the now Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company? A. I have. Q. What is that value? A. $950,000. Q. Now, Mr. Abernathy, if, in the fall of 1942, the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company had purchased this property from the Carnegie heirs, after that purchase, what would you have said was the fair market value or actual value of that property? ...
