        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Patterson,\nGeorge M. Dierolf, executor of the estate of Frances S. Carmany, appellant in appeal No. 178, and George M. Dierolf and Emma M. Schenck, residuary legatees under her will, appellants in appeal No. 179, filed this petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court for partition of the real estate of Jacob S. Carmany, deceased, asserting rights in and to the land by reason of his alleged intestacy as to the principal of his estate. Mary O. Forney, appellee, daughter of Jacob S. Carmany filed an answer denying appellants\u2019 interests. These appeals are from the decree of the court below dismissing the petition.\nJacob S. Carmany died testate February 1, 1931, survived by Frances E. Carmany, widow, and Mary O. Forney, a daughter by a prior marriage. His will provided, inter alia:\n\u201cItem. All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate I direct to be held in trust by my hereinafter names Executors, the income therefrom to be paid, as follows:\nAfter paying taxes and all other expenses of administration and Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($750.00) on the first days of October and April of each year, to my said wife, which sum, I hereby give devise and bequeath to her, the balance of the income shall be paid by my hereinafter named Executors to my daughter, Mary O. Forney, her heirs and assigns.\nItem. If in the opinion of my Executors, it should be to the best advantage of my estate to sell any of the real estate other than that occupied by my wife, then I order and direct that they shall sell the same and make and execute a good deed for any of the said properties. I further authorize and empower my Executors, at the request of my said wife, to sell any real estate that she has the right to occupy under this my will and to make good and sufficient deeds for the same.\nItem. I further bequeath to my said wife the sum of Five Hundred Dollars (f500.00) in personal property, to be appraised to her immediately at my death. This bequest being in lieu of the exemption allowed her by law.\u201d\nProvision was also made whereby the widow had, for the term of her life or widowhood, the use and occupancy of testator\u2019s dwelling house. The executors had the right and power, upon the widow\u2019s request, to sell said real estate and pay the income therefrom to her or to repurchase a smaller home to be occupied by her during widowhood. In the latter event, the remaining proceeds of the sale were to be held in trust for the widow who was to receive the income semiannually.\nFrances E. Carmany elected to take under the will. She died testate on April 26, 1945 and by her will directed a conversion of all real estate of which she died seised. After making several minor bequests, she gave the entire residue and remainder of her estate to her brothers and sisters living at the time of her decease, appellants in appeal No. 179.\nAppellants contend that (1) the trust terminated upon the death of the widow Frances E. Carmany, and (2) there being no disposition of principal his estate passed under the intestate laws as of the date of his death vesting a one-half undivided interest in the whole in the widow and daughter. Appellee contends that the gift of income to her, \u201cher heirs and assigns\u201d, being absolute and unlimited with regard to time and amount, constituted a gift of the principal.\nOne who writes a will is presumed to intend to dispose of all his estate and not to die intestate as to any portion thereof: Provident Trust Co. of Philadelphia v. Scott, 335 Pa. 231, 6 A. 2d 814; Duffy\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa. 101, 169 A. 142; Appeal of Ferry, 102 Pa. 207; Miller\u2019s Appeal, 113 Pa. 459, 6 A. 715. If possible to do so, a will must be construed to avoid an intestacy; Rapson\u2019s Estate, 318 Pa. 587, 179 A. 436; Boland v. Miller, 100 Pa. 47. A construction is favored which will give effect to every word,, rather than one which will render some words idle and nugatory: Horn\u2019s Estate, 351 Pa. 131, 40 A. 2d 471; Dormer\u2019s Estate, 348 Pa. 356, 35 A. 2d 299. An estate favorable in quantum and enjoyment to a natural object of a testator\u2019s bounty is to be presumed rather than one which restrains free use, alienation and enjoyment: Crozer\u2019s Estate, 336 Pa. 266, 9 A. 2d 535.\nTestator\u2019s intention and the clear and primary purpose for which the trust was created, gathered from the language of the will and the surrounding circumstances, was to assure his widow a home for the balance of her widowhood and an annual income of $1500.00. During the continuation of the trust, whatever remained of the income was to be paid to the daughter. Upon death or remarriage of the widow, the entire net income was given \u201cto my daughter, Mary O. Forney, her heirs and assigns\u201d. The words of the will cannot be ignored. Giving effect to them renders inescapable the conclusion that his intention was to create a trust during the lifetime of the widow or until her remarriage and to give his entire residuary estate to his daughter. Had testator intended to create an active trust to be measured by the life of the daughter, he would have evidenced such intention by the use of the words \u201cfor life\u201d, rather than by words of inheritance. That he was cognizant of the method whereby the same could have been done is shown by his limitation of the life estate to the widow. The gift of income from Ms. residuary estate to the daughter \u201cher heirs and assigns\u201d is an irrefutable manifestation of his intention to give an estate of inheritance and not to die intestate.\nThe gift to Mary O. Forney was not only accompanied by words of inheritance but also unlimited and unrestricted as regards time, amount and conditions. An absolute gift of income without limitation of time or amount is a bequest of the corpus of the fund from which said income is derived: Thompson Trust, 348 Pa. 228, 35 A. 2d 261; Emmerich\u2019s Estate, 347 Pa. 307, 32 A. 2d 400; Bosworth\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 265, 11 A. 2d 140; Gibbons\u2019 Estate, 317 Pa. 465, 177 A. 50; McKinstry\u2019s Estate, 296 Pa. 185, 145 A. 806.\nApplication of this rule cannot be defeated or circumvented by reliance upon the power of sale given to the executors. The obvious purpose of the power was to secure to the executors, in their capacity as trustees, control of' the corpus and assure sufficient income to carry out the terms of the trust. Termination of the trust upon death of the widow ended the power. Nor do the duties of paying the \u201cbalance of the income\u201d after payment of taxes and administration expenses prevent application of the rule effecting a gift of the principal. The active duties referred to in Kline\u2019s Appeal, 117 Pa. 139, 11 A. 866, must be something more than the mere collection of income, deduction of administration expenses and payment of the remainder to the beneficiary. In every instance where income is to be given to a named beneficiary, there must be implied, if not expressed, the power of the executor to collect the same, deduct therefrom his commission and other expenses of administration, and pay the balance to said beneficiary. Cf. Bosworth\u2019s Estate, supra; McKinstry\u2019s Estate, supra. The exception referred to in Kline\u2019s Appeal, supra, is, therefore, inapplicable.\nMary O. Forney, appellee, is the owner of the entire estate of Jacob S. Carmany. The court below properly dismissed the petition for partition.\nDecree affirmed; costs to be paid by the respective appellants.",

        "text": "Me. Justice Allen M. Steaene,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part:\nI do not agree that the daughter is granted a fee in the real estate here involved. On the contrary, under the plain provisions of this will, all she receives is but a life estate. An intestacy results because of testator\u2019s failure to dispose of the remainder, which passes equally to the estates of testator\u2019s widow and the daughter.\nBecause, in either event, partition is not proper, the court below correctly dismissed the petition, and I agree that its action in so doing should be affirmed. But I am not in accord with the declaration in the majority opinion concerning the interests of the parties in the real estate and the settlement of title.\nIn a will construction courts may not speculate on what a testator may have actually intended. It is an unbroken rule of long duration that in expounding a mill the question is not what testator meant but what is the meaning of his words: Ludwick\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 365, 112 A, 543; Rosengarten Estate, 349 Pa. 32, 36 A. 2d 310; Myers Estate, 351 Pa. 472, 41 A. 2d 570; Lough-ran's Estate, 144 Pa. Superior Ct. 88, 18 A. 2d 676; Tombs Estate, 155 Pa. Superior Ct. 605, 39 A. 2d 367; Brqck Estate, 156 Pa. Superior Ct. 616, 41 A. 2d 347.\nThe words of the will requiring construction are:\n\u201cItem. All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate I direct to be held in trust by my hereinafter named Executors, the income therefrom to be paid, as follows:\n\u201cAfter paying taxes and all other expenses of administration and Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($750.00) on the first days of October and April of each year, to my said wife, which sum, I- hereby give devise and bequeath to her, the balance of the income shall be paid by my hereinafter named Executors to my daughter, Mary O. Forney, her heirs and assigns.\n\u201cItem. If in the opinion of my Executors, it should be to the best advantage of my estate to sell any of the real estate other than that occupied by my wife, then I order and direct that they shall sell the same and make and execute a good deed for any of the said properties. I further authorize and empower my Executors, at the request of my said wife, to sell any real estate that she has the right to occupy under this my will and to make good and sufficient deeds for the same.\u201d\nTestator therefore placed his residuary estate in trust, with active duties in his trustees, to pay out of the net income certain funds to his widow and only \u201cthe balance of the income\u201d to his daughter. He makes no specific disposition of the remainder. The gift to the daughter of the balance of net income was without limit of duration.\nIt is a well established canon of will construction that a devise of the rents, issues and profits of land, in the absence of anything in the will to indicate a contrary intention, passes title to the realty itself: France\u2019s Estate, 75 Pa. 220; Millard\u2019s Appeal, 87 Pa. 457; Beilstein v. Beilstein, 194 Pa. 152, 45 A. 73; Mifflin\u2019s Estate, 232 Pa. 25, 81 A. 129; McKinstry\u2019s Estate, 296 Pa. 185, 145 A. 806; Gibbons\u2019s Estate, 317 Pa. 465, 177 A. 50; Bosworth\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 265, 11 A. 2d 140; Emmerich Estate, 347 Pa. 307, 32 A. 2d 400; Thompson Trust, 348 Pa. 228, 230, 35 A. 2d 261; Estate of Henry Osborn, 88 Pa. Superior Ct. 7; Hunter\u2019s Pennsylvania Orphans\u2019 Court Commonplace Book, Vol. 1, p. 380, sections 6(a), 6(b). An examination of these cases will reveal that this fundamental canon of construction' is of ancient origin. As stated in Co. Lift. 4, 6, \u201cFor what is land but the profits thereof for thereby vesture, herbage, trees, mines, and all whatever parcel of the land doth pass.\u201d It is presumed that a devise of the rents, issues and profits of the land, without qualification or duration of time, passes the fee.\nBut as with any other canon of will construction\u2014 which is after all a declaration of presumed intent \u2014 such presumption falls in the face of language which discloses a contrary intention. Language sufficient to overcome the presumption has been defined by this Court in the Avords of Chief Justice Kephart (then Justice) in Gibbons\u2019s Estate, supra, at page 468: \u201cWhere (a) the gift is for a limited period; or if (b) the trustee has active duties to perform; or if (c) the will discloses anything to indicate a contrary intent.\u201d In the footnotes are cited cases which support the decision, and which need not be again cited.\nApplying, then, the above general rule and its exception, to the words of the present will, it is to be observed that Avhile the gift of income to the daughter Avas not for a limited time, but was without limit of duration, the trustees did have active duties to perform. They were directed to collect the gross income, and to pay therefrom the taxes and administration expenses, and to pay the net income to the widow and daughter. The trustees Avere invested with exclusive power to sell the real estate. The active duties imposed on the trustees unequivocally and conclusively rebut the presumption that the testator intended to pass a fee to the daughter. See Kline\u2019s Appeal, 117 Pa. 139, 147, 148, 11 A. 866; Bacon\u2019s Estate, 202 Pa. 535, 540, 52 A. 135; Roberts v. Hensel, 342 Pa. 314, 317, 21 A. 2d 34. See also: Deniston v. Deniston, 263 Pa. 224, 229, 106 A. 200; Schuldt v. Reading Trust Co., 270 Pa. 360, 364, 113 A. 545; Schuldt v. Reading Trust Co., 292 Pa. 327, 332, 141 A. 152.\nIn Kline\u2019s Appeal, supra, it was said: \u201cOf course, an unqualified gift of the income of land is to be taken as a gift of the land itself; but where, as in this case, that gift is qualified by a direction to, or power in, some one else to sell, it is clear that the gift must be confined to the income alone, for the intent to keep the two things separate and distinct is thus made manifest.\u201d In Bacon\u2019s Estate, supra, it was said: \u201cIt is undoubtedly true that an unqualified gift of the income of land with no remainder over is to be taken as a gift of the land itself, for so it is presumed the intent of the grantor is: . . . But where it is the manifest intent to sever the product from its source, a gift of income will not carry an estate in the principal . . . ; and where the gift is qualified by a direction to or power in some one else to sell, the gift must be confined to the income alone, for the intent to keep the two things separate and distinct is thus made manifest . . .\u201d In Roberts v. Hensel, supra, where there was a bequest in trust to pay to the testator\u2019s widow the income from his real estate, but where he gave a power of sale to the trustees, it was said: \u201cUnder the decisions referred to, testator thus clearly manifested an intention not to pass an absolute estate in these properties to the widow, but only the income therefrom for life; consequently, the technical rule of construction sought to be invoked by appellants, her heirs at law, has no application.\u201d\nFrom the foregoing analysis of the language of the will and the applicable principle of law, it is conclusive that the gift to the daughter of net income, unrestricted as to time, failed to pass the fee to her because of the active trust created. The daughter was not devised the rents, issues and profits. They were to be collected by the trustees and it was only the net income which passed to her. In addition, the trustees were given an absolute power of sale. As the daughter thus possessed but a life estate we are required to examine the words of the will to ascertain whether the testator, despite the words of the gift, indicated a contrary intent, and intended the daughter to take a fee.\nThe majority decide that an unrestricted gift of income followed by the words \u201cher heirs and assigns\u201d passes a fee. In my view this is erroneous. The words of the will, because of the creation of the trust, manifestly indicate that testator intended to create an estate for life only. It therefore follows that the presence of words of general inheritance does not enlarge the life estate into a fee: Ellet v. Paxson, 2 W. & S. 418; Coursey v. Davis, 46 Pa. 25; Urich\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 386; Wolford v. Morgenthal, 91 Pa. 30; Criswell v. Grumbling, 107 Pa. 408; Hague v. Hague, 161 Pa. 643, 29 A. 261; Ackerman v. Ackerman, 34 Pa. Superior Ct. 162; Restatement of Property, Yol. 1, section 108, comment (f). An additional indication that the use of the words \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d did not have the meaning attributed to them by the majority is evidenced in the same item of the will concerning the gift of income to the widow. No one contends that the widow possessed a fee in the corpus from which her income was derived. In her case the words were \u201cI hereby give devise and bequeath.\u201d\nThe majority, in order to fortify their conclusions that testator \u201cindicated a contrary conclusion,\u201d make this statement:\n\u201cHad testator intended to create an active trust to be measured by the life of the daughter, he would have evidenced such intention by the use of the words Tor life\u2019, rather than by words of inheritance. That he was cognizant of the method whereby the same could have been done is shown by his limitation of the life estate to the widow.\u201d\nThis is an inaccurate conclusion. If the exclusion of the words \u201cfor life\u201d always indicated that testator intended a fee, there would be no basis for the many cases herein cited supporting the canon of construction and its exceptions.\nFurthermore, the testator does not use the words \u201cfor life\u201d in the residuary clause, as respects the widow, which clause is the only item of the will requiring construction.\nTrue, in the second item of the will, testator does devise his home in \u201cMount Joy\u201d to his widow for life ox\u2019 remarriage. But the majority overlook that this property was deeded in 3913 to testator, for life, with remainder to testator\u2019s widow for life, with remainder to the executors of testator to be disposed of according to the terms of his will or under the intestate laws if he left no will. No provision of testator\u2019s will therefore granted a life estate to his widow. She already possessed that by deed.\nWhere real estate is given for life, absence of a gift over does not enlai\u2019ge the estate to a fee simple: Reynold\u2019s Estate, 175 Pa. 257, 34 A. 624; McCullough\u2019s Estate, 272 Pa. 509, 116 A. 477; Schaaf et al. v. Politowski, 276 Pa. 31, 119 A. 748; Rupp et al. v. Stevens et al., 297 Pa. 448, 147 A. 101; Nelson v. Johnson et al., 354 Pa. 512, 514, 47 A. 2d 650.\nI am not persuaded that no intestacy may be declared until all theories of construction fail. Judge Penkose of the Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court wrote in Wunder\u2019s Estate, 13 Dist. Repox\u2019ts 197, 198: \u201cWe have no right to assume that the absence of a residuary clause was an accident\u201d. While it is true that in will construction an intestacy should be avoided there is an equally potent canon of construction that an heir should not be disinhexnted except by plain words or necessax\u2019y implication: Grothe\u2019s Estate, 229 Pa. 186, 78 A. 88; Lippincott\u2019s Estate, 276 Pa. 283, 120 A. 136.\nIt may be conjectured that testator intended to give his daughter the balance of income for the lifetime of his widow, and then to have passed the fee to the daughter absolutely. The difficulty with such a construction is that the language of the will does not support it. Conjecture is not permitted to supply what testator has failed to indicate: Jacob\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 387, 22 A. 2d 744.\nThere is nothing strange or unnatural for a testator to divide equitably the net income from his estate between his widow and daughter, and by intestacy, to pass the remainder equally to the estate of his widow and daughter \u2014 especially since the wife of testator reared the daughter since her early childhood.\nWhile I concur in the dismissal of the partition petition, I dissent from the declaration and settlement of the title to the real estate as decided by the majority.\nMr. Justice Linn and Me.
