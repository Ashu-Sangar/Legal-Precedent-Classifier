Hillman Coal & Coke Co., 357 Pa. 535. While in the Poland Coal Company litigation we had two appeals, in the present case we do not have an appeal from an order refusing to set aside Eavenson\u2019s award.\nAppellant\u2019s Statement of Questions Involved presents two points: first, that the option, similar to the option considered in the Poland Coal Company case, violated the rule against perpetuities; second, that the words \u201cWe are desirous of exercising our option\u201d were not a sufficient exercise of the option.\nThe first point is sufficiently dealt with in the opinion in the Poland, Coal Company case. The second point does not merit discussion, the chancellor having found as a fact that the option had been exercised. The finding is not questioned by exception or assignment of error.\nThe decree is affirmed, costs to be paid by the appellant.",
