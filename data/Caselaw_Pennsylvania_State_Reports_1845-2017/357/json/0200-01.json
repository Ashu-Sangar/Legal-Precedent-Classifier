        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiff brought two suits against the defendant, one in assumpsit for $975,00 allegedly advanced to the defendant and the other in trespass for an assault and battery allegedly made on the plaintiff in Lancaster on June 20, 1944. Plaintiff claims that the money placed in defendant\u2019s hands was to be matched \u201cdollar for dollar\u201d by her and that after plaintiff\u2019s return from service he and she were to open a restaurant in Lancaster. According to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, he and the defendant came in contact with each other in a cocktail lounge in New York City about midnight on September 4, 1943, and a few minutes later she greeted him outside the cocktail lounge with the remarks \u201cOh gosh, sailor, am I drunk!\u201d; that she was a \u201cmilliner from Lancaster\u201d and that she had come to New York \u201cto celebrate\u201d. He then proceeded to help her \u201ccelebrate\u201d. A week later he met her in Lancaster. On September 18, 1943, he met her at the Broad Street Station in Philadelphia and he and she spent a weekend in Philadelphia. During the Philadelphia meeting, on September 20, 1943, he advanced the defendant $525.00. At that time they agreed to be married. She had told him that she had \u201cgot rid of her husband eleven years before that.\u201d He learned in April of the following year that she had not been divorced. She did, however, obtain a divorce on June 12, 1944. Plaintiff then went overseas and returned to this country on March 30, 1944. He phoned the defendant and she spent three days and three nights with him at the Times Square Hotel in New York City.\nBetween April 1st and 3rd, 1944, he gave defendant $450.00, making a total of $975.00 which he advanced to her. On April 30,1944, he came to Lancaster and found out that she had not been divorced. He said to the defendant : \u201cWhat in the hell kind of a human being are you? . . . you are not going to take me over, girl.\u201d She then promised to return the money to him. Later she came to New York and told him she \u201cwanted to patch it all up again.\u201d On June 19, 1944, she told him she would never marry him and would never return the money to him. This led to an altercation on June 20, 1944, in Lancaster. Omitting all the unsavory details of the assault and battery which took place, plaintiff claims that defendant \u201csank her teeth into his finger\u201d and said \u201cI will mark you for life.\u201d She hit him in the eye with her hand and caused it to become black and blue. Among other things she did to him physically was to grab an alarm clock and smash it into his spine, which dazed him. He said he got up and sat in a chair for about an hour.\nIn the trespass action, plaintiff sued for $11,650.00 damages. Both the action in assumpsit and trespass were tried together and verdicts were returned in favor of the defendant in both cases. Plaintiff took appeals from the judgment in both cases, and we remitted the appeal in the assumpsit case to the Superior Court because the amount involved was not within our jurisdiction. Criminal proceedings growing out of the relationships of this plaintiff and defendant and growing out of the alleged assault and battery were instituted in Lancaster County and resulted in a conviction of the defendant for fraudulent conversion and aggravated assault and battery. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court and the judgment was affirmed. See Commonwealth v. Kuhn, 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 154, 44 A. 2d 314.\nIn the paper book filed in this case covering both appeals, the appellant presented five assignments of error. The first was the order of the court below discharging the rule for a new trial and the second was the final judgment of the court below. The third has relevancy only to the action in assumpsit. The fourth assignment is based upon the refusal of the trial judge to permit Gertrude O\u2019Brien, a witness called by the plaintiff, to testify that the records of Hotel Adelphia, Philadelphia, indicated that the defendant was not registered at that hotel on September 18 and 19, 1943. Defendant had testified that she had registered at that hotel on those two days. The court ruled that it was necessary for the witness to produce the records of the hotel for those two days in order 'to prove the absence of the defendant from the hotel at that time or it was necessary for the witness to show that the records were either lost or too cumbersome to produce in court or were otherwise unavailable. This was not done and the evidence was rejected. This rejection for these reasons was not error. The testimony was offered to impeach the credibility of the witness on a collateral matter. This would also have been a valid reason for the refusal of the offer. In Commonwealth v. Petrillo, 341 Pa. 209, 19 A. 2d 288, we held: \u201cNo witness can be contradicted on everything he testifies to in order to \u2018test his credibility.\u2019 The pivotal issues in a trial cannot be \u2018side-tracked\u2019 for the determination of whether or not a witness lied in making a statement about something which had no relationship to the case on trial. The purpose of trials is not to determine the ratings of witnesses for general veracity. A witness can be contradicted only on matters germane to the issue trying. There is no rule more firmly established than this: \u2018No contradiction shall be permitted on collateral matters.\u2019 \u201d\nThe fifth assignment of error was the offer on the part of the plaintiff \u201cto prove the record of conviction of Irma K. Kuhn, for the sole purpose of impeaching her credibility.\u201d It should be noted that no particular criminal offense was named in the offer, and to that extent the offer was inadequate. Furthermore, even if it had been properly made the offer would have to be rejected under the authority of Nowak v. Orange, 349 Pa. 217, 36 A. 2d 781, where we held that in a civil action to recover damages for assault and battery, the record of defendant\u2019s conviction in a criminal court on the same charge of assault and battery against the prosecutor is not admissible.\nThe assignments of error are overruled; the judgment is affirmed.",
