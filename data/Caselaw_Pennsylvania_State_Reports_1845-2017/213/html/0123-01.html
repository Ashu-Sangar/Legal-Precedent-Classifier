In an opinion and decree of this court on its law side, filed on June 22, 1904, to 61 August Term, 1904, it was adjudged that the cost of roads constructed under the act of 1895 might legally exceed the estimate submitted to the grand jury, if no fraud was practiced upon the grand jury and the engineer was honestly mistaken in his estimate.
