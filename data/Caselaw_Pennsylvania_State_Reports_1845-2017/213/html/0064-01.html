It was also provided that at the time and place the members of the party met to elect delegates to the convention, they should also “elect a member of the county committee for such district, for the ensuing year.” Another rule provided that “the affairs of the party shall be managed by a county, committee elected as aforesaid.” The delegate elections were not held at any set date, but at “such time and place as may be fixed by the county committee.” From the rules generally considered it appeared that the whole party machinery of party elections was centered in and to a large extent dependent upon the initiatory action of the county committee for the county and the committeeman for his district. <em>Held, </em>that the words “ensuing year” used in the rule relating to the election of the county committee, did not mean the calendar year, but did mean the political year, that is, the interval between one election and the next annual election which might be more or less than twelve calendar months.</p>

By rule <em>4 </em>the primaries or delegate elections are to be held on the Saturday next before the nominating conventions, and the electors are then to elect delegates to represent them in the nominating convention, and “at the same time, and place they shall elect a member of the county committee for such district for the ensuing yea'r.” The learned president judge of the court below in his second finding held that the term of the committee duly elected, as is conceded, on March 18, 1904, expired on March 18, 1905, and the committee became functus officio on that day except the chairman, secretaries and treasurer, who held over under rule 5 till their successors should be appointed. This part of the finding is a conclusion of law based on the interpretation of the phrase, “ for the ensuing year,” in rule 4, and was an erroneous con<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>struction of the rule. The “ ensuing year ” meant by the rule was not the calendar but the political year, that is, the interval between one election and the next annual election, which might be tnore or less than twelve calendar months. The delegate elections are not held at any set date, but at “ such time and place as may be fixed by the county committee.” (Rule 3.) The time is in the discretion of the committee, and it is common knowledge that it varies in different years, according to the exigencies or convenience of each year. Thus in the years of election of the president, or the governor, or other state officers, the date of county conventions is largely dependent on the date of the national or state conventions, while in years of election of county officers only the date is governed by local convenience. If a county election and convention should be held, as it often is, in August of one year and another in March in the next year, the new committee would come into power at once and the term of the prior committee would end, though it had lasted only seven months, and vice versa, the term of a committee elected in March might extend to August of the following year and thus cover seventeen months, if the date of the primary election should be so fixed.</p>

By rule 3 the time and place of the county convention are to bo fixed by the committee; by rule 4, on the Saturday before such date the electors are to assemble at the usual place of holding delegate elections, “ or at such place as shall be designated by the members of the county committee for the respective district,” and the committeeman shall call the assembly to order, and they shall then proceed to elect a judge and two inspectors, and to hold the election ; and by rule 6 “the county committeeman of each district shall be the executive officer thereof.” It thus appears that the whole party machinery of party elections is centered, and to a large extent dependent, on the initiatory action of the county committee for the county and of the committeeman for his district. If the whole committee is liable to become officially dead at a fixed date of exactly a calendar year after their election, then the whole organization is in danger of being thrown into inex<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>tricable confusion by the accidental or intentional or factional failure by the old committee to fix a date for the election of a new committee before the expiration of their own year. The party will be helpless to proceed regularly under its own rules, for there will be no one with authority to make the calls or start the proceedings. It is impossible to suppose that the party in framing its rules meant to subject itself to such obvious risks. But, on the other hand, if the “ ensuing year ” was intended, as it must have been, to mean the political year, there is full provision for an organization always in existence ready for regular party action under the rules.</p>

Under rule 4 the two elections are to be held at the same time and place, but they are separate elections and involve separate rights of the electors. The rule <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>requires the election for committeemen to be held at the time and place fixed by the committee, but it clearly contemplates an election each political year, and if the electors should see or suspect a design on the part of the committee to postpone a new election for the perpetuation of their own power or other unlawful or insufficient reason, mandamus would lie to compel the committee to act.

And without conceding that the record proper in this case contains sufficient to give us jurisdiction to inquire into the merits of the question, we are clearly of the opinion that under a reasonable construction of the party rules the terms of the county committee men elected in March, 1904, expired at the time fixed for holding the meeting in April, 1905, to elect members for the then ensuing year.</p>
    <p id="b105-8" data-blocks='[["BL_105.8",105,[159,1946,1184,459]],["BL_106.1",106,[273,329,1196,1133]]]'>Apparently no other construction than this, occurred to the mind of any one connected with the county committee, and the chairman showed that he so construed and understood the rule, by his action in attempting to appoint the members of an entire new committee to act from that date. It is suggested for the first time, in the opinion of the majority of this court, that the terms of the old committeemen were not limited to the ensuing year after their election, but, that they continued in office indefinitely, owing to the failure of a <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>convention to elect their successors in April, 1905. With this view we cannot agree. Rule 4 provides “ that on the Saturday next before the time for holding the nominating convention, the republicans of the respective districts .... shall elect a member of the county committee for such district for the ensuing year.” In the present instance the time designated by the chairman for holding the convention was April 18, 1905, and the Saturday before was April 15, so that under the rule, the term of the committeemen elected for the previous year ended at that time. And the chairman so understood it and appointed new .committeemen under his claim of right to fill vacancies. It was this action which the court below held was unauthorized and illegal and we think the view taken by the court in this respect was right. Clearly under the rules the county committee was an elective body to be chosen by the people of the districts, to serve only for the ensuing political year. The power of the chairman to fill vacancies extended only to such as occurred in the elective body, and during the current year. We can see no power given to him by the rules to appoint an entirely new committee, without submitting the choice of- the membership to the votes of the people of the respective districts at the time fixed, under rule 4.</p>
