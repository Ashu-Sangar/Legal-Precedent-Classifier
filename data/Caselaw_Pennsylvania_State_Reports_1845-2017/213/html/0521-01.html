By it the improvement was authorized and the director of the department of public works was instructed- to prepare specifications and advertise for proposals, and the committee on public works to report an ordinance awarding the contract. This power was not exercised by the committee, but by the recorder and director of public works, and it seems plain that the irregularity in the letting of the contract occurred through the confusion incident to the radical change in the law of the municipality by the acts of assembly, and we think the city could waive such irregularity. It having the power to make the contract, it has also the power to adopt the contract that has been made for it by its agent, even if made irregularly, and it seems plain that the city, by its subsequent acts, has fully adopted this contract. It accepted the work. It issued a final estimate to the contractor. It issued bonds to raise money with which to pay the contractor. It paid the contractor. It instituted these proceedings to collect the cost of the improvement from the abutting property holders. These acts constitute a complete adoption of the contract, taking the place of a prior ordinance for its letting.</p>
