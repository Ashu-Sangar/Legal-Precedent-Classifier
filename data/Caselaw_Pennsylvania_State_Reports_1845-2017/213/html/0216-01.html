    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[245,427,1187,510]]]'>The court regarded the transaction as a pledge of the stock for a loan by defendant to plaintiff and this is probably the correct view of what the parties intended, though no agreement of plaintiff to pay is specifically found, and some doubt, therefore, might have arisen as to his obligation for the balance of the debt had the stock been sold without bringing enough to pay the advance in full. But this question is not material, as the transaction, if not a pledge of collateral for a debt, was clearly a conditional sale of the stock, i. e., a sale with an option in the vendor to repurchase on specified terms.</p>
