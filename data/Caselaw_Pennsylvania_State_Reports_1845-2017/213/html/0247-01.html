Thomas Lilley, the plaintiff, is the owner of a tract of land in East Pike Run township, in this county, containing 232 acres more or less, over which the Pittsburg, Virginia and Charleston Railway Company, the defendant, in the year 1876 (or near that time) constructed its railroad and has ever since operated the same. The ground occupied by the defendant company as a right of way for the track of its road in 1876 over this farm — for a valuable consideration — was “ granted, bargained, sold and conveyed ” to it by the father of the plaintiff who then owned the farm, and the plaintiff took title to the farm subject to the defendant company’s easement thus conveyed to it. The defendant’s way, as described in said conveyance, was sixty feet “ in width at grade and such additional width as may be required and necessary in the construction of said road at cuttings and embankments to make sixty feet wide at grade and extending in length as far as the said road may pass over ” said farm. In the writing dated April 12, 1876, in which this^ grant is made, the then owner of the farm also released any claim for damages in these words: “ and I hereby for myself, my heirs and assigns release the said Pitts-burg, Virginia and Charleston Railway Company from any and all damages resulting'to me by the location and construction of said railway through my said land provided said railway company pay me before they enter on said land the further sum of $260 (that is in addition to the sum paid for the grant of the right way) and make cattle guards at each end of my line where it is now enclosed and do not damage my springs and give' me at least five wagon roads under their track or at <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>grade through my farm and remove any buildings at their own expense.”</p>

It is clear, we think, that this is a severable and not an entire contract. The clause relating to the damages and the wagon roads across the tracks to be given Mr. Lilley maybe omitted from the contract and still the grant of the right of way will have a valuable consideration to support it and be enforceable against the grantor. The conveyance is complete without this clause, and vests in the railroad company the easement through the farm of Mr. Lilley. The only plausible theory, and the correct interpretation of the contract, therefore, is that suggested by the trial judge that the release of damages was intended to release the railway company from any damages which, by the construction of the railroad, might result to that part of the farm outside the right of way. These damages may have been released by the grant of the easement, as has been held in some jurisdictions, but the parties thought the release necessary to relieve the company from damages and for that reason it was inserted in the conveyance. Following the release is the proviso, the several matters in which clearly constitute the consideration for the execution of the release and not, as claimed by the plaintiff, for the grant of the right of way. The contract did not provide that the $250.00 should be paid, the cattle guards should bo constructed, and the company should give Mr. Lilley the wagon roads over its tracks as a consideration for the conveyance of the right of way, but, on the contrary, it expressly sets forth that the grant of the right of way was made “for and in consideration of the benefits and advantages to me from the construction of its railway through my land.” The money to be paid and the acts to be done, as required in the proviso, must, therefore, bo regarded as the consideration for the release of damages for injuries done the plaintiff’s farm outside the appropriation for the right of way for the construction of the defendant’s road.</p>

L. 12 : 2 Purd. 1798. The crossings were easements or private rights of way and as such may be taken by the company under the <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>statute. In doing so the defendant is not repudiating or rescinding the contract of April 12, 1876, as contended by tbe learned counsel for the plaintiff, but simply appropriating for its legitimate use the property of the plaintiff in accordance with the laws of the state.</p>

In that case it is said by Rice, P.
