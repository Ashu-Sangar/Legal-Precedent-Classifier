    <p class="syllabus" id="b195-10" data-blocks='[["BL_195.8",195,[147,1351,1182,897]]]'>An owner of a mill deposited with a trust company a deed for his property, in escrow. By the terms of the escrow agreement he was to receive money and stock of a corporation, which was to take title to the property. Subsequently he was notified that the option in the escrow agreement had been exercised. The trust company delivered the deed to the purchaser, and forwarded the money and stocks to the grantor who receipted for them. About the same time the grantor executed a lease whereby he covenanted to operate the mill for a period of sixty days as lessee. Both before and after the receipt of the cash and stocks he stated at different times and to different persons that he was in possession of the property as a tenant under the lease, and after the organization of the corporation he acknowledged his liability for rent to the company. After the delivery of the deed the company executed a mortgage on all its property, of which the grantor had notice. On a subsequent default the mortgage was foreclosed, and the properties were sold. In an action of ejectment by a purchaser at the foreclosure sale against the grantor in the deed to recover the mill, the grantor maintained that no title had passed from him because of the failure of the trust company to see that certain other conditions of the escrow agreement had been complied with. He also offered evidence that at the foreclosure sale he had given public notice of his claim of title. <em>Held, </em>that the court committed no error in giving binding instructions for plaintiff in the ejectment.</p>

After an exhaustive examination of all the <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>questions raised by this appeal, we are of opinion that no testimony produced at the trial, or offered and refused, was sufficient in law to overcome the prima facie case made out by the plaintiff. The theory upon which the learned counsel for appellant bases his contention is that the terms and conditions of the option or agreement with Jackson under which the deed was held in escrow, had not been complied with before it was delivered by the Union Trust Company, the depositary, to Murphey, the grantee, and by reason of the alleged failure to comply with the terms and conditions precedent to the delivery of the deed no valid title passed.</p>

Whether in a suit between appellant and Jackson, or between appellant and the Eastern Milling &amp; Export Company, this testimony should be admitted for any purpose, it is not necessary to consider and determine, but as between the parties to this litigation, under the admitted and undisputed facts, it is clearly incompetent for the purpose of affecting the validity of plaintiff’s title.</p>

A few days after receiving this notice he executed a lease whereby he covenanted to operate the mill for a period of sixty days as lessee, and surrender the same on five days’ notice thereafter. Some delay in closing up the transaction was occasioned on account of the failure to deliver a deed for a railroad siding, which it was alleged should be included in the conveyance. The deed for the siding was delivered May 31, and subsequently the Union Trust Company forwarded the money and stocks deposited with it to appellant as consideration for the transfer under the terms of the agreement by which the deed was held in escrow. On June 20, he acknowledged in writing the receipt of $6,250 and 375 shares of the preferred and 375 shares of the common stock of the Eastern Milling &amp; Export Company, which he accepted as consideration in full for his mill property.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[255,1214,1201,561]]]'>Before and after the receipt of the cash payment and stocks, appellant asserted at different times and to different persons that he was in possession of the property as a tenant under the lease. As late as July 5, after the organization meeting of the Eastern Milling Export Company, he acknowledged ■ his liability for rent due the company as its tenant, and asked that it be charged to him as a set-off in the settlement to be made ’ on account of the company taking over certain personal property belonging to him. On the same day he deposited the stock held by him in a pool with other stockholders of the company, but withdrew it a few days later.</p>

On that day Murphey, the grantee, acting under the direction of the Eastern Milling &amp; Export Company, executed a mortgage on the milling property, the title to which is in dispute in this suit, to secure a temporary loan of money. The appellant had notice of the execution of this mortgage because he was notified to transfer the insurance to the mortgagee. On July 1, a general mortgage covering all the constituent properties of the new corporation, including the property of the appellant, was executed and recorded. This mortgage secured a bond <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>issue in a large sum of money. Tlie corporation defaulted in the payment of interest on the bonds, and the mortgage was foreclosed by a decree of the United States circuit court, under which the property in dispute, and all other properties covered by the mortgage, were sold and conveyed to the plaintiff who brought this action in ejectment.</p>
    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[166,645,1183,1072]]]'>It is thus apparent that the appellant, the new consolidated milling company, and all other parties in interest, treated the delivery of the deed by the trust company to Murphey, April 5, 1901, as an absolute transfer of the property. Against this array of concrete facts it is of no avail to assert abstract principles of law wherein it is held that a deed takes effect only from the time of its delivery; or, where a deed is placed in the hands of a third person as an escrow, the grantee is only entitled to a delivery upon a strict compliance with the conditions precedent to such delivery; or, that if the depositary delivers the deed without authority from the grantor, or if the grantee obtains possession of it fraudulently, without performing the conditions, the deed is void ; or, that where the future deli very of a deed depends upon the payment of money, or the performance of some other condition, and the grantee obtains possession of the deed without performing the condition, he acquires but a voidable title. These are recognized and settled principles of law, and will not be questioned by anyone familiar with the rules of property, but it would do violence to every rule of construction to hold them applicable to the facts of tlie case at bar.</p>

The position is not tenable under the facts of the present case. Such a rule would impose a higher standard of legal requirement on the agent than on the principal. It will not be seriously contended that in this respect the Union Trust Company can be required to exercise greater care and diligence in the enforcement of the conditions of the <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>escrow than the appellant, who, with Jackson, constituted the trust company depositary for the receipt of the consideration and delivery of the deed. When the appellant, who was as familiar with the facts connected with the organization of the new milling company as the common agent, the depositary, accepted the money and stocks in full consideration for his property, and thereafter acquiesced in the mortgage of said property as a security to third parties and bondholders, who had advanced their money for the uses and purposes of the new corporation, he cannot now be heard to say that the depositary had been unfaithful in not enforcing the alleged conditions of escrow precedent to the delivery of the deed.</p>

A purchaser for value has a right to act on the faith that a deed has been signed, sealed, acknowledged and delivered as it purports to be, and the presumption is that it has been so executed and delivered by proper parties: Blight v.

The appellant had executed a conveyance of his property and had received the consideration agreed to be paid him, and the delivery of the deed under the circumstances was binding upon him. Having parted with the title to his property, and the rights of third parties having intervened, it was immaterial what notice he gave at the sale.</p>
