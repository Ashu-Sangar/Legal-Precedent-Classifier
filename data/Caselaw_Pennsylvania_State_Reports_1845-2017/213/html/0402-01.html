Woods, 5 S. &amp; R. 275, the rigor of the rule laid down in that case, and it is the leading one in this state, has been greatly relaxed. Nor, considering the progress in population and wealth and the change in methods of conducting business, could it have been strictly adhered to without great obstruction to business and hardship to individuals. Under that ruling the cases were rare where as to creditors the ownership of chattels could be in one and the possession in another; in such circumstances, with few exceptions, the transaction was constructively fraudulent as to creditors. But in the long line of cases following it, step by step, the rule has been so softened that now it may be said, with few exceptions, where the purpose of the contracting parties was as between themselves an honest one, and there was no concealment, as to creditors, of its true nature, the contract is not constructively fraudulent; in other words, the law will be slow to hold the parties scamps constructively if the contract, in view of its purposp, was actually an honest one.”</p>

The transaction was an honest one. The price paid for the coffee was the current price for that article. The purchaser paid part cash and gave bankable notes for the balance, which he subsequently paid. He left his coffee with the Huff Company to be roasted, as he had been doing for seven or eight years. We do not understand the defendant to contradict the proposition that he could leave the coffee with Huff and still make the sale to him valid as against creditors. Certainly no one would insist that Riggs should have shipped his coffee to Wellsville and reshipped it back to Pittsburg in order to have it roasted. But it is contended that the separation from the coffee of the vendor was not complete. True, they might have placed Riggs’ coffee all in one pile; they might have marked every individual sack; but how that would have been more of an identification of his coffee than what was done in this case we are at a loss to see. Each pile was marked by a tag which told to the person who looked at it that that coffee was sold to E. H. Riggs, giving the number of bags so sold, which corresponded with the number of bags in the row. And if there was a row of coffee on either side of this Riggs row belonging to the Huff Company, it was separate and distinct from it, both by actual space and by the markings on the Riggs’ coffee. And so as to the weighing of the coffee. It is alleged that this was not an accurate weighing, and that there would have to be another weighing out before the actual shipment of the coffee to Riggs. Certainly with the weighing that was done Riggs could have demanded and received all of the coffee that had been set apart to him; and that is all that is in question in this ease. If all pf his poffee had not been set apart to him, and if, as between <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>liim and Huff, he had a claim for other coffee, that is not material here, as he is only claiming what was set apart; but if Huff had weighed out to him in the manner in which he did more than 7,000 pounds of coffee, still Riggs could claim the amount set apart. And as the evidence goes to show that this was the ordinary, customary way of weighing out large quantities of coffee such as this, there can be no question but what this was a proper weighing. “ Unusual and unnecessary formalities in such transactions are generally a badge of fraud rather than of honesty: ” Garretson v. Hackenberg, <a href="/pa/144/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="144 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="823805" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0107-01">144 Pa. 107</a>.</p>

Plaintiff was a retail dealer who did not sell green coffee, and he testified that the arrangement was that Huff should put the coffee aside for him, mark it, and keep it stored until he gave orders for roasting. No charge was to be made for storage if Huff did the roasting, and a written memorandum to that effect was put on the invoice. All this was in accordance with the custom of the parties in dealings for several years previously.</p>

Exactly how this was done is thus detailed by the witness : “We took the order for the first item of coffee, whatever it called for; I went to the piles and found how much was in the pile, and if there was enough in that pile to make it, I marked it, and if there wasn’t I would go to another until I did get enough; and if there was too much in the pile, I would take away until there was enough left to make out the amount.” “ Q. Now, take this order of 7,000 pounds of Mocha coffee; tell us how you put that up and what you did. A. That first order was in three separate piles; each pile was marked with a tab to the front bag, sewed on — how many bags there were in the order and what kind it was, so anybody could see it as they would go along through the aisle. . . . . Q. Now, Fas there any weighing done by you? How did you ascertain that the fifty-four bags marked there in the left hand margin amounted to 7,000 pounds ? A. There were five bags taken off the pile and weighed and the average weight of the bags estimated from those five, and then counted from that.”</p>
