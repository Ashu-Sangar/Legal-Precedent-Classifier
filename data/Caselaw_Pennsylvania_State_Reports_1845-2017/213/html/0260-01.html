This presumption is founded upon the ancient and moss-grown maxim that the law does not recognize fractions of a day.

In different cases this court has decided that a calendar month is a month varying in length from twenty-eight to thirty-one days, according to the common calendar in general use. In the case of Parker’s Estate, 14 W. N. C.566, this question is directly ruled under the section. Therefore, as the will in this case was executed on October 8, and as October is a month having thirty-one days, it would be necessary under the provisions of the act of 1855 that thirty-one days at least must intervene between the execution of the will and the time of the decease of the testator, otherwise the legacies are void: Kane v.

She died on November 8, of the same year, between the hours of 7 and 8 o’clock p. m., and the single question raised on this. appeal is whether the bequest to the appellant is defeated by the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 328.</p>

A calendar month beginning in February, except in leap year, is of twenty-eight days’ duration; one beginning in April, June, September or November is of thirty days, and one beginning in either of the other seven months, of thirty-one days. As the calendar month to elapse between the date of the execution of this will and the death of the testatrix was one of thirty-one days, the bequest made to the appellant is void, unless, after the will was executed in the manner directed by the statute, “ at least ” that number of days intervened before her death.</p>

We are not, however, dealing with general principles or rules of construction, but with the express words of a statute, which cannot be overridden, even in the furtherance of what may seem to be justice. The fiction of the law that a day has no fractions yields at times, when equity requires that hours be counted, or that the exact time a thing is done be noted, but never when the duration of time, as fixed by a statute, is free from all doubt. “ At least one calendar month ” must elapse between the execution of a will containing a charitable bequest and the death of the testator, if the bequest is to be valid. The meaning of the words “ at ]east ” is “ in the smallest or lowest degree; at the lowest(estimate, or at the smallest concession or claim; at the smallest number: ” 4 Cyc. of Law &amp; Proc., 366. In declaring that “at least one calendar month” must elapso between the execution of a will containing a charitable bequest and the death of the testator, the manifest meaning of the statute is that such a month must fully elapse between the dates of the two events. A calendar month is made up of days — in this case, of thirty-one days. These are full, clear thirty-one days, not thirty days and fractions of two <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>other days, making in hours another day, and, with the other thirty, thirty-one days, but thirty-one separate and independent days, the first beginning when October 8 ended, at midnight, and the last ending at the close of November 8, at midnight. The computation in hours which the appellant makes, from 5 p. M. October 8, to 8 p. M. November 8, it is true, would make in hours thirty-one and one-eighth days <em>; </em>but this is not the computation contemplated by the statute. It is “ at least á calendar month,” made up, at certain seasons of the year, of a certain number of full, clear days, and that kind of a month did not intervene between the execution of this will and the death of the testatrix. “ When so many ‘ clear days ’ or so many days ‘ at least ’ are given to do an act, or ‘ not less than ’ so many days must intervene, both the terminal days are excluded : ” Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 391.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[276,1112,1191,612]]]'>The act of 1855 is for the protection of a testator for the last full calendar month of his life against yielding to any influences during that period — so often a susceptible one — which may unduly lead him to devote his estate, or any portion of it, to religious or charitable uses. It must be literally read and strictly construed, if effect is to be given to the legislative intent, and cannot be stretched to save a bequest clearly intended by the act to be void. Charitable or religious institutions claiming bequests or devises must bring themselves within it.

Under that rule, with October 8 excluded, the full calendar month would not have expired until the end of November 8.</p>
