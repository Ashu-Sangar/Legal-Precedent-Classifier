There is no proof that he improperly received anything for transferring the $10,000 of four per cent government bonds for the longer term five per cent school bonds. And there can be no doubt but that the trade was of advantage to the estate both in the amount of interest to be received and the ultimate value of the bond. The contestants had their day in court and as the time for the review of the original account had expired they were not entitled to have that decree opened.</p>
