Spangler against the 'Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, to recover damages resulting from the death of her husband, caused by a head-on collision between an east-bound freight engine and a west-bound passenger train. Mr. Spangler was upon the east-bound freight engine operated by the freight crew proceeding to the scene of a wreck upon the Wheeling branch of said company.</p>

That the telegraphic message (under which the freight engine was proceeding) was subject <em>(a) </em>to the rule and railway schedule of the company giving priority of right of way to passenger trains; and (6) to the rule requiring a flagman approximately a mile ahead of the freight engine to protect its crew against passenger trains.</p>
