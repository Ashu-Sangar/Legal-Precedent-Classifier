McDonnell gave a bond and mortgage for $2,700 to secure payment of balance of purchase money due Dr. Julius Strieker. McDonnell defaulted in payment of amount covered by the bond and mortgage, a sci. fa. was issued upon the mortgage, a judgment entered thereon, execution issued and the property sold for $25.00 to the mortgagee. Subsequently judgment was confessed upon the bond. The plaintiff having died, his executors were substituted and caused a sci. fa. to issue for the purpose of reviving and continuing the lien of said judgment. To this action an affidavit of defense was filed in which it was alleged that the bond was canceled and the debt discharged by the sale had through proceedings upon the mortgage. The terms of the mortgage are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>

      <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>Tlie mortgage in the present case, which was for part of the purchase money of the same land conveyed by plaintiff’s testator to defendant, after reciting the bond, continued : “Now this indenture witnesseth that the said party of the first part, as well for and in consideration of the premises as of the aforesaid debt .... and for the better securing the payment thereof unto the said party of the second part, executors, administrators and assigns in discharge of the said obligation above recited .... hath granted,” etc. The appellant claims that the effect of the words “ in discharge of the said obligation above recited,” i. e., the bond, is that a sale under the mortgage is a satisfaction of the bond. But there is nothing in the language to sustain such a departure from the presumed purpose in giving the double obligation, nor is any such intention of the parties set forth in the affidavit of defense, which rests the satisfaction on the claim as a conclusion of law that the sale under the mortgage “ operates as a legal and just extinguishment and payment of the said indebtedness.” But this is not the legal and usual operation of such a sale, nor as already said is the language such as to imply an intention of the parties to that effect. On the contrary, the words as already quoted are “ in consideration of the premises (the recital of the debt and the bond) as of the aforesaid debt .... and for the better securing the payment thereof.” It is the payment of the debt which is to discharge the other obligation, to wit: the bond, to which the mortgage is legally only a collateral security. Though the wording is a little different the purpose is the same that is expressed in the more common form.</p>
