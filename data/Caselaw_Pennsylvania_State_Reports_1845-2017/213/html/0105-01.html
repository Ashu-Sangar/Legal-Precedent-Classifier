It is not denied that the defendants are the owners of at least one-third of 'the' real estate in controversy. ■The pláintiff claims to own the two-thirds by reason of the deed of December 30, 1901, which is a deed for the real estate regular and absolute on its face. The defendants, while admitting this deed, allege that it is held subject to the paper of February 3, 1902, which they call a deed or declaration of trust. This is the issue before us and must be determined upon the proper construction of the paper of February 3,1902.</p>

But it was not recorded within sixty days of its execution, hence it runs into the very jaws of the Act of Juno 8, 1881, P.
