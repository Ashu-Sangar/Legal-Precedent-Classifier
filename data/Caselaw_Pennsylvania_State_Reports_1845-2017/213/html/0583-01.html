Woods, or whether Frank M. Woods and William A. Woods and the widow of Allen B. Woods, Jr., are entitled to a one-third share of said real estate. In other words, whether the words in the will, <em>“ </em>then to convey the same to my surviving children share and share alike,” refer to survivorship at the death of the testator, or to a survivorship at the death of the life tenant, William J. Woods.</p>

The question of testator’s intention as to who is to' take the ultimate bequest in case of the lapse is not affected by the fact that direction to convey was expressed in a trust. The question is one of substance and not one of form. In Snyder’s Estate, <a href="/pa/180/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="180 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="888362" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0070-01">180 Pa. 70</a>, testator gave the residue of his estate to his executors in trust, at the. death of his wife to pay the income to his four children, in equal shares for their lives, and provided .as to the principal <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>as follows : “ And upon tlie death of my above named children and as the same shall occur then in trust to pay over, grant and convey unto the respective children of my above named sons and daughters the principal or share of my estate, the income of which is devised for the benefit of their respective parents for life, etc.” In speaking of the effect of the trust, the court says on page 72 : “ The question here is not affected by the direction for conveyance at the expiration of the life estate. In England this would simply continue the legal estate in the trustees until the conveyance was made; here, where equity is part of the common law, it has not even this effect, and the legal estate vests at once in the beneficiary: Renziehausen v. Keyser, <a href="/pa/48/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="48 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="422129" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0351-01">48 Pa. 351</a>; Bacon’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="57 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1010429" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0504-01">57 Pa. 504</a>.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[125,991,1185,1237]]]'>Not only, in our opinion, is there nothing in the will and codicils indicating that the testator refers to a survivorship at the death of the life tenant, W. J. Woods, but, on the contrary, we think that the will indicates that he intended the survivor-ship to take effect from the date of his death. The meaning is to be determined at the time he wrote his will, and the words are to be read with his expressed legal intention. In the earlier parts of the will the testator has named his children as “ my son, George A. Woods,” again, “my son, Harry Hays Woods,” and again, “ my son, Allen Boyd Woods;” these three sons and William J. Woods, the life tenant named in the seventh paragraph, were all the testator’s children, and when he named William J. in the seventh paragraph and made provision for him and his issue and in the same paragraph made provision for giving the property to his other children, “ my surviving children,” in case the gift to William J. should lapse, he evidently had in mind that all of his children should take an equal share whenever the lapse should occur, whether before his death or afterwards, and the words, “ my surviving children share and share alike,” referred to the children whom he had enumerated, namely, George A., Harry Hays and Allen Boyd. - The authorities cited by the able and learned counsel for George A. and Harry Hays Woods, do not change the general rule, but are in harmony with it.</p>
