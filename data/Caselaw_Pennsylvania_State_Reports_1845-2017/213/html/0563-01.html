    <p class="summary" id="b595-11" data-blocks='[["BL_595.17",595,[131,2058,1180,357]],["BL_596.1",596,[260,341,1187,510]]]'>The plaintiff, a boy of thirteen years and seven months, was employed by the defendant at a thread-cutting machine, and his duty was to push nuts under four taps which were raised by a lever worked by the foot which raised the taps; the nut is then put in oil in a tin pan and pushed under the taps, which descend and cut the thread. The only instruction given him was by the foreman who put a nut under the tap and showed <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>him how to do the work, and then directed another boy to show him, and he put four nuts in the machine. The foreman told the boy to be careful and not break any taps. On the next day he put a nut in the machine, tramped on the treadle and his foot slipped, the tap broke and the nut flew up and got caught in a cogwheel, breaking the cog. The boy did not know how to stop the machine, and had not been instructed, although there was a lever for that purpose. He took a stick and tried to poke the nut out, and by the pulling of the stick or in some other way his hand was caught in the cogs and injured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[259,859,1189,509]]]'>It was no part of his duty to remove the nut from the cog, and the case is not like that of Creachen v. Carpet Co., <a href="/pa/209/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="209 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="936071" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0006-01">209 Pa. 6</a>, where it was part of the boy’s duty to remove the “ choke,” which was the accumulated wool caused by the operation of the machine. The plaintiff was not injured in performing any duty for which he was employed and was attempting to remove a difficulty which was not caused by the ordinary operation of the machine, but was meddling with something that was not his business. Had he been hurt in the operation of the machine he might be entitled to recover.</p>
