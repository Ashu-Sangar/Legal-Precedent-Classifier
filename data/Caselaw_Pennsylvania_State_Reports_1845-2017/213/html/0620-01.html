The bad faith and misconduct of Coyle are most reprehensible and cannot be too strongly condemned; but the one who can mbst justly complain of them is A. W. Mellon. More than six months prior to May 29, 1903, when D. F. Henry, the husband of the appellant, was first approached about the purchase of the Hotel Duques ne, A. W. Mellon had employed Coyle to find out for him whether Mrs. Black would sell the property, and, if so, to endeavor to get an option upon it. At that time Coyle did not even know.Mrs. Black, but, having ascertained her residence, went to see her and endeavored to persuade her to sell the property, not, however, mentioning the Mellons at first. He made repeated visits at various times, and she declined to sell or to •give an option. Finally he told her he was acting for the Mellons, who were more or less known to her, she having been a depositor in their bank. Having many times refused to sell the property or to give an option on it to Coyle, alleging as a reason that she would not know what to do with the money if she had it, she finally, as she says, in order to get rid of his importunities, said she would give him an option for $800,000. Coyle thereupon said he would take it, and she executed the following, which is printed as exhibit “ A ” of the plaintiff’s amended bill:</p>

He told her that his purpose in getting it was to make a sale to the Mellons, which she believed, and the distinct finding of the court is that Coyle was, in fact, the agent of the Mellons to procure it. Mrs. Black testified; “ He promised me faithfully that nobody else would get it but the Mellons, if that’s plain. He promised me faithfully a dozen of times that nobody would get it but the Mellons, for I wouldn’t sell it to anybody else. I thought the Mellons ought to have it because they had the most of the square and the old gentleman used to come and see that building going up and he stood there watching it, seeing that they are doing it right, and he would say ‘ They are making a good job for you,’ and I would have been afraid to build almost if it hadn’t been for him. . . . This here, Mr. Coyle, he was determined he would have it and he said it was for the Mellons, and I thought I might as well give it to the Mellons, as I had no child to leave it to, and no person to leave it to, and I just thought Mellons had the most right to it.” In this she is confirmed by her nephew, R. G, Jackson, who was present at the <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>interview between her and Coyle. The latter himself testified: “ Mrs. Black asked me- if the option was being taken for the Mellons and I told her again that it was, and she executed the option at that time.” When Coyle notified A. W. Mellon that the option had been procured the latter said, according to his testimony: “ I said to him that the price was too high but that, perhaps, we would have to pay that price for it, but just to keep it and we would make up our minds about it. The option had thirty days to run and my idea was that there was no urgency about it and that I could close it out toward the end of the option term.” This Mellon did on June 5, 1903 — three days before the option had expired — by giving notice to Coyle and Mrs. Black that the option was accepted. Mellon further testified that when he learned that Coyle had, in bad faith, offered the property to Henry, he said to Coyle that .he and Ewing “ hadn’t any right to do anything of the kind, that the option had been taken for us and belonged to us and it was in bad faith to us to offer the property for negotiation with others.” To this Coyle made reply that he did not think there was anything in it, or something to that effect. From the foregoing undisputed facts it is manifest, as found by the court below, that Coyle was the agent of the Mellons in procuring the option, and A. W. Mellon is involved in none of the mala fides of the case. On the contrary, the equities of it are all with him.</p>

This being the case, she is bound by the rule announced in Chew v. Barnet, 11 S. &amp; R. 389, that the purchaser of an equitable title takes it subject to all the countervailing equities to which it was subject in the hands of the person from whom he purchased it.y'Of this rule it is said by Gibson, J., in that case : “ Now, every equitable title is incomplete on its face ; it is, in truth, nothing more than a title to go into chancery, to have the legal estate conveyed; and, therefore, every purchaser of a mere equity takes it subject to every clog that may lie on it, whether he has had notice of it or not. But the purchaser of a legal title takes it discharged of every trust or equity which does not appear on the face of the conveyance, and of which he has not had notice, either actual or constructive.” <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>The equities of Mellon were countervailing and superior to any that can be asserted by the appellants, in view of the facts just referrred to.</p>

The option was not unconditionally accepted, but, as appears from the receipt, the appellant paid $5,000 hand money on account of the salo of the property, not according to the option, but as “ per agreement this day made.” An acceptance of an option, to .be good, must be such as amounts to an agreement or contract between the parties. Such an acceptance can be only an unconditional one. The rule upon this subject is thus stated in Potts v. Whitehead, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20N.J.%20Eq.%20512" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="28 N.J. Eq. 512">28 N. J.

Briscoe, 11 Ves. 583; Carr v.

So long as the offer has been neither accepted nor rejected, the negotiation remains open, and imposes no obligation upon either party; the one may decline to accept, or the other may withdraw his offer; and either rejection or withdrawal leaves the matter as if no offer had ever been made. A proposal to accept, or an acceptance, upon terms varying from those offered, is a rejection of the offer, and puts an end to the negotiation, unless the party who made the original offer renews it, or assents to the modification suggested. <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>The other party, having once rejected the offer, cannot after-wards revive it by tendering an acceptance.”</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[263,444,1193,1182]]]'>The agreement of Mrs. Henry was not, then, to purchase on the terms set forth in the option, but according to an agreement to be made that day, which, as a matter of fact, was not made. Not satisfied with the terms of the option, which provided for the payment of the balance of the purchase money, 1775,000, by securing it by a bond and mortgage for ten years, the appellant had her attorney prepare and she signed an agreement in which there was a stipulation that the purchase money mortgage was to be accompanied by what is commonly known as a common bond, the said mortgage and bond, however, “to be limited to the premises ” described. This was a material variance from the option, which, on being submitted to Mrs. Black, she refused to sign. Though the reason of her refusal may have been that the Mellons were not to get the property, the fact remains that the agreement was not signed by her; and as Mrs. Henry’s insistence that the terms of the option should be changed was a legal rejection of it, Mrs. Black was not to be further bound by it, unless it was formally renewed. The case, as presented, is one in which the receipt does not contain the terms of sale, which were to appear in an agreement subsequently to be executed by the parties, and, as it never was executed, there were no terms to be enforced. It follows as a matter of course that no decree for specific performance could have been made.</p>
