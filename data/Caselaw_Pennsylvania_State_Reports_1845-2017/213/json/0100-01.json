T., 1905, by Safe Deposit & Trust Company, Trustee et al., from decree of O. C. Westmoreland Co., Nov. T., 1899, No. 43, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in Estate of Laura C. Mace, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of Edward B. McCormick, Esq., auditor.\nSteel, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nA careful examination of the testimony, exceptions, papers and rep\u00f3rt in the case convinces us that all the interest that could fairly have accrued on the money and securities in the. hands of the accountant has been charged against him, and that the proper amount of premium on the bonds sold has been accounted for. There is no proof that he improperly received anything for transferring the $10,000 of four per cent government bonds for the longer term five per cent school bonds. And there can be no doubt but that the trade was of advantage to the estate both in the amount of interest to be received and the ultimate value of the bond. The contestants had their day in court and as the time for the review of the original account had expired they were not entitled to have that decree opened.\nAnd now, to wit: May 6,1905, the exceptions are dismissed and the auditor\u2019s report is confirmed absolutely.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nJohn E. Kunkle, with him Edward E. Bobbins, for appellants.\nJames S. Moorhead, with him John B. Head, for appellee.\nOctober 30, 1905 :"
