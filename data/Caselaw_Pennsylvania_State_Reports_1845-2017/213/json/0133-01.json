While they might have abandoned it they had the option to continue and claim the damages caused by the city\u2019s fault.\nThe dispute as to grading was one of amount alone. The director of public works might have settled the amount conclusively by measuring and certifying it, but he did not do so. It was therefore a question for the jury.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Sheehan v. Pittsburg, Appellant.\nContract \u2014 Municipal contract \u2014 Opening street \u2014 Delay.\nWhere a municipal contract for the construction of a street is based on the assumption by both the city and the contractor that the complete right of way had been secured by the city, a delay caused by the failure to obtain the complete right of way is not within the meaning of a provision of the contract that all loss or damages from unforeseen obstructions and difficulties and from delay, should be borne by the contractor. In such a case a provision of a contract for extension of time only on the written assent by the director of public works is not applicable.\nWhere a municipal contractor is delayed in completing his work by the fault of the city, he may either abandon the work, or continue it and claim the damages caused by the city\u2019s fault.\nWhere a dispute between a municipal contractor and a city as to grading is one of amount alone, and it appears that the city might have settled the amount conclusively by measuring and certifying it, but did not do so, the question in dispute is for the jury.\nArgued Oct. 25, 1905.\nAppeal, No. 85, Oct. T., 1905, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co.,, Oct. T., 1901, No. 300, on verdict for plaintiffs in case of John C. Sheehan et al. v. City of Pittsburg.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a municipal contract for the construction of a street. Before Frazer, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on September 16,1896, the city of Pittsburg entered into a contract with W. E. Howley & Co. for the construction of a street known as the Grant Boulevard. This contract was subsequently assigned to Werneberg, Sheehan & Company, plaintiffs. Both parties to the contract assumed that the complete right of way had been acquired by the city. It turned out that this was not the case, and that by reason of the delay in securing the right of way the contractors were subjected to a large loss.\nThe contract contained the following provisions :\n\u201c All loss or damage arising out of the nature of the work to be done under this contract or from any unforeseen obstructions or difficulties, which may be encountered in the prosecution of the same, or from the action of the elements, or from any encumbrance on the line of the work, shall be sustained by the parties of the second part \u201d (the contractors).\n\u201c No charge shall be made by the contractor for any hindrance or delay from any cause during the progress of the work, but it may justify his asking an extension of the time allotted for completing the same sufficient to make allowance for the detention to be determined by the director of the department of public works ; provided, the contractor shall give said director immediate notice in writing of the cause of the detention.\u201d\nIn addition to the loss caused by delay plaintiffs claimed to recover for a quantity of filling as to the amount of which they offered evidence.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $128,995.01. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were various instructions.\nWilliam Watson Smith, assistant city solicitor, with him T. D. Carnahan, for appellant.\nThomas Patterson, of Patterson, Sterrett Acheson, with him William W. Wishart and John W. Kephart, for appellees.\nNovember 4, 1905."
