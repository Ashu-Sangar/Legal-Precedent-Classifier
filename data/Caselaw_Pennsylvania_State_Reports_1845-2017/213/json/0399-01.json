Jones et al., ante, p. 390 from this same decree, we have hold that the trust created by the will of Mrs. Peninah W. Kountz violates the rule against perpetuities, and is therefore void. As her entire estate is distributable at this time, under the provisions of the intestate law, it is unnecessary to pass upon the questions raised by this appeal. It is therefore dismissed at the cost of the appellant.",
