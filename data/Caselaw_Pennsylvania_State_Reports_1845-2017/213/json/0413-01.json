This would seem to bring the case within the rule in McCarrell v. Mullins, 141 Pa. 513.\nBut there is a second reason why the attachment should not issue, alluded to by the learned judge, though not dwelt upon. The decree was that the defendants \u201c must refund and repay so much of the stocks, bonds and assets of the McKinley Coal Company, received by them, or either of them, as may be necessary to pay the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, with interests and costs.\u201d\nThis was an indefinite order which imposed no exact duty on the respondents. Until the required amount was liquidated, the decree was wanting in the precision necessary for its enforcement by attachment.\nDecree affirmed.",

The McKinley Coal Company.\nEquity \u2014 Attachment\u2014Fraud\u2014Corporation.\nA court of equity will not issue an attachment to compel officers of a corporation to restore to the corporation assets of the company where the court finds as a fact that there was no fraudulent misappropriation of the assets.\nOn a creditor\u2019s bill against a corporation and its officers and stockholders, the court entered a decree that the defendants \u201cmust refund and repay so much of the stock, bonds, and assets of the corporation received by them or either of them as may be necessary to pay the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, with interest and costs.\u201d Held, that no attachment could issue upon the order since it imposed no exact duty on the respondents.\nArgued Oct. 27, 1905.\nAppeal, No. 196, Oct. T., 1905, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., Dec. T., 1902, No. 6, refusing attachment in case of First National Bank of Pittsburg v. The McKinley Coal Company, W. H. McKinley and Ernest H. McKinley.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestbezat, Potteb, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity by a judgment creditor against a corporation, its officers and stockholders for an account.\nThe case resulted in a decree quoted in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe plaintiff thereupon filed a petition for an attachment.\nCollier, P. J., dismissed the petition, saying:\nWe have again gone over the case with care, and have failed to find anything in the decree itself to justify the issuing of an attachment on the ground of fraud, or in the findings and pleadings to show that the conduct and acts of the defendants were fraudulent, and with fraudulent intent.\nThe only finding bearing at all on the question is one that there was-a misappropriation by the defendants; but this is far from finding that there was a fraudulent misappropriation. At any rate, until it is determined how much, if any, of the stock now held by the plaintiff is applicable to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, the court would not allow the attachment as prayed for to issue.\nError assigned was decree refusing attachment.\nLevi Bird Buff, with him L. B. D. Reese, for appellants,\ncited: Batdorf\u2019s Estate, 2 Dauph. Co. 287; United States v. Caruther\u2019s, 15 Fed. Repr. 309.\nEomer L. Castle, of Stone Stone, with him H. S.
