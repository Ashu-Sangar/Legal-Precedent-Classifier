The same jury fixed the punishment at three separate death sentences for the first-degree murder convictions. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the convictions and death sentences. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The bodies of Lucille Horner, age 88, Minnie Warrick, age 86, and Sarah Kuntz, age 85, were found on the morning of June 22, 1985, in a secluded, wooded area off a dirt road in Cecil Township. Pursuant to the subsequent autopsy, Dr. Earnest L. Abernathy of Washington County determined that the victims were killed the previous day between 12:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. At Appellant’s trial, Dr. Abernathy testified that Ms. Horner’s injuries included significant bruising on her chin, chest, and back, damage to her heart, numerous fractures of her ribs, a fracture of her backbone, damage to her liver, and a torn larynx. Dr. Abernathy concluded that the cause of death was traumatic <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>rupture of the heart. The autopsy of Ms. Kuntz revealed similar injuries, including bruises on her face, chest, and legs, lacerations to the scalp, fractured ribs, and damage to her heart and liver. Dr. Abernathy concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia due to a fracture of the larynx. With regard to Ms. Warrick, Dr. Abernathy testified that she also sustained bruising to the face and chest, fractured ribs, and heart damage, as well as a partially collapsed lung and blowout of the stomach wall. The cause of death for Ms. Warrick was traumatic rupture of the heart, with numerous companion injuries. Dr. Abernathy testified that the pattern of bruising was similar in all three cases, caused by substantial blunt force blows, which, in his opinion, were most likely delivered by human hands.</p>

Mildred Stitler testified that on June 21, 1985, she observed, from her apartment window overlooking the shopping center parking lot, an elderly woman standing with a bald, well-dressed, African-American man, identified as Appellant, next to a car. She noticed Appellant pointing to the rear of the car as if something was wrong with the tire. The two got into the car, with Appellant in' the driver’s seat, and drove away, apparently to pick up the other two victims who were waiting for the car at another location in the shopping center. Kimberly Oyler testified that on June 21, 1985, she was at the Millcraft Shopping Center at approximately 2:15, and, as she was parking her car, she observed Appellant holding open the rear door of a vehicle (later determined to be Ms. Horner’s car) as two elderly women entered the rear seat. A third witness, Harry Crothers, testified that he was personally acquainted with Ms. Horner, who was his friend’s mother-in-law. Mr. Crothers owned a shop across the street from the shopping center, and observed Ms. Horner in the passenger seat of her car, with two elderly <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>women in the back seat and Appellant driving, as the vehicle left the shopping center at about 2:30 p.m.</p>

Appellant got out of the car, and there were no other occupants in the vehicle. Witnesses inside the store, who identified Appellant from a photographic array, stated that he purchased some soda, and handed a child a gold-chain necklace. He left the store and drove away, heading north. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Elements observed Appellant driving the same vehicle heading south past the station. Appellant appeared a third time, between 4:00 and 4:30, when he coasted into the station with the motor off. An employee assisted Appellant in restarting the car, and he drove away. Mr. Elements identified Ms. Horner’s vehicle as the car he had seen Appellant driving during his multiple stops at the service station throughout the day of the murders. Other witnesses identified the necklace Appellant gave to the child as belonging to Ms. Warrick.</p>
    <p id="b403-6" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[137,1507,1158,563]]]'>Evidence was also introduced at trial concerning a burglary that occurred that day at the home of Delha Woznicak, which was located three-tenths of a mile, about a thirty second drive, from the Elements service station. Ms. Woznicak testified that her residence was broken into between 3:25 and 4:50 p.m. on June 21, 1985. She identified evidence introduced at trial as items stolen from her home, and further identified the bottom portion of a dress that she had found in her abode while cleaning up after the burglary, which Ms. Warrick’s relative identified as the dress Ms. Warrick wore to the luncheon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

When Appellant was arrested on June 23, 1985, numerous items identified as the Woznicaks’ were discovered in his possession.</p>

Ms. Whitlock’s brother resided there, and testified that Appellant visited him the night of June 21, 1985. Alfred Adams testified for the Commonwealth that he grew up with Appellant, and that at one time Appellant had lived approximately 600-800 yards from where the victims’ bodies were found. The Commonwealth also established that Appellant had been an instructor in martial arts, and held a black belt in karate. Further, the Commonwealth submitted expert testimony from FBI Special Agent Andrew Podolak, who testified that he examined samples of a hair found on Appellant’s clothing, and determined that the hair had characteristics similar to that of Ms. Warrick’s, and in his expert opinion, the hair was Ms. Warrick’s.</p>

Ms. Hair testified that on June 18,1985, three days before the murders, at approximately 6:15 p.m., she was sitting in her car in the parking lot of Chartiers Valley Shopping Center in Bridgeville when she was approached by a bald African-American man whom she identified as Appellant. Appellant told her that her car had a flat tire. Ms. Hair inspected the tire, but could see nothing out of the ordinary. Appellant was persistent, she stated, saying that he observed someone “fooling” with the tire. Appellant attempted to extract a nail from the tire, and after several minutes offered to drive Ms. Hair to a service station to have the tire repaired. She refused his offer, and attempted to drive away. Appellant, however, blocked her from driving away, then bent down and stood up holding a pair of scissors, claiming to have found them under the tire. Ms. Hair took the scissors, saying she would take <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>them to the police. Appellant took them back, and stated that he would take them there. As a result of this incident, Ms. Hair made a complaint with the Collier Township Police.</p>

He admitted that he was in the area on June 21, 1985, to see an attorney, but that he left, returning by ear to Pittsburgh at about 12:45 or 1:00 p.m. with a man known to him only as “P.I.” Appellant further testified that he came to be in possession of the Woznicak’s belongings after meeting with P.I. on the night of the 21st in the Hill District of Pittsburgh. Other defense evidence included defense experts who offered their opinions that the blows sustained by the victims were not the result of a karate-style attack, karate blows, or a human hand. Finally, although other witnesses testified as to Appellant’s whereabouts on June 21, 1985, none were able to account for the time between 12:00 noon and 7:00 p.m.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

This subpart arises from Agent Podolak’s testimony. As described above, Mr. Podolak stated in the report that hair analysis does not provide an absolute basis for identification. Counsel filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Mr. Podolak’s testimony. The trial court denied the motion, and Mr. Podolak testified that he could make, and did make, a positive identification of the source of the hair found on Appellant’s clothes. According to Appellant, the Commonwealth never disclosed that the agent <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>would render this opinion, before or during trial. As such, Appellant contends that the Commonwealth deliberately violated the rules of discovery. Appellant argues that this discovery violation rendered defense counsel ineffective at the motion <em>in limine </em>proceeding. Specifically, Appellant argues that had counsel known of the actual content of Mr. Podolak’s proposed testimony, or if the Commonwealth had been forthright with the court during the litigation on the motion <em>in limine, </em>counsel would have persuaded the trial court to exclude this evidence as violating the <em>Frye/Topa </em>requirement of general acceptance in the scientific community.</p>

Appellant fails to meet his burden, and his claim must fail. <em>See Jones, supra. </em>Further, we fail to see how counsel can be considered ineffective at the motion <em>in limine </em>hearing. Based on the information contained in the report, trial counsel argued that Mr. Podolak’s testimony should be excluded because the opinion described in the report was not generally accepted in the scientific community.

Three different eyewitnesses saw Appellant with the victims at, or near, the Millcraft Shopping Center. The first witness observed Appellant approach one of the victims and point to the car’s tire. The same witness watched as Appellant got into the drivers’ seat of the car. The second witness saw Appellant holding the door open for the other two victims as they entered the vehicle.

Ms. Woznicak found a strip of cloth that was later determined to be from the dress worn by Ms. Warrick the day she was murdered. Moreover, the bodies of the victims were found approximately 600-800 yards from Appellant’s childhood home. The Commonwealth introduced testimony that Appellant was a black-belt in karate, which was important because the coroner found that the victims were likely killed by blunt trauma by a human hand. Finally, Ms. Hair testified that just three days before the murder, Appellant tried to gain access to her and her vehicle by fabricating a problem with the vehicle’s tire, going so far as to feign seeing a nail in the tire and a pair of scissors under the tire.

At trial, however, he testified that he saw Appellant driving the car. To counter the Commonwealth’s identification witnesses, including Mr. Crothers, the defense presented the testimony of an expert in perception and memory, who testified regarding matters affecting the reliability of eyewitness identification, specifically cross-racial identifications. Further, the defense presented the testimony of three witnesses who observed a similar looking man, who was not Appellant, in the area around the time of the crimes.

As noted, Appellant was represented by two attorneys at the guilt and penalty phases: Attorney Liekar and Attorney Tershel. Attorney Liekar handled the vast majority of the pretrial investigation and preparation for the guilt and penalty phases, and Attorney Tershel was involved in the pre-trial investigation to a lesser extent. During trial, Attorney Tershel actually litigated the case <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>during the guilt and penalty phase and presented both closing arguments while Attorney Liekar, though present, did not say anything on the record. Attorney Liekar passed away following the direct appeal, before Appellant filed the PCRA petition raising claims of ineffectiveness. Consequently, only Attorney Tershel was available to testify at the PCRA hearing. In raising his various claims of counsel ineffectiveness, Appellant does not distinguish between these attorneys but generally refers to “counsel.” It appears, however, given his references to Attorney Tershel’s PCRA testimony, that when Appellant refers to “counsel,” he is specifically referring to Attorney Tershel. He does not mention Attorney Liekar or acknowledge his role in preparing for trial. For ease of discussion, we will refer to counsel collectively as “counsel” and individually by name.</p>

A train was fast approaching, and Mr. Stephens was unable to free himself. Although there were other people around at the time, only Appellant risked his life to do anything. Appellant ran from “out of nowhere,” N.T. at 1556, and saved Mr. Stephens’s life by throwing him from the track at great personal peril. Additionally, Appellant’s mother testified. She corroborated Mr. Stephens’ testimony and told the jury that as a result of saving Mr. Stephens’ life, Appellant received the Carnegie Hero Award, which included $500 and a bronze metal. She also testified that although Appellant had been in jail before, he had never been violent or harmed anyone; had never flown into a fit of rage; and had always been protective and loving to his family.

We will examine these two categories of evidence and Appellant’s arguments separately. Preliminarily, we note that Appellant’s ability to meet his burden and prove that counsel was ineffective in regard to the mitigation investigation is impacted by the passage of fourteen years between counsels’ alleged ineffectiveness at the 1986 trial, and the PCRA hearing in 2000. While Attorney Liekar was not available to testify, Attorney Tershel understandably had difficulty recalling the specific nature of the investigation and conversations he had with Appellant and family members. Appellant points to these failings as proof that counsel did not reasonably investigate available avenues of mitigation. We disagree with Appellant that the unavailability of Attorney Liekar and the inability of Attorney Tershel to recall details of the investigation proves that counsels’ investigation of possible mitigation evidence was inadequate. It is Appellant’s burden to prove the lack of a reasonable investigation. If Appellant’s task is made more difficult by the passage of time and likely loss of memory, it does not follow that Appellant can meet his burden by raising an inference of ineffectiveness premised on Attorney Tershel’s lack of memory. While Appellant’s burden to prove counsel’s ineffectiveness is made more difficult, it is not obviated or lessoned by these circumstances. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Attorney Tershel, who was aware that Appellant grew up in a large, poor family, and that Appellant’s parents were divorced, N.T. PCRA at 145, directed Mr. Reid to look into Appellant’s background, believing this information would be “helpful.” <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. In carrying out this assignment, Mr. Reid talked to Appellant’s sister, Ms. Scott, who described Appellant’s background and family history and that Appellant helped raise and feed <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>the family.

Additionally, Attorney Tershel recalled personally talking to Ms. Wade several times. <em>Id. </em>at 99. This testimony supports the PCRA court’s conclusions that trial counsel did, in fact, conduct a reasonable investigation of Appellant’s family background.

Declaration of Ms. Scott, January 1, 2000. There are no medical records reflecting these alleged injuries. Similarly, although Dr. Armstrong refers to ten years of pugilistic sports related head injuries in prison, there is no medical evidence regarding these alleged injuries. Further, as the PCRA court found, the declarations of Drs. Armstrong, Woods, and Dee are not persuasive. Preliminarily, although Appellant refers to each of his mental health providers’ declarations as affidavits, the declarations of Drs. Armstrong and Woods cannot properly be characterized as such, because they have not been sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths. <em>See </em>1 Pa. C.S. § 1991 (“Affidavit” is defined as “[a] statement in writing of a fact or facts signed by the party making it, sworn to or affirmed before an officer authorized by the laws of this Commonwealth to take acknowledgments of deeds, or authorized to administer oaths, or before the particular officer or individual designated by law as the one before whom it is to or may be taken, and officially certified to in the case of an officer under his seal of office.”). <em>See Hall, <a href="/pa/582/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="872 A.2d 1139" data-case-ids="650333,8979014" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0461-01,/a2d/872/1139-01">872 </a></em><a href="/pa/582/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="872 A.2d 1139" data-case-ids="650333,8979014" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0461-01,/a2d/872/1139-01">A.2d at 1188</a> (Pa.2005) (declining to characterize as affidavits documents that have not been sworn to by the declarant in accord with 1 Pa.C.S. § 1991).

Although each mental health provider referred to their reliance on “numerous background materials” regarding Appellant, they did not identify or list these materials. Additionally, Dr. Armstrong asserts that she conducted a forensic neuropsychological assessment of Appellant at the request of PCRA counsel, and attached the results of this neuropsychological evaluation to her declaration. Appellant, however, does not set forth the contents of that report nor does he offer a copy thereof.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_30" id="ref_footnote_1_30">30</a> We are left with Dr. Armstrong’s conclusions, which appear to be based solely on Appellant’s family’s unsworn declarations and unidentified background materials. Further, although Dr. Armstrong’s 2000 declaration is in the present tense when describing Appellant’s inability to engage in multiple cognitive processes simultaneously and the impairment to his judgment and reasoning, which she ties to head trauma resulting from pugilistic sports activity in prison, she does not reference when these injuries occurred in relation to the 1985 murders.</p>

He asserts that he conducted a psychiatric evaluation of Appellant following two interviews of him, a review of “numerous [unidentified] background materials,” and after consulting with Dr. Armstrong. Dr. Woods’ statement tracks the factual assertions regarding Appellant’s childhood found in the unsworn assertions provided by Appellant’s family members. He likewise concluded that at the time of the offense Appellant suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, and had an impaired ability to conform his conduct to the law, without explaining how he was able to reach this conclusion in 2000 about Appellant’s 1985 mental status. Similarly, Dr. Dee performed a “psychological and neuropsychological test battery” on Appellant, reviewed numerous, unspecified documents regarding him generally, his background, and the trial proceedings. In Dr. Dee’s opinion, Appellant “is a <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>seriously psychologically impaired individual and has been so for many years, since well before the offense at issue.” Affidavit of Dr. Dee, May 12, 2000.

In support of this contention, Appellant presented a Washington County jail incident report that describes that when two corrections officers investigated a noise, they saw an inmate on the floor, and Appellant helped the officer hold the inmate down while he kicked and convulsed. They discovered a shoestring around the inmate’s neck. Appellant has not demonstrated that he <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>was prejudiced by counsel’s failure to present this evidence. In addition to proving arguable merit and a lack of reasonable strategic basis for counsels’ actions, Appellant must prove that he was prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. <em>See Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="240" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d at 975</a>. Evidence that Appellant helped corrections officers attend an inmate who had attempted suicide would be mitigating evidence under the catch-all mitigator. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. 9711(e)(8). As noted, however, the jury found the existence of this mitigator in reliance on counsel’s argument that Appellant had saved the life of Mr. Stephens. While this additional evidence would have bolstered counsel’s portrayal of Appellant as heroic, in light of the gruesome nature of the crime and the jury’s acceptance of the Commonwealth’s aggravating factors, we cannot conclude that it would have persuaded at least one juror to give more weight to the already found catch-all mitigator, such that the juror would have held out for life in prison. The burden on Appellant is to prove sufficient preju<em>dice—i.e., </em>a reasonable probability that the outcome of trial would have been different had counsel presented this additional evidence to the jury. <em>See Wiggins, </em><a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="241" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">539 U.S. at 537</a>, <a href="/us/539/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="242" data-cite="539 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="8898384" data-case-paths="/us/539/0510-01">123 S.Ct. 2527</a> (articulating the prevailing standard for assessing prejudice from deficient stewardship in the presentation of mitigation evidence in terms of whether “there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.”).

Appellant, however, does not argue that he told counsel of his involvement, was ready and willing to testify about his involvement at the penalty phase, or that there was any reason for counsel to be aware of and ask him about it. Therefore, Appellant has not proven the arguable merit prong of his claim of counsel ineffectiveness because he has not demonstrated that the evidence existed or was available to counsel.</p>

Brief for Appellant at 10. Defining his burden at the outset of his brief and adequately meeting the burden of developing his substantive claims, however, are not the same thing. When it comes to demonstrating trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for acting or failing to act in specific instances, Appellant has, as noted, opted for assertions of ineffectiveness rather than attempting to demonstrate, for example, how or why the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the act or omission in question. <em>See Rios, </em><a href="/pa/591/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="321" data-cite="920 A.2d 790" data-case-ids="3014692,8325303" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0583-01,/a2d/920/0790-01">920 A.2d at 799</a>.

Whether the Commonwealth failed to argue prejudice is not relevant: it is Appellant's burden to prove ineffectiveness. What the Commonwealth chooses to argue, or not argue, as the case may be, does not lesson Appellant’s burden in this regard. We are troubled by the Commonwealth's failure to advocate this case, and specifically reference the Commonwealth's one sentence answer on this issue before the PCRA court and one paragraph argument before this Court.

In his dissenting opinion, Justice Saylor emphasizes Reid's lack of experience and the short time allotted for the mitigation investigation. It appears to be Justice Saylor's position that any mitigation investigation that begins following the guilty verdict is <em>per se </em>unreasonable, without regard to whether counsel had a mitigation strategy that resulted in a thoughtful effort to convince the jury to spare Appellant's life. In a general sense, we share Justice Saylor's concern about the lack of time dedicated to investigating mitigation. We do not believe, however, that this factor alone renders counsels’ performance unreasonable. In this case, counsel prepared a mitigation case. As described above, there was an investigation: counsel investigated Appellant's family history, talked to Appellant and his family numerous times, and secured the testimony of Appellant’s mother and Mr. Stephens. Through this investigation, counsel became aware of Appellant's life <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>history, but found nothing that should have caused them to investigate further or alter their judgment that evidence of family history and poverty would not fit into their strategy of arguing that Appellant's life deserved to be spared because Appellant had previously saved the life of Mr. Stephens.</p>

Along with that filing, Attorney Ñolas offered that his organization would be willing to represent appellant if it were appointed to do so by the trial court. <em>See </em>Ñolas Letter to Washington County Clerk of Court, 6/5/96. The following year, on May 15, 1997, Ñolas and co-counsel Robert Dunham, Esquire, who were then associated with a successor Pennsylvania capital defense organization with the moniker Center for Legal Education and Defense Assistance (CLEADA), renewed the request to be appointed to represent appellant. In an opinion dated June 6, 1997, the PCRA judge denied the request, noting that appellant was not entitled to appointed counsel of his choice, and that competent PCRA defense counsel was available for appointment in the county. The court appointed a local attorney to represent appellant; the initial appointed PCRA counsel was permitted to withdraw, however, and the court then appointed Peter K. Darragh, Esquire.</p>

Counsel has filed substantial pleadings, and the PCRA litigation strategy employed throughout was arrived at with the benefit of consultation with the Federal Defender. The Federal Defenders are well-financed, sophisticated and capable capital defense advocates. They well know—better than this Court knows—the effect that their state-side litigation advice and decisions will have <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>upon the prospect for’federal habeas corpus relief. I believe that the structure and content of appellant’s petition below, and his Brief in this appeal, are the result of a fully realized capital collateral litigation strategy, one whose primary concern is with laying the groundwork for anticipated federal habeas corpus relief.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[307,637,1163,974]]]'>This Brief, like other briefs filed by the Federal Defender in the same general time frame, poses the issues in a very distinct and deliberate way. In its statement of the scope and standard of review, in its summary of argument, and in the lengthy preamble to the argument (entitled “Eligibility For Relief And The Nature Of Appellant’s Claims”), the Brief is careful to characterize claims in the alternative. Thus, the Brief first declares that appellant is eligible for relief on his “substantive claims of federal constitutional error.” In this regard, the Brief says that appellant “seeks substantive review of his claims under the established principles of constitutional law noted in this brief’ and cites the direct review harmless error standard. The Brief then asserts, as “additional claims,” that the same arguments entitle appellant to relief under the rubric of ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, the Brief poses, as a third version of the same basic claims, that appellant is entitled to relief under “State Law” and the PCRA, which counsel would have us believe is different than federal law. .

A preserved “constitutional” claim, subject to a direct appeal standard of review (where harmless error would have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the Commonwealth), is preferable to a derivative constitutional claim, such as ineffective assistance of counsel. Under <em>Strickland, </em>there is a presumption of competency to overcome, mere error is not enough if counsel acted reasonably, and actual prejudice must be proven by the defense. A defendant with counsel who are savvy to federal habeas standards would make every effort to pose his state collateral claims in a way that maximizes the prospect of securing the more favorable review standard. I believe that it is highly likely that counsel in this case have their federal strategy carefully mapped out, <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>and that strategy dictated the form of the Brief, including the allocation of space to development of direct review claims versus collateral claims. It is a strategy that may be borne of an anticipation that, if and when appellant proceeds to federal review, he will argue something along the lines of: I posed my PCRA claims as claims of direct constitutional error in state court; I was entitled to do so under relaxed waiver or some other theory; the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s findings of procedural default should not be honored; and my underlying claims therefore should be reviewed, on their merits, without deferring to anything the Pennsylvania state courts had to say. Even with respect to appellant’s alternative allegations of counsel ineffectiveness, collateral counsel will probably articulate a theory of why they believe the state defaults this Court has found should be disregarded.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[140,1115,1162,1241]]]'>Material briefing deficiencies respecting the <em>Strickland </em>versions of appellant’s claims are important to this Court, of course, because Pennsylvania law does not permit appellants to pursue waived claims, and <em>Strickland </em>claims are not self-proving. But, as I have addressed elsewhere, there is a difference between what this Court has the power to do, given the terms of the PCRA, and the respect our restrained decisions will be shown on federal habeas review. <em>See Ford, </em><a href="/a2d/809/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="367" data-cite="809 A.2d 325" data-case-ids="11424113,270339" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0325-01,/pa/570/0378-01">809 A.2d at </a>846 n. 8. State court defendants with an eye toward federal habeas relief have a powerful incentive to seize upon whatever they can to argue that state courts have engaged in unequal treatment, or have unreasonably failed to review the defendant’s preferred form of his claims, thereby opening the door for <em>de novo </em>federal consideration. And a lower federal court with a predisposition to engaging in non-deferential <em>de novo </em>review whenever possible will be receptive to such arguments. This Court has no control over how the federal courts will construe our decisions; we must simply discharge our duties. And, to the extent we would concern ourselves with the coin-flip that is federal habeas review, the result can be very bad law, since every state court response to a particularly egregious, unusual circumstance will be argued, in federal court, as proof that state rules of procedural default are uneven and should not be honored.</p>

Appellant’s counsel may view compliance with <em>Strickland </em>(and the PCRA itself) as a comparative waste of time (and briefing space): the familiar tone and content of the Brief here indicate as much. Counsel may believe that the less that is said about the ineffectiveness claims, the easier it will be to claim in federal court that appellant was not obliged to raise his waived “constitutional” claims here under the derivative guise of <em>Strickland. </em>Of course, absent a hearing and counsel’s candid testimony, we cannot know counsel’s strategy for sure, and counsel may be disinclined to reveal it, particularly where appellant has not sought counsel’s removal. What is plainly apparent, however, is that the briefing in this case is not a function of negligence or inattention—it is deliberate and sophisticated, if not entirely candid. And, given the federal court’s seeming receptiveness to theories allowing them to ignore Pennsylvania state court procedural defaults in capital cases, it cannot be said that counsel’s PCRA briefing strategy is unreasonable. Counsel simply has a different agenda.</p>

In finding reasonable strategy, the majority also faults Appellant for failing to advise counsel of childhood abuse. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 402 n. 28, 961 A.2d at 822 n. 28.

Counsel testified that his overriding strategy in the penalty proceedings was to "try to put doubt back into [the juror’s] minds.” N.T., May 30, 2000, at 73; <em>accord id. </em>at 196 (reflecting counsel’s characterization of residual doubt as "the only chance we had”). Even if such strategy was not ill conceived in the first instance when viewed against the Commonwealth's case for guilt, proper implementation obviously would require reasonable sensitivity to the jurors’ perspective.

Further, although the majority repeatedly indicates that Appellant has failed to "prove” elements of his claims, <em>see, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion at 405-06, 961 A.2d at 824, it bears repeating that he was not permitted to develop his primary proofs on an evidentiary record.
