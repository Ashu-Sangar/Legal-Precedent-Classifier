Generally speaking, the compulsory joinder statute sets forth the requirements for when a current prosecution is precluded due to a former prosecution for a different offense. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude the Superior Court properly found that the instant prosecution for criminal conspiracy was barred by the compulsory joinder statute because the offenses “occurred within the same judicial district” as a former prosecution. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 110(l)(ii). Contrary to the Superior Court, however, we also find the offenses of possession of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia did not occur in the same judicial district as the prior prosecution, and thus, were not barred by Section 110. Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the Superior Court.</p>

The trial court found in relevant part that on June <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>24, 2003, Michael Boudwin, a Detective working for the Delaware County Criminal Investigation Division, contacted Montgomery County Detective Reginald Roberts and informed him that he had information concerning cocaine trafficking by Appellee Edward Borzelleca, a Montgomery County resident. Detective Boudwin described a meeting an undercover detective and Borzelleca had planned on June 26, 2003 at Barnaby’s, a restaurant located in Havertown, Delaware County. Detective Boudwin informed Detective Roberts that Borzelleca owned a Subaru automobile and that Borzelleca would travel in his car from his Montgomery County residence to the meeting at Barnaby’s.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[296,966,1164,947]]]'>On June 26, 2003, at 2:15 p.m., Montgomery County police set up a surveillance of Borzelleca’s residence. Detective Boudwin spoke with Detective Roberts and told him that Borzelleca planned to meet with his supplier known as “Mike”—Appellee Michael Fithian—and thereafter travel with Fithian from Montgomery County to Delaware County to meet with Detective John Newell, an undercover detective employed by the Delaware County Criminal Investigation Division. At 4:00 p.m., Borzelleca, while at his Montgomery County residence, telephoned Detective Newell to arrange for the sale of two ounces of cocaine to Detective Newell for $1,900. The trial court noted that while Borzelleca told Detective Newell who the men wanted to meet at Barnaby’s, it was Detective Newell that requested Borzelleca and Fithian come to Delaware County to Barnaby’s to make the sale. At 4:30 p.m., Fithian called Detective Newell to ask him to “front” the money. Detective Newell was to ride with Borzelleca and Fithian, who was to join them, back to Montgomery County.</p>
    <p id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.6",234,[294,1938,1161,307]]]'>At 4:48 p.m., Montgomery County police observed Borzelleca leave his residence and followed him to a street address in Flourtown, Montgomery County. There, the police saw Borzelleca meet with Fithian. Thereafter, Fithian was seen entering a Dodge pickup truck, and Fithian followed Borzelleca’s vehicle down Route 476 to Barnaby’s.</p>
    <p id="b234-7" data-blocks='[["BL_234.7",234,[297,2270,1159,94]],["BL_235.1",235,[141,313,1157,456]]]'>At 5:30 p.m., Borzelleca and Fithian met with Detective Newell at Barnaby’s. After a brief conversation, Borzelleca <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>walked to Fithian’s Dodge truck where Fithian appeared to be removing packaging material. Borzelleca and Fithian departed in Borzelleca’s Subaru, and Detective Newell followed in his vehicle. Borzelleca and Fithian planned to drive both vehicles to Montgomery County and purchase two ounces of cocaine for Detective Newell and one ounce for themselves. While in Montgomery County, the vehicles stopped at a bar so that Borzelleca and Fithian could obtain money to buy the cocaine.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[141,803,1159,1162]]]'>The vehicles then traveled out of Montgomery County, and entered Philadelphia County where Borzelleca, Fithian and Detective Newell made the actual purchase of the cocaine. Once in Philadelphia County, Borzelleca, Fithian and Detective Newell met with the supplier of the cocaine, although there is some inconsistency as to what occurred. According to a report prepared by Montgomery County Detective Roberts, the supplier sold one ounce of cocaine to Borzelleca and Fithian, and two ounces of cocaine directly to Detective New-ell. Detective Newell’s probable cause affidavit, however, offers a slightly different version of events. Specifically, Detective Newell contended that Fithian gave Borzelleca three bags of cocaine, and that Borzelleca handed two bags of cocaine to Detective Newell. After inspecting the cocaine, Detective Newell gave Borzelleca $1,900, and Borzelleca handed the money to Fithian. Borzelleca told Detective Newell that the third bag of cocaine was for the person at the bar. Without reconciling the discrepancy, the trial court noted that both versions of the events were consistent that the transfer occurred in Philadelphia County and that Detective Newell did not receive the cocaine or transfer the money in Delaware County.</p>
    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[142,1991,1153,246]]]'>Thereafter, Borzelleca and Fithian returned to Montgomery County in the Subaru and were stopped on Route 476 in Montgomery County by the Pennsylvania State Police. The police recovered approximately one ounce of cocaine from the interior of the Subaru.</p>

The Delaware County District Attorney’s Office filed a criminal complaint the same day charging both men with criminal conspiracy, possession of a controlled substance, and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Fithian was also charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. The Delaware County complaints alleged that Borzelleca and Fithian arranged the sale of two ounces of cocaine in Delaware County with Detective Newell, and the Delaware County District Attorney sought to prosecute them for conspiracy and the delivery of the cocaine in Philadelphia.</p>

Before the trial court, the Commonwealth contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Delaware prosecution did not arise from the same criminal episode occurring in the same judicial district as the former Montgomery County prosecution. The trial court retraced the chain of events noted above and concluded that the conspiracy to sell the two ounces of cocaine to Detective Newell occurred in both Delaware and Montgomery County. That being the case, the conspiracy that formed the basis for the Delaware County prosecution occurred within the same judicial district as the Montgomery County prosecution. This satisfied one of the requirements of the compulsory joinder statute, described in greater detail below. ■ According to the trial court, the <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>Montgomery County officials elected to prosecute the men for the one ounce of cocaine seized in the traffic stop on Route 476 and either expressly or tacitly agreed to allow Delaware prosecutors to prosecute the balance of Borzelleca and Fithian’s criminality. The trial court concluded the subsequent Delaware County prosecution was barred by Section 110.</p>

The Delaware County offenses of conspiracy and intent to deliver involved the delivery of two different bags of cocaine to Detective Newell. The Delaware County offenses spanned Montgomery County, Delaware County, and Philadelphia County. Thus, the Commonwealth contends the Delaware County offenses did not occur solely within the fixed limits of the same judicial district as the former prosecution in Montgomery County; rather, the conduct occurred in Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia Counties. As the conduct that formed the basis for the Delaware County offenses brought in that judicial district did not occur in the same judicial district as the former prosecution, Montgomery County, the fourth prong of Section 110(l)(ii) is not satisfied.

Borzelleca and Fithian argue that the offenses that form the basis of the prosecution in Delaware County originated in Montgomery County with telephone calls from Borzelleca and Fithian to Detective Newell. The only portion of the transactions at issue taking place in Delaware County was the meeting between Borzelleca, Fithian, and Detective Newell at Barnaby’s. The men then returned to Montgomery County and the actual drug transaction occurred in Philadelphia County.

In light of this history, it is clear to us that the General Assembly intended to incorporate, or perhaps re-incorporate, a geographic component in determining which offenses are precluded because of a former prosecution. That is, the legislature intended that the compulsory joinder statute be limited to mandating joinder only of those offenses occurring in a single judicial district.</p>

Prior to their meeting with Detective Newell, Borzelleca and Fithian spoke with one another and met in Montgomery County. While Detective Newell requested that Borzelleca and Fithian come to Delaware County even though they told him the supplier of the cocaine was in Montgomery County, this was the only activity that occurred exclusively in Delaware County. After meeting at Barnaby’s (in Delaware County), Detective Newell, Borzelleca and Fithian drove in two separate cars to a bar in Montgomery County to secure money for the drug purchase. The drug transaction was finalized in Philadelphia County when the drugs Detective Newell arranged to purchase were delivered to him. At that point, Detective Newell returned to Delaware County, and Fithian and Borzelleca drove to Montgomery County, where they were arrested.</p>

As a corollary, we conclude that a conspiracy “occurs” in any of these locales. It is clear from the above that the offense of criminal conspiracy to deliver the two ounces of cocaine spanned Montgomery, Delaware, and Philadelphia Counties. As this is the case, the offense of conspiracy to deliver two ounces of cocaine to Detective Newell “occurred within the same judicial district as the former. prosecution” for the conspiracy to deliver one ounce of cocaine—Montgomery County. Therefore, consistent with the conclusions of the lower tribunals in this matter, we find that the Delaware County conspiracy offense is barred by the compulsory joinder statute.</p>

Rather than engaging in an analysis of where the offenses occurred, the lower tribunals reverted to an analysis of where the non-conspiracy charges could have been brought, concluding that they could have been brought in Montgomery County and, accordingly, that there was no reason not to have consolidated all charges against Fithian and Borzelleca in Montgomery County. While it may be true that all the charges could have been brought in Montgomery County, this is not the proper analysis. Section 110 is a statute of preclusion due to a former prosecution. As noted above, the proper analysis, pursuant to our interpretation of Section 110(l)(ii), focuses upon whether the offense occurred within the same judicial district. As these offenses took place solely within Philadelphia County, they did not occur “within the same judicial district as the former prosecution,” Montgomery County. Therefore, the Delaware County prosecution for the charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver, and possession of drug paraphernalia, is not barred by the compulsory joinder statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>
