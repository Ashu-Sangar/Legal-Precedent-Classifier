The uncontradicted trial testimony revealed that at about 1:30 p.m, Garnett was in the living room of his second floor apartment when he heard a loud crashing noise. He went to investigate and came upon Appellant raising his second floor bathroom window in an apparent attempt to break into the apartment. Garnett recognized Appellant from the neighborhood and called 911 from his cell phone as he ran out of the apartment, forgetting his keys. When the police arrived a short time later, Garnett was unable to let them into the building, and ran back up the fire escape. Upon entering his apartment, he observed Appellant inside with Garnett’s VCR in his hands. Appellant escaped out a second-story window carrying a duffel bag.</p>

Apparently anticipating the Commonwealth would seek application of the two-strikes provision in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9714—which, as we discuss more fully below, provides a mandatory minimum sentence when a defendant commits a second “crime of violence” including, <em>inter alia, </em>“burglary of a structure adapted for overnight accommodation in which at the time of the offense any person is present,” <em>id. </em>§ 9714(g)—the trial judge indicated in her PaiR.A.P.1925(a) opinion that she offered the Commonwealth the opportunity to request a separate finding by the jury that Garnett was present at the time of the November 13, 2003 burglary, but the Commonwealth declined.

The Commonwealth then contended Appellant’s conviction for the Garnett burglary constituted a second strike under Section 9714 because the evidence at trial revealed that Garnett was at home, in a building adapted for overnight accommodations, when Appellant perpetrated the burglary, and thus this constituted a “crime of violence” under that <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>section. Appellant countered that because the bill of information charging him with the Garnett burglary did not specify that a person was present, and because the jury was not specifically asked to make such a factual determination, the burglary conviction could not qualify as a “crime of violence” and thus should not count as a second strike.</p>

The trial court thus requested the Superior Court to remand the matter for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>The Superior Court disagreed with the trial judge’s change of heart, however, concluding instead that the trial court’s original application of the second-strike provision was appropriate despite the absence of a specific jury finding that the Garnett residence was occupied at the time of the burglary, and affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, the plain language of the statute indicates that the sentencing court, and not the jury, must determine whether the crime in question was a crime of violence by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, despite the reference to “conviction” in relation to a crime of violence in subsection (a)(1), the Legislature clearly intended the elements in Section 9714 to be determined at sentencing. Moreover, as the Commonwealth suggests, Appellant’s assertion that the statute should be interpreted as mandating the burglary-related crime of violence in Section 9714(g) be charged in the bill of information, or requiring a <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>specific jury instruction and finding would essentially redefine the statutory definition of burglary, which is not our role.
