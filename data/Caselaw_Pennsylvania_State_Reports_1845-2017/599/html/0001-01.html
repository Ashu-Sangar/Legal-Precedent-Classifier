He also seriously wounded Sandip Patel, pointed his loaded pistol at George Thomas II, set fire to Mrs. Gordon’s house by using an incendiary device, desecrated one synagogue by defacing it with red spray paint and shooting bullets into it, and desecrated a second synagogue by shooting bullets into it. Appellant was arrested on the day of the crime spree and was found to have in his possession a .357 caliber handgun, spent .357 caliber shell casings, live .357 caliber ammunition, two Molotov cocktails, a can of red spray paint, <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>and a roadmap.

A jury trial on the charges was thereafter held from April 27 to May 9, 2001. During trial, Appellant did not dispute that he had shot the victims; rather, he presented evidence that he had done so while suffering from a mental disease.

Lebanon. The responding firefighters, and police officers who later arrived at the scene, discovered at this residence the body of Anita Gordon, an Orthodox Jew, who had been shot multiple times in the chest, abdomen, and both hands, and who exhibited no signs of life. An incendiary device known as a Molotov cocktail was also discovered as having been thrown and ignited in a first-floor bedroom of the Gordon residence. During the discovery of the violence perpetrated at the Gordon residence, police began to receive reports regarding other nearby acts of violence, <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>specifically, shootings occurring at the Beth El Synagogue, 1.3 miles from the Gordon residence, and at the Scott Towne Center, a strip mall less than one mile from the synagogue.

Finder was able to identify Appellant as the driver of the Jeep. Dennis Wisniewski testified that on the day of the incident he was stopped at a red light three car lengths from the synagogue when he heard a bang and turned to see a man matching Appellant’s description discharging five or six pistol rounds into the synagogue. Wisniewski testified that he then observed the shooter walk casually back to a black Jeep Cherokee. Philip Balk, a member of the synagogue, testified that at approximately 2:00 p.m., he arrived at the scene to observe that windows had been broken out and that a swastika and the word “Jew” had been spray-painted in red paint on the building. Detective Edward Adams of the Allegheny County Police testified that when he arrived at the synagogue at approximately 2:50 p.m., he observed the broken glass and the desecration with the red spray paint.

Appellant turned and followed the man into the store; McClusky then heard three more gunshots. Appellant left the establishment, made eye contact with McClusky, and then walked slowly, calmly, and collectedly toward a lower area of the mall parking lot.

The Commonwealth’s psychiatric expert in some part relied upon this recording in forming his opinion that Appellant had acted from racist motives rather than from a mental illness. Appellant had moved to suppress the evidence of the telephone conversation pre-trial, arguing that it. violated Section 5704(14) of the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (Wiretap Act), 18 Pa.C.S. § 5704(14), because there had purportedly been no written notification that the conversation would be recorded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Appellant also argued that Section 5704(14) of the Wiretap Act was violated a second time when the contents of the recorded conversation were divulged to a detective and the Commonwealth’s psychiatric expert.</p>

Further, the court found that evidence adduced at the hearing established that Appellant and his parents were actually aware that their telephone conversations were being recorded. Indeed, during the March 2, 2001 conversation, Appellant’s father warned Appellant that the conversation was being recorded by prison authorities. Finally, the court determined that the contents of the conversation were properly divulged pursuant to the Wiretap Act’s directive that contents of recorded conversations may be divulged in connection with “the prosecution or investigation of any crime.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5704(14)(i)(C).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Accordingly, the court determined that the Wiretap Act had not been violated because Appellant had received prior written and aural notice—and had actual notice as well—that his telephone conversations were being recorded by prison personnel, and because the contents of the conversation were divulged in conformance with the statute.</p>

Appellant’s new counsel also obtained an affidavit from the head of operations at the jail when Appellant was incarcerated there, who confirmed that the prison handbook did not contain written notice to inmates regarding the interception and recording of their telephone conversations. Based on this information, Appellant argued in post-trial motions, as he is arguing now before us, that the telephone conversation at issue was made in violation of Section 5704(14)(i)(A) of the Wiretap Act, as that section requires <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>written, not other, notice. The trial court rejected this argument, noting that the fact that Appellant actually knew that his conversation was being recorded controlled the disposition of the issue. Further, the court determined that Section 5704(14)(i)(A) of the Wiretap Act did not require written notice to every inmate individually, but only prior written notice to the existing inmates before a correctional facility could implement a program of intercepting and recording inmate telephone conversations. This determination was based on the court’s reading of the subparagraph relied on by Appellant for his argument, to wit, “Before the implementation of this paragraph, all inmates of the facility shall be notified in writing that, as of the effective date of this paragraph, their telephone conversations may be intercepted, recorded, monitored or divulged.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5704(14)(i)(A) (emphasis added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Simply stated, there is no basis to conclude that the privacy rights of Appellant or his parents were infringed when their March 2, 2001 telephone conversation was recorded. These individuals were actually aware that their telephone conversation was being or could be intercepted and recorded by prison authorities. Written notice to Appellant, assuming he never received any, would not have afforded him any greater protection of his right to privacy or that of his parents than the actual notice they possessed at the time of the conversation.

(1) only as is necessary to safeguard the orderly operation of the facility; (2) pursuant to a court order; or (3) in the prosecution or investigation of any crime.

The parents’ accusation was based on Commonwealth evidence, by this point shared with the defense, that while in prison, Appellant had autographed for another inmate newspaper or magazine articles on controversial racial issues and had made racist remarks in conversation with this inmate. The Commonwealth sought publication of the redacted portion of the March 2, 2001 telephone conversation to corroborate the truth of the inmate’s testimony regarding these events based on Appellant’s admission on the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>tape that he had engaged in this conduct. Additionally, the Commonwealth sought to bolster its case that Appellant had committed the crimes because of his racism and not because of insanity, based on Appellant’s failure to deny his parents’ charge that he was a racist.

Upon careful review of the record, we are persuaded that Appellant’s death sentences were not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, but rather resulted from properly introduced evidence that Appellant intentionally and deliberately shot to death Anita Gordon, Anil Thakur, Ji-Ye Sun, Thao Pak Pham, and Garry Lee. We also conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the two aggravating factors found by the jury in relation to the killings. There is no doubt that “[i]n the commission of the offense [Appellant] knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7). When Appellant shot Ji-Ye Sun and Thao Pak Pham, he created a grave risk of death to David Tucker, who was present in the restaurant when Appellant opened fire multiple times on his victims. In fact, Pham was shot just two to three feet away from Tucker as he was running past Tucker, who was trying to “dodge” the danger that was unfolding before him. N.T. Trial, 4/30/01, at 433-35.

The two items of contrary evidence upon which Appellant now relies (the handbook itself and an affidavit of a jail employee) were not brought onto the record of the suppression hearing, but apparently were obtained by Appellant’s counsel after sentencing. As the Commonwealth explains, however, such items are not appropriately considered in this Court’s direct review of the suppression court’s ruling, as they were not before the court at that time. Accordingly, although Appellant may have claims of deficient stewardship to assert during post-conviction proceedings, I do not believe that his argument in this direct appeal is cognizable on the terms on which it is presented.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

Given the number of witnesses presented and the passionate character of many of the statements, I find this to be a close case in terms of whether the trial court exceeded its discretion in this regard. I also recognize, however, that the Constitution does not foreclose evidence of the harm caused by the defendant in capital sentencing proceedings, <em>see Payne v.

Thus, although I agree with the majority that no relief is due here, given that we are seeing fairly wide differences across cases in terms of the degree of control exercised by the trial courts over the development of victim impact evidence, I believe that the Court would be well advised to consider exercising its rulemaking function to impose some structural limitations.</p>

      <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>First, as to Baumhammers’ argument that the Commonwealth violated the Wiretap Act in recording his telephone conversations with his parents while he was incarcerated awaiting trial, I agree with the result reached by Justice McCaffery, but on narrower grounds. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 28-30, 960 A.2d at 76-80. I would explicitly adopt the parsing of the relevant statute by the trial judge, the Honorable Jeffery A.

Op., 12/29/05, at 14; <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5704(14)(i)(A).

First, Baumhammers asserts the trial court erred in not granting him a change of venue or venire; his trial counsel, however, specifically opposed either suggestion when raised by the trial court. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 23-29, 960 A.2d at 73-76. Accordingly, this argument is waived for purposes of direct appeal. Second, Baumhammers asserts the trial court erred in not excluding particular victim impact evidence, <em>see </em>Majority Op. at 54-58, 960 A.2d at 92-94; however, his trial counsel did not specifically object to the introduction of testimony from any of the particular victims. Accordingly, this argument is also waived for purposes of direct appeal. Third, Baumhammers asserts that his rights under the Confrontation Clause, in light of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em><a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">541 U.S. 36</a>, <a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">124 S.Ct. 1354</a>, <a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="185" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">158 L.Ed.2d 177</a> (2004), were violated when Dr. Michael Weiner testified about conversations regarding Baumhammers which Dr. Weiner had with a variety of non-testifying individuals. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 58-60, 960 A.2d at 94-96. Again, Baumhammers’ trial counsel did not object at trial, and so this argument is waived for purposes of direct appeal. Nevertheless, in each of these instances, the majority continues on to address the merits of the waived <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>claims.

With limited exception, under <em>Grant, </em>we foreclose a prisoner on direct appeal from recasting waived claims in terms of counsel’s ineffectiveness, requiring such appellant to defer such claims until collateral appeal, no matter how potentially meritorious. As a corollary, we ought similarly to resist discussion of the merits of such claims on direct appeal, as our discussion could prejudice the collateral appeal courts’ proper consideration of the relevant issues.</p>
