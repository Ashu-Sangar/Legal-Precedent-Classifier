The City denied the request on behalf of Council Members Bodack and Burns on the basis that (1) the records were excludable under the Right-to-Know Act because they contained private telephone numbers, which, if revealed, could potentially result in danger to the owners of the telephone numbers and/or danger that persons would be reluctant to contact the City regarding local problems; and (2) such bills were not, in general, public records subject to the Right-to-Know Act because the council members had reimbursed the City for their cellular telephone usage.</p>

Thus, the court concluded that the telephone bills, unredacted, fell within an exception to the definition of “public record.” Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court reversed the decision of the trial court ordering disclosure of the telephone bills “as-is.” More particularly, the Commonwealth Court held that the telephone numbers on the bills must be redacted before the bills are eligible for public release.</p>

Thus, because there is a charge for the call, the incoming number is often displayed on the cellular phone bill. This fact ...

Again, we did not hold that the agency was required to prove, with respect to each individual address, social security number, or telephone number, that disclosure would operate to the prejudice or impairment of that person’s reputation or personal security. Rather, it was clear from our holding that the very nature of such information may render disclosure thereof by an agency a threat to privacy, reputation, or personal security.

The Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that while, initially, the telephone bills were public records subject to disclosure, as they were financial records of a public agency, they nevertheless included information that could “potentially impair the reputation or personal security of another.” <em>Pennsylvania State University, supra </em>at 538 (emphasis added). Moreover, the court did not err when it determined that such “potential impairment outweighed the public interest in the dissemination of the records at issue.” <em>Id. </em>Here, no strong public interest in the disclosure of individual telephone numbers is apparent from the record. Indeed, Appellants have failed to set forth any cogent argument that the disclosure of the telephone numbers in the requested cellular telephone bills would serve a strong public function, whether those telephone numbers were possessed by individuals, businesses, or other entities.</p>

However, the strong intrinsic interest of the possessor of telephone numbers to privacy, reputation, or personal security may not be lightly set aside; and the agency opposing disclosure of such personal information is not, under our case law, required to prove item-by-item that each person or entity who may be affected will potentially suffer a threat to privacy, reputation, or personal security.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Moreover, as the Commonwealth Court observed, it is because cellular telephones are involved in this case that the telephone numbers of callers to the council members are listed on the bills at all. Thus, disclosure of these numbers when such numbers would not exist on telephone bills for “land lines” would be arbitrary. In this ease, the strong public interest in disclosure of how the agency spends public funds is met by disclosure of redacted bills and information concerning whether the agency received reimbursement for private use of public equipment.</p>

Because of the patently strong privacy interest in shielding the telephone numbers from disclosure and the weak, perhaps non-existent public interest in favor of disclosure of the telephone numbers, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court correctly determined that the telephone numbers must be redacted from the telephone bills prior to the public disclosure of those bills under the Right-to-Know Act. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
