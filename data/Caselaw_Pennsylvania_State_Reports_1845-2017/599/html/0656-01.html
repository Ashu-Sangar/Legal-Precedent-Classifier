Op., 4/21/05, at 6. Regardless of the ongoing viability of this aspect of <em>Trombetta, </em>it is clear that Appellees had access to "comparable evidence.” In <em>Trombetta, </em>the high Court classified as comparable evidence (1) challenges to the reliability of the test; (2) cross-examination of test administrators; (3) assertions that particular characteristics (for example, in the breathalyzer context, the suspect's diet) were present which were likely to undermine the accuracy of the results; and (4) the possibility of human error. <a href="/us/467/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="467 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="6202648" data-case-paths="/us/467/0479-01">467 U.S. at 490</a>, <a href="/us/467/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="467 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="6202648" data-case-paths="/us/467/0479-01">104 S.Ct. 2528</a>. All those strategies were available to Appellees in the instant case. Additionally, preliminary hearing testimony reveals Appellees contracted with Elk Environmental to remediate the property, arid Elk contracted with GLA Laboratories to perform independent tests on soil samples from the property, taken in October of 2002, which also showed unlawfully high concentrations of lead. N.T. Hearing, 3/28/05, at 55-56. While these additional tests could not be used to prove Appellees' guilt, since the criminal complaint references only environmental violations committed between June 2001 and August 2002, had Appellees' independent tests revealed levels of toxins in the soil which were within the statutory limits just a short time after the Commonwealth's tests revealed the opposite, it would certainly have buttressed Appellees' argument that the tests do not provide consistent results sufficient to prove Appellees’ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and provided Appellees with a reasonable opportunity to contest the Commonwealth’s evidence.
