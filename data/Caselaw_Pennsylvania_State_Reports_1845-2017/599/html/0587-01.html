The 1972 Official Comment to 18 Pa.C.S. § 905 states that “[u]nder the [predecessor] conspiracy provision, 18 P.S. § 4302, the conspiracy is punishable by a maximum of two years' imprisonment whether there is a conspiracy to commit murder or to commit a trespass. Under the new Code, the penalty for conspiracy, as for attempts and solicitation, is the same as the penalty for the most serious offense which is an object of the conspiracy....” The principal thrust of this comment is to contrast the old and the new general conspiracy provisions to indicate that the new Code authorizes a greater <em>maximum </em>sentence. The comment cannot be read to expand the scope of the mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentencing statute at issue in this case, 35 P.S. § 780-113(k).</p>

Reeves </em><a href="/a2d/778/0691-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="778 A.2d 691" data-case-ids="9496743" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/0691-01">778 A.2d 691</a> (Pa.Super.2001) to support the application of the mandatory minimum sentencing provision to Appellant's conspiracy conviction in the instant case. That reliance is misplaced. <em>Reeves </em>did not involve the issue of whether a mandatory minimum sentence applied to a conspiracy conviction. The minimum sentencing statute in <em>Reeves </em>clearly included conspiracy among the crimes to which it applied. The dispute in <em>Reeves </em>involved whether a separate element of the minimum sentencing statute at issue in that case had been met. This case involves no similar issue.</p>
