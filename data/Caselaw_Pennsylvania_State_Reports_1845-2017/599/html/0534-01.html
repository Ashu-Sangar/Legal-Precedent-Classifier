The court summarized the relevant legal conclusions of <em>Johnstonm Tribune </em>as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[343,668,1123,1497]]]'>Our holding in <em>Johnstown Tribune </em>was premised upon basic principles of statutory construction as well as privacy concerns. A coroner’s statutory duty under the Coroner’s Act is to ascertain the cause and manner of suspicious deaths. <em>Johnstown Tribune, </em><a href="/a2d/871/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="871 A.2d 324" data-case-ids="8977053" data-case-paths="/a2d/871/0324-01">871 A.2d at 328</a>. <em>See also </em>Section 1237 of the Coroner’s Act, 16 P.S. § 1237 (describing a coroner’s duties and the narrow purpose of a coroner’s investigation); Section 1238 of the Coroner’s Act, 16 P.S. § 1238 (requiring an autopsy only when the coroner’s investigation is inconclusive as to cause and manner of death). Thus, the legislature’s use of the word “official” in the phrase “official records and papers” is significant. It implies that there are “unofficial” records within the coroner’s custody that are not subject to disclosure. It follows that the “official” records that a coroner must deposit with the prothonotary are those that state the cause of death and whether it was the result of criminal conduct. <em>Johnstown Tribune, </em><a href="/a2d/871/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="871 A.2d 324" data-case-ids="8977053" data-case-paths="/a2d/871/0324-01">871 A.2d at 328</a>. We also determined in <em>Johnstown Tribune </em>that if autopsy reports were included as part of the “official” records, an irreconcilable conflict would arise between Section 1251 and Section 1236.1(c) of the Coroner’s Act, which allows for the coroner to charge and collect a fee of up to one hundred dollars ($100) for an autopsy report. Finally, this Court noted that if autopsy reports were to become part of the official record, much more than the cause and manner of death could be revealed to the public, such as potentially privileged information related to the decedent’s medical history and graphic photographs taken during the autopsy. <em><a href="/a2d/871/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="871 A.2d 324" data-case-ids="8977053" data-case-paths="/a2d/871/0324-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/871/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="871 A.2d 324" data-case-ids="8977053" data-case-paths="/a2d/871/0324-01">at 329</a>.</blockquote>

We determined that the Superior Court’s interpretation was “certainly reasonable,” as the phrase “official records and papers” was “broadly stated ... and the parties do not dispute that autopsy reports are covered material.” <em>Buchanan, supra </em>at 624, <a href="/pa/583/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="880 A.2d 568" data-case-ids="687753,687764,8937289,8937380" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0620-01,/pa/583/0619-01,/a2d/880/0568-01,/a2d/880/0568-02">880 A.2d at 571</a>. The Commonwealth Court concluded that <em>Buchanan </em>was not controlling because (1) the decision only characterized <em>Dillon’s </em>interpretation as “certainly reasonable” but did not expressly adopt it; and (2) the <em>Buchanan </em>Court was not required to resolve the issue because the parties agreed that autopsy reports were material encompassed by Section 1251.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Commonwealth Court further noted that, unlike <em>Johnstoum Tribune, Dillon </em>was not premised upon any statutory analysis of the Coroner’s Act but merely <em>assumed </em>that autopsy reports were covered under Section 1251. In addition, the Commonwealth Court stated that <em>Buchanan </em>and <em>Dillon </em>are distinguishable, because, unlike the instant case, those cases “addressed the balance between the public’s interest in information about the cause and manner of death and the Commonwealth’s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of such information during an ongoing criminal investigation.” <em>Penn Jersey Advance, </em><a href="/a2d/910/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="910 A.2d 120" data-case-ids="8445805" data-case-paths="/a2d/910/0120-01">910 A.2d at 124</a>. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court’s grant of mandamus in both cases. For the reasons that follow, we reject the Commonwealth Court’s conclusions.</p>

This inherent power provides trial courts with the'means to limit public access to autopsy reports (or portions thereof) based on privacy or privilege concerns where warranted. For example, if graphic photographs or items of information subject to a claim of privilege are included as part of an autopsy report, anyone seeking to protect an interest in such material, and having standing to do so, can seek appropriate relief from the trial court. •</p>

By the terms of Section 1251, the records that a coroner must deposit with the prothonotary are not available until thirty days after the end of each year, at which time interested persons may' “inspect” such records. Section 1236.1, which is entitled “Requests for examinations and reports,” authorizes a coroner to charge up to $100 for each autopsy report, without mention of any time requirement. 16 P.S. § 1236.1(c). Thus, Section 1236.1 merely provides a rapid means of <em>procuring </em>an autopsy report for those who do not wish to wait until after the end of the year, and who are also willing to pay the charges associated with procuring it.

The details of an autopsy do not, in my judgment, become an “official record.”</p>

The singular official duty of a coroner is to determine the cause and manner of death within a particular county. An autopsy is not a duty'—it is a tool the coroner uses in order to discharge that duty. Having authority to order an autopsy does not equate to the duty to do so. It is up to the coroner to determine whether an autopsy will be of help when completing those statutory duties, <em>see </em>16 P.S. § 1237(a), but there is no duty to conduct an autopsy.</p>
    <p id="b591-10" data-blocks='[["BL_591.12",591,[130,1814,1159,421]]]'>Nothing in the statute hints at what is distinguishes “official records and papers” from non-official records and papers. Autopsy reports normally consist of the details of the examination, and a conclusory portion that addresses cause and manner of death based on those details. I believe the latter is appropriately part of the “official” report, for it deals with that which the coroner is obliged to find. However, the entirety of the autopsy notes should not be deemed such.</p>

Being necessarily comprehensive, autopsies reveal volumes of information, much of which is sensitive medical information, irrelevant to the cause and manner of death. Private medical information protected in life<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> does not automatically become less private because of the person’s death.</p>

I believe this does not express good public policy, for it places the onus on those who are affected adversely by the automatic public display of very private information. The majority offers no guidance on what might be “appropriate circumstances” much less “necessity,” nor does it suggest with what parameters judicial discretion should be exercised.</p>

Having a loved one die under circumstances requiring an autopsy is tragedy enough for the family; thinking of what that autopsy entails for the body of the deceased is exponentially disturbing for them. Does the family really have to run to court to try to avoid routine disclosure of the deceased’s weight, muscle tone, the condition of internal organs, the presence and progress of disease, and such other physical abnormalities that confront us all but are no one else’s business? Requiring the public exposition of every detail of the body borders on abominable; matters having nothing to do with cause and manner of death should remain private, and not be routinely disclosed.

If the coroner chooses to file the entire report, it may be inspected; however, the coroner has the discretion to file only the conclusions, which meets the requirements of the statute, just as if no autopsy was performed.
