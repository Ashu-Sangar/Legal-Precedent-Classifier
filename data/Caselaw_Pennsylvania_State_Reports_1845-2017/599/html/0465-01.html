Specifically, we consider whether the substantial factor element of the claim may be established solely through testimony of the patient’s spouse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court and the Superior Court panel majority answered that question in the negative. For the following reasons, we determine that the testimony of the patient’s spouse may be sufficient to prove the substantial factor element. For the reasons we explain below, we vacate the Superior Court’s order and remand to that court to consider appellants’ evidentiary claim, which the panel did not reach.</p>
    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[144,1090,1152,637]]]'>The evidence adduced at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to appellants as verdict winners, revealed the following. Appellant Carol Fitzpatrick was born in 1953, and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (“MS”) when she was nineteen years old. MS is an incurable condition that attacks nerve fibers in the brain, spinal cord, and eyes, resulting in progressive physical deterioration that is often attended by muscle spasticity or flaccidity that eventually necessitates the use of a wheelchair. The progression of the disease is marked by “flare ups” of varying frequency that leave the patient progressively more disabled. Carol married appellant Thomas Fitzpatrick when the two were in their early twenties.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.6",517,[143,1764,1152,202]],["BL_518.1",518,[311,314,1157,99]]]'>There are three types of treatment available to patients diagnosed with MS: (1) treatment for the “flare ups”; (2) symptomatic treatment; and, relevant to this case, (3) treatment to reduce disability. This third treatment typically <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>involves the use of disease-modifying drugs that slow the progression of the disability, but do not eliminate it.</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[309,453,1162,957]]]'>By 1977, Carol’s MS had progressed to the point where she required a cane to walk, and was prescribed daily oral doses of Baclofen, an anti-spasticity drug. In 1990, due to the continuing progression of her disease, she was forced to terminate her employment and was hospitalized on numerous occasions. In 1994, Carol began using a Rascal motorized scooter. In 1998, Carol became a patient of Dr. Howard Natter, a neurologist at Meadowbrook Neurology. While taking her medical history, Dr. Natter noted that Carol was having difficulty walking, and had some incontinence, intermittent pain, and other' symptoms. Instead of oral doses of Baclofen, Dr. Natter suggested that Carol consider undergoing surgery to have a subcutaneous pump implanted that would administer Baclofen continuously and uniformly. Dr. Natter provided appellants with manufacturer-produced information on the Baclofen pump, which included a videotape and pamphlet that outlined the use of the pump, as well as the benefits and risks associated with it.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.6",518,[307,1459,1164,745]]]'>At Carol’s next appointment, Dr. Natter again suggested •having the Baclofen pump implanted and appellants were receptive, agreeing to consider the procedure. In December of 1998, Dr. Natter referred appellants to appellee Dr. Michael Munz,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>. a neurosurgeon who performed pump implantation procedures. Appellee examined Carol, discussed the risks and benefits of the implantation with appellants, and stated that Carol was potentially a good candidate for the surgery, but would first have to undergo a test dose of Baclofen to gauge her reaction to the medication. After again reviewing the information they had received from the Baclofen pump manufacturer and discussing the surgery, appellants decided that Carol had “nothing to lose and everything to gain” from the procedure.</p>

      <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>Carol signed two consent forms, one prior to undergoing the test dose, and a second prior to the surgery itself. The parties disputed later what occurred following the test dose procedure: Dr. Munz testified that, while Carol experienced some hypotonia, <em>ie., </em>extreme muscle flaccidity, her spasticity and function began to return within twelve hours and her walking was improved for several days after the test dose. Thomas testified that Carol had a severe reaction to the test dose, experiencing extreme hypotonia that robbed her of all function and lasting several days, well after her discharge from the hospital. Thomas testified that despite this reaction, Carol’s ability to walk was improved after four to five days. Dr. Munz opined that Carol’s response was favorable and confirmed that she was a good candidate for the procedure.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[147,1121,1155,583]]]'>On May 12, 1999, Carol underwent surgery for the implantation of a Baclofen pump. After being discharged from the hospital, Carol was referred to physical therapy. While her condition improved for a period of time, in August of 1999 Carol was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and, following the infection, her ability to walk decreased until she ultimately became wheelchair bound. Carol’s condition continued to deteriorate to the point where she became paraplegic, incontinent, and wholly dependent upon Thomas for care-taking. In 1999, Thomas left his job to care for Carol full-time.</p>
    <p id="b519-5" data-blocks='[["BL_519.6",519,[146,1757,1155,307]]]'>In 2001, appellants filed a civil action against Dr. Natter, Meadowbrook Neurology,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the Brain and Spine Institute at Temple University Hospital,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and appellee.

      <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>A jury trial commenced on February 23, 2004, but limited to the claims of lack of informed consent and loss of consortium. Thomas testified that he and Carol made all medical decisions jointly and that, had the risks of the surgery been fully disclosed, Carol would not have undergone the procedure. Carol was present in the courtroom for most of the proceedings, but did not testify. While appellants now assert that Carol did not testify due to her deteriorated condition and cognitive dysfunction, Appellants’ Brief at 11, 24, the record does not support that assertion. Appellants did not present any explanation or evidence at trial that Carol’s failure to testify was due to her physical incapacitation. Meanwhile, appellee argues that Carol’s failure to testify was strategic. Appellee notes that it was only after the defense case began and the court was considering a motion for compulsory nonsuit that appellants asked to re-open their case to present Carol’s testimony. That request was denied by the trial court. In its opinion, the trial court found that appellants had made a conscious and strategic decision not to present Carol’s testimony. The trial court found that the request was untimely and prejudicial to the defense. Trial Ct. Op. at 10,19-21.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[313,1451,1159,907]]]'>In order to prove the first element of the informed consent claim, that is, the undisclosed risk or alternative, appellants attempted to present two expert witnesses, an anesthesiologist and a neurologist. The trial court refused to permit the anesthesiologist, Dr. Atlas, to testify on informed consent, reasoning that an anesthesiologist was not qualified to testify against a neurosurgeon such as appellee. The neurologist, Dr. Grenell, was also barred from testifying as to the informed consent issue, the trial court reasoning that a neurologist was not necessarily qualified to testify regarding the benefits, risks, or complications associated with pump implantation surgery. Further, the trial court found Dr. Grenell unqualified to testify on this point because he had never personally performed a surgery, had never secured a patient’s consent for surgery, and had no experience with the Baclofen pump. Both experts were permitted to testify concerning the negligence case against Dr. Natter.</p>

      <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>Thomas testified that he had questioned Dr. Munz about potential risks and side effects of the pump implantation, and that Dr. Munz had told him that it was an “extremely simple procedure.” Thomas also stated that his understanding was that patients with MS should never undergo any procedure near the spinal cord, and that Dr. Munz had “shrugged that off,” and stated that that was “a very conservative way of thinking” and that “none of [Dr. Munz’s] patients ever suffered an attack or exacerbation; that’s not something to worry about.” Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 2/24/04, at 26. Thomas testified that, prior to the procedure, Dr. Munz did not inform him and Carol that the pump implantation might not be successful in controlling Carol’s spasticity, that it might cause weakness, or that it might exacerbate her incontinence.</p>
    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[145,1065,1155,577]]]'>Appellee testified at trial as to the risks of pump implantation. Appellee testified that the risks that should be disclosed to a patient before the surgery are the general risks associated with anesthesia and surgery, the risk that the procedure may not help the patient, and the risk of increased perceived weakness due to the decrease in spasticity brought about by the medication. Appellee testified that hypotonia and temporary loss of function are recognized potential side effects of Baclofen, but that those side effects were caused by the medication, and so could be dealt with by “turning the Pump off’ and thereby ceasing the administration of the medication.</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[144,1667,1154,686]],["BL_522.1",522,[309,311,1159,193]]]'>On February 27, 2004, the defense rested. During closing arguments, appellants argued that the undisclosed risks of the pump implantation were loss of the ability to walk due to too large a dosage of Baclofen, and that the procedure may not work due to an inability to correctly calibrate the dosage. As part of its jury charge, the trial court submitted a verdict sheet with seven questions to the jury. Questions three, four, five, and seven addressed the case against Dr. Munz. Question three asked: “Do you find that [Dr. Munz] failed to obtain the informed consent of Carol Fitzpatrick for the operative procedure which he performed?” Question four read: “Do you find that the failure of [Dr. Munz] to obtain the informed consent of [Carol Fitzpatrick] was a substantial factor in her decision <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>to undergo the implantation procedure?” Question five asked for a calculation of damages for the informed consent claim, and question seven for a calculation of damages on the loss of consortium claim.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[309,536,1161,466]]]'>On March 1, 2004, the jury answered yes to questions three and four, finding that appellee failed to obtain Carol’s informed consent before performing the pump implantation surgery and that the missing information would have been a substantial factor in Carol’s decision whether to undergo the surgery. The jury awarded damages in the amount of 1.5 million dollars on the informed consent claim, and 1.7 million dollars on the loss of consortium claim. Both awards were against Dr. Munz only.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[307,1024,1163,943]]]'>Dr. Munz filed post-trial motions for, <em>inter alia, </em>a new trial and judgment N.O.V. The trial court granted the motion for judgment N.O.V. In its Opinion, the trial court found that the informed consent claim failed on three distinct grounds. First, the trial court opined that the claim failed as a matter of law because the informed consent statute, 40 P.S. § 1301.811-A, required the patient herself to testify that the allegedly undisclosed information would have been a substantial factor in her decision to undergo the procedure. The trial court noted that Carol was present throughout the trial and capable of testifying, yet appellants instead strategically chose to rely solely on Thomas’ testimony to establish the lack of informed consent. Without Carol’s testimony, the trial court reasoned, the jury could only speculate what her thought process was and whether she had provided her informed consent to the surgery. The court concluded that, as a matter of law, Carol’s failure to testify rendered the jury’s verdict “improper.” Trial Ct. Op. at 10.</p>
    <p id="b522-7" data-blocks='[["BL_522.7",522,[308,1990,1160,256]],["BL_523.1",523,[145,315,1154,204]]]'>Second, the trial court determined that appellants had failed to prove that the allegedly undisclosed information would have been significant to Carol’s decision because the evidence showed that other factors had completely dominated her election to go forward with the procedure. The “other factors” <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>cited by the trial court included that, at the time she decided to undergo the procedure, Carol was suffering from frequent bouts of incontinence, falls, difficulty ambulating, and confinement to a scooter. Trial Ct. Op. at 13.</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.5",523,[144,546,1156,798]]]'>Finally, the trial court discussed its rulings barring the expert testimony of appellants’ neurologist and anesthesiologist on informed consent. After first finding that the rulings were not in error, the trial court went on to conclude that appellants had failed to meet their burden of establishing the benefits, risks, and alternatives associated with the pump implantation procedure. The court recognized that appellants had attempted to rely on the testimony of Dr. Munz himself to meet their burden, but the trial court found that the record “was devoid of any expert opinion testimony on the risks involved, how likely the risks are to occur, and the nature of the harms inherent in these risks.” Consequently, the trial court found that appellants had not introduced “sufficient expert testimony” to establish the elements of an informed consent claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Trial Ct.

The Superior Court affirmed the grant of judgment N.O.V. in an unpublished, 2-1 panel opinion. The panel considered appellants’ first two claims together. Appellants argued that the testimony of Dr. Munz was sufficient to prove the first element of their claim, respecting the material risks involved, even though the trial court barred their own experts. Appellants added that Thomas’ testimony was then sufficient <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>to prove the substantial factor element, and that the trial court erred in holding that Carol’s testimony was required to prove this element.</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[314,494,1156,1016]]]'>The panel majority stated that the “essential issue” concerned the substantial factor element. The majority determined that Thomas’ testimony was insufficient to prove that the allegedly undisclosed information would have been a substantial factor in Carol’s decision-making. The majority reasoned that, while Thomas could testify as to what he understood the risks to be, or what he suggested to Carol regarding the potential risks, he could not testify about the significance Carol may have placed upon the information as compared to other factors playing into her decision. The majority found that, “[without Wife’s testimony ... the jury was left to speculate on whether the undisclosed information would have been a substantial factor in Wife’s decision to undergo the procedure, given the circumstances of Wife’s condition and the other factors favoring the procedure.” Super. Ct. Op. at 14-15. The majority concluded that, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants as verdict winners, appellants had failed to adduce sufficient evidence as a matter of law to sustain the jury verdict in their favor.</p>

Ct. Op. at 14-15. The majority’s brief observation concerning the first element was contrary to the trial court’s alternative finding that appellants had failed to establish, through the required expert testimony, the benefits, risks, and alternatives implicated by the surgical procedure. However, having found that the evidence was insufficient to establish the first element of the informed consent claim because of Carol’s failure to testify, the majority declined to address appellants’ third claim concerning the trial court’s exclusion of appellants’ expert testimony.</p>

Appellants argue that the Superior Court erred by holding that this circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish the substantial factor element.

The primary question posed here is whether the testimony of a person other than the patient can be sufficient to prove the substantial factor element. For the reasons that follow, we hold that, as in other areas of the law, circumstantial or indirect evidence may suffice for an informed consent patient to prove the elements of her claim.

But, Thomas did testify to a few questions raised by Carol herself. For example, Thomas testified that, during the first appointment with appellee to discuss the pump implantation, Carol was present and did not say “a whole lot,” but that she was concerned that the placement of the pump would put pressure on her bladder. N.T., 2/24/04, at 28. Further, Thomas testified that the most important consideration for Carol was to preserve her current level of functioning-he stated that Carol “enjoyed doing the things that she could do,” that she was “proud of the things she was able to do” and “did not want to lose the ability to walk. She did not want to lose the ability to <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>care for herself.” <em>Id. </em>at 199-200. Thomas also testified that he and Carol made all medical decisions jointly, that he attended all doctor’s appointments with her, and that she listened to his advice regarding medical treatment. He further testified that had he been in possession of the information regarding the procedure that he and Carol claimed was not disclosed, he would have considered it a substantial factor in their joint decision-making process. <em>Id. </em>at 199. In fact, Thomas testified that had he been informed that Carol could have lost. existing function as a result of the implantation procedure, he would have advised her not to go ahead with the surgery. <em>Id. </em>Appellants essentially argue that, on this record, the-jury could properly infer, from Thomas’ testimony, that what would have been a substantial factor for Thomas would also have been a substantial factor for Carol. The predicate difficulty with appellants’ argument concerning the substantial factor element as premised upon the existing trial record, however, is that it assumes there was competent evidence concerning an undisclosed risk of the surgical procedure, which could then be the subject of the substantial factor analysis. In addition to arguing that other factors dominated Carol’s decision to undergo the surgical procedure, appellee forwards a more elemental alternative argument—one which was credited by the trial court on post-verdict motions—that appellants failed to prove the first element of their informed consent claim, <em>i.e., </em>they failed to prove, by expert testimony, the risks of the procedure, the alternative procedures, and the risks of the alternatives. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1301.811-A(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> The determination of what risks would be material to the patient’s decision is a jury question; however, in making that determination, the jury must be supplied with expert information not only as to the potential harm, but the likelihood of that harm <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>occurring. <em>See Moure v.

Thus, appellee notes that appellants’ primary trial theory was that hypotonia from too much Baclofen is an established risk of pump implantation, and that that specific risk was not disclosed to Carol prior to the surgery. Appellee also urges that, notwithstanding the Superior Court panel majority’s offhand notation that the jury could reasonably conclude that appellee “had failed to disclose the general risk that any surgical procedure might exacerbate [Carol’s] MS,” in point of fact, no expert evidence was presented at trial from which the jury could find that such a risk actually exists, or that such a risk is likely and material enough that a reasonable physician would inform a patient of the risk prior to surgery.</p>

Appellants] did not and [do] not raise an issue as to whether the risks of receiving Baclofen through a Pump were properly disclosed.

Our careful review of the record corroborates appellee’s assertion that there was no properly admitted expert testimony at trial to support appellants’ current theory of <em>liability—i.e., </em>that any surgery on a patient with MS carries a risk of exacerbating that condition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> The trial court noted that its evidentiary rulings, which excluded the testimony of appellants’ expert witnesses on the informed consent claim, left an evidentiary void as to the risks actually associated with pump implantation surgery and, by implication, the risks implicated in any surgery on a patient with MS. The record supports the trial court’s view. Appellants’ first expert, Dr. Atlas, was not permitted to testify as to the informed consent issue because the trial court reasoned that, as an anesthesiologist, he was not qualified to testify against a neurosurgeon such as appellee. Likewise, the trial court limited the testimony of the <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>second plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Grenell, to the negligence case against Dr. Natter. N.T., 2/23/04, at 33. The trial court reasoned that Dr. Grenell, a neurologist, was not qualified to testify regarding any benefits, risks or complications associated with pump implantation because Dr. Grenell had never performed a surgery, had never secured a patient’s consent for surgery, and had no experience with the Baclofen pump. In arguing that their existing expert evidence was in fact sufficient to prove the undisclosed risk necessary to then-claim, appellants point primarily to the testimony of Dr. Grenell. Dr. Grenell indeed testified that Carol’s condition was “worsened” by the implantation of the Baclofen pump because, in the secondary progressive phase of MS, “you wouldn’t expect her to have sudden worsening unless there was some smoking gun such as high fever or a urinary infection or an operation.” N.T., 2/23/04, at 46. Dr. Grenell also opined that “multiple sclerosis patients can respond to injury by worsening multiple sclerosis” and that “surgery is a kind of controlled injury.” <em><a href="/pa/529/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="529 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1831163" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0394-01">Id.</a> </em>The difficulty in appellants’ argument, however, is that the trial court specifically limited the jury’s consideration of Dr. Grenell’s testimony to the negligence case against Dr. Natter. Moreover, as appellee correctly notes, even if Dr. Grenell’s testimony could be considered in the context of the informed consent claim, Dr. Grenell did not testify that permanent neurological deterioration is a recognized risk of surgery in a patient with MS, nor did he quantify the likelihood of such a “risk” occurring. Thus, Dr. Grenell’s testimony did not serve to provide the expert testimony necessary to prove the undisclosed risks and alternatives element of the informed consent claim.</p>

Appellee testified to risks associated with the pump implantation procedure, including the general risks associated with surgery and anesthesia, the risk of side effects from leaking spinal fluid, the risk that the procedure may not help the patient, and the risk of increased perceived weakness due to the decrease in spasticity brought about by the medi<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>cation. Appellee also testified that hypotonia and temporary loss of function are recognized side effects of pump implantation, but that those effects could be addressed' simply by “turning the Pump off” and ceasing the administration of Baclofen. N.T., 2/25/04, at 74-75. However, appellee did not testify to the likelihood of any of the acknowledged risks occurring, nor did he testify that a permanent loss of function is associated with any surgery on MS patients. Furthermore, as appellee emphasizes, appellants did not qualify appellee as an expert prior to asking him questions regarding the risks of the implantation. Finally, appellee is also correct in noting that an expert medical witness must testify to “a reasonable degree of medical certainty,” <em>Barbour v. Dep’t of Transp., </em><a href="/pa/557/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="557 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="56896" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0189-01">557 Pa. 189</a>, <a href="/a2d/732/1157-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="732 A.2d 1157" data-case-ids="11552913,11552936,11552971,56815,56877,56896" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/1157-01,/a2d/732/1157-02,/a2d/732/1157-03,/pa/557/0187-01,/pa/557/0188-01,/pa/557/0189-01">732 A.2d 1157</a>, 1160 (1999), and appellee never testified that his opinion reached that level of certainty. In short, appellee did not testify to (nor was he asked) whether surgery itself carries a risk of permanent neurological deterioration in MS patients, nor did he quantify the likelihood of this supposed risk.

Appellee argues that the trial court properly barred appellants' expert neurologist, Dr. Grenell, from testifying as to the risk of pump implantation because the proposed testimony went beyond the scope of his pre-trial report and he was not qualified to render such an opinion. Furthermore, appellee points to Dr. Grenell’s trial testimony and argues that he never testified that Carol's present, debilitated condition was a risk of the surgery, nor did he ever quantify the probability that the surgery could lead to this result. Finally, as to causation, appellee argues that the evidence demonstrates that Carol’s deteriorated condition was not. in fact caused by the surgery. The Superior Court, however, did not pass upon appellants' claim that the trial court erred in excluding their expert testimony. The validity of appellee's alternative argument is intertwined with the evidentiary question, which we will remand to the Superior Court.</p>
