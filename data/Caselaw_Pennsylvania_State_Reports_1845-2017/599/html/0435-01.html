One of appellant’s initial claims on appeal to the Superior Court was that his constitutional right to a jury trial was violated when the trial court imposed, without a prior offer of trial by jury, an aggregate sentence that exceeded six months. The Superior Court panel had authority and an obligation to consider this claim, as well as the Commonwealth’s assertion that appellant waived the claim by failing to include it in his Statement of Questions Complained of on <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>Appeal. The panel was not authorized to convert appellant’s constitutional claim into one based on the statutory right to a jury trial apparently granted by 42 Pa.C.S. § 4136(a)(3)(i).</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[314,468,1156,672]]]'>Of course, once the Superior Court improperly refocused the issue on Section 4136, and then further determined that appellant was denied his rights under the statute, the Commonwealth was entitled to seek review in this Court to challenge: 1) the failure of the Superior Court to consider the case on the proper grounds; and 2) the merits of the panel’s decision. This Court, as carefully and thoroughly set out in the Majority Opinion, concludes that under <em>Commonwealth v. Sorrell, </em><a href="/pa/500/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="500 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1781035" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0355-01">500 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="500 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1781035" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0355-01">456 A.2d 1326</a> (1982), the Legislature usurped the Court’s constitutional rulemaking authority when it granted the right to a jury trial in Section 4136(a)(3)(i).

The resulting court orders in such cases are legislatively authorized by statute. Here, however, <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>with Section 4136(b), the Legislature limits the court’s authority to punish for indirect criminal contempts of <em>any and all </em>of the court’s general orders of injunction and restraint. Thus, it purports to apply to every injunction and restraining order a court enters. Under the statute, a court cannot fashion its sentence based on the nature of the eontemnor’s violation or the danger the violation may have triggered. Rather, the court is limited to imposing, at a maximum, a brief period of incarceration, no matter the facts surrounding the case. This is an improper encroachment on a court’s inherent authority to enforce its own orders and so certainly constitutes an illegal infringement on the separation of powers.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[151,969,1153,418]]]'>Unlike Justice Saylor, I believe that criminal contempts of court present the <em>only </em>instance where courts may make a rule, adjudicate its violation, and assess a penalty. The right of appellate review serves to protect the contemnor. The limits imposed by the legislature in Section 4136(b) abrogate the inherent power by which the court can enforce its own orders. Because Section 4136(b) violates the separation of powers doctrine, it is invalid.</p>

The Superior Court panel looked to Section 4136(b) because it believed that subsection presented a statutory exception to the "fine only” provision in Section 4133.
