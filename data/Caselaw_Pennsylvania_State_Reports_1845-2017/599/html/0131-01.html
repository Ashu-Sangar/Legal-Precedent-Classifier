Thus, Nationwide argues that, contrary to the Superior Court’s conclusion, it was indeed prejudiced by Appellee’s settlement, because it cannot recoup the gap from the primary UIM insurer. According to Nationwide, it would never have been required to pay its monies if it had been given the opportunity <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>to exercise its <em>Daley-Sand </em>rights. While recognizing that this Court has not specifically addressed the right of insurers to recoup the gap monies between the settlement amount and the limits of coverage, Nationwide observes that other jurisdictions have held that such a right exists. <em>See Gusk v. Farm Bureau Mutual Ins.

Appellee also argues that Nationwide has failed to adduce sufficient facts to demonstrate prejudice in any other form. The Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association asserts that forcing insureds to seek out consent for settlement and waiver of subrogation from every other UIM carrier implicated in a case would result in increased premiums due to insurers’ need to conduct investigations on claims that may never, in fact, be made. It also maintains that the fact that the underlying claim is a UIM claim, as opposed to a third-party claim, is a distinction without difference, warranting application of the same equitable principles that guided the Superior Court in refusing to enforce an exhaustion clause in <em>Boyle. </em>In this regard, the organization observes that the concerns regarding the unnecessary burden that would be placed on the judicial system if insureds were prevented from accepting third-party settlements are the same for UIM settlements, particularly as arbitration is no longer required in UIM cases. <em>See Insurance Federation of Pa.

There, Nationwide argued that the <em>Lehman </em>rule was not applicable at the second-priority level. <em>See Brief for Appellee, Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Schneider, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2004%20WL%203251479" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="2004 WL 3251479">2004 WL 3251479</a>, *19-20 (Pa.Super. April 23, 2004). Further, Nationwide contended that, in all likelihood, it would <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>have withheld its consent to settle because of the $250,000 shortfall between the settlement and the insurer’s exposure at the first-priority level. <em>See id. </em>at *21.

Actual prejudice is circumstance dependent and should turn on such factors as the strength of the plaintiffs proofs of liability on the part of the underinsured motorist, the ability to demonstrate causally-related damages equal to or greater than the policy limits, and potentially the reasonableness of a withholding of consent on the part of the insurer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Indeed, in this Court’s <em>Brakeman </em>decision, upon which <em>Lehman </em>was founded, the Court remanded to provide the insurer the opportunity to develop a record concerning prejudice. <em>See Brakeman, </em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">472 Pa. at 77-78</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">371 A.2d at 198-99</a>.

      <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>We also find Nationwide’s current position, entailing a bald invocation of <em>Daley-Sand, </em>to be insufficient to establish prejudice. It simply is not self-evident that a second-priority insurer having a maximum exposure of $200,000 would tender $750,000 to the plaintiff to thwart a settlement in order to obtain an assignment to step into the plaintiff’s shoes relative to the first-priority insurer. Such a decision obviously would require careful consideration and be fact-driven. Nationwide’s position, however, is materially undeveloped in terms of salient facts. Since Nationwide has not offered a sufficient factual predicate to support the conceded prejudice requirement, we find no basis to disturb the decision to overturn the common pleas court’s award of summary judgment in the company’s favor.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[300,1099,1164,1177]]]'>In closing, we observe that the Superior Court not only reversed the common pleas court’s order awarding summary judgment in Nationwide’s favor, but it also directed the matter to arbitration, thus effectively awarding summary judgment in favor of Appellee in the declaratory judgment proceedings. However, on the matter of the consent-to-settle eláuse, the Superior Court’s rationale concludes with the statement that “the trial court erred by failing to place the burden of establishing prejudice upon Nationwide,” <em>Schneider, </em><a href="/a2d/906/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="906 A.2d 586" data-case-ids="8467304" data-case-paths="/a2d/906/0586-01">906 A.2d at 593</a>, and such conclusion does not equate to the proposition that it was impossible for Nationwide to establish prejudice on an evidentiary record or that Nationwide had forfeited its ability to attempt to do so. Appellee, however, repeatedly represented throughout this litigation that the operative facts were not in dispute and that the controversy could be resolved on the existing pleadings and summary-judgment submissions, and Nationwide has not disputed this representation. Nationwide also does not seek a remand for development of an evidentiary record regarding its asserted prejudice in its present brief.

While certainly the Department was free to decline our invitation to participate in this appeal as an <em>amicus, </em>we note that its first reason for doing so is incongruous with its responsibilities. The Department is charged with the obligation to administer and enforce insurance-related matters under the MVFRL, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1704(b), and, as such, has the initial responsibility to interpret the statute's requirements. Furthermore, as part of its duties, the Department is to approve policies issued in Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 477b. Moreover, the Department, unlike this Court, is vested with tools to examine how insurance policy terms affect the remedial and cost-containment purposes of the MVFRL. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1799.5, 1799.6 (affording the Insurance Department authority to monitor insurer profits, undertake analysis of market studies, conduct random field surveys, and undertake other forms of investigation).

      <p id="AIO" data-blocks='[["BL_194.2",194,[370,1610,1094,391]]]'>Further, although this Court has previously withheld comment, the Department’s position also casts some light on why, despite its obligation to "make rules and regulations necessary for the administration” of the insurance-related provisions of the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1704(b), it has failed to update its regulations containing a badly outdated form for uninsured motorist insurance only, <em>see </em>31 Pa.Code § 63.2(a) &amp; Exhibit C, in the wake of the passage of the MVFRL, the corresponding movement in the direction of public policy, the statute's provision for underinsured motorist insurance, and the substantial developments in tire decisional law.</p>
      <p id="Asy4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.3",194,[370,2005,1094,349]]]'>The Insurance Department’s second reason for declining comment here derives from its opinion that this case does not directly impact widespread consumer interests. Exhaustion requirements, however, regulate consumer access to an entire reservoir of UM/UIM coverage at the second-priority level. Facially, this appears significant, if not substantial, in terms of consumer impact. Although we lack the tools to test the Department's assertion empirically, the agency’s indication of a lack of relevant expertise diminishes our confidence that its evaluation of consumer impact is concretely grounded.</p>

In light of this concession, we decline to finally determine in this case whether a showing of prejudice is required of all insurers in this setting. Rather, we will apply the prejudice requirement for purposes of this case, with the observations that it remains the prevailing law of this Commonwealth under <em>Lehman </em>and its progeny unless and until a meritorious challenge to the rule is presented to this Court, and that Nationwide’s <em>amicus, </em>The Defense Institute, appears to maintain that prejudice should not be required.</p>

Parenthetically, Nationwide appears to argue that the <em>Daley-Sand </em>decision forecloses an insurer's ability to withhold consent. As noted above, however, our approach to this case is to decide it based on the arguments presented and to leave further refinements to future cases in which other lines of reasoning are developed. As to <em>Daley-Sand, </em>here we note only that the decision was embodied in a closely-written opinion affirming an equitable remedy afforded by a trial court and “hold[ing] only that the operation of the consent to settle clause in this case as now written frustrates public policy.” <em>Daley-Sand, </em><a href="/pa-super/387/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="387 Pa.
