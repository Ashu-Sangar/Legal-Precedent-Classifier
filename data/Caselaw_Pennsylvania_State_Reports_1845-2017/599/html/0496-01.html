Lancaster, Lebanon, Perry, and York. Although unclear, the record suggests that' Belco tentatively notified the Department of its proposal in early 2005. Shortly thereafter, notices of Beleo’s proposal were published in various legal journals and newspapers inviting interested persons to file comments by May 12, 2005.

First, with respect to whether the Banks were entitled to a hearing, the Deputy Secretary explained the Department’s position that the decision of whether to hold a hearing is a matter of agency discretion under § 503(a.2) of the Credit Union Code, 17 Pa.C.S. § 503(a.2), and that the Department was exercising its discretion by choosing not to hold a hearing in this instance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Second, with respect to the hearing file, the Deputy Secretary indicated that the Department did not have such a file<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> and that the non-disclosure provision would prohibit the Department from disclosing this information in any event. <em>See supra </em>note 2.

The Secretary therefore declined to reach the substance of the Banks’ claims, and instead, directed them to file a legal memorandum in support of their right to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 8.

Finally, the Secretary commented that the Department had only 30 days to review a credit union’s proposal under the deemed approval provision, 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(g), and therefore, the Department’s authority to deny Belco’s conversion had <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>expired. The Secretary opined that, given the unambiguous 80-day statutory review period provided in the deemed approval provision, protestors seeking a stay must be diligent and develop meaningful arguments to demonstrate how their interests are at risk prior to the expiration of the 30-day period. .

The Banks then filed a Petition for Review in the Commonwealth Court, wherein they continued to argue that the mandatory hearing regulation and the hearing file regulation entitled them to an evidentiary hearing and to discovery of the hearing file, respectively. In addition, the Banks supplemented these arguments by asserting that: a) section 504 of the Administrative Agency law was an alternative basis that would require the Department to conduct a hearing, <em>see supra </em>note 10, and b) that the non-disclosure provision violated due process insofar as it prevented them from obtaining discovery of the hearing file.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> In response, the Department <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>and Belco argued that the regulations at 10 Pa.Code Ch. 3 (henceforth, “Chapter 3”), which include both the mandatory hearing regulation and the hearing file regulation at-issue in this case, were wholly inapplicable to credit unions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

As correctly noted by the Department and Belco, the Department of Banking Code defines the term “institution” as, <em>inter alia, </em>a corporation, person, or mutual holding company, <em>but not “credit unions ... </em>

The Banking Code also excludes credit unions from the definition of “institution” by defining the term as an “incorporated institution,” which, in turn, is defined as “a bank, a bank and trust company, a trust company or a savings bank” and not as a credit union. 7 P.S. § 102. Thus, under either of these definitions, a credit union does not qualify as an “institution” within the meaning of the Department’s regulations. It therefore follows that, because a credit union is not an institution, a credit union cannot file an “application,” <em>see </em>10 Pa.Code § 3.1, thereby removing the case before us from the scope of Chapter 3. <em>See </em>10 Pa.Code § 3.2(a) (stating that the regulations contained in Chapter 3 apply to “applications”).</p>

Moreover, we likewise disagree with the Banks that it would be “irrational” or “arbitrary” to adopt the definition of institution excluding credit unions in the Department of Banking Code. While the Banks are correct that there are instances in the statute where credit unions are deemed institutions, the general definitions provision applicable to the entire statute, 71 P.S. § 733-2(A), clearly states that institutions do not include credit unions “unless specifically stated otherwise.” As such, any alleged inconsistency in the statute in defining the term “institution” to include credit unions can be explained by this exception.

They note, for example, that § 503(a.2) is phrased using permissive language by using the word “may” instead of the mandatory word, “shall,” which they claim indicates the legislature’s intent to give the agency the option, rather than the obligation, to conduct hearings.

Subsequently, on May 26, 2005, Belco formally filed “notice” of its proposal with the Department. This notice commenced the 30-day approval period provided in the deemed approval provision, 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(g), and prompted the Department to publish a second notification in the <em>Pennsylvania Bulletin. </em>Reading these notices in their totality, we believe it was sufficiently clear that any person interested in Belco’s conversion needed to file some type of comment, protest, or other document with the Department within the 30-day period.

In response, the Secretary issued a decision denying the Banks’ request for a stay, finding that the Banks waived any right thereto by failing to provide sufficient detail in their pleading.

As these regulations do not apply, it follows that they cannot serve as the basis for entitling the Banks to a hearing or to discovery concerning Belco’s proposal. Moreover, while we acknowledge that the Banks may have been entitled to a hearing pursuant to § 504 of the Administrative <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 504, we hold that this claim is waived given the Banks’ failure to raise this issue before the Department. For similar reasons, because the Banks failed to assert adequately a direct interest in Belco’s proposal and thereby failed to establish standing, our precedent in <em>Conestoga </em>is inapplicable to this matter, and therefore, the Banks are not entitled as a matter of due process to a hearing or to discovery. Finally, as the Banks are not entitled to discovery, the Commonwealth Court erred in declaring the non-disclosure provision unconstitutional. The decision of the Commonwealth Court is therefore reversed, and this matter is remanded to that court to address the Banks’ remaining constitutional challenge to the non-disclosure provision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a>

Nevertheless, I differ with the majority’s approach to the extent it faults the Banks for invoking Chapter 3. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 515-16, 962 A.2d at 621. At the very least, I believe the terms of Chapter 3 are ambiguous as to their application in proceedings initiated by credit unions.

Accordingly, I see no reason not to simply sanction the approach of treating the Banks’ protest as such under the default regulations. <em>See </em>1 Pa.Code § 35.23 (“A person objecting to the approval of an application, petition, motion or other matter which is, or will be, under consideration by an agency may file a protest.”). The majority’s approach also seems to me to be in substantial tension with the Department’s actual treatment of the Banks’ protest as constituting at least a timely-filed comment, as well as with the Department’s concession that, “[i]n the event a substantial and direct property interest is supported in comments that would warrant further due process, the constitution would demand it.” Brief for the Department at 34.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Finally, as it <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>appears that the Department has referenced the Chapter 3 regulations as the core procedural framework in its treatment of past credit-union submissions, <em>see, e.g., </em>33 Pa.

For example, the Banks develop that, under both Section 103(a)(v) of the Banking Code and Section 103(a)(5) of the Savings Association Code of 1967, it is the duty of the Department to provide for “[t]he opportunity” for institutions subject to the Banking Code and associations subject to the Savings Association Code “to remain competitive with each other” and “with financial organizations existing under other laws of this Commonwealth.” 7 P.S. §§ 103(a)(v), 6020-3(a)(5).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Finally, the <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>Banks note that the United States Supreme Court highlighted the role played by restrictions upon the membership of credit unions in holding that commercial banks had standing, under federal jurisprudence, to challenge field-of-membership expansion. <em>See NCUA v.

In this regard, the Department develops competitive disadvantages of the credit union model, including the fact that such organizations cannot raise capital from investment markets or experience market appreciation since they do not have capital stock, and thus, credit-union capital grows very slowly out of many years of accumulating retained earnings. According to the Department, given the above, the limited size of credit unions, and the different system for insurance, it is highly unlikely that credit union failures would have significant impact on banks. Moreover, the Department concludes, there is no historical or other basis for determining that there is a unique relationship between credit unions and banks to support a finding of a substantial property interest. <em>See </em>Brief for the Department at 26 (arguing that “a claim based on competition is disingenuous given highly competitive financial marketplace and the numerous banks in the same market territory. The unrestricted ability of banks to operate in any geographic area without limitation under the law, unlike credit unions, renders their claims hollow.”).

Brief for the Department at 30 (citing 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(f)(3)). The Department further expresses the position that protracted proceedings at the behest of competitor banks would harm the interests of credit unions by injecting unnecessary delay into charter conversion proceedings. In this regard, the Department also <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>relates its concern that the process would be subject to abuse, particularly since credit unions have no reciprocal ability to lodge field-of-membership challenges relative to other financial organizations. The Department also points to the General Assembly’s intent to allow state credit unions to engage in activities on par with their federal counterparts upon notice, just as banks may operate on par with federal banks under notice-based parity provisions in the Banking Code. <em>See </em>7 P.S. § 201(c)(i). In this regard, the Department indicated that it does not wish to “circumvent the General Assembly by acting within the thirty-day period simply to deny the credit union its rights to exercise the statutory provision for a deemed approval” of parity-related charter conversions. Brief for the Department at 30. Finally, the Department contends that all the process which was due was provided via public notice and opportunity for comment.</p>

Indeed, the Credit Union Code’s express authorization of the imposition of “conditions, limitations, and restrictions” on credit union activities includes a specific cross-reference to the parity-related provisions of the Credit Union Code. 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(f)(2) (cross-referencing 17 Pa.C.S. § 501(e)). Thus, it seems clear that the Department should enforce parity-related restrictions, including the maintenance of boundaries for community-based credit unions established by a well-defined local community. <em>See </em>17 Pa.C.S. § 501(e). It is far from clear, however, particularly without adversarial testing, that expansion to a seven-county area in South Central Pennsylvania meets that requirement. <em>Cf.

As the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>First National Bank, </em>financial organizations may suffer direct harm, in the form of a loss of customers, due to the actions of credit unions and other competing financial organizations, and thus, maintain an acute interest in ensuring that competitors abide by statutory provisions limiting the markets that they can serve. <em>See First Nat’l Bank., </em><a href="/us/522/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="522 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="11472372" data-case-paths="/us/522/0479-01">522 U.S. at </a>488 n. 4, 492-93, <a href="/us/522/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="522 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="11472372" data-case-paths="/us/522/0479-01">118 S.Ct. at </a>933 n. 4, 935.
