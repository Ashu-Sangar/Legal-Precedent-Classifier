Land Displays alleged that Section 105.2 deprived it of constitutional property rights and interests without due process of law by operating as a <em>de fazto </em>exclusion of billboards. Focusing on the 25-square-foot limitation on sign size in Section 105.2, Land Displays asserted that since national advertising industry standards set billboard size at either 300 or 672 square feet, Section 105.2 effectively <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>banned billboards as a form of outdoor advertising in the Township.

In its opinion, the Board highlighted the evidence the parties presented on the issue of Section 105.2’s validity. The Board observed that Land Displays supported its assertion that Section 105.2 amounts to a <em>defacto </em>exclusion of billboards with testimony that billboards are uniformly sized at 300 or 672 square feet under national advertising industry standards; that standardized billboards facilitate the purchase of sign structure and the preparation of advertising material; and that a 25-square-foot sign is not an acceptable standard in the outdoor advertising industry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Board next observed that the Township supported its contention that Section 105.2 does not exclude billboards from the Township with photographs of existing 25-square-foot advertising signs in the Township and justified Section 105.2’s enactment by the Township with testimony that the regulation addressed the Township’s concerns for aesthetics and traffic safety along U.S. Route 422. The Board then made the following findings: that Section 105.2 is part of the Ordinance;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> that as a result of the sign <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>size limitation in Section 105.2, the Ordinance excludes billboards as a permitted use in the Township; that the industry-standard for minimum billboard size is 300 square feet; that U.S. Route 422 is a heavily traveled four-lane highway in the Township, with speed limits that vary from 40 to 55 miles per hour; that only the southern portion of U.S. Route 422 is posted at 55 miles per hour; that U.S. Route 422’s reduced speed zone areas abut areas of varying degrees of commercial development; that the credible evidence establishes that the maximum reasonable size for billboards in the Township is 300 square feet; that the Ordinance’s other sections contain reasonable regulations on billboards; and that any billboard Land Displays proposes to erect must comply with all of the Ordinance’s sign regulations, except as affected by the Board’s decision. The Board made no findings as to whether Section 105.2’s exclusionary effect on billboards throughout the Township was validated by the Township’s concerns for aesthetics and traffic safety along U.S. Route 422.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.6",623,[131,1279,1156,679]]]'>The Board went on to note that a successful challenger to a zoning ordinance is entitled to site-specific relief, but that such relief may be subjected to reasonable regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 8, <em>citing, e.g., Casey v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Warwick Tp., </em><a href="/pa/459/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="459 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="480992" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0219-01">459 Pa. 219</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="459 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="480992" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0219-01">328 A.2d 464</a> (1974). Upon reviewing Land Displays’ billboard proposals, the testimony of Land Displays’ witnesses who conceded that national industry standards do not address local concerns, and the evidence the Township introduced regarding conditions along U.S. Route 422, the Board concluded that billboards not exceeding 300 square feet in size would be permitted in the Township, but that due to aesthetic and traffic safety issues, no new billboards would be erected along certain portions of U.S. Route 422.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.7",623,[131,1984,1155,257]],["BL_624.1",624,[316,299,1160,1243]]]'>Accordingly, the Board issued an order, stating, in relevant part: that the Ordinance, with respect to Section 105.2, is invalid as a <em>de facto </em>exclusion of billboards throughout the Township; that the maximum surface area for a billboard in the Township, including frame and trim, shall be 300 square <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>feet; that billboards must strictly comply with all other provisions of the Ordinance; and that the erection of billboards along business U.S. Route 422 from Shelbourne Road and west in the Township is prohibited as injurious to the public health, safety and welfare. Consistently with Section 916.1(c)(5) of the MPC, the Board’s order also made recommendations to the Township to cure Section 105.2’s exclusionary effect. <em>See </em>53 P.S. §• 10916.1(c)(5) (“If a challenge heard by a zoning hearing board is found to have merit, the decision of the zoning hearing board shall include recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found.”) The Board recommended that the Township engage the services of a qualified assistant in the preparation of appropriate regulations for billboards; establish a sliding scale of billboard sizes related to location and roadway circumstances; consider establishing a larger billboard sign size and permitting trivision and smart boards for the area along the U.S. Route 422 bypass; and establish a minimum distance between billboards, such as 1,200 feet. Thus, under the Board’s order, Land Displays was permitted to erect billboards of a size not to exceed 300 square feet, but was prohibited from erecting billboards on specified portions of U.S. Route 422.</p>
    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[316,1590,1157,747]]]'>The Township filed an appeal from the Board’s order in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. The Township complained: (1) that the Board erred in finding that Section 105.2 constituted a <em>de facto </em>exclusion of billboards, arguing that Section 105.2 does not operate to prohibit outdoor advertising; (2) that the Commonwealth Court has rejected Land Displays’ contentions about billboard size in other cases and the case-law the Board relied upon for its decision is inapt; and (3) that the Board erred in accepting the Township’s concerns for traffic safety and aesthetics only as to a portion of U.S. Route 422, arguing that the Board failed to recognize that U.S. Route 422 in its entirety is subject to these same concerns. Without taking additional evidence, the trial court affirmed the Board.</p>

      <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>The Township appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which, in a 2-1 divided decision, reversed the trial court. <em>Township of Exeter v.

The Commonwealth Court’s panel majority concluded that Land Displays did not establish that Section 105.2 of the Ordinance constituted a <em>de facto </em>exclusion of billboards. The majority reasoned that, although the testimony before the Board reflected the importance of uniform sizing in the billboard industry, it was insufficient to prove that the Ordinance was unconstitutional. <em><a href="/a2d/911/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="911 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="8401552" data-case-paths="/a2d/911/0201-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/911/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="911 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="8401552" data-case-paths="/a2d/911/0201-01">at 204</a>.

In the majority’s view, the fact that such signs existed demonstrated that Section 105.2 did not exclude billboards. In light of its holding that the trial court erred in upholding the Board’s finding that Section 105.2 constituted a <em>de facto </em>exclusion of billboards, the Commonwealth Court declined to reach the Township’s remaining issue on appeal, <em>i.e., </em>whether the Board erred in limiting the Township’s aesthetic and trafile safety concerns to portions of U.S. Route 422, rather than finding them applicable to U.S. Route 422 in its entirety.</p>

On the issue of whether the Township’s 25-square-foot size restriction on signs amounted to a <em>defacto </em>exclusion, Land Displays offered the expert testimony of John Carter Hayes (“Hayes”). Hayes, a consultant in the outdoor advertising industry, testified that billboards come in two . standard sizes. The “bulletin” measures 672 square feet (14 feet by 48 feet), while the “poster” measures 300 square feet (12 feet by 25 feet), including the trim, or 240 square feet (10 feet, 5 inches by 22 feet, 8 inches) of actual sign area. According to Hayes, the outdoor advertising industry developed these standards at the request of national advertisers who sought uniformity in billboard size. The standards allow those who advertise on billboards to produce their respective • advertising messages in large quantities and place them on highways throughout the nation.</p>
    <p id="b630-6" data-blocks='[["BL_630.7",630,[307,2140,1162,205]],["BL_631.1",631,[132,301,1157,1057]]]'>Hayes explained that the value of a billboard is derived from the number of people who see it and that the size of a billboard is significant because size determines the amount of advertising information a billboard can contain and whether <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>the information can be seen and read. As to the 300-square-foot poster, Hayes testified that its size was determined by practical issues of production and considerations as to what would be visible to those driving on roads and highways. Hayes also noted that there are standardized outdoor advertising signs measuring 72 square feet, but that these signs are typically used in highly urbanized areas with pedestrian or vehicular traffic that moves very slowly. When asked about the effectiveness of signs smaller than the 300-square-foot size, Hayes testified that smaller signs are not designed for arteries on which traffic flows at higher rates of speed. In Hayes’ opinion, at about 45 to 55 miles per hour, a 72-square-foot sign could conceivably display a name or logo, but would be inadequate to display an advertising message. Moreover, Hayes was of the view that, because such a sign would be difficult to read for those traveling on a highway, it would not only be ineffective, but would also be a distraction to drivers. Finally, Hayes opined that the advertising message that a 300-square-foot billboard conveys cannot be placed on and communicated by a 25-square-foot sign.</p>

Land Displays established that a billboard is a legitimate means of displaying and communicating an advertising message to passing drivers on roads and highways. Land Displays also established that a 300-square-foot sign is large enough to serve this purpose, but that a 25-square-foot sign is not. Land Displays showed that a 25-square-foot sign cannot function effectively as a billboard because it is too small to contain and convey an advertising message to the motoring public. Such a conclusion is also <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>supported by common sense. Thus, Land Displays proved a <em>de facto </em>exclusion—that is, it demonstrated that Section 105.2 appears to permit billboards as a use, but under such conditions that the use cannot in fact be accomplished. <em>See H.R.

The evidence showed that the 300-square-foot industry minimum was a matter of industry standardization, and not necessarily the absolute minimum size necessary to make a billboard effective in serving its communication purpose and thus economically viable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The record does not support the notion that a restriction on the size of signs must meet industry standards to pass constitutional muster.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> That being said, however, proof of industry size standards was certainly probative of whether the restriction here was exclusionary, and the Commonwealth Court majority improperly downplayed that evidence. Land Displays’ proof had bearing on what square footage allows a sign to fulfill a billboard’s purpose and provided a concrete frame of reference against which to evaluate the functionality, or lack thereof, of a 25-square-foot sign as a billboard. In this same vein, the fact that the Township produced evidence of a few 25-square-foot signs on Township roadways did not <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>defeat Land Displays’ claim.

Further, it appears that the Township did not challenge this gap in the Board’s analysis or otherwise preserve the issue. Therefore, it appears that all that remains is for the Commonwealth Court on remand to consider the issue raised by the Township below and left unresolved by the Commonwealth Court given its broader <em>disposition—ie., </em>whether the Board erred in finding that the Township’s aesthetic and safety concerns warranted the existing restriction only as to portions of U.S. Route 422, and not finding them legitimate as to U.S. Route 422 in its entirety.</p>

The Board made clear that since Land Displays did not present financial data, the Board did not consider whether compliance with Section 105.2's size restrictions essentially rendered billboards economically impracticable or impossible as a use. <em>See Stahl v.

According to the Board, its consideration of Land Displays' challenge to Section 105.2 was limited to Land Displays' argument that Section 105.2 amounts to a blanket prohibition of billboards because its size limitation is “grossly deficient when compared with the national standards and [because] national - advertisers will not purchase billboard space on 25 square foot signs.” Board's Memorandum Findings, Opinion, and Order, 8/15/2005, at 7.</p>

We applied a particular analysis, known as the "fair share" test, and determined that the ordinance unconstitutionally excluded multi-family dwellings. <em>Id. </em>at 112.</p>

With all due respect to our colleague in the dissent, we do not conclude that a zoning ordinance must allow for signs that meet national industry size standards in order to avoid being labeled a <em>de facto </em>exclusion of billboards. Nor do we conclude that unless a sign is at least 300-square-feet, it does not function as a billboard. Indeed, this case does not require us to determine what size a sign must be to function as a billboard. We only consider whether the record established that a 25-square-foot sign does not.</p>

To be clear, we do not approve the Board’s embrace of the 300-square-foot national industry size standard lor billboards or its finding that the maximum reasonable size for billboards in the Township is 300 square feet.

The majority agrees with the Commonwealth Court’s finding “industry size standards are not automatically controlling in determining what size sign restriction can be deemed <em>de facto </em>exclusionary,” Majority at 584, 962 A.2d at 662, and further notes, “[t]he record does not support the notion that a restriction on' the size of signs must meet industry standards to pass constitutional muster.” <em>Id. </em>However, it appears industry size standards have nevertheless dictated the present outcome.</p>
    <p id="b634-9" data-blocks='[["BL_634.11",634,[308,1481,1164,689]]]'>Land Displays’ experts testified it is impossible to market billboard advertising on the route in question unless the sign is at least 300 square feet; the Board found this evidence established the operation of a billboard of lesser square footage is impossible and, in effect, a <em>de facto </em>exclusion of billboards. Like the Commonwealth Court, I would find the Board’s determination unsupported by substantial evidence; thus, Land Displays did not overcome its burden to show § 105.2 is unconstitutional. The testimony of two industry experts, citing alleged national standards of an industry where profits and sign square footage are directly proportional, falls short of overcoming the presumption in favor of § 105.2’s constitutionality.</p>

Advertising signs are a permitted use under § 105.2, and billboards fall under this classification. The sign size limit, as the photographs of conforming 25-square-foot advertising signs in the Township evidence, precludes only those signs larger than 25 square feet and does not amount to a total ban of billboards, defeating Land Displays’ claim. As it was within the Township’s authority to limit the size of advertising signs, it was under no duty to do so pursuant to national advertising industry standards. As I find the Board’s decision was not supported by substantial evidence, I would hold Land Displays did not meet its burden to prove § 105.2 unconstitutional.</p>
