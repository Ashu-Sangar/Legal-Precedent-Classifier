That said, one must remember the reason why the Constitution tolerates the lesser standard articulated' in Terry—the detention is allowed to maintain the <em>status quo </em>so the officer may conduct a brief and safe investigation to see if indeed there is criminal activity afoot. Extensive case law supports the conclusion a vehicle stop for DUI may be based on reasonable suspicion, as a post-stop investigation is normally feasible. However, a vehicle stop based solely on offenses not “investigatable” cannot be justified by a mere reasonable suspicion, because the purposes of a <em>Terry </em>stop do not exist—maintaining the <em>status quo </em>while investigating is inapplicable where there is nothing further to investigate.
