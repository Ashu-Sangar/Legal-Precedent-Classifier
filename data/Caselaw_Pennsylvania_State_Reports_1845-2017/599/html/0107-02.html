Prior to the commencement of the present matter, no disciplinary action had ever been taken against him. In June 2001, the Pennsylvania State Police began investigating Appellant with respect to controlled substances he had prescribed to certain of his patients whom police had arrested for drug violations. The state police conducted the investigation in conjunction with agents of the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”). As part of the investigation, the state police obtained a search warrant for certain of Appellant’s books and records, including his files pertaining to fourteen specific patients. The affidavit of probable cause appended to the search warrant application was not signed by the affiant, state police Officer Michael R. Boltz, although Officer Boltz signed the search warrant application in front of Jefferson County Common Pleas Court Judge William Henry, the issuing authority.

They spent approximately two and one-half hours conducting their search, during which a DEA agent videotaped the extant conditions of Appellant’s office. Also during the search, the state police became aware that six additional individuals, known to the police from their ongoing investigation, were also patients of Appellant. After completing the search and seizing the fourteen specific files they had sought, the police obtained another search warrant for the files of the six additional patients mentioned above. Those files were seized on November 14, 2001.</p>

The police then sent the original files to the DEA, which in turn provided them for review to Paul A. Moore, D.M.D., Ph.D., a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, whom the DEA had retained as a dental consultant. The purpose of Dr. Moore’s review was to evaluate whether there was any indication in the files that narcotics were being distributed by Appellant for reasons <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>other than dental care. <em>See </em>R.R. at 163a; 166a. After reviewing the records, Dr. Moore set forth his conclusions in his “Review of Records: Summary of Findings” dated May 21, 2002. He summarized his general findings based on his review of all the files, and then stated specific findings and opinions regarding four of the patient files. Among Dr. Moore’s findings were poor record maintenance, questionable diagnostic descriptions and procedures, use of herbal therapies having little or no scientific basis, heavy prescription of controlled substances <em>(i.e., </em>OxyContin, Percodan, Loracet, Xanax, and Soma), and ignoring patients’ “drug diversion” behavior. R.R. at 900a-901a.

These three witnesses testified regarding their investigation and their search of Appellant’s dental office. In addition, Dr. Moore was qualified as an expert and testified at the hearing. He testified about his review of Appellant’s records, about his opinions and conclusions based on that review, and about the propriety of Appellant’s practice of dentistry as reflected in Appellant’s records. On June 16, 2004, the examiner heard Appellant’s defense.

Appellant did not reiterate this argument in his brief in this Court, and, in any event, Appellant has not explained how this fact, even if true, renders the warrants devoid of probable cause. Appellant makes no attempt to explain why the facts set forth in any affidavit of probable cause are insufficient to support a reasonable belief that evidence of a crime is to be found in Appellant’s dental office. However, because we hold that die exclusionary rule does not apply to civil proceedings before the Board, Appellant's failure to further particularize his challenge to the warrants is of no moment here.</p>

Thus, as a Fourth Amendment matter, the U.S. Supreme Court has applied the exclusionary rule in civil proceedings that are merely “quasi-criminal,” such as forfeiture proceedings. <em>See One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v.

Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">526 Pa. 374</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d 887</a> (1991), Justice Baer states that, unlike the Fourth Amendment, which has been characterized as deterrence-based, the history of Article I, Section 8 indicates that “the exclusionary rule in Pennsylvania has consistently served to bolster the twin aims of Article I, Section 8; to-wit, the safeguarding of privacy and the fundamental requirement that warrants shall only be issued upon probable cause.” Concurring Op. at 441 (quoting <em>Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d at 899</a>).

The import of this statement regarding universal application of the exclusionary rule in the criminal setting is not meant to suggest the applicability of the exclusionary rule to any nuanced exception referenced by the Chief Justice in his concurring opinion. Rather, I authored this concurring opinion to make absolutely clear my position that we should guard against the erosion of one of society's most cherished of freedoms—the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The only effective means of protecting such right in the realm of criminal law is to preserve the remedy which chills improper conduct on the part of police, <em>i.e., </em>the application of the exclusionary rule. While I readily acknowledge that it is unfortunate when a <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>lawbreaker cannot be brought to justice due to the applicability of the exclusionary rule, as noted in Edmunds, this is a costly, but worthwhile price to pay to preserve liberty and freedom for the vast majority of Americans who will never engage in criminal conduct.</p>

Such view, however, does not diminish the innumerable occasions in which Pennsylvania courts have applied the exclusionary rule to protect against unreasonable searches and seizures since <em>Mapp </em>was decided. Moreover, similar to the High Court’s adoption of the exclusionary rule in <em>Mapp </em>as the remedy to preserve the constitutional right against unreasonable searches, there are other examples of judicially-created safeguards or remedies, which were adopted years after the constitutional right they protect was recognized. For example, the requirement of reading a defendant his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="172" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.Ed.2d 694</a> <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>id 966), was found to be essential to assure that a defendant was accorded his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. As with the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, <em>Miranda </em>rights are protected through the exclusionary rule. Also, the appointment of counsel, as required by <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em><a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="174" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">372 U.S. 335</a>, <a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="175" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">83 S.Ct. 792</a>, <a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="176" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">9 L.Ed.2d 799</a> (1963), was found to be essential to protect the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The fact that these judicially-created safeguards or remedies did not exist at the time the constitutional rights they protect were recognized does not diminish their significance, but rather emphasizes it. As these principles form the bedrock of our constitutional jurisprudence, I respectfully suggest that it would be unwise and, indeed, dangerous to advocate erosion of the exclusionary rule when applied in "typical” criminal cases.</p>
