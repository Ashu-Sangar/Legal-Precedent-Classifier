      <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>Appellant claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to enable the trier of fact to find every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. He contends that it is clear that the jury was confused and could not have found him guilty of first-degree murder based upon what he terms the speculative and unreliable evidence presented, which he claims was inconsistent and contradicted by the physical and testimonial evidence. He further argues that the evidence supports the proposition that he was intoxicated at the time of the crime. Appellant bases this argument on the testimony of his uncle, Donald VanDivner, who testified that he and appellant drank beer at a bar from approximately 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. on the day of the murder, and that of his brother, Albert VanDivner, who also testified to the imbibing, adding that the men began the day with an eight ball<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> of crack cocaine and that they occasionally left the bar to smoke the crack cocaine. Due to his alleged intoxication, appellant argues, the evidence was insufficient to convict him of first-degree . murder because the use of intoxicants negates the specific intent required for a conviction.</p>

He points to the testimony of a defense witness, psychologist Adam Sedlock, who stated that appellant’s overall level of function is in the mild range of mental retardation and that he has organic functional problems with the frontal lobe of his brain, which controls his ability to think before he speaks or acts. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth did not refute his diminished capacity claim; therefore, he posits, the jury could not have found that he was capable of forming the requisite specific intent.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that the jury heard testimony that appellant had consumed alcohol and crack cocaine prior to the shooting but chose not to reduce the verdict, noting that the jury may disregard all, part or some of the evidence. Further, the Commonwealth claims that it established that appellant possessed specific intent to kill in that, while armed with a handgun, he grabbed Michelle by the hair and shot her in the head, thereby using a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim’s body.</p>

He found that some of her organs and tissues had been removed post-mortem for organ donor purposes but that none of the tissues or organs were of any consequence to his review.

He noted that the edges of the wound were blackened from the gun powder, which is an indication that the shot was fired at close range, and that there was no stippling, meaning that the gun’s muzzle was no farther than an inch or so from Michelle’s head when the shot was fired. <em>Id. </em>at 240. Dr. Wecht testified that the head is a vital part of the body because the brain is the most important organ because “it runs the show,” and that the cause of death in this instance was “anoxic and cephalopathy due to the gunshot wound of the head with damage to the skull and brain.” <em>Id. </em>at 241.</p>

This additional information is generally gleaned from the police investigation—whose gun was used, was the gun found near the decedent’s body, is there any reason to believe the decedent was cleaning the gun or fooling around, making it an accident? If there are no indications of accident or suicide, then the conclusion is that it is a homicide.

The court asked Dr. Wecht if he received a report from Dr. Reilly or discussed the matter with him. Dr. Wecht responded that he discussed the case with Dr. Reilly, which is what is always done, and that the discussion is analogous to the hospital records he would get when someone dies in a hospital and provides information that he utilizes in his overall analysis of a case.

The trial court here cited to <em>Smith </em>in its opinion as support for allowing the testimony. Dr. Wecht clearly testified that he customarily uses information received from the coroner or hospital records in rendering his opinions regarding cause and/or manner of death. He also stated that, in a case involving a close-range gunshot wound, this information typically includes whose gun was used, whether the gun was found near the body, and whether there was any indication of an accident.

Appellant adds that he was in special education classes until he dropped out of school during the 1964-65 school year when he was in tenth grade. According to appellant, Sedlock performed a psychological evaluation and determined that appellant had an organic brain syndrome and closed head trauma, although neither had altered his IQ. Appellant also claims that the testimony of Dr. Lawson Frederick Bernstein, Jr., a clinical and forensic neuropsychiatrist who testified on behalf of appellant, established, based on an MRI, an EEG, and a psychiatric evaluation, that appellant was mildly mentally retarded, had dementia due to head trauma/cardiovascular disease, suffered from cerebrovascular disease and at some point had had a stroke.</p>

Sedlock testified that appellant’s composite score on the Vineland test was 65, indicating that he was functioning within the mild range of mental retardation. Based upon his interview, Sedlock concluded that appellant’s social skills are deficient and he cannot manage either his money, his own health concerns or his interpersonal relationships. Sedlock also administered the Wide Range Achievement Test, which revealed that appellant’s sight reading and mathematics skills are at the second grade level, and he spells at a first grade level. Sedlock testified that appellant had impulse control problems that have their origins in his cognitive limitations and/or organic changes in appellant’s frontal lobe. He also diagnosed appellant with antisocial personality disorder. Sedlock further opined that the onset of appellant’s supposed mental retardation occurred prior to age eighteen, based upon his school records showing he was in special education classes, the testimony of appellant’s sister, and Dr. Bernstein’s testimony that IQ does not change over a lifetime. Based upon all of this evidence, appellant claims that he established by a preponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded and, therefore, the trial court should have barred the Commonwealth from proceeding with the death penalty in this case.</p>

According to the Commonwealth, all of the expert witnesses agreed that there was no testing performed on appellant prior to age eighteen. Further, the Commonwealth contends that there is no objective evidence of any significant limitation in adaptive behavior caused by mental retardation. The Commonwealth points to the fact that appellant, when not incarcerated, maintained full-time employment as a licensed CDL (commercial driver’s license) truck driver, and that any social problems he may have can be attributed to his anti-social personality or his polysubstance abuse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The Commonwealth notes that while <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>appellant’s school records indicate that he was in special education classes, a school official testified that there were non-intelligence-related reasons a student might receive special education, such as disciplinary problems, and that appellant was absent 92 days of his tenth grade school year.

In addition, according to Dr. Wright, appellant possesses several risk factors which can contribute to or cause cognitive impairment, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cerebrovascular insults like strokes, substance abuse and head trauma. Dr. Wright maintained that the only means of establishing onset of impaired mental function prior to age eighteen is <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>through testing, and that a diagnosis of mental retardation cannot be made in light of appellant’s deceitfulness, risk factors and the lack of objective testing prior to age eighteen.</p>

Alternative evidence, the trial court noted, could include school records or other psychological records proving that appellant’s alleged mental retardation manifested itself before age eighteen. The court noted that, while appellant was in special education classes in tenth grade, his school records did not identify him as mentally retarded, nor was there any indication that he was placed in special education classes due to mental retardation. The court pointed to the testimony of a school official to the effect that, at the time appellant was in school, there was no formalized procedure for placement in special education classes, as well as appellant’s sister’s admission that she was placed in special education classes because of behavioral problems, not mental retardation. The court concluded that appellant may have been placed in special education classes for a number of reasons, including poor attendance or behavior problems, and that there was no evidence that he was in special education classes because of a diagnosis or recognition of his mental retardation. In addition, the court noted that appellant’s poor grades may reflect his poor attendance rather than any mental impairments. For all of these reasons, the court held that appellant had failed to prove that his mental retardation originated prior to age eighteen.</p>

Here, appellant elected to attempt to establish that he is mentally retarded by demonstrating the three shared concepts of the two definitions. He presented evidence that his IQ is at or below the standard set forth in Mental Retardation (two standard deviations, or 30 points, below the mean of 100 with a standard error of measurement of three to five points), that he had significant adaptive limitations in that he claims to be incapable of managing his personal finances and other aspects of his life, and that his mental retardation manifested itself in his childhood, arguing that his placement in special education classes and the testimony of his sister that he was incapable of certain academic and personal tasks established that he suffered from mental disabilities since his childhood.</p>

The trial court also recognized that appellant’s excessive absences from school could very well have been the cause of his poor academic performance.

The trial court did not hold, and we do not suggest, that objective IQ testing occurring before age eighteen is required to prove mental retardation. Other factors were involved here. The Concurring and Dissenting Opinion marginalizes the trial court’s more extensive factfinding, which included findings that appellant’s school records contained no notations that he was considered mentally, retarded; that his placement in special education classes, which he offered as objective proof of childhood mental retardation, could have' been related to other factors such as behavioral issues or his poor school attendance; and that the number of objective medical risk factors appellant had could contribute to his current mental impairment (a relevant point because appellant’s current impairments were offered as proof of lifelong impairment). In short, the trial court’s decision which we affirm was not predicated upon perverting the <em>Atkins/Miller </em>standard into one only requiring objective IQ testing in childhood, but rather on all of the evidence, or lack thereof, that appellant suffered from mental retardation prior to the age of eighteen.

Thus, as the Commonwealth correctly argues, any additional expert testimony regarding appellant’s adaptive skills would have been merely cumulative. Further, it is apparent that appellant was not prejudiced by the trial court’s refusal to appoint the requested expert because the controlling finding <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>by the trial court was that appellant failed to establish onset of mental retardation by the age of eighteen, which is unrelated to his adult adaptive behaviors.

Appellant contends that his present limitations, whether or not they began prior to age eighteen, should render him ineligible for the death penalty. His argument, in essence, is that a murderer who is mentally deficient to the same extent as a murderer who has been found to be mentally retarded should be similarly exempt from capital punishment. The trial court rejected this claim, finding that there is no national consensus that mentally deficient individuals should be entitled to the same exemption as those found to be mentally retarded. In addition, the court noted that the <em>Atkins </em>Court made it clear that not all defendants who claim to be mentally retarded fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there exists a national consensus against capital punishment. <em>Atkins, </em><a href="/us/536/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="536 U.S. 304" data-case-ids="1255406" data-case-paths="/us/536/0304-01">536 U.S. at 317</a>, <a href="/us/536/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="536 U.S. 304" data-case-ids="1255406" data-case-paths="/us/536/0304-01">122 S.Ct. 2242</a>.</p>

As the Majority describes in detail, during a four-day hearing, Appellant attempted to prove these premises, derived directly from the three-prong <em>Miller </em>test, by a preponderance of the evidence. In regard to the first element, defense psychologist Adam Sedlock administered an intelligence test and determined that Appellant scored an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 61-71, indicating that Appellant is functioning within the mild range of mental retardation. With regard to the second element, Appellant produced evidence that his adaptive skills are deficient. Finally, regarding the third element of <em>Miller, </em>that onset was before age eighteen, Appellant offered evidence that he was in special education classes until he dropped out of school in the tenth grade. Further, defense expert Dr. Lawson Frederick Bernstein, Jr., a clinical and forensic neuropsychiatrist, testified that IQ does not change over a lifetime. Based on Dr. Bernstein’s testimony, Appellant’s present IQ score, Appellant’s school records, and interviews with Appellant’s sister, defense expert Sedlock concluded that the onset of Appellant’s mental retardation occurred prior to age eighteen.</p>

Contrary to the trial court or the Majority, I believe that whatever evidence is put forward by an Appellant should be considered without the barrier of a talismanic test. Here, Appellant’s expert Sedlock interviewed Appellant, Appellant’s family, and reviewed Appellant’s school records, and concluded, based on this evidence, that the age of onset of mental retardation was before eighteen. The trial court, and the Majority, has accepted the Commonwealth’s position and that of its expert that absent objective evidence of origination of the symptoms of mental retardation prior to age eighteen, Appellant could not meet his burden. Conversely, I believe this case should be remanded to the trial court to assess whether in the absence of preclusive, objective criteria, and weighing all of the evidence put foiward by Appellant and the Commonwealth, Appellant established mental retardation. I believe further that the trial court should analyze the two remaining elements of <em>Miller </em>so that upon the next appeal, this Court is in a position to determine whether the credible record evidence establishes mental retardation.</p>

I acknowledge that the Commonwealth also argued that in accord with <em>Miller's </em>first two criteria, Appellant did not have limited intellectual functioning or maladaptive behavior. However, the trial court’s decision and this Court’s Majority Opinion both turn solely on Appellant’s alleged failure to prove the third <em>Miller </em>prong by objective testing and diagnosis prior to age eighteen.</p>

Ann Peters, the supervisor of special education for the Frazier School District, reviewed Appellant's school files and testified that at the time Appellant attended the school, there was no formalized evaluation procedure for placing students in special education classes.

The Majority observes that it is possible for a defendant to show age of onset before eighteen in the absence of objective testing from that time by offering school records, social service records, or psychological records to prove that mental retardation manifested before age eighteen. Here, however, according to the trial court and the Majority, Appellant failed to meet his burden of proof because nobody labeled him mentally retarded in his school records, he might have been placed in special education classes because of excessive absences, and his current mental impairments may be the result of something other than mental retardation.</p>

Rainey, </em><a href="/pa/593/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="593 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="3248208" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0067-01">593 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/pa/593/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="928 A.2d 215" data-case-ids="3248208,8355826" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0067-01,/a2d/928/0215-01">928 A.2d 215</a>, 242 (2007). Here, Appellant attempted to meet his burden and overcome the lack of objective testing or the characterization of mental retardation in his school records before his eighteenth birthday by offering expert opinions, as well as the testimony of family members about his adaptive limitations while in school. His experts opined that, considering his school records and contemporary IQ scores, his IQ-related deficiencies were present before age eighteen. Appellant's family members corroborated this conclusion, testifying that his adaptive limitations were present before his eighteenth birthday. In rejecting Appellant's evidence, the trial court focused on his failure to introduce an IQ test administered before age eighteen or to offer any illuminating school, social service, or psychological records, which, again, were extant prior to Appellant's eighteenth birthday, and the Majority affirms this decision. Notwith<a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>standing the Majority’s protests to the contrary, I believe that the trial court and Majority have erected an insurmountable wall for defendants such as Appellant who were not tested or labeled through a structured, formal school procedure.</p>
