The issue as framed by the County is:\n(1) Whether the Trial Court and Commonwealth Court abused their discretion or committed an error of law by holding that a public referendum question ordered to be placed on the ballot pursuant to a validly enacted ordinance that would have asked voters whether they wished to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal Allegheny County\u2019s tax on the retail sale of alcoholic beverages constituted a non-binding, advisory question prohibited from being placed on the ballot?\nThe parties are also directed to address the following additional issue, if applicable:\n(2) If the referendum proposed by petitioner is non-binding, whether specific constitutional or statutory authority is required before such measures may be placed on the ballot?\nIn addressing these issues, the parties are directed to follow the principles of statutory interpretation set forth in the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1901, et seq., in order to ascertain the meaning of Section 2962(b) of the Municipalities Code, 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(b).",
