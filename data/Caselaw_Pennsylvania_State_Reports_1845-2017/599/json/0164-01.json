In reversing the grant of JNOV, the Superior Court overlooked that there was an outstanding motion for lesser relief in the form of a new trial. Therefore, the order of the Superior Court reversing the trial court\u2019s order granting Petitioner\u2019s motion for JNOV is hereby VACATED IN PART, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court, for remand to the trial court, for consideration of Petitioner\u2019s unresolved motion for a new trial, and preparation and filing of a comprehensive opinion thereon.\nJurisdiction relinquished.",
