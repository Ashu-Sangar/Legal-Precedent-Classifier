    <p class="author" id="b309-11" data-blocks='[["BL_309.11",309,[264,1240,293,33]]]'>PER CURIAM:</p>
    <p id="b309-12" data-blocks='[["BL_309.12",309,[221,1310,1151,420]]]'>On August 3, 1975, James E. Jackson, Jr., appellant, was arrested and charged with murder. Appellant was tried nonjury before the Honorable Alex Bonavitacola and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were filed and argued on March 10, 1976. The motions were denied and on April 14, 1976, appellant was sentenced to <em>2lh </em>to 10 years in the state correctional institution at Grater-ford. Appellant now appeals to this court raising two issues.</p>
    <p id="b309-13" data-blocks='[["BL_309.13",309,[220,1784,1151,302]]]'>First, appellant contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he fired the bullet which killed the decedent. Secondly, appellant contends that the evidence established as a matter of law that he was acting in self-defense. We have examined appellant’s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>
    <p id="b309-14" data-blocks='[["BL_309.14",309,[262,2123,616,40]]]'>Judgment of sentence affirmed.</p>
