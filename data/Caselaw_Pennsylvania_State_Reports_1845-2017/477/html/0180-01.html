Appellant’s motion to suppress a statement given the police was denied, and he was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree, aggravated assault, robbery and conspiracy. Following denial of post-verdict motions, the court imposed concurrent sentences of life imprisonment for murder and <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>ten to twenty years for robbery, and suspended sentence on the other charges.

The police also obtained a warrant for appellant’s arrest. Shortly thereafter, the police arrested appellant at Broadmeadows Prison and advised him of his rights. According to police testimony, appellant, in response to the question whether he desired counsel, replied that “he didn’t know right then.” The officers did not continue questioning appellant, stating that they would “talk to him” when they “got down to the police station.”</p>

The police read appellant a form setting out, on a single page, “Your Rights,” and “Waiver of Rights.” Appellant signed this form, on which was printed: “I do not want a lawyer at this time.” Appellant was then confronted with his alleged co-conspirator and that person’s statement incriminating appellant. Appellant read the statement, responding, “I didn’t shoot anybody.” A police officer testified that appellant’s next words were that “he <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>was not going to make a statement until he could talk to his mother.”</p>
    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[222,398,1153,528]]]'>Appellant telephoned his mother. When she and appellant’s brother arrived, she conferred with three police officers in the office of the police Captain. Appellant’s mother testified that one of the officers, whom she had known for several years, said they had picked up her son for murder, but that it was not serious because her son remained in the car, had not gone inside the bar and had become very upset when the others returned and reported the killing. This police officer, however, denied making such a statement to appellant’s mother.</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[223,952,1152,572]]]'>Following this conference, appellant talked privately with his mother and brother. His mother told him to do “whatever the police asked.” Without additional warnings, appellant then gave the police an oral statement, admitting participation in the robbery and presence in the bar but denying he held or used a gun. A tape recorded version of the statement was then made. At that time, after once more informing appellant of his rights, the police obtained a written version of the statement. At trial, the Commonwealth, over objection, introduced into evidence the written statement.</p>

Because the prosecutor’s opening statement was not transcribed, we do not know his precise words. Appellant objected to the opening statement at its conclusion, charging that the prosecutor had commented that the evidence would show that appellant had said, “Kill the white mother fucker.” The district attorney neither at that time nor on this appeal has taken issue with the accuracy of appellant’s version of the remark. When argument is not recorded, objections should be entered during the argument rather than at its conclusion. Nonetheless, here we are able to pass upon the propriety of the challenged remark because there is no dispute as to what was said and the record discloses the content of the remark. See <em>Commonwealth v. Adkins, <a href="/pa/468/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="468 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1719715" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0465-01">468 </a></em><a href="/pa/468/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="468 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1719715" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0465-01">Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="468 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1719715" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0465-01">364 A.2d 287</a> (1976). The trial court also treated appellant’s objection as timely and assured <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>appellant that it would take corrective action if the Commonwealth failed to introduce evidence supporting the remark.</p>

The page on which the instruction would have appeared is missing from the transcript. Although a gap in the record can be so crucial that appellate review is impossible, requiring grant of a new trial, see <em>Commonwealth v. Goldsmith, </em><a href="/pa/452/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="452 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="574792" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0022-01">452 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20478" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="304 A.2d 478">304 A.2d 478</a> (1973), the omission here, precluding review only of the court’s instruction, is not serious, for we hold that the prosecutor’s comment was not error even in the absence of cautionary instructions to the jury.</p>
