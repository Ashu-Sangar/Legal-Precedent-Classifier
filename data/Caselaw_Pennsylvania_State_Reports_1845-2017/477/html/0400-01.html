After a hearing and argument on the matter, the court below granted the Commonwealth’s petition. On April 22, 1975, a date within the extended time, appellee was tried by a judge and jury and was convicted of burglary. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellee was sentenced to a prison term of six to twelve years.</p>

Further, appellee argued that since the case was not tried within the 180-day period called for in the rule, he was entitled to a discharge. The Superior Court agreed with appellee, and on June 30, 1976, the court ordered that appellee be discharged. <em>Commonwealth v.

A criminal complaint charging appellee with burglary and theft was issued on September 24, 1974. The case was listed for trial on January 27, 1975. While the Commonwealth was prepared to proceed, appellee requested a continuance, which the court granted for an unspecified period of time. The case was rescheduled in accordance with the normal Montgomery County procedure, which the trial court described as follows:</p>

Since calendar control is under the direct supervision and control of the Board of Judges of this County, we may take judicial notice of the manner in which our Court Administrator, under our direction, schedules criminal matters. The next criminal session scheduled after the session during which the continuance was granted commenced February 24, 1975, and was a 3 week session. The next succeeding criminal session commenced April 14, 1975, also a 3 week session. Taking into consideration the availability of judicial personnel, the Court sets the number of cases to be listed for each three week segment of criminal court. The Court administrator then schedules specific cases at least 30 days prior to the first date of the criminal session, so that attorneys have ample notice, and sufficient time is allowed for subpoenaing witnesses. As a practical matter, it is thus not possible to superimpose upon an already prepared list, those cases which are continued from a current list. Instead, as happened here, continued cases are scheduled for the second session thereafter. . . . ”</blockquote>

In <em>Wallace, </em>the trial court granted the defendant’s suppression motion on the 270th day. The Commonwealth requested an extension of time to appeal the suppression court’s ruling. The court granted the extension. However, rather than setting a specified date for trial, the court ordered that the defendant be tried within a “reasonable time” following disposition of the appeal. The Commonwealth subsequently withdrew its appeal and brought defendant to trial. In <em>Wallace, </em>thus, no certain time was set for the extension as was done in the instant case. When an extension of time is granted until a certain date, and the case is tried prior to that date, a motion to dismiss under Rule 1100(f) would be a futile gesture. In <em>Wallace, </em>however, since no certain time was set for the extension, it was by no means certain that a petition to dismiss would have been a futile motion.
