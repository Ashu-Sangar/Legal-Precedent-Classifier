One of appellee’s employees, Gary Vogel, filed a written charge of unfair labor practices with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, alleging appellee violated Section 6(l)(a), (b), (c), and (e) of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act. Vogel’s allegations were based on his discharge on the day after he had organized and conducted a meeting with fellow employees for the purpose of forming a grievance committee. The Board issued a complaint to which was attached a copy of Vogel’s charge of unfair labor practices.</p>

According to the Commonwealth Court, the employer’s conduct constituted an “unfair practice described” by Section 5 of the Act and not by any of the provisions of Section 6. According to the Commonwealth Court, however, appellee <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>could not be found guilty of violating Section 5 because it had never been charged with a violation of that Section.

Section 6(l)(c) does not call for such a result. Under Section 6(l)(c), if the employer’s conduct discourages membership in any labor organization an unfair labor practice takes place. An employee might call a meeting to discuss forming a new labor organization or joining an existing labor organization which is not established at the employer’s place of business. Firing an employee for calling an organization meeting certainly tends to discourage not only that employee but other employees from becoming members of <em>any </em>labor organization. A common sense reading of the Act requires that it cover a situation such as exists here, and prohibit the employer from discouraging membership in any labor organization, regardless of whether such labor organization exist at the employer’s place of business, exists somewhere else, or is not yet in existence at all.

Complaints about Vogel’s work habits were cited as the motivation for his discharge, but substantial evidence to support the Board’s contrary finding exists. There is testimony that nothing was said about Vogel’s work habits at the time of his discharge, and that the president of appellee corporation told Vogel that “you no longer like it here and we no longer like you.” Also, the testimony indicates that the employer knew of and had discussed Vogel’s meeting with another employee before firing him. <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>Finally, Vogel was discharged within twelve hours of the meeting on the previous night. The record therefore adequately supports the Board’s finding that Vogel’s labor activity prompted his discharge.</p>
