During the course of the evening, appellant and the victim became engaged in an argument over a sum of money that the victim had loaned appellant earlier that same evening. When the argument became more heated, the bartender on duty, Robert Heresco, the victim’s brother, intervened to quiet the dispute. At that point appellant began arguing with the bartender also. Shortly thereafter appellant told his wife to get his gun out of the car, which was parked outside of the club. Appellant’s wife left the club. Soon after her departure, the bartender insisted that appellant and the victim leave the club; the bartender escorted the two men out to the parking lot and then returned to his duties inside the club.</p>

Then appellant’s wife arrived driving an automobile. At that time appellant went over to the driver’s side and told his wife to get out. When she refused, he struck her in the chest, pulled her out of the car, and got into the driver’s seat himself. Then the victim leaned into the driver’s side saying, “don’t, don’t, don’t!” Seconds later there was a single gunshot; the victim fell back onto the curb, and appellant sped away in the vehicle. Shortly after the shooting, the victim was pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital.</p>
