No. 3, P.L. 96, art. IV, § 405, 50 P.S. 4405 (herein cited as “the Act”) which permitted emergency involuntary detentions without a hearing for ten days. On November 21, 1973, a hearing was held in Northumberland County, Court of Common Pleas, to determine whether appellant should be detained longer than the ten days allowed by Section 4405. The court, finding appellant to be mentally ill and in need of care and treatment, committed appellant to Danville State Hospital until such time as the director of the hospital determined that care and treatment were no longer necessary. On April 15, 1974, appellant was unconditionally released from the hospital.</p>

As to the request for the destruction of the hospital records, the trial court, citing Section 401 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. IV, § 401, 17 P.S. § 211.401(a) (1977-78 Supp.) ruled that the Court of Common Pleas was without jurisdiction to entertain the matter since the hospital, as a state agency, was under the Commonwealth Court’s jurisdiction.</p>

      <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>Accordingly, appellant filed a petition with the Commonwealth Court requesting the destruction of the hospital records. The Commonwealth Court ruled<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that since Section 4602(a) of the Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> required a state hospital to maintain records on all patients admitted or committed, and since there was no statute which authorized the destruction of said records, the Commonwealth Court was without authority to order the destruction of the records. Appellant appealed to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[250,793,1154,250]]]'>The sole question before this Court is whether a person who has been unlawfully committed to a state mental hospital has a right to the destruction of the hospital records which were created as a result of the illegal commitment. We answer in the affirmative.</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.6",524,[251,1076,1154,686]]]'>The Pennsylvania Constitution specifically provides that “all men . . . have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which . . . [is] acquiring, possessing, and protecting . . . reputation '. . . ” Const, art. 1, § 1. We cannot ignore the fact that many people in our society view mental illness with disdain and apprehension.

This section states that records must be kept on persons who are “admitted or commit<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>ted to any facility . . . <em>under any provision of this </em>act”. Since it has been adjudicated that appellant’s November 21, 1973 commitment is null and void, appellant was never “admitted or committed to any facility <em>under any provision of this </em>act”. Therefore, Section 4602(a) does not bar the destruction of the hospital records in question.</p>
