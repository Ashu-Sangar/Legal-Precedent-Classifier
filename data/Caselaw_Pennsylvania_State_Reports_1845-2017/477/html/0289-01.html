      <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>An action to quiet title was brought by Walter H. Douglass, Jr. and his wife, Dallas Douglass, appellants. The facts are not disputed; the case has proceeded on stipulated facts which are as follows. In 1965 appellants bought a residence in Bucks County and thereafter paid the realty taxes through the mortgagee. However, appellants failed to comply with an agreement entered into at settlement whereby they became obligated to pay an interim school tax for the year 1966 in the amount of $191.10. In November of 1967 the Bucks County Treasurer sent a notice to appellants of the amount due, including the following clause in bold type: “PAYMENT ACCEPTED ONLY BY CASH, MONEY ORDER OR CERTIFIED CHECK.” Similar delinquency notices were sent February 1, 1968, April 1, 1968, and June 3, 1968. The fourth notice also stated that a tax sale was to be scheduled for August 5, 1968, unless payment was made. No payment having been tendered by that date, the property, with a mortgage of $14,100, was sold to Grace Building.</p>
    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[237,1265,1148,856]]]'>On June 1, 1970, appellants received a final delinquency notice informing them of their right of redemption and stating that “cash, certified check or money order” in the amount of $251.26 (which included interest) was payable to the treasurer. On July 27, 1970, nine days before the expiration date of the redemption period, appellants mailed to the Bucks County Treasurer a personal check drawn on their personal account at the Girard Trust Bank in the amount of $251.26.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Instead of depositing appellants’ uncertified check on the day of receipt, the treasurer’s office mailed it back to appellants with instructions that payment would be accepted only by “cash, certified check or money order.” Appellants did not have the check certified until August 6, 1970, and it was not received by the treasurer’s office until August 10, 1970. On August 6, 1970, the treasurer’s office deeded the property to Grace Building.</p>

During the Nineteenth Century, this was a valid concern, since all of these cases deal with promissory notes, which are a promise to pay at some specified time in the future. With modern banking procedure, checks are a promise to pay for only a short period, as the collection process employed by commercial banks normally involves a short period. A treasurer will today know whether a check has been paid or dishonored shortly after processing a check. A treasurer accepting a check is hardly substituting “his <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>own responsibility for cash,” thus doing nothing “contrary to his duty as a public agent.”</p>
