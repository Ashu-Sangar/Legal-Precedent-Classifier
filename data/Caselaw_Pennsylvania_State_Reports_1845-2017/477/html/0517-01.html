Appellant first renews its jurisdictional challenge, arguing that appellees have an adequate remedy at law and hence the case should have been certified to the law side of the Court. Appellant’s second claim is that the Chancellor improperly interpreted the sales contract. Appellant contends that it was entitled to cancel the sales agreement because the agreement required only that appellant apply for a building permit, which was denied. Third, appellant argues that because the Trachtenburgs’ property was encumbered by a lease, and the contract required appellees to convey title free of any leases, appellees were not “ready, willing, and able” to tender performance which is a prerequisite to <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>specific performance of the agreement. Fourth, appellant claims that the Chancellor erred in refusing to admit evidence relevant to the existence of the lease.

Appellant characterizes appellees’ suit as one to obtain the purchase price under the agreements, argues that such relief is no more than a suit for money damages alone, and contends that these should therefore have been certified to the law side of the trial court. To support its conclusion that equity did not have jurisdiction in this case, appellant relies principally on <em>Kauffman’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/55/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="55 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1470651" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0383-01">55 Pa. 383</a> (1867), where one hundred eleven years ago, this Court held that a seller of real estate cannot get specific performance of a contract to convey land if the seller only seeks the payment of the purchase price. <em>See also Heights Land Co. v.

Because we apply equitable principles does not, however, alter the fact that the proceeding is one for the law side of the court, with the defendant entitled to have the case decided by a jury. A defendant’s right to have a jury as the ultimate finder of fact, a right not available in equity <em>(see </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 1513) is an important right not to be lightly regarded.

Appellees claim their remedy at law is not adequate because they seek more than the purchase price; specifically, that the deed be transferred and that the $1,000 deposited in escrow by appellant be settled. Appellees do not contend, however, that this relief cannot be granted as incident to a judgment at law requiring appellant to pay appellees the unpaid purchase price. The $1,000 in escrow is nothing more than part of the purchase price, and since equitable principles would be fully applicable to appellees’ action, <em>e. g., Freeman v. Lawton, supra, </em>it seems clear the trial court cannot enter judgment in favor of appellees unless its order is conditioned upon appellees transferring the deeds to the three parcels of real estate; appellees should not be permitted to recover the purchase price and still retain ownership of the three contiguous parcels. In summary, all the relief sought by appellees, including damages, are recoverable at law.</p>

Appellees also cite their expressed desire to be relieved of the burden of land ownership. These arguments would be persuasive if the only remedy available to appellees was damages measured by the difference between contract price and market value. If appellees’ remedies were so limited, the argument can be made that appellees should be entitled to specific performance. <em>See Restatement of Contracts </em>§ 360 &amp; Comment (c) (1932); 5A <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>§ 1145, at 142 (1964). As stated above, however, Pennsylvania law does not limit appellees to this remedy, and should it be decided on remand that appellant did in fact wrongfully repudiate the sales agreement, and that appellees are otherwise entitled to relief, awarding appellees the purchase price plus any other established damages, will put them in as good a position as if appellant had honored the contract.
