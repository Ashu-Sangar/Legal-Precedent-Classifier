Kester. The substance of the Petition for Distribution was that the 1955 instrument constituted a mu<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>tual agreement between Mr. and Mrs. Kester for the disposition of their property, which became irrevocable upon the death of either.

Kester died prior to his wife’s execution of the 1971 will. The petitioner, therefore, took the position that insofar as the provisions of Mrs. Kester’s 1971 will differed from the provisions of the joint will of 1955 they were in derogation of Clarence Walter Kester’s rights thereunder. Thus, even though the later document was properly admitted to probate, it was contended that distribution should be made according to the former; that is to say, to Clarence Walter Kester absolutely to the exclusion of the remaindermen.</blockquote>

At the same time, the Church filed Objections to the Second and Final account insofar as it claims credit in the amount of $13,638.17 for advances by the accountant “of his own money to be paid toward the bills for siding, new doors, etc. on decedent’s single house”.

Although such a suggestion is made in <em>Herr Estate, </em><a href="/pa/400/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="400 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1292526" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0090-01">400 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%2032" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="161 A.2d 32">161 A.2d 32</a> (1960), whatever the validity of the suggestion it has no applicability in the case before us. The same language was used by Olive M. Kester when she executed her 1971 will which obviously was not intended to be a contract since no other party was involved.</p>
