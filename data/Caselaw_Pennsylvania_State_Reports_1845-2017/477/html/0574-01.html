Evidence was received on whether the Commonwealth’s use of the property created a safety and security problem for residents of South Fayette Township. Following the hearing, the court issued a decree enjoining the Commonwealth “from occupying or using or permitting others to occupy or use the subject property as a unit for juveniles adjudicated delinquent” and directing “all persons [then] occupying said premises as a juvenile detention facility to vacate the same within fourteen days of the receipt of a certified copy of [the] order.” The court’s Memorandum Opinion concludes that the Commonwealth’s use of the property was contrary to the zoning ordinance and therefore that the Township was “entitled to the relief requested under the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>City of Pittsburgh v.

The Commonwealth Court and South Fayette Township erred in asserting that this Court’s decision in <em>City of Pittsburgh, </em>supra, establishes that any land use by the Commonwealth contrary to local zoning ordinances may, without more, justify injunctive relief. To the contrary, <em>City of Pittsburgh </em>establishes that applicability of zoning regulations to the Commonwealth depends upon an examination in each case of the nature of the competing legislative grants of authority, the purposes for which these grants were created and the facts of the individual case. Id. <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">468 Pa. at 182</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">360 A.2d at 612</a>. Thus, this Court in <em>City of Pittsburgh, </em>faced with the question of whether the Bureau of Corrections could use leased premises in a residential section of Pittsburgh as a -'re-release center for adult female convicts in contravention of the city’s zoning ordinance, examined 1) the authority given the Bureau of Corrections to use leased premises for pre-release centers, Act of July 16, 1968, P.L. 351, § 1, 61 P.S. § 1051 (Supp.1977); 2) the grant of power to a second class city to enact zoning ordinances, Act of March 31, 1927, P.L. 98, § 1, 53 P.S. § 25051 (1957); 3) the specific “Conflict with other laws” provision in the Act giving second class cities zoning authority, Act of March 31,1927, P.L. 98, § 8, 53 P.S. § 25058 (1957); and 4) the particular circumstances of the case, <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>including the existence of other suitable sites for establishment of a pre-release center and the “density concerns” of the city. We concluded that the Bureau of Corrections was subject to local zoning regulations in establishing pre-release centers for adult female convicts because 1) the act authorizing the Bureau to establish pre-release centers evidenced no legislative intent to override second class cities’ statutory zoning powers; 2) the legislative grant of zoning power to second class cities explicitly directed that zoning regulations shall govern whenever zoning regulations of second class cities impose higher standards than are required in any other statute; and 3) other suitable locations were available to accommodate both the community’s interest in low-density residential zoning and that of the Bureau of Corrections in establishing pre-release centers.</p>

The Commonwealth Court .must determine whether the Commonwealth can fulfill its responsibility as <em>parens patriae </em>to provide care and treatment for delinquent children by establishing a facility for fifteen juveniles on four acres of land owned by the Commonwealth within South Fayette Township, a first class township. Resolution of this question depends upon an analysis of 1) whether the Commonwealth’s intended use of the property violated the zoning ordinance; 2) the significance of the Commonwealth’s ownership of the property; 3) the responsibility of the Commonwealth as <em>parens patriae, </em>derived from the Juvenile Act, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, § 1, 11 P.S. §§ 56-101 et seq.

Most of the evidence presented concerned the “irreparable injury” prong of the test for issuance of a preliminary injunction. South Fayette Township introduced evidence concerning incidents occurring on the property when it was operated by the Boy’s Industrial Home of Western Pennsylvania, a facility housing up to 350 delinquent and dependent children with no security surroundings.. South Fayette Township also discussed three escapes from the facility in 1976 when it was operated by a private trustee and before implementation of the complete security program installed by the Commonwealth. Reports were available for only two of the escapes. They established that one boy was missing for only forty-five minutes and the other one for approximately two hours. South Fayette Township also offered evidence of escapes from the New Castle Youth Development Center, an overcrowded facility located in another county encompassing <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>intermediate and non-security programs. The Commonwealth Court properly noted the evidence was of limited relevance as there was “no indication any of those escapees are of the same character of the [juveniles] coming [to Oakdale ITU] or the security is the same.”</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[216,565,1152,573]]]'>To establish that there was no immediate risk of irreparable injury, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that the Oakdale ITU held fewer juveniles, fifteen, and had superior security than the facilities upon which South Fayette Township’s argument was based. The Commonwealth also introduced evidence that since January, 1976, security at the New Castle and Oakdale intensive treatment units were nearly identical and that there were no escapes from the New Castle intensive treatment unit since January, 1976. There were no problems at the Oakdale ITU during the short time the Commonwealth occupied it.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.6",627,[216,1164,1153,840]]]'>The record shows that the Commonwealth and South Fayette Township held meetings on the issue of the Oakdale ITU, including a meeting in late March, 1977, with Governor Milton Shapp. On April 19, 1977, the Commonwealth informed South Fayette Township by letter of the Governor’s decision to approve the juvenile unit at Oakdale ITU upon the conditions that: 1) all security installations be completed prior to occupancy; 2) no more than fifteen juveniles occupy Oakdale ITU at any time; 3) no expansion of the site be considered at any time; 4) adequate staff be maintained at all times; and 5) a citizens’ group be formed to monitor the continuing security program at Oakdale, to act as advocate for residents and to ensure DPW’s compliance with these conditions. DPW’s Director of Security Services for the Western Region testified that, as required, all security requirements had been put into effect prior to occupancy.</p>

South Fayette Township’s sole proof of anticipated injury was evidence of incidents occurring months and years before the hearing at facilities operated under different circum<a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>stances than the Commonwealth’s present operation of Oak-dale ITU. Since all the most recent evidence established that Oakdale ITU was secure, and South Fayette Township made no showing the problems complained of presently exist, South Fayette Township did not establish the clear right to relief necessary to sustain issuance of a preliminary injunction. See <em>Zebra v. Pittsburgh School District, </em><a href="/pa/449/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="449 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1945644" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0432-01">449 Pa. 432</a>, 439-40, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20748" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="296 A.2d 748">296 A.2d 748</a>, 751-52 (1972). In <em>Zebra, </em>this Court vacated a preliminary injunction enjoining a school district from requiring forty-seven children to attend a certain school, a measure taken to improve racial balance and reduce overcrowding, and requiring provision of other school facilities. This Court concluded that evidence of acts of violence, threats, harassment and intimidation directed against some of the transferred students did not justify issuance of the preliminary injunction, partially mandatory in nature, because, in part, only eleven students testified concerning the complained of acts and the order was based on incidents occurring almost a month earlier, before corrective measures were taken.</p>

The mandatory provision of the order requiring all persons presently occupying the Oakdale ITU to vacate within fourteen days of issuance of the order would change significantly the status of the parties. The Director of Youth Services testified no other appropriate facilities were currently available in the region to house the juveniles located in Oakdale ITU. Thus, the order would require transfer of Oakdale ITU juveniles to the New Castle facility, where rehabilitation programs were inferior and overcrowded conditions would again be critical.</p>

Such a decree would be, by its terms, merely “prohibitory.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Yet I think it clear that such a preliminary injunction would also have to be vacated for the reasons outlined in the Court’s opinion. Indeed, the mandatory portion of the Commonwealth Court’s decree was merely the obverse of its prohibitory order. The Court first “enjoined [respondent, the Commonwealth] from occupying or using — the subject property as a unit for juveniles adjudicated delinquent,” and then specified that the implementation of this decree be accompanied by the removal of the occupants of the facility within 14 days.” The prohibition could hardly be complied with in any other manner; all that the “mandatory” segment of this decree added was a time limit for compliance.</p>
