    <p id="b417-10" data-blocks='[["BL_417.10",417,[238,1032,1149,521]]]'>Appellant, Clifford Walker, was tried before a jury and found guilty of murder in the first degree, criminal conspiracy, robbery, and burglary. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge, and concurrent seven and one-half to fifteen year sentences for robbery and burglary. The judgment of sentence for murder was appealed directly to us; the judgments of sentence for robbery and burglary were taken to the Superior Court and subsequently transferred to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b417-11" data-blocks='[["BL_417.11",417,[239,1586,1148,525]]]'>Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to suppress all statements given to the police by the appellant. The trial court did suppress some statements because of an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment, but refused to suppress other statements made earlier in time than those suppressed. As a result of the pretrial ruling, the statements in question were introduced by the prosecution during appellant’s trial. Appellant continued his challenge to the statements in post-verdict motions and also in this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b417-12" data-blocks='[["BL_417.12",417,[237,2142,1148,153]],["BL_418.1",418,[268,270,1156,958]]]'> The appellant argues that all statements which he gave to the police should have been suppressed because appellant, who was a juvenile, was denied his right to <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>consult with an interested and informed parent, adult, or counsel. The suppression court denied relief on this ground even though it found that appellant was a juvenile and was denied the right to consultation. It did so, however, on April 24, 1974, prior to our decisions holding that all juveniles are entitled to consultation before they can effectively waive their constitutional rights. Under those cases, appellant, who is before us on direct appeal, is entitled to relief. We agree therefore with appellant that all statements should have been suppressed. At the time of his arrest, and at the time the statements were obtained, appellant was seventeen years of age. A juvenile cannot effectively waive <em>Miranda </em>rights absent an opportunity to consult with an interested and informed parent, adult, or counsel. Statements made by a juvenile without this protection must be suppressed. <em>Commonwealth v.

In those cases the defendants failed to contest at trial the <em>voluntariness </em>of their statements, and affirmatively used the statement for the benefit of the defense. Unlike the issue of voluntariness, the issue of the effectiveness of a juvenile’s purported waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights cannot be relitigated at trial once the suppression court has determined the issue adversely to the defendant. Because voluntariness is an issue which can be raised during the trial by the defendant, but was not raised in <em>Parks </em>and <em>Segers, </em>we held in those cases the issue had been waived. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

(Appellant, <em>during evidentiary hearing on the admissibility </em>of the confession, stated he did not object to the confession because he intended to use it affirmatively.) The cases, however, do not stand for the proposition that no evidence admitted over the objection of a defendant may be used during the trial for the benefit of the defense. Such a rule would improperly handicap the defense. The defense is always entitled to attempt to use evidence introduced by the prosecution in a manner favorable to it.</p>
