      <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>On the afternoon of October 15, 1973, Glenn Norman Decker, an off-duty auxiliary policeman<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> in the borough of Roaring Spring, Blair County, went in search of a friend who was running his dogs in the woods behind the home of Eshelman’s grandmother, Margaret Smith, where Eshelman also resided. The Smith property was located in Taylor Township, a short distance from the adjoining community of Roaring Spring. After talking with his friend, Decker, without permission, crossed the Smith property. Behind the house near the edge of the woods he noticed an old Cadillac, surrounded by weeds and without tags, which he knew had belonged to Eshelman. Through the windows of the car he observed that it contained a number of thin packages or rolls; the contents of the packages, wrapped in newspaper and tied with string, were not visible. Decker, however, recalled that he had heard a talk at his police station which indicated that this was a common method of wrapping and drying marijuana, and he became suspicious that the packages contained marijuana. He therefore reached inside a partially open window of the car, extracted one of the packages and, without opening it or examining its contents, took it to the police station at Roaring Spring and showed it to the chief of police, under whom he worked when on active duty. The chief then made arrangements by telephone for Decker to take the package to Trooper Winklbauer at the state police barracks at Hollidaysburg.</p>

As a result of this information, Winklbauer sought and obtained a warrant to search the Cadillac. He then went to the Smith property, served the warrant on Mrs. Smith, searched the car, and removed from it other packages containing plants similar to the one removed by Decker. While searching the car, he also observed through the open door of a nearby shed other similar pack<a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>ages, but he did not then examine them. At this point Eshelman arrived, and Winklbauer arrested him and advised him of his rights. Eshelman admitted that both the car and the plants it had contained belonged to him. He also admitted that the plants inside the shed were his, stated “you might as well get them all,” and helped the officer remove them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

In affirming, the Superior Court majority noted that the suppression judge, in his capacity of trier of fact, chose to believe the testimony of Decker that he was not searching for marijuana or acting under police orders when he trespassed upon the Smith property, observed that Taylor Township was outside Decker’s jurisdictional territory, and emphasized a statute limiting the police powers of auxiliary policemen to periods when they are on active duty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Eshelman, however, argues that the evidence <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>establishes Decker was acting as a police officer and allows “the clear inference” he was acting “under the direction of sovereign authority,” and that, in any event, the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> should be extended to evidence improperly obtained by private citizens.</p>

At this time the state prohibition act had been repealed, and the appellants argued that the National Prohibition Act by its terms made the troopers agents of the federal government in such cases. Justice Brandéis, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, rejected the appellants’ contention that at the time of the seizure the troopers were agents of the United States and concluded that it was immaterial whether or not state law imposed a duty on them to aid in the enforcement of the National Prohibition Act. Rather, he concluded that, in view of the established working relationship between state and federal authorities in these cases, the initiation of a federal prosecution on the basis of evidence seized “solely for the purpose of aiding the United States in the enforcement of its laws,” <a href="/us/275/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="275 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="6141344" data-case-paths="/us/275/0310-01">275 U.S. at 317</a>, <a href="/us/275/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="275 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="6141344" data-case-paths="/us/275/0310-01">48 S.Ct. at 139</a>, was in effect a ratification of the wrongful search and seizure made on behalf of the United States, even though there was no evidence the federal authorities had participated in or directed it. Of particular significance for our purposes is the fact that the <em>Gambino </em>Court specifically distinguished <em>Burdeau </em>on the ground that <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>the seizure by private citizens in that case was <em>not </em>made solely for the purpose of aiding the United States, and it further noted that the federal authorities not only had nothing to do with the seizure but had no knowledge of it until several months later.</p>

Furthermore, he testified that he became suspicious of the contents of Eshelman’s car because of information he had received at his police station about how marijuana was dried and wrapped.
