A review of the record in this light discloses the following facts: On March 6, 1974, the victim was standing on the sidewalk in the 1700 block of Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The victim saw something coming toward his head and then was struck once in the face by appellant, using a closed fist. The victim fell to the ground but never lost consciousness. He was taken to an emergency ward where he was treated for the nose injury. An eyewitness, a taxicab driver who was parked near the scene of the incident, testified that appellant walked up to the victim and struck him in the nose and then walked away. The taxicab driver and a police officer apprehended appellant after a short chase.</p>

Rather the Commonwealth argues that the appellant’s action in striking the victim with his fist is sufficient evidence to show that appellant intended to inflict serious bodily injury, thereby subjecting appellant to liability under the attempt provision of the aggravated assault statute. <em>See id </em>§ 2702(a)(1). The Superior Court accepted this argument and stressed the fact that the blow delivered by appellant was directed at “a very vital part of the human body,” the victim’s head. <em>Commonwealth v. Alexander, supra, </em>237 Pa.Super, at 115, <a href="/citations/?q=346%20A.2d%20319" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="346 A.2d 319">346 A.2d at 321</a>.</p>

      <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>While there can be no dispute about the physiological significance of the head, where the victim did not actually sustain the requisite serious bodily injury, we cannot say that the mere fact that a punch was delivered to that portion of the body is sufficient, <em>without more, </em>to support a finding that appellant intended to inflict serious bodily injury. Where the injury actually inflicted did not constitute serious bodily injury, the charge of aggravated assault can be supported only if the evidence supports a finding that the blow delivered was accompanied by the intent to inflict serious bodily injury. Criminal intent may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Caye, </em><a href="/pa/465/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="465 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1712673" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0098-01">465 Pa. 98</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="465 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1712673" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0098-01">348 A.2d 136</a> (1975); <em>Commonwealth v.

In the instant case, the only direct evidence of appellant’s intent is his testimony to the effect that he did not intend to seriously injure the victim. Thus, any evidence of his intent to inflict serious bodily injury must be gleaned from the other circumstances surrounding appellant’s attack on the victim. In this case there simply are no such circumstances to support a finding that appellant harbored the requisite intent. There is no evidence that appellant was disproportionately larger or stronger than the victim; appellant was not restrained from escalating his attack upon the victim; appellant had no weapon or other implement to aid his attack; appellant made no statements before, during, or after the attack which might indicate his intent to inflict further injury upon* the victim. Appellant delivered one punch and walked away. See <em>Commonwealth v.
