    <p id="b558-7" data-blocks='[["BL_558.7",558,[251,588,1157,843]]]'>Appellant was arrested January 12, 1976, and charged with burglary and resisting arrest. On April 29, 1976, the date set for trial, appellant expressed his desire to plead guilty to both charges. Following an on-the-record colloquy, the court accepted the pleas, directed appellant to pay costs and restitution and imposed a sentence of four to fifteen years imprisonment on the burglary charge and a consecutive sentence of one to two years imprisonment for resisting arrest. Appellant thereupon took a pro se appeal to the Superior Court. Pursuant to appellant’s petition to remand to the trial court, the Superior Court remanded the case on August 5, 1976, for consideration of appellant’s petition to withdraw his guilty pleas as if timely filed. The trial court denied appellant permission to withdraw his guilty pleas and the Superior Court affirmed. Appellant then sought allowance of appeal.</p>

It is an obvious and necessary corollary to this rule that the colloquy occur at the time the waiver is made.
