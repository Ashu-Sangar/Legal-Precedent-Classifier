      <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Minerd v. Margiotti, </em>as well as these latter decisions which adopted its reasoning, were based on the premise that such power “enveloped” an attorney general at common law and the Attorney General of this Commonwealth was clothed with the same power. As this Court has recognized, this reasoning has been severely criticized, and Pennsylvania seems to be the only jurisdiction which has approved the supersession of a District Attorney based on an Attorney General’s common law powers. <em>See Packel v.

The Court in <em>Minerd </em>based its conclusion on an analysis of the powers of the King’s Attorney in England, out of which evolved the modern office of the attorney general. The King’s attorney, appointed by the Crown, was the chief law enforcement officer in England. He managed all of the Crown’s legal affairs, including the prosecution of all suits, both criminal and civil, in which the Crown was interested. The King’s Attorney also had the right to appoint deputies, over which he had complete control and could replace at any time. <em>See </em><a href="/pa/325/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="325 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1172312" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0017-01">325 Pa. at 23-24</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20524" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="188 A. 524">188 A. at 527</a>.

One possible reading of these two sections, therefore, is that § 907 deline<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>ates the only method by which the Attorney General can ever supersede a district attorney. This interpretation arguably finds support in the Act of March 20, 1939, P.L. 8, where the General Assembly “repealed absolutely” the Act of July 30, 1938, P.L. 17, which had conferred on the Attorney General the power to supersede, at his discretion, the District Attorney of a county at any stage of an investigation or proceeding pending in that county’s criminal courts. This action indicated, at the least, a legislative disapproval of a system in which the Attorney General could, at his pleasure, displace an elected official in the execution of his governmental responsibility. We could reasonably conclude that the Legislature believed that the elective process, as well as § 907’s authorization of a president judge to intervene in appropriate cases, were sufficient checks on the office of District Attorney.</p>
    <p id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[207,1144,1149,469]]]'>Another possible construction of §§ 904 and 907, one urged upon us by the Attorney General, is to hold § 907 is but one prescribed avenue of supersession, and the Attorney General can supersede a district attorney at will providing his decision to do so is not an abuse of discretion. Under this view, the appellant argues, the Attorney General’s legislative mandate to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth includes the power to supersede a district attorney despite the seeming limitation of § 907.</p>

In our view, neither represents a proper accommodation of the two statutory provisions or the important interests they attempt to promote. Section 907, the only section which expressly authorizes supersession, speaks to the limited situation of a president judge requesting that the attorney general become involved in a proper case in a prosecutorial matter. We reject the position that § 907 represents the only instance in which the Attorney General can ever supersede a District Attorney. That construction would give insufficient consideration to § 904, which empowers the Attorney General “to take such steps, and adopt such means, as may be reasonably necessary to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth.” If a <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>situation arose where the Attorney General was warranted in believing that superseding a district attorney was a necessary means of enforcing those laws, he would be helpless if supersession could only be initiated by the president judge and not by the Attorney General.</p>
    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[286,550,1158,732]]]'>On the other hand, we reject the notion that § 907 in no way limits an Attorney General who desires to supersede a District Attorney. In drafting § 907, our Legislature enacted a scheme whereby a member of the judicial branch could act as a check on an elected District Attorney who could not or would not carry out his prosecutorial responsibilities. Once a president judge requested the Attorney General to involve his offices in a criminal matter, only then was his power <em>plenary. </em>We believe that § 907 evidences a legislative belief that the Attorney General’s entry into local law enforcement should be exercised with circumspection, and that § 907 negates the Attorney General’s argument that with the narrow exception of an abuse of discretion, his power to supersede a district attorney is untrammelled.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[288,1303,1157,730]]]'>Although § 907 provides that a president judge may initiate a request that the Attorney General supersede a District Attorney, legislation is silent on the procedure that the Attorney General must use if the Attorney General desires to initiate action in order to perform his duties under § 904. We believe that § 904 and § 907 can be properly accommodated by holding that if the Attorney General initiates action under § 904, he must do so by presenting a petition to the president judge. Because of § 904, we cannot deny to the Attorney General the right to initiate action. Because of § 907, we cannot allow the Attorney General to initiate action before a judge other than the president judge. The president judge’s decision, in any event, would be a final judgment subject to appellate review.</p>

Although there is no evidence of “judge shopping” in this case, our holding pre<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>vents that possibility whereby the Attorney General could possibly circumvent and undermine the authority of the president judge contained in § 907. Since the president judge’s determination on the issue of supersession is subject to appellate review, proper effect is given to the Attorney General’s obligation under § 904 “to take such steps, and adopt such means, as may be reasonably necessary to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth.”</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[239,725,1151,1215]]]'>The issue remains as to the proper standard and the burden of proof that should be applied by the president judge, as well as the appellate court, in reviewing a president judge’s decision to allow or deny the Attorney General to supersede a District Attorney. We believe, in view of the fact that the District Attorney is statutorily and constitutionally responsible for law enforcement at the local level, that the Attorney General must establish good cause for the supersession. Supersession is not a “reasonably necessary [step] to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth” unless it is established, after a consideration of all the circumstances, that the District Attorney abused his discretion. Our holding therefore does no violence to § 904 of the Administrative Code. Moreover, we think significant the expressed preference of the General Assembly which has retained for nearly half a century the statute vesting this discretion in the president judge (§ 907) but rejecting a provision giving the Attorney General the same discretion. <em>See </em>Pa.Leg.J. 12-15, 38 — 42, 62 (1938); Pa.Leg.J. 414-15, 465-68, 624 (1939). In insulating to this degree the District Attorney’s office from outside intervention, we do no more than confirm the legislative judgment that accountability and responsibility in law enforcement should coexist to the fullest extent possible.</p>

The Attorney General’s basis for this belief is reasonable.
