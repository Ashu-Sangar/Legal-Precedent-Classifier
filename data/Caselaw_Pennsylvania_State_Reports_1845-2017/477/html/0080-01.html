Such a conclusion follows, however, only if the inadequacy of the colloquy conclusively establishes the ineffectiveness of the waiver and hence requires the grant of a new trial. The majority suggests that such a rule was announced in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b135-5" data-blocks='[["BL_135.5",135,[195,392,1151,1448]]]'>Trial counsel’s decision, then, whether or not to raise the involuntary waiver issue rests not only on the facial adequacy or inadequacy of the colloquy, but also on a review of the circumstances surrounding the waiver. A lawyer who prior to trial had fully discussed with his client the various considerations for and against trial by jury and the consequences of the waiver could reasonably conclude that the decision to forego a jury was in the client’s best interests when made and still remained so. He might also reasonably believe in light of <em>Williams </em>that the attendant circumstances would render futile any effort to challenge the waiver either post-trial or on appeal. Counsel may not be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue an avenue which, in light of the then existing state of the law, would appear frivolous. <em>Commonwealth v. Rice, </em><a href="/pa/456/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="456 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="584461" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0090-01">456 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20705" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="318 A.2d 705">318 A.2d 705</a> (1974). Nor may counsel be deemed ineffective for failing to anticipate a change in the law such as is accomplished by today’s opinion when it announces a <em>per se </em>rule of invalidity of a jury trial waiver whenever the supporting colloquy is inadequate. See, <em>e.g., Commonwealth v. Triplett, </em><a href="/pa/476/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="476 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1736902" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0083-01">476 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="476 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1736902" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0083-01">381 A.2d 877</a> (1977). Thus a reviewing court may not properly pass upon counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness in failing to pursue a claimed facially defective waiver of jury trial unless and until it is apprised of the reasons for counsel’s inaction. Because the record before us does not yield this information the only proper course is to remand for an evidentiary hearing to develop it.</p>
