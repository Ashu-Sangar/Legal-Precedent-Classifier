Wyoming Sand sought to compel appellees to pay interest on a tax refund awarded Wyoming Sand by the Board of Review of the Bureau of Sales and Use Tax of the Department of Revenue.

Taxpayer asserts it should not have been applied towards the disputed $103,050 assessment because under section 241 of the Tax <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>Reform Code of 1971, Act of March 4,1971, P.L. 33, § 241, 72 P.S. § 7241 (Supp.1977), refunds may not be credited without the taxpayer’s consent against assessments not final, and this application was an abuse of appellees’ discretion. Taxpayer further contends that because it had a clear legal right to this money, mandamus was a proper remedy to compel payment, and section 16 of the Mandamus Act of 1893<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> allows damages calculated as interest for the period of unlawful retention.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Finally, it contends a mandamus action for damages alone may be maintained after the underlying wrong, the illegal detention of the refund, has been remedied.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[258,908,1157,673]]]'>We do not agree. Wyoming Sand overlooks the fact that it took an appeal from the refund and that by statute this appeal subjected the refund to increase or decrease by the Board of Finance and Revenue. 72 P.S. § 7254. Because of taxpayer’s appeal, this award was not a final adjudication directing the payment of a sum certain. We hold that the Fiscal Code, Act of April 9,1929, P.L. 343, §§ 1 et seq., as amended, 72 P.S. §§ 1 et seq. (1949 &amp; Supp.1977), forbade appellees to release the refund to Wyoming Sand pending disposition of its appeal. Therefore, Wyoming Sand had no legal right to the refund pending appeal, appellees did not abuse their discretion by refusing to make the refund, and mandamus will not lie against appellees.</p>

The statute provides for appeal only by the taxpayer: the Commonwealth has no authority to appeal either a full or partial grant of a refund.

(1949 &amp; Supp.1977). The Code protects the Commonwealth and the taxpaying public from misuse or lax handling of public funds. This statute directs the Treasury Department and other state agencies to disburse Commonwealth funds only after “audit and examin[ation]” to insure that expenditures are based “upon requisition pursuant to law.” Id. § 307. Accord, id. §§ 1501-02 (disbursements allowed from state treasury only upon requisition determined “lawful and correct” by Treasury Department); cf. id. § 405 (directing Auditor General to “audit and adjust” accounts of parties <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>with claims against the Commonwealth); id. § 1003 (same).

The Legislature indicated this when it included section 1108 of the Fiscal Code, 72 P.S. § 1108, providing that taxpayers may make payments to the Commonwealth before final determination of their taxes without forfeiting review by administrative and judicial tribunals. The Legislature did not, however, authorize the Commonwealth similarly to pay tax refunds before a final determination that such refund is due. In the absence of statutory authority, there is no basis for allowing the Commonwealth to make payments of tax refunds which the taxpayer is challenging on appeal. Such payments would contravene the objectives of the Fiscal Code.</p>

Section 253 authorizes the Department of Revenue to process claims for refunds. Section 233 allows assessments for the Commonwealth to recover erroneously granted refunds. Wyoming Sand asserts these sections evince a legislative intent to require payment of tentative refunds, because refunds subsequently reduced by the Board of Finance and Revenue are the type of refunds which could be collected under section 233 as erroneously paid.</p>
