It is incumbent upon all of our institutions to join in a cooperative effort to strive to achieve a more just and equitable world.</p>

On the same day as the entry of the order, petitioners presented to the trial judge a motion containing their requests. This motion was dismissed without hearing or argument. Petitioners filed with this Court a Petition for Writ of Prohibition and an Application for Stay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>

The procedural defects alone would have justified the lower court’s denial of the motion without a hearing. Further, at the time of the hearing the City contended that there would be minimal, if any, infringement upon the rights of the adjoining property owners and residents. (See the interpretation of the order as set forth in the majority opinion.) In view of these circumstances where the petitioners’ claim suffers from serious procedural defects and their legal claim is far from clear, the request for a Writ of Prohibition must be denied. Furthermore, we do not view the circumstances as requiring the continuation of a stay order.</p>
