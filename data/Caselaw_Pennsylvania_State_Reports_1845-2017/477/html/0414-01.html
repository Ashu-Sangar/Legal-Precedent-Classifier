Even assuming, however, that this issue was properly within the scope of the court’s review of whether the trial court had abused its discretion, we do not agree with its conclusion. Section 514 establishes rights in a School District employee not to be dismissed without specific cause and not to be dismissed without due notice and a statement of reasons, and it establishes corresponding duties in the School District. It also establishes a right to a hearing, but the other rights and duties are not made contingent upon the employee’s exercising his right to demand a hearing. Since the School District has consistently denied that it was Coleman’s employer, it would have been futile for Coleman to have demanded of it the right to a hearing guaranteed to School District employees by section 514. Since the School District provided her with no reasons for her dismissal, she has <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>established a clear legal right to reinstatement without the necessity of a hearing'.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
