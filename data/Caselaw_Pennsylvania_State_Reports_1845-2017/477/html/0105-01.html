The prosecution’s argument begs the question: If appellant could specifically quote or describe the alleged prejudicial portions of the closing argument, and assuming that the prosecution accepted the defense’s version, there would be no need for the missing portion of the transcript to insure meaningful appellate review. The prosecution is in effect contending that defense counsel has not presented an “equivalent picture” of the prosecution’s summation. The burden, however, is upon the prosecution, not the defendant, to make available a full record or its equivalent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, supra; Commonwealth v. Anderson. supra. </em>Neither in the trial court nor before this Court has the prosecution made any attempt to provide an equivalent picture.</p>

Rather, the untimely illness of the court reporter immediately following trial, his subsequent death, and the inability of any other reporter to read his shorthand notes combined to limit the transcription to only 309 pages of testimony from the five-day trial. The Supreme Court of the United States, faced with a similar situation arising in an Illinois trial, i. e. unavailability of the trial transcript due to the death of the court reporter, held that Due Process and Equal Protection did not require the <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>state to afford the defendant a new trial. <em>Norvell v.

That case, in my view, is controlling here. Said the Supreme Court: ‘When through no fault of the State, transcripts of criminal trials are no longer available because of the death of the court reporter some practical accommodation must be made. . . . “The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations — illogical, it may be, and unscientific. . . . What is best is not always discernible; the wisdom of any choice may be disputed or condemned.” The “rough accommodations” made by government do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment unless the lines drawn are “hostile or invidious.” ’ <a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">Id. at 424</a>; <a href="/us/373/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="373 U.S. 420" data-case-ids="11718610" data-case-paths="/us/373/0420-01">10 L.Ed.2d at 459</a>.” * * * * * *</blockquote>
