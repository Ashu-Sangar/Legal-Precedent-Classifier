    <p id="b175-13" data-blocks='[["BL_175.13",175,[231,1509,1148,363]]]'>Appellant, who was charged under a murder indictment for the August 25, 1974 slaying of Francis Coleman, was tried by a jury and found guilty of murder of the third degree. Following the lower court’s denial, <em>en banc, </em>of appellant’s motion for new trial and arrest of judgment, appellant was sentenced to not less than ten nor more than twenty years imprisonment.</p>

We have considered these arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>
