The judgment of sentence for murder was appealed directly to us, and the judgments of sentence for burglary and conspiracy were appealed to the Superior Court and transferred here.</p>

Four of these witnesses gave no testimony whatsoever which would tend to prove appellant’s, guilt. One of these witnesses was a police officer who arrived at the scene of the robbery-homicide after the participants in the crime had already left. Another of these witnesses was the victim’s father, whose testimony was limited to identifying the victim. Another prosecution witness was a doctor employed by the medical examiner’s office, who conducted the post mortem examination of the victim. This witness’s testimony established only that the victim died of gunshot wounds. A fourth witness for the prosecution was a woman who lived with the victim and was present in the victim’s home at the time the robbery-homicide took place. She was unable to identify any of the persons who were in the house, and gave no testimony implicating appellant.</p>

The case against the appellant rests solely on Hedgeman’s testimony.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[269,406,1151,89]]]'>The prosecution’s brief presented its summary of the evidence as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[307,524,1113,798]]]'>“[Defendant, accompanied by his mother, Dorothy Finley and a third party (Skeets) drove his automobile to the home of Melvin Clark, at 912 W. Silver Street and parked outside on the street. There they waited until one Garfield Hedgeman approached the victim’s home. Skeets then left the car and gained entrance to Clark’s home by following Hedgeman inside. Once inside Hedgeman attempted to buy drugs from Melvin Clark but learned that he was five dollars short. Skeets, who was not previously known to Hedgeman, then volunteered that Dorothy Finley would lend him five dollars. Skeets and Hedgeman then went to the waiting car which contained defendant, seated behind the wheel, and Dorothy Finley, his mother. Hedgeman, Skeets, and Dorothy Finley then returned to Clark’s home while defendant remained in the car.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.7",430,[305,1350,1113,966]]]'>“Immediately after entering Clark’s residence, Skeets shot Melvin Clark, and Hedgeman and Dorothy Finley chased after Clark’s girlfriend Bernadette Durant, and her infant son, preventing them from fleeing through the kitchen door. Ms. Durant then ran upstairs and was pursued by both Hedgeman and Dorothy Finley. Hedge-man attempted to tie Ms. Durant up and tried to strangle her. Ms. Durant fled to a bedroom and secured it by pushing a chest of drawers against the door. Both Hedge-man and Dorothy Finley then searched the upstairs for narcotics. They then ran out of the house, passing Skeets and hearing two more shots on their way out. Skeets then followed and they all ran to the waiting car where defendant had started the car (or ‘was getting ready to start up the car’). Dorothy Finley and Skeets got in; Hedgeman was given some narcotics but prevented from getting in; and the car sped away.” (We could find no other name in the record for “Skeets”).</blockquote>
    <p id="b431-4" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[263,281,1147,360]]]'>
      <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>If the testimony of Hedgeman and the reasonable inferences arising therefrom supported the above summary from the prosecution’s brief, we would conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution’s summary, however, contains factual conclusions which are not supported either by the evidence or by any inferences drawn from the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[257,665,1151,1112]]]'>The prosecution contends that appellant parked on the street and waited until Hedgeman approached the victim’s home, and that when Hedgeman approached, “Skeets” left the car, intending to gain entrance to the victim’s home by following Hedgeman inside. There is no evidence, however, that the car <em>waited </em>outside the victim’s home for anyone. Hedgeman testified that as he approached the victim’s home he saw a car parked nearby, from which “Skeets” exited and began walking behind Hedgeman toward the victim’s home. Hedgeman’s testimony was that although he noticed that the car across the street looked like one owned by his friend, Dot Finley, he walked on toward the victim’s home for the purpose of purchasing narcotics and paid little attention to the car until he heard a car door close, at which time he noticed “Skeets” walking behind him. There is no evidence from which an inference can be drawn that the car was <em>waiting </em>for Hedgeman. There was no evidence as to how long the car had been there. It is sheer speculation to conclude that the car had been there for any length of time. So far as the evidence is concerned, the car could have arrived immediately before Hedgeman did.</p>
    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.6",431,[254,1800,1148,511]]]'>Thus, the prosecution’s ultimate conclusion in its summary that the car was <em>waiting </em>outside the victim’s home for Hedgeman to arrive has no support in the evidence. That ultimate conclusion is obviously important to the prosecution because, had the car been waiting for any unusual period of time, it could be inferred that the occupants of the car — appellant, his mother, and “Skeets” — had a common purpose in waiting. Without the evidence that the car was waiting, the prosecution’s theory is significantly weakened at its inception.</p>
    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[257,296,1154,500]]]'>
      <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>The prosecution’s summary also draws the ultimate conclusion that “Skeets” was able to gain entrance to the victim’s home only by following Hedgeman into the home. Yet there is nothing in the evidence to indicate anything more than that appellant’s car and Hedgeman arrived on the scene at about the same time; and there is nothing to show that the fact that Hedgeman’s approach to the victim’s home occurred almost simultaneously with “Skeets’s” exit from the car and <em>his </em>approach to the victim’s home was anything more than coincidence.</p>
    <p id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[257,824,1154,1131]]]'>When the victim opened the door and admitted Hedgeman and “Skeets” the first time, there is no evidence to indicate that the victim considered “Skeets” a stranger or an intruder. According to Hedgeman, he immediately began discussing a narcotics transaction with the victim while “Skeets” was present. There is no indication that the victim hesitated or was reluctant to discuss the narcotics transaction with “Skeets” present. There is no evidence as to whether “Skeets” was known or unknown to the victim. Under these circumstances, the prosecution’s theory that appellant’s car was waiting for Hedgeman’s arrival so that “Skeets” could gain entrance to the victim’s home by following Hedgeman is sheer speculation. When the victim told Hedgeman that he was short $5.00 for the purchase and Hedgeman returned with “Skeets” to the car to borrow $5.00 from appellant’s mother, there was no evidence that any conversation occurred in the presence of the appellant except that concerning Hedgeman’s need for a loan of $5.00 to complete the narcotics purchase. When ppellant’s mother left the car and returned with Hedgeman and “Skeets” to the victim’s home, there is no evidence that appellant had any knowledge of what would later occur inside the home.</p>
    <p id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[260,1979,1150,352]]]'>The prosecution’s summary also states that after the shooting and the robbery, when the participants returned to the car, appellant was inside, and had started the car (or “was getting ready to start up the car.”) Hedgeman’s testimony, however, was not that certain. In testifying about what happened when he, “Skeets,” and appellant’s mother got to the car Hedgeman said:</p>
