The dispositive issue is whether the trial court erred in refusing defense counsel’s request to instruct the jury that where the defense of self-defense, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 505 (1973), is raised by the evidence at trial, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not committed in self-defense. In its opinion disposing of the issues raised in written post-trial motions, the lower court concluded that it did not err by refusing to so instruct the jury.

      <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>A review of the record discloses the following facts. Appellant was the manager of a bar owned by his father in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. Appellant lived in an apartment above the bar. On the evening of March 30, 1975, the victim and appellant were seated at the bar engaged in a discussion. At about 12:45 a. m. on March 31, 1975, appellant told the barmaid that he intended to retire soon for the night and asked her to serve everyone a complimentary drink for Easter.</p>
    <p id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[235,754,1151,1164]]]'>By this time, the victim, who was a long-time friend of appellant, and the appellant had become embroiled in an argument. At about 1:00 a. m., appellant got up from the bar to leave and walked toward the back of the barroom in the direction of the stairs which lead to his upstairs apartment. The victim shouted, “Nobody walks away from me when I’m talking,” and proceeded to follow appellant with his arms outstretched toward appellant. The victim had no weapons or objects in his hands. Although appellant testified that the victim grabbed him from behind around the neck and threatened to kill him, other eyewitnesses testified that they were unable to observe the victim’s hands, either because of the witnesses’ angle of observation or because the size of the victim (six feet one inch tall, weighing two hundred and ninety pounds) obscured their view of his hands. No witness other than appellant testified as to any physical contact between the victim and appellant immediately prior to the killing. Upon being accosted by the victim, appellant pulled a handgun from his right coat pocket and shot the victim twice, killing him. Appellant testified that because of robbery threats he carried the handgun at closing time.</p>

    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[232,389,1162,1364]]]'>The 1972 Crimes Code, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2501, 2502 (1973 &amp; Supp.1977-78), perpetuated the traditional distinction between murder and voluntary manslaughter. This distinction is that voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing committed without malice, whereas malice is an essential element of murder. <em>Commonwealth v. O’Searo, </em><a href="/pa/466/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="466 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1714948" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0224-01">466 Pa. 224</a>, 240, n. 6, <a href="/pa/466/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="466 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1714948" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0224-01">352 A.2d 30</a>, 38, n. 6 (1976). In a prosecution for murder, evidence of provocation or self-defense tends to negate the malice required to prove murder. <em>See Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/452/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="452 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="575106" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0316-01">452 Pa. 316</a>, 323, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="305 A.2d 354">305 A.2d 354</a>, 357 (1973). Thus, we think that <em>Cropper </em>requires a trial court to instruct the jury so as to convey the following concepts: (1) That in order to prove murder, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was malicious; (2) That evidence of self-defense, from whatever source, tends to negate the malice required for murder; (3) That in order to meet its burden of proof on the element of malice, the prosecution must exclude self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. While a trial court is free to use its own language in instructing the jury, <em>Commonwealth v. Lesher, <a href="/pa/473/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="473 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1730272" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0141-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/473/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="473 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1730272" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0141-01">473 Pa. at 147</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="473 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1730272" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0141-01">373 A.2d at 1091</a>, whatever language is used must explain accurately the above-described relationship between evidence of self-defense and the essential element of malice in a murder prosecution. In short, the jury must be fully aware that the finding of malice requires the exclusion of the defense of self-defense.</p>

The trial court reasoned that by not placing any burden on the appellant to establish any element, the court avoided any conflict with the <em>Cropper </em>decision. Similarly, the Commonwealth urges strongly that the court’s deliberate placement of the burden on the Commonwealth to prove all of the elements of the crime throughout the charge eliminates the necessity to specifically instruct the jury with reference to the burden of the respective parties as to the evidence relating to self-defense. Both the trial court and the Commonwealth in their reasoning assume that the affirmative placement of the burden of proving the material elements of the crime upon the Commonwealth necessarily conveys to the jury that this requires that the Commonwealth disprove the presence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. This assumption is unwarranted, particularly in light of the language which was used in the instant charge, wherein the trial court stated:</p>

The application of the <em>Cropper </em>decision to the instant factual situation does not raise a question of retroactivity. <em>Cropper </em>made clear that it was not announcing a rule pursuant to the court’s supervisory powers, but was rather applying a legislative mandate required by the Crimes Code of 1972. Since the instant criminal episode is governed by the 1972 statute, the burden of proof required the 1972 Crimes Code relating to self-defense is also applicable. Additionally, a majority of this Court held in <em>Commonwealth v. Lynch, <a href="/pa/477/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="477 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="1738256" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0390-01">supra,</a> </em>that the <em>Cropper </em>holding was also mandated by the federal constitution.</p>
