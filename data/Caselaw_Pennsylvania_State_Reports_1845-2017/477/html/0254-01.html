It specifically limited Annis Kershaw Sykes’s power of appointment to “blood relatives” of either testator or Annis Kershaw Sykes. It did not so limit the class to whom the corpus would pass in default of exercise of the power of appointment. Rather, it directed that the corpus would then pass to the “issue” of Annis Kershaw Sykes. This variance is subject to conflicting interpretations. On the one hand, it could be argued that the initial reference to “blood relatives” modifies the subsequent use of “issue.” Having indicated his desire to confine distribution to blood relatives, testator, under this view, saw no need to repeat his intention when specifying those to whom the estate would pass if his niece did not exercise her power of appointment.</p>
    <p id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[240,1182,1158,514]],["BL_303.1",303,[237,284,1147,198]]]'>On the other hand, it could be said that testator knew his intention well enough to specify “blood relatives” as the sole objects of the power to appoint, and therefore must have intended to remove that restriction in the succeeding clause when he failed to specify that only blood descendants would take if the power to appoint were not exercised. By this interpretation, testator may have sought to permit Annis Kershaw Sykes to dispose of the corpus to “blood relatives” of herself or of testator, or to her “issue,” including adopted children, if any, as she saw fit. Thus, in her discretion, she <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>could appoint to “blood relatives;” if she desired to ensure that her children, by blood descent or by adoption, should take upon her death, she need only decline to exercise her power of appointment.</p>

Testator devised the residue of his estate in trust to “Annis Kershaw Sykes, her heirs and assigns,” and the Girard Trust Company. This phrase, “heirs and assigns,” braces neither interpretation.

That is, they describe the nature of the estate given rather than the persons who are to take. <em>Butler Estate, </em><a href="/pa/364/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="364 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1223554" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0279-01">364 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20110" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="72 A.2d 110">72 A.2d 110</a> (1950); <em>Estate of Witte, </em><a href="/pa-super/102/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="102 Pa.

Testator apparently bore a special affection for Annis Kershaw Sykes. He named her co-executor and co-trustee, permitted her alone to draw from the corpus of the trust, entrusted her with exclusive power to appoint, and provided that the corpus, upon failure to appoint, would pass to her “issue.” To some degree, bestowal of such favor to Annis Kershaw Sykes indirectly extended to her family, implying that testator intended to confer benefits upon all her family, without regard to the blood relation of her children. It is also plausible, however, that testator did not intend to benefit persons other than Annis Kershaw Sykes.

The Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, art. V, § 502, 1 P.S. § 502 (Supp.1977), states that an adopted child “shall have all the rights of a child and heir of the adopting parent . . . .” Our case law recognized the import of this provision as early as 1905.
