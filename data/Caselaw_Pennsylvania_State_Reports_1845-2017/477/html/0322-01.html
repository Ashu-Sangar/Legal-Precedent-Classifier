This requirement excludes the possibility that parental rights will be terminated because of insufficient notice, since the parent’s inability or unwillingness to meet the child’s essential needs must be affirmatively demonstrated.

The notion that a showing of parental misconduct is necessary before parental rights may be terminated rests upon the erroneous assumption that the purpose of section 311(2) is to punish an ineffective or negligent parent. Section 311(2) reflects a deep concern for the essential needs of the child, not a legislative vengeance against parental misconduct. The official. comment to the Adoption Act of 1970 states that the provision “centers judicial inquiry upon the welfare of the child rather than the fault of the parent.” Joint State Government Commission, Official Comment, Adoption Act (1970). Thus, section 311(2) authorizes termination upon a showing of parental incapacity, when the incapacity “cannot or will not be remedied by the parent” and has “caused the child to be without essential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being.” The Legislature clearly mandated that, in such circumstances, the “physical or mental well-being” of the child must be protected.</p>

Sometimes appellant or her daughter Joan refused <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>to allow the caseworker inside and spoke to her at the door or through a window.</p>

David had run away from his foster home and juvenile probation caseworkers came to appellant’s home where David was hiding. The conditions were so deplorable that the juvenile officers requested Children’s Services to make an immediate visit. Although all of appellant’s minor children were then living elsewhere, the agency was concerned about the infant children of Joan, appellant’s daughter. Garbage and food were strewn on the floors throughout the house, including the upstairs. Dirty diapers were found on the floors, along with feces from several dogs and cats, causing a foul odor to permeate the house. Photographs confirm the testimony describing these grossly unsanitary conditions.</p>

At times, she has listened to the suggestions of caseworkers and expressed her intention to improve her housekeeping and child care skills. Similarly, the public health officer and the school counselor who worked with David testified that appellant would hear them out and promise to follow their suggestions. Invariably, however, appellant made no effort to alleviate the offensive conditions. At other times, appellant expressed hostility towards the agency and the caseworkers for interfering in her life. Nutrition aides discontinued their visits in late 1975 because appellant was never home at the agreed times.</p>

Having determined that grounds existed justifying termination of appellant’s parental rights under section 311(2) of the Adoption Act, the court concluded that Judith’s best interests would be served by terminating appellant’s parental rights so that Judith might be adopted into a responsible family, able to meet her essential needs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_29" id="ref_footnote_1_29">29</a> The decree of the orphans’ court is supported by adequate and competent evidence.</p>

We rejected the former argument in Part II B of this opinion, insofar as it relates to the requirements of the Adoption Act. Although Judith never suffered serious harm while in appellant’s custody, the record fully supports the orphans’ court’s finding that the conditions in appellant’s homes while Judith was in her <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>custody constituted a serious threat to Judith’s health and safety. We cannot agree with appellant that where, as here, a serious threat to health and safety has been shown, the court cannot terminate parental rights until serious harm actually occurs.

Mr. Justice Nix, in his dissenting opinion, departs from this standard by drawing his own inferences contrary to the findings of the orphans’ court. An appellate court is not free to draw inferences contrary to the findings of the orphans’ court supported by competent evidence.</p>

Turning to Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, we learn that “incapacity” is the state of being incapable, i. e., lacking capacity, ability or qualification for the purpose or end in view. In the instant case, the majority itself states that appellant is “minimally capable” of caring for a child.

A finding that the cause of appellant’s incapacity cannot be remedied could only be sustained by ignoring the psychologist’s testimony concerning appellant’s capacity for training and education. Nor can it be concluded that the cause of appellant’s incapacity will not be remedied. Appellant has, at considerable inconvenience, sought and received the assistance of Children’s Services and nutrition aides in order to provide adequate parental care; appellant changed her residence in order to improve her family’s living conditions; appellant maintains an adequate and healthful dwelling; and she provides for her daughter’s basic needs. The record shows that appellant was more than willing to seek the best possible environment for the rearing of her children and that she possessed sufficient capacity to perform the duties of parenthood.

The cornerstone of the parental relationship is the natural love that exists where it is properly nurtured by the parent. In the panoply of duties and responsibilities that comprise the obligations of parenthood, nothing is more important than the fostering of the love that can exist between parent and child. No experience in life is more gratifying and significant in the development of the child than to have been the recipient of parental love. The warmth and the security of that love dwarfs the incidental benefits that riches, luxury and power may provide. The societal importance of the parental relationship explains, if such explanation is needed, why the United States Supreme Court has consistently held that the right of natural parents to raise their own offspring is a fundamental interest and thus subject to the highest degree of constitutional protection. <em>Stanley v.

In concluding that the incapacity provisions of section 311(2) do not require any showing of parental fault, the majority relies upon the Joint State Government Commission, Official Comment, Adoption Act (1970). It is, of course, permissible for this Court to consult such comments in construing a statute. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1939 (Supp.1977-78). However, in construing a statute, this Court should also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation and should presume that the legislature did not intend that a statute be construed in a constitutionally questionable manner. 1 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1921(6), 1922(3) (Supp.1977-78). While the words, “incapacitated” and “cannot”, when read in conjunction in a purely literal sense, could support the construction urged by the majority, it is my view that such a construction is foreign to the American philosophy of the relationship between the State and the citizen and is totally unwarranted. The majority’s no-fault interpretation of the <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>incapacity provisions of section 311(2) permits the termination of the parental rights of parents who, without any fault, are rendered unable to care for their children. In light of this consequence and the attendant constitutional difficulties, I suggest that some degree of parental fault be a prerequisite to a termination on grounds of incapacity. The “abuse, neglect, or refusal” language of section 311(2) shows that parental misconduct was a primary concern of the legislature. Furthermore, in providing for termination when an incapacity “will not be remedied by the parent”, the legislature clearly intended that the willful refusal of parents to take steps to remedy their own incapacity would constitute grounds for termination. Thus, the element of fault, or parental misconduct, permeates section 311(2). Since the state has a much stronger interest in protecting minor children from willful or even negligent parental misconduct, the statutory interpretation I proffer is essential if section 311(2) is expected to withstand an equal protection attack.</p>

There was no finding by the lower court that appellant was mentally unstable, and the delusion of pregnancy suffered by appellant nearly 15 years ago, and referred to by the majority, could hardly constitute substantial evidence of a present instability. See <em>Adoption of Farabelli, </em><a href="/pa/460/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="245" data-cite="460 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="482875" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0423-01">460 Pa. 423</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="246" data-cite="333 A.2d 846" data-case-ids="482825,482875,482907" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0422-01,/pa/460/0423-01,/pa/460/0421-01">333 A.2d 846</a> (1975). In straining to find support for the theory that appellant “suffered from some mental instability”, the majority takes facially neutral evidence and wrenches factual inferences that are unwarranted and unfavorable to appellant. In describing appellant’s failure to locate a certain boyfriend, the majority states that the boyfriend did not exist. Although these were the words used by appellee’s witness to describe the witness’ unsuccessful attempt to locate the boyfriend, the context of the comment shows that the witness merely meant that she could not establish the identity of the boyfriend, not that the boyfriend was a figment of appellant’s imagination.</p>

Although appellant later adopted this account and it was not rebutted, the majority transforms this testimony into evidence of appellant’s delusions by stating that “the circumstances surrounding appellant’s relation of this story rendered it incredible.” If such stories were incredible merely because they were bizarre, this Court could quickly dispose of numerous homicide appeals by discharging defendants who committed “incredible” murders.</p>

Financially secure parents suffering from the same mental or intellectual deficiencies as appellant Marjorie L. conceivably could hire nurses or seek the services of a private agency to aid in their childrearing. Thus, wealthy parents of families may avoid even the possibility of losing their parental rights. On the other hand, indigent parents similarly afflicted must seek aid from public agencies in order to provide for their children. It is indeed ironic that in seeking the only assistance available to them indigent involuntarily incapacitated parents expose themselves to the threat of losing the very reason for the quest for help — their children. Such de facto discrimination on the basis of wealth should be considered by this Court when construing and applying the words of a statute. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(6) (Supp.1977-78).

The majority holds that the state may constitutionally terminate the parental rights of a parent if that parent, without fault, is incapacitated, and the incapacity prevents the parent from taking care of that parent’s children. The state does not have such a dangerous and far-reaching right over its citizens. Suppose a parent is incapacitated, without fault, as the result of an automobile accident, or a heart attack, or an injury received during a war? Under the majority’s holding, if such a parent cannot take care of his or her children, the state may terminate parental rights. To state the issue is to answer it.
