The supplement proposed changes in all metered rates sufficient to produce an increase in annual revenues of $415,477.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">1</a> Pursuant to an investigation of the reasonableness of these rates, the PUC issued an order postponing the effective date of the increase until August 22, 1973; thereafter the new rates were deemed temporary pending a final PUC adjudication. Based upon hearings and the submission of appropriate data, the Commission entered a detailed final order on April 17, 1974. Of Keystone’s $423,356 requested increase in revenues (as revised), $365,450 or 86 per cent was permitted. This decrease of $57,906 is principally explained by the fact that the PUC excluded from the computation of the rate base the value of Keystone’s White Deer Creek filtration plant; the Commission also eliminated from allowable operating ex<a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>penses the annual depreciation chargeable to the plant.

The area of the watershed above Keystone’s intake point is approximately 37 square miles. The watershed was almost entirely forest land and Keystone owned about 1,300 acres in fee. Approximately 10 per cent of the watershed is owned by the Commonwealth and is maintained as state forest land. For the remaining 90 per cent, Keystone holds deeds granting water rights dating back to about 1902, wherein it is stated that Keystone has the complete control and use of all the waters and the right to enter upon the land at all times for the purpose of maintaining its supply of water. This water was so pure that it required no treatment other than the minimal chlorination required by the Department of Health for all public water companies. In 1959 Keystone became aware that the Commonwealth proposed to construct Interstate Highway 1-80 through the valley of the White Deer Creek. Keystone advised the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) of the danger to its water supply but was unsuccessful in attempting to have 1-80 rerouted so as not to touch the watershed. As a result of long, involved negotiations with PennDOT concerning Keystone’s condemnation rights, an understanding was reached and reduced to a written agreement dated July 18, 1966.” 19 Pa.Cmwlth. 292, 295-96, <a href="/citations/?q=339%20A.2d%20873" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="339 A.2d 873">339 A.2d 873</a>, 874 (1975) (footnote omitted.)</blockquote>

It is argued that to permit Keystone to obtain a return on the filter plant is to confer a windfall on the utility to the detriment of the rate paying public. We cannot agree with this assertion. The PUC’s equity argument seems to reflect concern with the disparity between the carrying value of the land and water rights taken or destroyed by the condemnation, and the amount agreed upon in settlement, coupled with the fact that this amount bears a close correlation to the cost of the new plant. But the matter must be seen in context. The fact is that the water rights taken, whatever their cost of acquisition many years ago, were of unique value to Keystone, and only to Keystone. The current value of these property rights was not ascertainable by conventional methods because there was obviously no market for them at the time of condemnation. Keystone was sufficiently farsighted at the turn of the century to procure easements which were extensive enough to assure a plentiful source of pure water, a supply kept untouched by polluting influences with which our land and streams are today afflicted. It should not be penalized because of the fact that the only standard of compensation for the loss of such an asset is the amount necessary to be spent in order to accomplish by artificial means what formerly was accomplished by natural means. <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>That this amount is substantially greater than the original investment of Keystone in its property rights is an irrelevancy, and in no wise converts the settlement with Penn-DOT from damages for a taking into a voluntary contribution. Without the construction of the new plant the customers of Keystone would have been without drinking water (a circumstance caused by PennDOT, not Keystone); thus they have been benefited by that construction. It does not seem unjust that the rates charged to consumers should be increased to reflect the costs of obtaining purity by artificial rather than natural means. Conversely, for Keystone and that portion of the public who are its shareholders to be left with an asset on which no return and no depreciation are to be allowed for purposes of rate-making would mean that it has virtually nothing to show for the taking of its valuable rights to a protected watershed. That result would indeed seem unjust.</p>

In the first place, Section 301 of the Public Utility Law, <em>supra, </em>66 P.S. § 1141, sets forth the fundamental criterion that “[e]very rate made, demanded, or received by any public utility . shall be just and reasonable.” Our courts have consistently held that the process of implementing this standard and determining allowable revenues upon which customer rates are founded is one of calculating the fair value of a utility’s property used and useful in public service (termed the “rate base”) and multiplying that amount by a percentage figure called “rate of return” (most frequently determined by reference to the company’s cost of capital).

Apparently, the customers of White Deer quite properly were recognized by the parties to the agreement as being in the nature of a third party beneficiaries whose interest in public utility water service had been injured; and accordingly, it was agreed by the parties that to heal the injury to the interests of the customers and restore the former usefulness of the land, i. e., to restore the precondemnation status quo as nearly as possible, the filtration plant must be provided for the customers. To reflect equitably and meaningfully this near restoration of, or equitable substitution for, the precondemnation status quo, both the utility and its customers must be made whole insofar as reasonably possible. This we have done. As a result of our treatment of the condemnation proceedings, the customers’ rates remain unchanged by the condemnation and respondent’s financial stability and ability to serve remain unchanged.”</blockquote>

It is impossible to find an exchange value for a utility, since utilities, unlike merchandise or land, are not commonly bought and sold in the market. Nor can the present value of the utility be determined by capitalizing its net earnings, since net earnings are determined, in large measure, by the rate which the company will be <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>permitted to charge, and thus the vicious circle would be encountered. So, under the rule of <em>Smyth v. Ames, </em>it is usually sought to prove the present value of a utility by ascertaining what it actually cost to construct and install it, or by estimating what it should have cost, or by estimating what it would cost to reproduce or replace it. To this end an enumeration is made of the component elements of the utility, tangible and intangible; then the actual, or proper, cost of producing, or of reproducing, each part is sought; and finally it is estimated how much less than the new each part, or the whole, is worth. That is, the depreciation is estimated. Obviously each step in the process of estimating the cost of reproduction, or replacement, involves forming an opinion, or exercising judgment, as distinguished from merely ascertaining facts. And this is true, also, of each step in the process of estimating how much less the existing plant is worth than if it were new. There is another potent reason why, under the rule of <em>Smyth v. Ames, </em>the room for difference in opinion as to the present value of a utility is so wide. The rule does not measure the present value either by what the utility cost to produce, or by what it should have cost, or by what it would cost to reproduce, or to replace it.

The water filtration plant is the tangible asset needed to preserve, the quality of the water from White Deer Creek. The plant replaced Keystone Water’s asset of nearly perfect water, which had appreciated over the years Keystone Water had been in business.

A court can more easily determine whether a regulatory body has acted within its statutory and constitutional authority than whether a rate is fair as a matter of initial rate-making law.

Utility customers should not be subjected to such unjustified hardship. See <em>Duquesne Light Co. v.

Before the Commonwealth’s condemnation, Keystone Water would have been entitled to a fair return on the cost of reproducing its original investment in the White Deer Creek watershed. This cost would include replacement of a source of water so pure that only chlorination would be required before delivery to Keystone Water’s distribution system. To reproduce such a resource, Keystone Water would need a source of water, a filtration plant to bring that water up to comparable standards, and money to operate the plant.

Scranton Steam Heat Co., supra, </em><a href="/pa/405/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="405 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1303561" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0397-01">405 Pa. at 401</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%2086" class="citation" data-index="143" data-cite="176 A.2d 86">176 A.2d 86</a>. We think the other opinion misperceives the issue. The issue is the continued vitality of the rate base/rate of return adjudicatory formula as the approach to ascertaining just and reasonable rates for public utilities to charge. That formula requires the inclusion of the utility’s properties in rate basis at a proper value. In Pennsylvania that value has been denominated in a short-cut fashion as “fair value”. See <em>Scranton, supra. </em>But in the case at bar the Public Utility Commission totally ignored the utility’s filtration plant in its determination of rate base, giving it a zero valuation. In attempted justification, it argues that the traditional formula heretofore used in utility rate making in Pennsylvania is no longer viable, but must give way to some other approach to just and reasonable rates. That is the issue presented in the case, directed solely to what rate will allow the utility to operate successfully.</p>

The Opinion of Mr. Justice Pomeroy errs in asserting that the continuing validity of the “fair value” concept is not before us. See p. 610 at n.15. Only if Keystone Water can charge customers rates based on the cost reproducing original investments can it justify including in its rate base the plant which represents the cost of reproducing its original investment in the White Deer Creek watershed. Keystone Water never paid for the water filtration plant. Because the plant was constructed with public funds, Keystone Water cannot justify including the plant in its rate base on the ground that the plant represents its own capital expenditure.</p>
