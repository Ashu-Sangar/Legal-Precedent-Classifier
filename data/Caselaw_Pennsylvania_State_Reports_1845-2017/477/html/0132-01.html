He then drove to his own trailer home, located about a quarter of a mile south of the Boyer residence. Within an hour appellant, accompanied by his three year old daughter, Tina, returned to the Boyer home. He awakened the Boyers by calling “Ivan, Ruby’s been shot.” The Boyers, Pronkoskie and his daughter returned to the Pronkoskie trailer where the body of Ruby Pronkoskie was found. She had been shot in the upper torso, and the wound caused thereby was, according to the Commonwealth’s pathologist, the cause of death, which he placed at about midnight. Several other bullets had been shot in the home. The police were summoned.</p>

While alone with Mrs. Klinger, Tina said to her: “Daddy had a gun. The gun is on the shelf in my bedroom,” and “We were going to go to Mammy’s [her grandmother, Mrs. Boyer’s residence]. Mommy told me to get under the bed but I stayed on top.” Later the same night Tina was alone with her eight-year-old cousin, Angela Boyer. During this period Tina stated to Angela: “Daddy didn’t love us anymore”; “Daddy had a gun in his hand”; and, “Daddy shot mommy.” These declarations were relayed to the police, who in due course charged appellant with the murder of his wife.</p>

In light of this disposition of the case, we do not reach the other grounds advanced in support of the motion for a new trial. These are that reversible error was committed when the trial court: (1) admitted prejudicial testimony regarding the location of the murder weapon; (2) unduly restricted cross-examination of certain Commonwealth witnesses; (3) refused to allow the defense to reopen its case for further testimony; (4) permitted the members of the jury to examine certain allegedly prejudicial photographs previously admitted into evidence; and (5) inaccurately charged the jury concerning intoxication as a defense, the elements of voluntary manslaughter and the definition of “premeditation.” The appellant also asserts that there was insufficient evidence upon which a jury could return a verdict of guilty. This last claim we have reviewed in light of the record and find it to be without merit. See Act of February 15, 1870, P.L. 15, § 2, 19 P.S. § 1187 (1964).</p>

Appellant argues that even if Tina’s statements would normally be admissible under some evidentiary rule, the finding that Tina herself is incompetent to testify renders all of her declarations inherently unreliable. In light of our finding that her declarations do not qualify as excited utterances (see <em>infra </em>) and are therefore inadmissible, we need not decide this question. We deem it appropriate to observe, however, that a finding of incompetency to testify does not necessarily undermine the indicia of reliability attendant upon an excited utterance of the incompetent witness. The relevant inquiries in a voir dire proceeding to determine a particular witness’ competency to testify involve: (1) the capacity to perceive an event with accuracy; (2) the ability to remember; (3) the ability to understand questions and communicate a response; and (4) a consciousness of the duty to tell the truth. See <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, </em><a href="/pa/466/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="466 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1715019" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0479-01">466 Pa. 479</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="466 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1715019" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0479-01">353 A.2d 454</a> (1976). The inherent reliability of an excited utterance, on the other hand, arises from the spontaneity of the response and will normally remain undiluted by faulty memory, inability to understand questions or otherwise to communicate on the witness stand. See, e. <em>g. Commonwealth v. Banks, </em><a href="/pa/454/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="454 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="579894" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0401-01">454 Pa. 401</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20576" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="311 A.2d 576">311 A.2d 576</a> (1973); <em>Commonwealth v.
