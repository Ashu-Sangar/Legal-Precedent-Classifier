Rosmon, Jr., tendered a plea of guilty to murder of the third degree and, following an extensive colloquy, the plea was accepted by the trial judge. In accordance with a plea bargain between appellant and the District Attorney, a sentence of imprisonment of eight to twenty years was recommended and was imposed by the court. On July 27, 1976, Rosmon petitioned the trial court for permission to withdraw his plea of guilty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court en banc denied the petition and this appeal followed. We affirm the order of the trial court.</p>

      <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>The record discloses that appellant entered a tavern in Washington County and, accompanied by a young woman, proceeded to a pool table in the rear of the bar. There they encountered Richard and Nancy Coen. The two couples played pool until a heated argument broke out between the two men. Testimony at the coroner’s hearing conflicted as to whether or not Coen at any time struck Rosmon, but it is agreed that Coen was unarmed. When the Coens attempted to leave the tavern, Rosmon produced a .22 caliber pistol from his coat pocket and, stationing himself between the Coens and the exit, threatened to shoot Richard Coen. The police were called, and entered the premises as Rosmon was backing toward the door, his gun aimed at Coen. The presence of the police went unheeded, whereupon one of the officers attempted to prevent Rosmon from firing. Rosmon nevertheless pulled the trigger, killing a bystander. Rosmon was heard to exclaim, “I shot the wrong man.”</p>

      <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>Appellant’s position is that a guilty plea cannot be said to be knowing and intelligent where at the time it is tendered the defendant maintains his innocence. While this Court has not had occasion to declare this proposition to be the law in Pennsylvania, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em><a href="/pa/445/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="445 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1940100" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0558-01">445 Pa. 558</a>, 566, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20480" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="285 A.2d 480">285 A.2d 480</a>, 485, (1971) (concurring opinion of ROBERTS, J., joined by O’BRIEN, J.), we nevertheless believe it inapplicable to the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[244,753,1157,1407]]]'>The rationale of the rule which appellant urges is the obvious incompatability of a claim of innocence with an admission of guilt; the conflict between the two states of mind, it is said, negates a conclusion that the plea is knowingly and intelligently entered. See <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/452/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="452 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="575106" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0316-01">452 Pa. 316</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="305 A.2d 354">305 A.2d 354</a> (1973); <em>Commonwealth v. Sampson, supra </em>(concurring opinion). We see no such conflict in the instant case. A reading of the colloquy as a whole shows clearly that appellant felt justified in resorting to deadly force even though his adversary was unarmed, despite a readily available avenue of retreat, and notwithstanding the fact that police had arrived on the scene and were attempting to resolve the situation. Rosmon was, however, correctly advised by his counsel that the law of self-defense would negate the conclusion that his acts were legally justified. Accordingly, we interpret the remarks of Mr. Rosmon as indicating that although he personally believed he acted correctly in response to the situation, he quite understood that he was <em>legally </em>wrong. Thus, he was not in fact asserting his innocence of the charges;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> rather, he was abandoning a would-be defense based on what he thought the law should be because it did not correspond with the law as it is, and which the jury was bound to apply. A similar situation was before us in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/452/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="452 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="575106" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0316-01">452 Pa. 316</a>, 321, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="305 A.2d 354">305 A.2d 354</a>, 356-57 (1973).
