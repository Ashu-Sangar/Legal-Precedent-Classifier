The evidence establishes that in the early morning of September 2, 1973, appellant, who was then seventeen, and David Milburn, another juvenile, observed the victim, Ola Danenberg, walking along the street. During their investigation, the police learned that the victim had been at a club, had had several drinks, and was staggering somewhat. She was carrying a purse containing several hundred dollars. Appellant and Milburn decided to snatch the victim’s purse. They waited for her to walk past an alley and then ran toward her from behind. Appellant grabbed the purse as they ran by the victim. The victim spun around, fell and struck her head on the sidewalk, which <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>caused fatal injuries. We must determine whether appellant’s action constituted robbery, which in turn will determine whether his felony-murder conviction can be sustained.</p>
