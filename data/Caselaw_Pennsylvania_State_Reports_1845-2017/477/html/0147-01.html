Such a witness, out of a reasonable expectation of leniency, has an interest in inculpating others. This basis is inapplicable, however, when the accomplice testifies on behalf of the defense. One implicated in a crime cannot reasonably expect such leniency by exonerating others, particularly where, as here, the witness has already been sentenced for committing the crime. Thus, it is unreasonable to infer, and improper for the court to charge, that because this defense witness stood convicted of the crime in question, his testimony must be viewed “with disfavor” and accepted only with “caution and care.”</p>

There is no doubt that when the prosecution calls as an inculpatory witness a person who is known to be or who may be found to be an accomplice with the defendant in the crime which is the subject of the trial, a so-called “accomplice charge” is proper. In the less usual situation where an accomplice is called by the defendant as an exculpatory witness, the Court now holds, as I read its opinion, not only that the normal accomplice charge is improper, but that no accomplice charge is proper. It is with this latter part of the Court’s ruling that I disagree.</p>
    <p id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[217,897,1162,999]]]'>The normal accomplice charge contains admonition to the effect that persons caught in the commission of a crime may falsely blame others because of some corrupt or wicked motive, or in the hope of obtaining leniency through inculpating others. The jury is usually told that the testimony of such a person, standing alone, is enough to convict only if the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the witness testified truthfully. Such a charge was given in the instant case with reference to a Commonwealth witness, one Grissell. I agree with the Court that it would be wrong for a trial judge to charge relative to a defense accomplice witness that only if the jury believed beyond a reasonable doubt that the witness was telling the truth could they accept his testimony. So to charge would distort the well established principles of burden of proof. <em>Commonwealth v. Griffin, <a href="/pa-super/216/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="216 Pa.

While the hope of favorable treatment by the prosecution would not be the motive for the testimony of a defense witness, other motives might well come into play. The favorable testimony of a witness like Adolf Schwartz, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on the offense for which the appellant <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>was on trial, might have been motivated by feelings of friendship, loyalty or even fear of future revenge by appellant or his friends should he, Schwartz, refuse to testify; such a person, moreover, would have nothing to lose by lying for a colleague, having already been convicted and sentenced himself. Hence, like the prosecution’s evidence from an accomplice source, such testimony by a defense witness is also susceptible to the possibility of perjury. Thus I agree with the view held in a number of other jurisdictions that “whether an accomplice testifies for the defendant or for the State his credibility may be suspect, and the trial judge should have judicial discretion to decide whether to advise the jury to accept the accomplice’s testimony with caution.” <em>People v.

While there is language in the charge which can be so construed, I am satisfied that there was a sufficient break between the two passages in the charge so that the jury was not misled into thinking that their approach to the two witnesses should be identical. The four points in the cautionary charge given to the jury as to Schwartz were also included in the longer instruction as to Grissell, and that is no doubt why the trial judge assimilated the one to the other. But his charge as to Schwartz did not contain the “beyond a reasonable doubt” caution, as did the charge on Grissell, nor did it say, as does the longer charge, that a person caught in committing a crime may falsely blame others because of some corrupt and wicked motive.</p>
