He found that subsequent to Aiken’s acquisition of National, Wilson engaged in the following activities: (1) made outright gifts of $60,000 to two of his former employees with full knowledge that this money would be used by them as initial capital for a company known as Compacting Tools, Inc. (Compacting), a company which the donees were then forming and which was organized to engage in direct competition with National; (2) rented to the same two former employees (the now owners and managers of Compacting) the building in which Compacting carried on its activities; (3) waived rent on the premises leased to Compacting for the first seven months of the lease because of the tight money situation at Compacting; (4) made two automobiles available to the former employees, both of whom used those vehicles in connection with the new business; (5) donated furniture and office equipment for use in the offices of Compacting; and (6) executed a waiver of his security interest (a landlord’s lien) in Compacting’s machinery located on the premises, thus enabling Compacting to negotiate a loan of $160,000 which it required to purchase necessary equipment. These findings properly led to the chancellor’s conclusion that Wilson had <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>engaged in activities in connection with the “ownership, management, operation or control” of a competitor in direct violation of the express language of the contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

During this same period, Compacting had sales of $694,000, some 95% of which was attributable to the business of these same 25 customers who correspondingly decreased their orders to National.

The chancellor reduced the lost sales total to $400,-000 to take into account factors in the record which he found to be not directly attributable to the competition of Compacting (market recession, a strike in the automobile industry, etc.). He also found that 33<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>/a% was a more realistic “marginal income percentage” than 44%.

The ordinary meaning of “ment” as defined in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary is the act of “direct[ing] or carrypng] on business or affairs.” Similarly, “operation” is defined as the “doing or performing of a practical work or of something involving practical <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>application of principles or processes.” The word “control” is defined as exercising a “restraining or directing influence over and to have power over.” “Ownership” means having a “lawful claim or title.”</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[244,529,1159,1075]]]'>Viewing Wilson’s activities allegedly connected with Compacting Tooling, it appears that he gave money to two of Compacting’s founders, Délo and Zebrovious. Wilson received no stock or securities in Compacting nor a position on the board of directors, nor office in the company in return for the money. He gained no right to participate in the business affairs of the company. Clearly, the gift of money from Wilson to Délo and Zebrovious, honoring a previous employment commitment, does not qualify as being “connected with ownership, management, operation or control” of Compacting. Likewise, Wilson’s leasing of rental property to Compacting, deferring the rent payment, and waiving the lessor’s lien can only be characterized as activity pursuant to Wilson’s real estate business, which Aiken expressly permitted Wilson to continue. Again, this activity gave Wilson no ownership interest in Compacting, nor any right to participate in the business of Compacting, nor a position of control. Finally, the covenant not to compete must be stretched to a ridiculous extent in order to find that Wilson’s loan of office furniture and automobiles for several weeks constituted or contributed to a breach.</p>

For example, the seller may be contractually prevented from competing by using the goodwill, reputation, or name of the business that has been sold if those items form a part of the consideration for the transaction. A covenant by which the seller is forbidden from transferring, by gift or loan, money <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>or other property to anyone who might compete with the buyer is an illegal restraint of trade. Thus, if the covenant in this case specifically prohibited the seller from giving money to anyone he knew would use that money to finance a competitor of the buyer, it would be illegal.

The term is used loosely to describe an accounting procedure whereby profit may be determined by calculating pre-tax income generated by increased sales within a certain dollar range of sales. The profit is calculated by taking total sales (number of units X sales price per unit) and subtracting variable costs (costs which increase as production increases, such as cost of materials, direct labor, etc.) to arrive at “marginal income.” From marginal income is subtracted fixed costs (costs remaining static regardless of volume of production, e. g., rent, fixed sales costs, etc.) to arrive at a profit figure for a particular volume of sales.
