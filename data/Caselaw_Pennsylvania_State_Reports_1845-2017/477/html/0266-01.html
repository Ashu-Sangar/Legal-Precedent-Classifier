After filing the amended petition but before entry of the PCHA court’s order, appellant also asserted that his appellate rights were denied, see <em>Douglas v.

      <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>Nonetheless, appellant’s claim is without merit. Appellant sought to prove self-defense.

In <em>Mabie, </em>where counsel before negotiating a plea of guilty for his client did not investigate prospective witnesses or examine certain potentially favorable records, we found that counsel was ineffective and invalidated the plea. By contrast, appellant’s decision here was not the result of counsel’s failure to explore his client’s case; rather, appellant undoubtedly realized that his chances of acquittal were slight. The Commonwealth had presented a strong case against appellant during several days of trial, including testimony of an eyewitness and a statement of appellant to police, and the testimony of the additional witnesses the Commonwealth planned to call was likely to be unfavorable. Moreover, appellant has not alleged that these Commonwealth witnesses, if interviewed, would have supplied information so favorable that he would not have pleaded guilty despite the persuasive case against him. In these circumstances, we cannot say that appellant’s plea of guilty was induced by counsel’s decision not to interview the two Commonwealth witnesses.</p>

Rather, the court was relying on <em>Stokes. </em>In <em>Stokes, </em>we said that “the denial of right to appellate review, even if true, would not be prejudicial. . . . ” because the issue of the validity of the plea was cognizable in a collateral proceeding. Under <em>Stokes, </em>therefore, the post-conviction court did not need to determine whether there had been a denial of <em>Douglas </em>rights.
