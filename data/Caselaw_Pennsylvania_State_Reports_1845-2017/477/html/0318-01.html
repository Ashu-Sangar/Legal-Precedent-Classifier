Troback, a resident of the County of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania, was convicted by a jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of interstate transportation of stolen securities in violation of Title 18, United States Code Sections 2314 and 2, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202314" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 U.S.C. §§ 2314">18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2314</a> and 2. On January 27, 1976, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment to begin on February 9, and to “become eligible for parole under <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204208" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 4208">18 U.S.C.A. § 4208</a>(a)[l](i) upon serving one year.”</p>
    <p id="b363-6" data-blocks='[["BL_363.7",363,[249,921,1146,476]]]'>On August 22, 1977, pursuant to a petition filed by Troback under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the sentence imposed on January 27, 1976, was “amended” by the trial jurist so as to place Troback on probation for a period of four years from November 29, 1976, with the proviso that Troback “shall not apply for reinstatement to practice law before the Bar of Pennsylvania or apply to the Bar of any other state for leave to practice law during the probationary period.”</p>

On March 15, 1977, a hearing ensued before a hearing committee at which Troback represented himself. On May 31, the hearing committee filed its report with the Board recommending disbarment. After reviewing the record, the Board filed its report in this Court on August <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>19, also recommending disbarment. We immediately notified Troback of the Board’s recommendation and offered him an opportunity to appear before the Court to present argument why the recommendation should not be accepted. Troback requested such an opportunity and on November 15, he appeared before the Court, presented oral argument, and filed a written brief.</p>

Troback, an attorney then practicing law in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, pledged bearer bonds with a face value of $50,000.00 as collateral for a loan with a New York bank because he was personally acquainted with the chief operating officer at the bank and because the interest rates were favorable. Subsequently, when an equally favorable interest rate was obtainable in Lancaster County, he refinanced his loan through a local bank and transferred the securities to that bank as collateral for the loan. In 1974, the bonds were sold at Mr. Troback’s request. At that time it was discovered that the bonds had been reported missing from a bank in Paramus, New Jersey, while Mr. Troback was employed by that bank. At the time of the bonds’ disappear<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>anee from the bank, they were included in the “Glass (Trust) Account” and Troback was an officer in the Trust Department.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[244,435,1148,1280]]]'>During the trial in the Federal District Court and in these disciplinary proceedings, Troback has steadfastly denied the commission of any crime and has testified that the bonds involved were acquired from the estate of his wife’s deceased mother, who died intestate in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, in 1971 leaving Troback’s wife as sole heir. He said the bonds were found in the mother-in-law’s sewing cabinet in her apartment, although other securities owned by the decedent were found in a bank’s safe deposit box. However, no evidence has- ever been produced to show how the mother-in-law acquired the bonds, although Troback suggested to the Disciplinary Board’s hearing committee that he knows the history of these securities. Likewise, no evidence has ever been produced to show any direct connection between the mother-in-law and the Paramus bank. Finally, in July 1969, when interviewed by one agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was investigating the disappearance of the bonds from the bank, Troback stated he knew nothing concerning the bonds. In 1974, in an interview with a second agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Troback said the bonds had been removed from the bank by “another person,” but refused to disclose this person’s identity because he did not want to get this other person involved.</p>
