The victim’s nude body was discovered in a vacant house on East Boston Street on October 15, 1966. Police suspected that the victim may also have been sexually assaulted. During their investigation, the police found out that the victim had been seen alive on Thursday evening, October 13, with appellant and four other people. After interviewing some of these witnesses, police discovered that the victim was last seen drinking wine with appellant and Thomas Burns, walking in the direction of East Boston Street.

In a statement given between 11:20 p. m. and midnight, Bums told police he had left appellant and the victim alone in the house where the victim’s body was discovered. Detective Melley, however, was not informed of Burns’ statement before picking up appellant. After going to the home of appellant’s parents, Melley learned that appellant was visiting friends in Aston, Pennsylvania, approximately one hour from Philadelphia. Melley and two other officers drove to Aston, where they met the Aston Township police chief, who went with the Philadelphia officers to the house where appellant was visiting. The officers arrived shortly before midnight. Appellant was asked to return to Philadelphia to discuss his drinking with Ms. Shenk. Appellant was neither informed of his constitutional rights nor told that police wanted to question him about a homicide. Appellant was not told that he was under arrest. He arrived at the Police Administration Building at approximately 1:00 a. m. on October 16. After .being placed in an interrogation room and advised of his constitutional rights, appellant gave an inculpatory statement within fifteen minutes of the commencement of questioning.</p>

It is not equivalent to the ‘proof beyond a reasonable doubt’ standard applied at trial. . . .

The trio was last seen drinking wine walking towards East Boston Street. The victim’s body was discovered in a vacant house on East Boston Street with alcohol in her blood. The police further suspected that the victim had been sexually assaulted. As probable cause requires only probabilities and not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, we believe Detective Melley could have effectuated a valid warrantless arrest in Aston.

The majority first states it need not decide whether appellant was arrested (footnote 1, ante), but then goes on to conclude that appellant’s arrest was legal. I can only assume from the majority’s conclusion that “we find a legal arrest” that the majority did, in fact, decide appellant was arrested when police officers picked him up at his friend’s house in Aston, Pennsylvania. I agree appellant was arrested, but I emphatically disagree with the majority’s conclusion that appellant’s arrest was legal because “Detective Melly could have effectuated a valid warrantless arrest” of appellant at that time. That statement by the majority plainly ignores a well-established principle of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence: that warrantless arrests are constitutional only in very limited circumstances. <em>Carroll v.

    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.7",327,[225,1509,1152,521]]]'>The majority concludes Detective Melley had probable cause to arrest appellant. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the majority is correct, the fact that police officers have cause to arrest does not relieve the officers of the necessity to obtain an arrest warrant where practicable; the United States Supreme Court has flatly rejected the argument that “the existence of probable cause renders noncompliance with the warrant procedure an irrelevance.” <em>Coolidge v.

No exigent circumstances appear in the record, and it is clear none existed. The police had ample time to obtain an arrest warrant, the <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>police knew where appellant was, and there was no indication appellant was attempting to flee authorities or otherwise prevent his apprehension. Indeed, other detectives had time to obtain a search warrant for appellant’s residence, yet the majority does not explain why there was not equal time to obtain an arrest warrant to seize appellant. The fact is, if this arrest was not unconstitutional because effectuated without an arrest warrant, this Court has written the arrest warrant requirement completely out of the Fourth Amendment, for this arrest is precisely the kind of arrest in which it was intended that a warrant be obtained. If police officers in this Commonwealth have an untrammelled right to arrest without a warrant, why ever bother to get a warrant?</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[233,1044,1161,572]]]'>It should have been a neutral, detached magistrate, not a police officer, who made the decision that appellant should be seized in connection with this crime. <em>See Beck v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/379/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="379 U.S. 89" data-case-ids="11728831" data-case-paths="/us/379/0089-01">379 U.S. 89</a>, 96, <a href="/us/379/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="379 U.S. 89" data-case-ids="11728831" data-case-paths="/us/379/0089-01">85 S.Ct. 223</a>, 228, <a href="/us/379/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="379 U.S. 89" data-case-ids="11728831" data-case-paths="/us/379/0089-01">13 L.Ed.2d 142</a>, 147 (1964). The Fourth Amendment arrest warrant requirement was intended to insure that citizens enjoy this important safeguard against arbitrary government seizures, and by today’s decision this Court seems willing to abandon that safeguard and allow police officers unfettered discretion as to whom they will arrest and how much information they need to justify an arrest.</p>
