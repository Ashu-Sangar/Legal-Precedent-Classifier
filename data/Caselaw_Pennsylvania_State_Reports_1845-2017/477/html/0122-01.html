On April 18, 1974, the defendant appeared before Judge Thomas N. Shiomos. The defendant knowingly and intelligently waived the preliminary hearing, presentment to the Grand Jury and indictment, and entered a plea of guilty on the Municipal Court transcript to the charge of Attempted Rape. In return for the guilty plea, the Commonwealth moved to nolle prosse the remaining charges. Thereupon, Judge Shiomos, sitting as a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, accepted the guilty plea and sentenced the defendant to five years probation.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[264,990,1159,837]]]'>On April 22, 1974, appellant was rearrested for the same charges. On April 29, 1974 he moved to dismiss the complaints and quash the warrant for rearrest. Relief was denied. On June 10, 1974 appellant was indicted, and on September 23, 1974, appellant moved to dismiss the indictments. One of the grounds alleged in support of this motion to dismiss, was a claim that appellant’s constitutional rights against double jeopardy were being violated. Relief was again denied. The trial court, however, certified the matter to the Superior Court for immediate review because in its opinion there was involved a controlling question of law to which there was substantial ground for difference of opinion. Act of July 31,1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, Art. V, § 501, 17 P.S. § 211.501. The Superior Court affirmed. We granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal, and this appeal followed.</p>

The trial court was therefore not divested of subject matter jurisdiction by any lack of notice to the defendant of the crimes of which he stood accused.</p>

That phase of the prosecution was therefore over. Both the defense and the prosecution agreed at that time that the trial judge should proceed to conduct a hearing for the purposes of accepting appellant’s guilty plea. The trial judge was a judge of the Court of Common Pleas which has subject matter jurisdiction over the crimes involved. Under these circumstances it cannot be said that a preliminary hearing was taking place, and that the trial judge was sitting as a committing magistrate rather than, by consent of all parties, as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
