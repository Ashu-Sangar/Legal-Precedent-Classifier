    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[244,603,1155,401]]]'>Our examination of the trial record supports appellant’s position that during the trial the trial judge, although aware of our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Bighum, </em>did not fully comprehend its import and did not base his ruling on the individualized considerations set forth in <em>Bighum. </em>When defense counsel first objected to the prosecution’s proposed introduction of appellant’s two prior convictions, the trial court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[281,1029,1115,523]]]'>“First of all, the Court is of the understanding that the propriety of utilizing records of prior convictions of either felony or misdemeanor or criminality is still the law of Pennsylvania, with certain restrictions, to witness [sic] the propinquity of time. 1973 upon its face does not strike the Court as being inside that prohibition. So if the law is still extant, as I believe it to be, that such convictions are admissible to attack the credibility, which is what they are being used for, of the witness, the Court will be obliged to overrule your objection.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b222-7" data-blocks='[["BL_222.7",222,[238,1571,1156,147]]]'>When defense counsel cited <em>Bighum </em>and replied that admitting the convictions would unduly influence the jury and prejudice appellant, the trial court continued:</p>

      <em>“As I said, if the law is still extant the Court has no choice but to utilize the use of those prior convictions. </em>I invite your further scrutiny in the time permitted of the <em>Bingham </em>[sic] case but it seems to the Court that the purpose of use of prior convictions is for the purpose of attacking the credibility of one. <em>And notwithstanding that a person is a defendant in a murder case their prior convictions upon the question of credibility has always been the rule unless it’s been changed. . . . </em>[The Supreme Court] may take different views afterwards but the present law is what Pm bound by.” (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>

      <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>Although the trial court did refer to the remoteness of the convictions — one of five factors articulated in <em>Bighum </em>to guide trial judges in the exercise of their discretion — read as a whole, we think the trial judge’s statements evidence a misapprehension of his role in this regard. Although he mentioned “the propinquity of time,” the basic tenor of the trial judge’s statements is that he felt obligated to allow the convictions to be admitted into evidence. Of course, <em>Bighum </em>removed any such obligation; whereas former decisional law gave the prosecution the absolute right to introduce such evidence, our holding in <em>Bighum </em>requires the trial court to deny the admission of prior convictions in a particular case if a careful weighing of the <em>Bighum </em>factors militate against admission. Our decision in <em>Bighum </em>has endowed trial judges with a useful source of flexibility in conducting their search for truth. The <em>Bighum </em>balancing test must be administered by reference to that objective, and that can only be accomplished by a careful consideration of all the factors we have said should guide a trial judge in deciding whether to admit or exclude evidence of prior convictions. We have long recognized the prejudicial effect of the introduction of other offenses and have limited their use to those situations where the probative value far exceeded the prejudice to a defendant. <em>See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Bobko, </em><a href="/pa/453/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="453 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="577615" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0475-01">453 Pa. 475</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20576" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="309 A.2d 576">309 A.2d 576</a> (1973). Only through a solicitous application of the <em>Bighum </em>criteria can courts ensure that the probative value of the prior convictions is indeed far weightier than such prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[200,1794,1150,527]]]'>Even though the trial court did not exercise this discretion as required by <em>Bighum, </em>appellant is nonetheless not entitled to relief. At trial, appellant objected to the use of the prior convictions for various reasons, only one of which is pursued on this appeal. Appellant argues that the convictions were too remote in time. The convictions were less than two years old, and we note that this criterion of <em>Bighum </em>was considered by the trial court. We find no abuse of discretion in permitting the introduction of convictions less than two years old.</p>

      <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>The appellant also argues in this appeal that the convictions should not have been admitted because the prosecution had other adequate means of attacking defendant’s credibility. The prosecution argues that this issue has been waived because not raised during trial. We agree. Although the issue now raised is important under <em>Bighum, </em>since the issue was not presented at the time of trial, it has been waived.</p>
