        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal is from an order of the Commonwealth Court which affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County. The Bucks County court ordered and decreed that a treasurer\u2019s deed of conveyance was valid and effective to convey absolute title to appellee, Grace Building Co., Inc. (Grace Building).\nAn action to quiet title was brought by Walter H. Douglass, Jr. and his wife, Dallas Douglass, appellants. The facts are not disputed; the case has proceeded on stipulated facts which are as follows. In 1965 appellants bought a residence in Bucks County and thereafter paid the realty taxes through the mortgagee. However, appellants failed to comply with an agreement entered into at settlement whereby they became obligated to pay an interim school tax for the year 1966 in the amount of $191.10. In November of 1967 the Bucks County Treasurer sent a notice to appellants of the amount due, including the following clause in bold type: \u201cPAYMENT ACCEPTED ONLY BY CASH, MONEY ORDER OR CERTIFIED CHECK.\u201d Similar delinquency notices were sent February 1, 1968, April 1, 1968, and June 3, 1968. The fourth notice also stated that a tax sale was to be scheduled for August 5, 1968, unless payment was made. No payment having been tendered by that date, the property, with a mortgage of $14,100, was sold to Grace Building.\nOn June 1, 1970, appellants received a final delinquency notice informing them of their right of redemption and stating that \u201ccash, certified check or money order\u201d in the amount of $251.26 (which included interest) was payable to the treasurer. On July 27, 1970, nine days before the expiration date of the redemption period, appellants mailed to the Bucks County Treasurer a personal check drawn on their personal account at the Girard Trust Bank in the amount of $251.26. Instead of depositing appellants\u2019 uncertified check on the day of receipt, the treasurer\u2019s office mailed it back to appellants with instructions that payment would be accepted only by \u201ccash, certified check or money order.\u201d Appellants did not have the check certified until August 6, 1970, and it was not received by the treasurer\u2019s office until August 10, 1970. On August 6, 1970, the treasurer\u2019s office deeded the property to Grace Building.\nAppellants then brought an action to quiet title, contending that their tender of a personal check to the treasurer\u2019s office constituted payment within the meaning of \u00a7 15 of the Act of May 29, 1931, P.L. 280, \u00a7 15, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5971o, which act provides:\n\u201c\u00a7 5971o. Redemption money\n\u201cIf any owner, his heirs or legal representatives, or any lien creditor, his heirs, assigns or legal representatives, or other person interested, shall, within two years after the day such sale was made, redeem such real estate for the benefit of the owner, by payment of the taxes and interest for which the lands were sold, and the costs, with an additional sum of fifteen per centum, and any taxes which may have been levied against any such property since the treasurer\u2019s sale, and which remain unpaid by the owner or redeemer, to the county treasurer, he shall receive and receipt for the same, and pay said taxes, interest, costs and additional percentage over to the purchaser upon demand, and the accrued taxes to the district entitled thereto; and the county treasurer shall forthwith acknowledge the receipt of the redemption moneys upon the margin of the acknowledgment of the treasurer\u2019s deed, as the same is entered and recorded in the prothonotary\u2019s office as aforesaid, and, if said deed has been recorded in the office for recording of deeds, cause an entry to be made on the margin of the record of the deed in the office of the recorder of deeds, by marking thereon the word \u2018redeemed\u2019, which shall be signed by the county treasurer, and attested by the recorder of deeds, and thereafter said deed shall be void and of no effect. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County held that the treasurer\u2019s deed conveying the property to Grace Building was valid and effective. An appeal was taken to the Commonwealth Court, which in a five-to-two decision, affirmed the Bucks County Court. Douglass v. Grace Building Co., 22 Pa.Cmwlth. 174, 348 A.2d 435 (1975). We granted appellants\u2019 petition for allowance of appeal.\nThere has been and still is but one issue during prior proceedings and this appeal: did appellants\u2019 tender to the county treasurer of an uncertified personal check constitute \u201cpayment\u201d for delinquent taxes under the above-quoted redemption statute? In its majority opinion, the Commonwealth Court stated:\n\u201cOur research has revealed no case in Pennsylvania law where the issue of mode of payment in a redemption following a treasurer\u2019s tax sale has been judicially scrutinized. However, there is case law, extending back over one hundred years, which holds that a treasurer, unless he agrees to the contrary, may receive money only in payment by a purchaser at a tax sale, Donnel v. Bellas, 34 Pa. 157 (1859), and that payment by check is ineffective. Similarly, in Nutting v. Lynn, 18 Pa.Super. 59 (1901), payment was tendered to a treasurer to prevent a tax sale and there the court reaffirmed the rationale that payment in other than legal tender to the tax collector was no payment at all.\n* * * * * *\n\u201cThe rationale which pervades these cases in that where a party nears the end of a limitation period, be it time for appeal, time to purchase, or as in the instant case, time to redeem, courts are reluctant to sanction what amounts to a mere promise to pay, Ellison v. Buckley, 42 Pa. 281 (1862), because finality of payment to the public officer insures collection without unnecessary litigation, Walker v. Graham, 74 Pa. 35 (1873) and in many instances, the public officer is but a conduit standing in the shoes of third parties whose rights are easily prejudiced and whose rights must be scrupulously guarded, Donnel v. Bellas, supra.\n\u201cWith these principles in mind, we cannot and will not sanction conditional tender in the form of a personal uncertified check to the county treasurer whose duty it was to insure a valid redemption prior to voiding the treasurer\u2019s deed which he had already executed and delivered to Defendant. It was eminently reasonable and perfectly valid for the treasurer to insist upon unconditional tender in the form of cash, money order or certified check. Plaintiffs were given ample notice of the tax deficiency, and the method by which it might be cleared, both prior to, and after the tax sale.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\nWe believe, however, that the court\u2019s reliance on these Nineteenth Century cases is misplaced, because those cases did not take into account the realities of modern-day banking procedures. Douglass v. Grace Building Co., supra (dissenting opinion by Mencer, J.).\nIn Ellison v. Buckley, supra, 42 Pa. at 283, for example, the court stated:\n\u201cWe cannot, however, avoid expressing our entire disapprobation of a prothonotary, or any public officer, receiving in his official capacity anything but money, in payment either of costs, or of sums intrusted to him under the orders of a court or other competent authority. If a prothonotary can take a note for money belonging to others, he may take a verbal promise to pay; or if he is debtor to the person paying, he may write off so much of his own debt. In these and other forms, he may substitute his own responsibility for actual cash, which is contrary to his duty as a public agent. . . . Besides, each suit should terminate all its own litigation, and not be the cause of others by the substitution of notes or credits for actual cash.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThese cases were concerned that a treasurer, by accepting a tender of other than cash, would be accepting a mere promise to pay. During the Nineteenth Century, this was a valid concern, since all of these cases deal with promissory notes, which are a promise to pay at some specified time in the future. With modern banking procedure, checks are a promise to pay for only a short period, as the collection process employed by commercial banks normally involves a short period. A treasurer will today know whether a check has been paid or dishonored shortly after processing a check. A treasurer accepting a check is hardly substituting \u201chis own responsibility for cash,\u201d thus doing nothing \u201ccontrary to his duty as a public agent.\u201d\nIn Hill v. United States, 263 F.2d 885, 886 (3d Cir. 1959), the court was discussing payment under the Internal Revenue Code, and went on to state:\n\u201c. . . We said in Busser v. United States, 3 Cir., 1942, 130 F.2d 537, 539, that the common use of the term \u2018payment\u2019 in both laymen\u2019s language and lawyers\u2019 language explains it as \u2018something given to discharge a debt or obligation.\u2019 . . . If a man in a haberdashery shop sees a tie marked $3.00 on the counter, picks it up and hands it to a clerk with three $1.00 bills we think there is no doubt in his mind or the clerk\u2019s mind that the money is being tendered as payment for the tie. To us this case is just as clear. A taxpayer makes out his return form; he accompanies it with a check for the amount he figures he owes. If that is not the sending of money in discharge of the debt it is hard to figure out what a \u2018payment\u2019 can be.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThis Redemption Statute, as applicable in Bucks County, allows an owner to redeem his property sold at a tax sale by \u201cpayment\u201d of back taxes plus interest within two years of said tax sale. Since the Legislature has not designated in what form payment must be made, we believe the Bucks County Treasurer\u2019s Administrative Procedure refusing uncertified personal checks cannot be allowed to stand given modern-day banking procedures.\nOne small problem remains, for it is clear that the mere acceptance of a check by a treasurer should not constitute absolute payment, because any check may be dishonored. In Wendkos v. Scranton Life Ins. Co., 340 Pa. 550, 553, 17 A.2d 895, 897 (1941), we stated: \u201c. . .a creditor\u2019s acceptance of a check constitutes only a conditional payment, dependent on the check finally being honored . .\u201d The question then becomes on which date is payment final?\nAs Judge Mencer stated in his dissenting opinion to Douglass v. Grace Building Co., supra, 22 Pa.Cmwlth. at 180:\n\u201cI do not advocate that the presentation of a personal check to the treasurer at any time prior to the close of the redemption period accomplishes payment. However, I would contend that, when a personal check is deposited in the normal course of the treasurer\u2019s duties and is paid by the drawer\u2019s bank prior to the close of the redemption period, then, under such facts, payment has been made as the statute requires.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\nWe believe that this view is too restrictive and would cause as many problems as it solves. We can perceive, for example, a situation where a taxpayer\u2019s check might not clear until after the redemption date through no fault of the taxpayer.\nIn Witt\u2019s Estate v. Fahs, 160 F.Supp. 521 (S.D.Fla.1956), a taxpayer made a charitable contribution by mailing a check to a charity on December 31, 1946. The charity did not receive the check until January 4, 1947, with the check clearing shortly thereafter. The court held that payment was as of the date the check was placed with the post office, thus allowing the taxpayer a charitable deduction for 1946. The same principle is applicable to our situation. As long as a check is given to a treasurer on or before the redemption date, we can see no problem with the treasurer forgoing final action on the treasurer\u2019s deed until the check is either paid or dishonored.\nOrder of Commonwealth Court reversed and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., joins this opinion and files a concurring opinion.\nPOMEROY, J., dissents.\n. It is undisputed that appellants\u2019 checking account had sufficient funds to cover the check at all times between the date the treasurer\u2019s office received the check and August 5, the last day of the redemption period.",

A certified check (or a cashier\u2019s check or a nongovernmental money order) is a promise to pay by a private person as is a personal check. If a personal check were not to be considered payment, neither should a cashier\u2019s check nor a certified check.
