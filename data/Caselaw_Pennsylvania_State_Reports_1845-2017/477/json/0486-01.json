        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nOn June 13, 1969, appellant was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter. Following the denial of post-verdict motions, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not.less than six nor more than twelve years. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Conner, 445 Pa. 36, 282 A.2d 23 (1971). On July 7, 1975, this Court, acting upon appellant\u2019s pro se petition for a writ of coram nobis, remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing of appellant without consideration of any uncounseled convictions expunged from appellant\u2019s record because invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). Commonwealth v. Conner, 462 Pa. 282, 341 A.2d 81 (1975). Appellant was resentenced on August 21, 1975, to a term of imprisonment of not less than six nor more than twelve years, to be computed from December 11, 1965. From this judgment of sentence, appellant now appeals.\nAppellant challenges the sentence imposed upon resentencing on the grounds that the judge who resentenced appellant should have disqualified himself and that the sentence imposed constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. We hold both contentions lack merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1977).\n. Appellant does not contend that the sentence must be vacated because the trial court failed to articulate reasons for the sentence imposed. See generally, Commonwealth v. Kostka, 475 Pa. 85, 379 A.2d 884 (1977); Commonwealth v. Riggins, 474 Pa. 115, 377 A.2d 140 (1977) (plurality opinion). Nor does he argue that the trial court erred in failing to consider appellant\u2019s background, characteristics, relative culpability or prospects for rehabilitation. See generally, Commonwealth v. Martin, 466 Pa. 118, 351 A.2d 650 (1976). To the contrary, appellant\u2019s argument suggests sentence should be based solely upon the nature of this \u201cpassion\u201d crime. Indeed, counsel\u2019s statements at the resentencing proceeding were directed entirely to the nature of the crime and brought to the court\u2019s attention no information concerning appellant\u2019s background, character or prospects for rehabilitation.\n. Appellant also raises numerous alleged trial errors not properly within the scope of this appeal arising from a proceeding at which imposition of sentence was the only issue. Appellant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth improperly cross-examined him was finally litigated in appellant\u2019s initial direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Conner, 445 Pa. 36, 39, 282 A.2d 23, 25 (1971). Appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in refusing to permit the record to reflect alleged prejudicial and inflammatory remarks by the Commonwealth was also finally determined in that appeal. Appellant\u2019s challenge to the tried court\u2019s use of the word \u201cvictim\u201d and the Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to cedi appellant\u2019s wife as a witness were waived by appellant\u2019s failure to reuse them in his first direct appeal.",
