        "text": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nOn October 29, 1973, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission found that appellants, Van Bur\u00e9n Homes, Inc. and Stephen Speare, President, by systematically confining Black residents and applicants solely to dwelling units on two streets within the Van Bur\u00e9n Homes Development, engaged in unlawful discriminatory practices in violation of Section 5(h) of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, \u00a7 5(h), as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(h) (Supp. 1977-78). On November 8, 1973, the Commission ordered appellants to cease their unlawful discriminatory practices and designed a detailed and comprehensive plan to eliminate existing discrimination in the development and to ensure future compliance with the Act. The Commonwealth Court unanimously affirmed the Commission\u2019s final order and we granted appellant\u2019s request to appeal to this Court.\nAppellants raise the following arguments:\n(1) The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission allegedly exceeded their scope of authority in allowing the complaint to be amended on the day of the hearing, changing the wording \u201cnon-white\u201d to \u201cblack\u201d.\n(2) The evidence presented allegedly does not support the findings of faet and conclusions of law found in the Commission\u2019s adjudication.\n(3) The Commission\u2019s final order is allegedly void and unenforceable as being arbitrary, burdensome and beyond the authority of the Commission.\n(4) A non-profit cooperative housing corporation allegedly does not engage in \u201ccommercial housing\u201d under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act.\nWe find these arguments to be without merit and affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court. Pennsylvania Hu man Relations Commission v. Alto-Reste Park Cemetery Association, 453 Pa. 124, 133, 306 A.2d 881, 887 (1973); Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester School District, 427 Pa. 157, 233 A.2d 290 (1967).\nOur jurisdiction in this case is based on the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp. 1977-78).",
