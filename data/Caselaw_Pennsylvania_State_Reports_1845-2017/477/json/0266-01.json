        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Robert Lee Jones appeals from an order of the Post Conviction Hearing Act court denying his petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1180-1 et seq. (Supp.1977). We affirm.\nOn August 4, 1972, after several days of trial, appellant pled guilty to murder of the second degree and several lesser offenses. The trial court sentenced appellant to six to twenty years imprisonment on the murder conviction and suspended sentence on the other charges. Appellant did not take a direct appeal from the judgment of sentence.\nOn June 20, 1975, appellant .filed a petition for relief under the Act. The PCHA court appointed counsel other than trial counsel to assist appellant in filing a petition conforming with the Act. Appellant\u2019s amended petition alleged that: (1) trial counsel was ineffective in not raising issues properly, not advising appellant adequately of the consequences of his plea of guilty, and otherwise failing to provide zealous representation; (2) his plea of guilty was unlawfully induced; (3) prejudicial pre-trial publicity existed; and (4) statements made by appellant to police were unlawfully obtained. After filing the amended petition but before entry of the PCHA court\u2019s order, appellant also asserted that his appellate rights were denied, see Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963).\nThe PCHA court concluded that trial counsel was effective and appellant\u2019s plea was validly entered. The court declined to rule on appellant\u2019s assertion that his appellate rights were denied, believing that it had jurisdiction over the merits of the validity of appellant\u2019s plea of guilty. Appellant did not subsequently request the PCHA court to make an express ruling on his Douglas claim. The court also did not rule on appellant\u2019s contention that prejudicial pre-trial publicity existed or that his statements to the police were unlawfully obtained.\nAppellant asserts that, because he did not voluntarily and knowingly enter his plea of guilty and because the trial court participated in the sentencing agreement, the PCHA court erred in failing to find that appellant\u2019s plea of guilty was not validly entered. Appellant also contends that trial counsel was ineffective for not interviewing certain witnesses, thereby inducing his plea of guilty. Appellant fails, however, to renew his claim that his Douglas rights have been denied. We conclude that appellant has not proven that his present challenge to the validity of his plea of guilty has not been waived for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal, and appellant\u2019s assertion that trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness induced his plea is without merit.\nTo obtain relief under the Act, a petitioner must prove that any alleged error resulting in conviction and sentence has not been waived. \u00a7 3(d), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-3(d). A petitioner has waived an issue if he \u201cknowingly and understandingly\u201d failed to raise on direct appeal an issue that could have been raised then. \u00a7 4(b)(1), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180~4(b)(l). Failure to raise an issue gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a \u201cknowing and understanding\u201d failure. \u00a7 4(c), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(c). There is no waiver, however, if a petitioner proves the existence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d .justifying failure to raise the issue on direct appeal. \u00a7 4(b)(2), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(b)(2). A denial of Douglas rights is such an extraordinary circumstance. Commonwealth v. Tunnell, 463 Pa. 462, 345 A.2d 611 (1975); Commonwealth v. Via, 455 Pa. 373, 316 A.2d 895 (1974).\nAppellant\u2019s contention that his plea was invalid could have been raised on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Tunnell, supra; Commonwealth v. Greer, 457 Pa. 646, 326 A.2d 338 (1974). Appellant has proved in neither the PCHA court nor this Court any extraordinary circumstance excusing his failure to take a direct appeal. While appellant asserted in PCHA court that he was denied his Douglas rights, that court expressly made no finding on whether such rights had been denied, appellant did not subsequently seek an express ruling on the Douglas issue, and in this Court has failed to assert a denial of Douglas rights. Consequently, appellant has not rebutted the Act\u2019s presumption that he knowingly and understandingly failed on direct appeal to raise the validity of his plea, and therefore the issue is waived. Commonwealth v. Tunnell, supra.\nThe PCHA court erroneously relied on Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. 265, 232 A.2d 193 (1967), in concluding that it could reach the merits of appellant\u2019s challenge to his guilty plea without first determining whether appellant\u2019s appellate rights were denied, see Commonwealth v. Tunnell, supra; Commonwealth v. Via, supra. The PCHA court\u2019s error, however, did not relieve appellant of his burden of proving extraordinary circumstances showing his claims were not waived.\nAppellant\u2019s argument that trial counsel was ineffective was not waived for failing to take a direct appeal because appellant was represented by trial counsel when he decided not to appeal. When a defendant fails on direct appeal to raise ineffectiveness of trial counsel, the issue of ineffectiveness is not waived if his appellate counsel was his trial counsel. Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975); see Commonwealth v. Fox, 476 Pa. 475, 383 A.2d 199 (1978). In Commonwealth v. Mabie, 467 Pa. 464, 359 A.2d 369 (1976), this Court applied Dancer to a situation where, as here, no direct appeal was taken:\n\u201cHere, since trial counsel, who Mabie contends was ineffective, would have been required to file post-verdict motions and a direct appeal on the issue of his own ineffectiveness were such procedures initiated, it is similarly unrealistic to expect counsel to file motions and/or an appeal challenging his own effectiveness. Therefore, where a PCHA petition alleges as grounds for relief that trial counsel, with whom the petitioner consulted concerning the feasibility of appeal, has been ineffective and where trial counsel has not taken a direct appeal on behalf of the petitioner, the question of whether trial counsel was ineffective has not been waived for the purposes of review in a PCHA proceeding.\u201d (Footnote omitted).\nId., 467 Pa. at 469-70, 359 A.2d at 371-72. Therefore, appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview certain witnesses induced his plea has not been waived.\nNonetheless, appellant\u2019s claim is without merit. Appellant sought to prove self-defense. After several days of trial, appellant changed his plea just before two additional witnesses were to testify for the Commonwealth. Although appellant\u2019s counsel had examined the Commonwealth\u2019s file and thus likely knew the substance of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, he did not interview the witnesses.\nRelying on Commonwealth v. Mabie, supra, appellant asserts that counsel\u2019s failure to interview these witnesses induced his plea of guilty. In Mabie, where counsel before negotiating a plea of guilty for his client did not investigate prospective witnesses or examine certain potentially favorable records, we found that counsel was ineffective and invalidated the plea. By contrast, appellant\u2019s decision here was not the result of counsel\u2019s failure to explore his client\u2019s case; rather, appellant undoubtedly realized that his chances of acquittal were slight. The Commonwealth had presented a strong case against appellant during several days of trial, including testimony of an eyewitness and a statement of appellant to police, and the testimony of the additional witnesses the Commonwealth planned to call was likely to be unfavorable. Moreover, appellant has not alleged that these Commonwealth witnesses, if interviewed, would have supplied information so favorable that he would not have pleaded guilty despite the persuasive case against him. In these circumstances, we cannot say that appellant\u2019s plea of guilty was induced by counsel\u2019s decision not to interview the two Commonwealth witnesses.\nOrder affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which POMEROY, J, joins.\nWe hear these appeals pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, arts. II & V, \u00a7\u00a7 202(1) and 503(c), 17 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 211.202(1) and 211.503(c) (Supp.1977), and the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L.

        "text": "MANDERINO, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. Appellant argues here, as he did in the PCHA court, that he should be awarded a new trial because,\n(1) the on-the-record colloquy of the guilty plea proceeding was inadequate under the standards of Pa.R.Cr.P. 319 and Commonwealth v. Ingram, 455 Pa. 198, 316 A.2d 77 (1974);\n(2) the trial judge participated in the negotiations leading to the plea bargain in violation of Commonwealth v. Evans, 434 Pa. 52, 252 A.2d 689 (1970), and\n(3) appellant was denied his right to effective representation of trial counsel.\nThe issues raised by the appellant in this appeal may or may not have merit. For the reasons that follow, I would not reach the merits of the issues raised however. Appellant did not appeal following the imposition of the judgments of sentence in 1972. The prosecution therefore argues that the case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Tunnell, 463 Pa. 462, 345 A.2d 611 (1975), and that we should not consider those issues raised in this appeal. In his PCHA petition, appellant alleged that he was denied the right to appeal, as guaranteed by Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963). This Douglas claim has not been pursued on appeal. In Commonwealth v. Tunnell, we said:\n\u201cOn appeal to this Court appellant does not challenge the propriety of the judge\u2019s ruling on the Douglas claim. He contends here only that the evidence produced at the post-conviction hearing requires a finding that his plea was invalid and that the sentencing judge should have permitted him to withdraw his plea. However, we do not reach the validity of this contention because appellant has failed to show that this claim was not waived, as required for relief under section 3(d) of the PCHA, supra, \u00a7 3(d), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-3(d). Commonwealth v. Hines, 461 Pa. 271, 336 A.2d 280 (1975).\nAppellant\u2019s contention that his plea was invalid was cognizable on direct appeal, Commonwealth v. Greer, 457 Pa. 646, 326 A.2d 338 (1974); Commonwealth v. Hill, 457 Pa. 1, 7, 319 A.2d 886, 890 (1974), and a failure to so raise it, absent extraordinary circumstances to justify such failure, constitutes a waiver under section 4(b) of the PCHA, supra, \u00a7 4(b), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(b). While appellant might have avoided waiver had he prevailed on his Douglas claim, Commonwealth v. Fiero, 462 Pa. 409, 341 A.2d 448 (filed July 7, 1975); Commonwealth v. Via, 455 Pa. 373, 376, 316 A.2d 895, 897 (1974), his failure to pursue the hearing court\u2019s adverse ruling on this point precludes further consideration of the issue.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Id. 463 Pa. at 462, 345 A.2d at 612.\nThis appeal is not controlled by Tunnell, however, for here the post-conviction hearing court made no adverse ruling as to appellant\u2019s Douglas claim. Citing Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. 265, 232 A.2d 193 (1967), the post-conviction court said the following as to appellant\u2019s claim that he was denied his appeal rights.\n\u201cThe defendant now contends that he was also deprived of his appellate rights. Of course, there is no merit to this contention since it is well settled that at this posture of the case the defendant may raise, by collateral attack, precisely those issues which he may raise on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. [262] 265, 232 A.2d 193 (1967). That is, having pleaded guilty, the defendant may only attack the jurisdiction of the court, the validity of his guilty plea and the propriety of his sentence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ward, 442 Pa. 351, 275 A.2d 92 (1971). (Emphasis added.)\nAlthough the PCHA court said \u201cthere is no merit to this contention\u201d, read in context, it is clear that the court was not deciding whether appellant had waived his Douglas rights by failing to appeal from his judgment. Rather, the court was relying on Stokes. In Stokes, we said that \u201cthe denial of right to appellate review, even if true, would not be prejudicial. . . . \u201d because the issue of the validity of the plea was cognizable in a collateral proceeding. Under Stokes, therefore, the post-conviction court did not need to determine whether there had been a denial of Douglas rights. This procedure was changed by Tunnell, and the PCHA court should have determined whether appellant was denied his Douglas rights.\nAppellant raises issues which would require a reversal of the judgment of sentence and a remand for new trial if meritorious and if he prevailed on the Douglas claim. We do not, however, have the benefit of any ruling on the claimed denial of the right to appeal. I would therefore remand the record to the post-conviction court with instructions that it consider and rule upon appellant\u2019s alleged denial of the right to appeal. Following a determination by the post-conviction court, appellant should be allowed to refile his appeal within the appropriate time.\nPOMEROY, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
