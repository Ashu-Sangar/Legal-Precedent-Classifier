Following the lower court\u2019s denial, en banc, of appellant\u2019s motion for new trial and arrest of judgment, appellant was sentenced to not less than ten nor more than twenty years imprisonment.\nIn this direct appeal, appellant raises the following issues: That the trial judge erred by unduly restricting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of two Commonwealth witnesses as to their racial bias; that the trial judge erred by unduly restricting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of one Commonwealth witness as to the witness\u2019s motive to cooperate with the prosecution; that the trial judge erred in refusing to strike a portion of one Commonwealth witness\u2019s testimonial reference to appellant\u2019s prior possession of firearms; that appellant\u2019s conviction was obtained by the use of false testimony. We have considered these arguments and find them to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision or consideration of this case.",
