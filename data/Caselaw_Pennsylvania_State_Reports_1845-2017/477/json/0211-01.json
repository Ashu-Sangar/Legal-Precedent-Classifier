On appeal appellant raises the following issues:\n1. There was allegedly insufficient evidence to support any of the crimes charged;\n2. That the search warrant was based on illegally obtained evidence and therefore the evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant was allegedly inadmissible.\nHaving found no merit in either of these arguments, we affirm the judgments of sentence.",
