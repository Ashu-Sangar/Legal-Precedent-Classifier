Blystone, </em>supra, we examined whether Section 5704(2) of the Act violated Article I, § 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The facts of the case are that Blystone and three of his companions picked up a hitchhiker to rob him for gas money. After pulling off the road at a lonely spot, Blystone had the hitchhiker exit the automobile at gun point and led him to an adjacent field. Blystone then robbed the hitchhiker of thirteen dollars and after having him lie face down on the ground subsequently emptied his revolver into the back of the hitchhiker’s head. After Blystone’s associates eventually exposed him, the police were able to obtain an audio tape of Blystone describing the murder to an informant who along with Blystone was in a truck when the police monitored and recorded the conversation. <em>Id. </em><a href="/pa/519/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="519 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1813568" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0450-01">519 Pa. at 487</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="519 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1813568" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0450-01">549 A.2d 81</a>.

In <em>Henlen, </em>a prison guard was being interrogated by a Pennsylvania State Trooper following the theft of an inmate’s personal property. During the interrogation, the guard was secretly tape recording the interrogation. Subsequent to the interrogation, the guard filed a complaint against the trooper who had interrogated him for harassment and gave a copy of the tape to the Internal Affairs Division of the Pennsylvania State Police.

Under the facts of that appeal, the evidence established that the trooper took some notes of the meeting but would have taken more if he heard more information which could have been used against the defendant. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that these kinds of interrogations are routinely recorded by law enforcement officials. Therefore, the trooper would not have been justified in expecting that this conversations would not be subject to interception.</p>

If nowhere else, an individual must feel secure in his ability to hold a private conversation within the four walls of his home. For the right to privacy to mean anything, it must guarantee privacy to an individual in his own home. As then Justice Roberts stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Shaw, </em><a href="/pa/476/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="476 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1736929" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0543-01">476 Pa. 543</a>, 550, <a href="/pa/476/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="476 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1736929" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0543-01">383 A.2d 496</a>, 499 (1978) (Citations omitted): Upon closing the door of one’s home to the outside world, a person may legitimately expect the highest degree of privacy known to our society.</p>

The police were admitted to his family’s home to inquire of his knowledge of a recent robbery and killing. An eyewitness to the shooting had informed the police that one of the perpetrators was a friend of a man by the name of “Shaw”. When the police entered the house and called out to the defendant, a detective heard feet shuffling on the second floor. Because the defendant did not respond to the detective’s call, three police officers ran upstairs without a warrant or permission. We held in that instance that the governmental intrusion was unreasonable given the defendant’s legitimate expectation of privacy in his own home and therefore the intrusion violated the defendant’s right against unreasonable searches and seizures. While the facts of <em>Shaw </em>differ from the case sub judice, the principle involved is identical. An individual has a constitutionally protected right to be secure in his home.</p>

Neither the majority nor the dissenting opinion in <em>Blystone </em>contains any reference to the location of the conversation, nor do they rely on that factor to decide the case. Where the Opinion in Support of Affirmance notes that the <em>Blystone </em>decision turns on the location of the conversation, it supports that contention with a citation to the appendix to the opinion (containing a transcript of Blystone’s conversation) rather than a citation to the bodies of the majority or dissenting opinion. Indeed, in this case, The Opinion In Support of Affirmance summarizes the <em>Blystone </em>holding without any reference to the location of the conversation, but instead acknowledges that there was “no constitutional defect in the statute because Blystone had no reasonable expectation of privacy <em>once he chose to disclose his confidence to the informant.” Supra, </em>slip op. at 1146 (emphasis added). Thus, the location is not a distinguishing factor because it was not a consideration in the original <em>Blystone </em>decision.</p>

The issue before us today is whether our Constitution allows a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule when the evidence was obtained pursuant to a constitutionally defective statute. This issue requires an analysis of related case law, as well as unique issues of state and local concern that relate to the use of evidence obtained through an unconstitutional statute.</p>

Assuming for the sake of argument that there exists a heightened expectation of privacy in one’s home, nevertheless we are not satisfied that this case presents an uncontroverted finding that this is a home. The record leaves unanswered the relevant question of whether this defendant was conducting a criminal business enterprise that was open to those members of the public who sought marijuana. Such an enterprise would reduce the defendant’s expectation of privacy in the conversations relating to his "business.” If indeed the home does present a zone of privacy warranting greater protection with relation to the Wiretap Act, a factual finding of whether this is a home remains necessary.</p>
