Thus, before a preliminary injunction may issue, we must examine whether the five factors stated by the Commonwealth Court are present. We begin with a consideration of whether the moving party’s right to relief is clear. If it is not, an injunction may not issue.</p>

In general, the 1994 policy covers wrongful acts which are reported during 1994, except that (a) it does not include coverage for wrongful acts, or circumstances, situations, events or transactions which have been the subject of notice before 1994 under any prior policy; or (b) it does not include coverage for <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>wrongful acts which are interrelated to other wrongful acts which have been noticed to an insurance carrier prior to 1994.</p>
    <p id="b698-4" data-blocks='[["BL_698.4",698,[273,435,1159,517]]]'>The Commonwealth Court in its February 27, 1996 opinion took the view that even though the insurance commissioner made allegations of wrongful conduct in its 1993 Opposition Petition, she did not make any claims against the officers and directors of Corporate Life. Moreover, the lower court’s view was that there are numerous allegations in the <em>Maleski </em>action that were not raised in the Opposition Petition. The Commonwealth Court concluded from this that it was appropriate to issue a preliminary injunction in the Richardson defendants’ favor.</p>
    <p id="b698-5" data-blocks='[["BL_698.5",698,[270,982,1158,632]]]'>We disagree. In order for the injunction to issue, the Richardson defendants’ right to relief must be clear. A viable argument can be made that in both 1993 and 1994 the insurance commissioner was alleging that the Richardson defendants were raping the insurance company and that their conduct involved fraud and numerous violations of law. The commissioner did not set out the allegations in detail in 1993, as she stated in the Opposition Petition, in order to avoid pointless duplication of work, but she made clear that the Richardson defendants, those in control of Corporate Life, were engaged in a systematic fraudulent scheme to divert more than $20 million of Corporate Life’s assets.</p>

That, however, is not dispositive. In order for the injunction to issue, it must be clear that the Richardson defendants will prevail, i.e., it must be clear that the <em>Maleski </em>matter was <em>not </em>“based upon” “a wrongful act whenever occurring ... together with a wrongful act which has been the subject of [prior] notice” or “any other wrongful act whenever occurring, which together with a wrongful act which has been the subject of [prior] notice, would constitute interrelated wrongful acts.” (Lloyd’s Policy, III. Exclusions, RR. 333a, supra). “Interrelated wrongful acts,” it will be recalled, are “wrongful acts which have as a common nexus, any <em>fact, circumstance, situation event trans</em>

    <p id="b699-4" data-blocks='[["BL_699.4",699,[242,439,1155,534]]]'>Although the Richardson defendants may, in fact, prevail in their claim that they are entitled to 1994 insurance coverage as well as 1993 coverage after the case has been fully litigated, we cannot say that their right to relief, on this record, is clear. It is plausible that the matters complained of in <em>Maleski </em>were wrongful acts which have a common nexus of facts, circumstances, situations, events and transactions and that they are, therefore, excluded from 1994 coverage. In the absence of a clear right to recover, it was error to issue the preliminary injunction.</p>
