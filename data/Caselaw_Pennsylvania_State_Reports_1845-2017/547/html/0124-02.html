Three children were born of the marriage. In September, 1986, the couple separated. Mr. McMahon thereafter retained Appellants, John G. Shea, Phyllis McCormick Shea, Michael S. Dinney, and Shea and Shea, a partnership, to represent him in the divorce proceedings. In January, 1987, the trial court ordered Mr. McMahon to pay $791.00 per week to his wife and children. Mr. McMahon appealed and, prior to a hearing, he and his wife entered into a written settlement agreement dated March 31, 1987. The agreement provided that half of the weekly amount was deemed child support and the other half was deemed alimony. The only provision for termination of these payments was a clause referring to the time when “the youngest living child reaches the age of twenty-one, is emancipated or finishes college, whichever occurs last.” Mr.McMahon also <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>agreed to provide health insurance coverage during the period he was obligated to pay support.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Mr. McMahon and his wife executed an Agreed Order dated July 22, 1987, which reiterated the weekly support payments and the obligation to provide health insurance coverage. On December 4, 1987, an Amended Agreed Order was executed which repeated the aforementioned provisions. On that same date, the parties entered into a separate Property Settlement Agreement which partially amended the March 31, 1987 settlement agreement to include that Mr. McMahon had further agreed to provide his former spouse with an automobile for as long as he was obligated to pay support.</p>

    <p id="b316-9" data-blocks='[["BL_316.9",316,[275,1413,1157,851]]]'>Today, the majority holds that when counsel fails to advise a client as to the controlling law applicable to a settlement contract, he may be subject to a malpractice claim based on a theory of negligence. In doing so, the court properly draws the legally relevant distinction between a challenge to an attorney’s professional judgment regarding an amount to be accepted or paid in settlement of a claim, and a challenge to an attorney’s failure to correctly advise his client about well established principles of law in settling a case. This is a reasonable and justifiable distinction. However, in addressing this issue, the majority steps beyond merely distinguishing <em>Muhammad, </em>and limits <em>Muhammad </em>to the facts of that case. To the contrary, while the case <em>sub judice </em>may be distinguishable from <em>Muhammad, Muhammad </em>is as necessary and valid today as it was when rendered only five years ago, and deserves no such limitation.</p>
    <p id="b316-10" data-blocks='[["BL_316.10",316,[276,2295,1154,99]],["BL_317.1",317,[251,329,1156,638]]]'>In <em>Muhammad, </em>plaintiffs Pamela and Abdullah Muhammad accepted a settlement agreement terminating their medical <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>malpractice action against, inter alia, Children’s Hospital for the death of their son. Subsequently, the Muhammads became dissatisfied with the settlement agreement and believed that the monies recovered pursuant to the agreement were insufficient. After a failed attempt to renegotiate the settlement, the Muhammads sued their attorneys for, inter alia, negligence and breach of contract. This court held that dissatisfied plaintiffs may not file a suit against their attorneys following a settlement to which they agreed, based on negligence and/or contract principles, unless the plaintiffs can establish that they were fraudulently induced to settle the original action.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[250,989,1157,1124]]]'>Our decision in <em>Muhammad </em>was based on this Commonwealth’s strong and historic public policy of encouraging settlement. <em>Muhammad </em>was also forged with the similarly desirable policies of reducing litigation and encouraging an end to disputes in mind. These public policies, set forth in more detail in <em>Muhammad, </em>are as of equal import today as they were five years ago, and, in light of our overcrowded courtrooms, are perhaps of even greater significance. It is axiomatic that allowing plaintiffs to challenge their attorneys’ professional judgment regarding settlement amounts, after accepting a settlement agreement, would erode our policy of encouraging settlements, validate client second guessing, promote “litigation concerning litigation,” and lead to interminable disputes. Moreover, to allow plaintiffs to sue their attorneys because they are not satisfied with the amounts obtained in settlement would enable plaintiffs to obtain monies from a party, and in a manner in which they were previously unable to secure such funds. To permit such an action is unfair, and, for purposes of judicial economy, unsound. Finality and closure in these situations are not only laudable goals, but after settlement, they become paramount.</p>

    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[281,525,1157,420]]]'>To reiterate, today the majority draws a needed distinction between holding an attorney accountable to inform a client about the ramifications of existing law and allowing the second guessing of an attorney’s professional judgment in an attempt to obtain additional monies, once a settlement agreement has been reached. However, this decision merely creates one exception to this court’s otherwise necessary and valid determination in <em>Muhammad.</em>
