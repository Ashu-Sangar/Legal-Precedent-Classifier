The Petition called to the attention of the Court a dispute between Judge Herron and the Honorable Bernard J. Avellino, a judge of the common pleas court. More particularly, the Petition averred that Judge Herron had assigned Judge Avellino to preside over criminal trials in the court’s “felony-waiver program” for the calendar year 1997, and that Judge Avellino had refused to comply with this assignment. A Rule was issued on January 8, directing Judge Avellino to show cause within five days why he should not comply with the assignment. Additionally, we ordered that Judge Avellino comply with the assignment pending further Order of this Court.</p>
    <p id="b572-9" data-blocks='[["BL_572.9",572,[278,1728,1157,422]]]'>Judge Avellino did not immediately abide by the Order that he comply with the assignment pending further Order. Rather, he filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and there sought a temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of the assignment. The court denied the temporary restraining order on January 10. Judge Avellino reported for his assignment on January 13,1997.</p>

He further moved for an evidentiary hearing to establish a record on the factual issues raised by the dispute, which he identified in terms mirroring his reasons for refusing to comply, i.e., whether the assignment is reasonable within the meaning of Pa.R.J.A. 706(d) and the April 11,1986 Directive, and whether the assignment is an invalid effort to punish him.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[244,938,1157,901]]]'>Judge Avellino argues that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction because the Constitution establishes that the Court “shall have such jurisdiction as shall be provided by law,” Article V, Section 2(c). He asserts that this matter does not fall within any of the classes of cases which the General Assembly has assigned to the Court’s original jurisdiction, 42 Pa.C.S. § 721 (habeas corpus, mandamus or prohibition to courts of inferior jurisdiction, and quo warranto as to any officer of statewide jurisdiction) or appellate jurisdiction, 42 Pa.C.S §§ 722-725. He also argues that the Court’s extraordinary jurisdiction, 42 Pa.C.S. § 726, does not apply as there is no case “pending before any court or district justice of this Commonwealth.” Finally, he argues that Article V, Section 10 of the Constitution, vesting the Supreme Court with “general supervisory and administrative authority over all the courts,” does not constitute an independent source of jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter.</p>

According to the terms of Section 1 of the Schedule, however, the adoption of the Judicial Code superseded that Section only with respect to the jurisdiction of the Court. Thus the Court may still “exercise all the powers ... vested in the ... Supreme Court” at the time the 1968 Constitution was adopted, among which were those collectively referred to as the King’s Bench powers. See generally <em>Carpentertown Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Laird, </em><a href="/pa/360/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="360 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="475080" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0094-01">360 Pa. 94</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="61 A.2d 426">61 A.2d 426</a> (1948).</p>
    <p id="b574-4" data-blocks='[["BL_574.4",574,[286,886,1153,366]]]'>The General Assembly recognized this distinction by acknowledging the general powers of the Supreme Court in 42 Pa.C.S. § 502. See also Pa.R.A.P. 3309, which is drawn in the disjunctive (“An application for extraordinary relief under 42 Pa.C.S. § 726, or under the powers reserved by the first sentence of Section 1 of the Schedule to the Judiciary Article....”)</p>

Extraordinary jurisdiction under section 726 enables the Court to assume plenary jurisdiction of a matter pending before a court or district justice at any stage. The King’s Bench powers are not so limited. The “power of general superintendency over inferior tribunals,” may be exercised where no matter is pending in a lower court. Cf. <em>President Judge Determination Cases, </em><a href="/pa/420/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="420 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1898526" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0243-01">420 Pa. 243</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=216%20A.2d%20326" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="216 A.2d 326">216 A.2d 326</a> (1966) (King’s Bench powers invoked to determine priority of commission of common pleas court judges). We therefore reject Judge Avellino’s argument that this Court cannot take cognizance of the dispute because the subject matter does not fall within our statutory original jurisdiction, there is no final order as to which we can exercise appellate jurisdiction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>there is no “case” pending as to which we can assume extraordinary jurisdiction.</p>

It was pursuant to this authority and the rulemaking authority identified in Section 10(c) that Pa.R.J.A. 706(d) and the April 11, 1986, Directive were promulgated.

Judge Herron’s assignment of Judge Avellino to the felony-waiver program when making assignments in the Trial Division for 1997 was made pursuant to his authority as Administrative Judge as described in paragraph (3)(A) of the Directive. Because the authority under which assignments are made ultimately derives from this Court, review and resolution of any disputes concerning assignments must necessarily be subject to the authority of this Court.</p>

Paragraph 17 of the answer states, “Administrative Judge Herron did not retaliate against Judge Avellino’s June 10 Complaint or his August 28 JCB Complaint. On October 17, 1996, when Administrative Judge Herron announced all Trial Division judicial assignments for the calendar year commencing January 6, 1997, including Judge Avellino’s, Administrative Judge Herron had no knowledge of either the June 10 Complaint, the August 28 JCB Complaint or the nature of the allegations contained <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>therein.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Furthermore, Judge Herron asserted in paragraph 14 of his answer that he did not become aware of the existence of the June 10 complaint until December 30, 1996, when Judge Avellino circulated it via electronic mail to all trial division judges in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas.</p>

Furthermore, he stated that at no time had he communicated to Judge Herron any comment, written or otherwise, that may have been made by Judge Avellino alleging wrongdoing by Judge Herron. The verification of Gregory D. Anthony, Deputy Counsel for the Pennsylvania Judicial Conduct Board stated that since October 17, 1996 to the present date, no full investigation has been authorized in the matter docketed at JCB # 96-311 (the complaint filed by Judge Avellino) and, therefore, Judge Herron has received no notice from the Judicial Conduct Board of the same.</p>

Judge Avellino indicated that he made President Judge Bonavitacola aware of his misgivings relating to Judge Herron’s actions with regard to inter alia, a list room jury demand program, which involved assigning jury trials on an individual calendar basis. He stated that President Judge Bonavitacola knew from his written and oral statements before May 22, 1996 that he intended to report the claimed misconduct of Judge Herron to the Judicial Conduct Board and/or to commence litigation. Judge Avellino further indicated that President Judge Bonavitacola undertook efforts to address his concerns and, as part of a negotiating process, told Judge Herron of Judge Avellino’s intent to file a formal complaint and that Judge Avellino’s agreement to defer doing so was an express condition of continued discussions.</p>

His verification conflicts with those filed by President Judge Bonavitacola and Judge Herron as to whether Judge Herron was made aware of his complaints prior to October 17, 1996. After a review of the verifications submitted, however, we find that resolution of that factual dispute is irrelevant and immaterial to a determination of the legal issues before us.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Judge Avellino suggests that our Court's authority to review cases concerning judicial assignments might be exercised in the form of appellate jurisdiction over a final order from a "mechanism” prescribed by general rule to resolve such disputes. As explained in the text, our authority is not so limited. We likewise reject the assertion <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>that absent such a mechanism Judge Avellino was without recourse. In <em>Carpentertown Coal &amp; Coke </em>it was noted that "The power of controlling the action of inferior courts is so general and comprehensive that it has never been limited by prescribed forms of procedure or by the particular nature of the writs employed for its exercise.” <a href="/pa/360/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="360 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="475080" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0094-01">360 Pa. at 100</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="61 A.2d 426">61 A.2d at 429</a>. Indeed, as evidenced by the matter docketed in this Court at No. 132 Eastern District Miscellaneous Docket 1995, Judge Avellino is personally aware that this Court will receive papers in the form of a "letter plea” and treat them in appropriate fashion. In that matter, Judge Avellino approached the Court by way of letter, asserting that he was “aggrieved by the conduct of Judge Doyle of the Commonwealth Court” and had "nowhere else to turn.” This Court ordered that the letter be treated as a petition for exercise of the Court’s King’s Bench powers and, as such, it was denied.</p>

The "June 10” Complaint referred to was a memorandum dated June 10, 1996 from Judge Avellino to President Judge Alex Bonavitacola complaining that conduct of Judge Herron had an appearance of impropriety and that if the perceived problem was not resolved by August 1, he would report Judge Herron to the Judicial Conduct Board. The "August 28 JCB Complaint” refers to the formal complaint filed with the Judicial Conduct Board by Judge Avellino on August 28, 1996.</p>

Along with the verification, Judge Avellino filed a Demand for Jury trial and Application For Leave To Conduct Formal Discovery, claiming that he is entitled to undertake discovery and proceed by way of a jury trial under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. Inasmuch as this matter arises pursuant to the Supreme Court’s general supervisory and administrative authority over the courts, no right to jury trial or discovery exists and an appropriate order denying these requests will be entered herewith. It would appear, however, that in asserting the need for discovery, Judge Avellino implicitly acknowledges that his allegations were made without personal knowledge or substantial foundation, and that he must now engage in a “fishing expedition” to uncover evidence that might support them.</p>

      <p id="b578-9" data-blocks='[["BL_578.8",578,[262,1995,1153,393]]]'>. As Judge Herron’s order encompassed the calendar year 1997, the assignments therein by definition are not for an indefinite term. Moreover, as the order assigned all the judges of the Trial Division to duties for the same one year period, it is self-evident that the term of the assignments is not unreasonable. At oral argument, counsel for Judge Avellino suggested that in proportion to the number of years remaining in his present term, a one year assignment may be construed as unreasonable. To restate this argument is sufficient to demonstrate its preposterousness. Quaere whether <em>any </em>assignment could be deemed reasonable as the end of a judge's term nears.</p>

At argument, counsel for Judge Avellino conceded that neither constitution, statute, nor rule establishes seniority as a consideration, much less a primary consideration, in the assignment of judges. He nevertheless continued to refer to Judge Avellino’s years of service as a factor to be considered in weighing the reasonableness of the assignment to the felony waiver program. This is nonsense. Simply put, seniority carries with it no entitlement to preferential consideration.</p>

Conversely, of course, action by this Court pursuant to our supervisory power in no way affects the independent authority of the Judicial <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>Conduct Board to investigate the same conduct for purposes of disciplinary action pursuant to Article V, Section 18.</p>

In arguing that a judge may refuse to obey an unconstitutional order, Judge Avellino puts forward the example of an administrative order directing judges to sign blank search warrants for police to use at night in order to eliminate the need to have a magistrate available at night. There is clearly a difference between an administrative order directing a judge to perform what he believes is an illegal act and an order that a judge believes to be beyond the authority of the administrative judge to enter. In either case, however, recourse may be had in this Court, which bears the ultimate responsibility for the proper administration of the judicial system. The suggestion that each judge may in the first instance determine unilaterally the appropriateness of complying with an administrative order invites chaos and is simply untenable.</p>
