The evidence presented to the ALJ included evidence of the condition of the crossing structures, the vertical and horizontal clearances, the involved sight lines, the proposed measures to make the rail structures safe for recreational use and the various alternatives to removal of the structures. On February 21, 1991, the ALJ issued a recommended decision.</p>

On remand by Commonwealth Court, the PUC did not simply clarify its original order, but instead changed its disposition regarding the twelve structures that were to remain in place in Washington County. This action clearly effected a substantial change in, and was not a mere clarification of, the PUC’s prior order. Because the PUC failed to afford interested parties notice and an opportunity to be heard pursuant to Section 703(g), the order of July 7,1994, is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
