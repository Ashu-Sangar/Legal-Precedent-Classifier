From 1969 until 1976, Mr. Cleveland’s duties included preparing and painting the interiors of ships. Because other shipyard employees inside the ships were constantly removing and installing insulating materials containing asbestos, Mr. Cleveland worked in an environment thick with asbestos dust.</p>

He does, however, have an increased likelihood of contracting cancer in the future because of his exposure to asbestos. Notes of Testimony, April 26, 1989 at 6.77-6.88; Epstein Videotaped Deposition, April 24, 1989 at 87. On July 19, 1982, Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland filed a complaint against various manufacturers of insulating materials containing asbestos. Mr. Cleveland sought damages for his injuries, including, <em>inter alia, </em>increased risk and fear of developing cancer. In addition, Mrs. Cleveland sought damages for the loss of Mr. Cleveland’s consortium.</p>

Mr. Cleveland first met the future Mrs. Cleveland in 1968, when she was married to Timothy A. Smith and was known as Winifred Smith. Mrs. Smith began living with Mr. Cleveland in 1971 or 1972 and assumed the <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>name Winifred Cleveland, even though she was still married to Mr. Smith. She divorced Mr. Smith in April 1983, and married Mr. Cleveland in September 1983. Thus, the Clevelands were not married until more than one year <em>after </em>they filed their complaint purporting to be husband and wife.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Celotex stipulated to liability and agreed to pay 15 percent of any verdict upheld on appeal. The parties proceeded to trial on the issue of damages only. Following a trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (trial court) during April and May of 1989, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Cleveland for $1,500,000.00 and a verdict in favor of Mrs. Cleveland for $140,000.00. In an Order dated January 8, 1990, the trial court denied Celotex’s post-trial motions. In a second Order dated January 8, 1990, the trial court granted the Clevelands’ motion for delay damages and entered judgments against Celotex and in favor of the Clevelands.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Mr. Cleveland received a judgment for $396,067.40<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and Mrs. Cleveland received a judgment for $36,966.40.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

This Court has recognized four approaches to applying a decision announcing a new rule of law. <em>Blackwell v. Commonwealth, State Ethics Comm’n, </em><a href="/pa/527/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="527 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1827711" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0172-01">527 Pa. 172</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="527 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1827711" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0172-01">589 A.2d 1094</a> (1991). Mr. Justice <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>Zappala cogently explained these four approaches in his Concurring Opinion in <em>Blackwell </em>as follows:</p>
      <blockquote id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.2",594,[331,1547,1090,543]]]'>The first approach, in which a new rule is not even applied to the parties to the case in which the rule is announced, may be described as giving the new rule "purely prospective effect”. The second approach, in which the new rule is applied to the parties to the case in which the rule is announced and litigation commenced thereafter, is best described, I believe, as giving the new rule "prospective effect”.... The third approach, in which the new rule is applied to the case in which it is announced and all other cases then pending on direct review where the issue is raised, may be said to give the new rule "retroactive effect”---- The fourth approach, in which the new rule is applied even where the issue has been finally decided at the time of the decision announcing the new rule but later is asserted in collateral proceedings, may be described as giving the new rule "fully retroactive effect”.</blockquote>

We also held that asymptomatic pleural thickening caused by occupational exposure to asbestos does not support a cause of action for compensatory damages, with the exception that the cost of medical surveillance of the condition is recoverable. <em>Simmons, </em><a href="/pa/543/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="543 Pa. 664" data-case-ids="461530" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0664-01">543 Pa. at 678-79</a>, <a href="/pa/543/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="674 A.2d 232" data-case-ids="461530,7859514" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0664-01,/a2d/674/0232-01">674 A.2d at 239</a>.</p>
