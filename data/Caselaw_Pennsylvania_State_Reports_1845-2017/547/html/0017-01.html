It is presumed that counsel’s assistance was effective, and the burden of proving ineffectiveness falls upon the party alleging it. <em>Commonwealth v.

He argues that state public assistance records and school census data should have been used to select the array of prospective jurors, in addition to the voter registration lists and lists of licensed drivers. He bases this argument on an informal survey conducted by employees of the Delaware County Public Defender which concluded that only 6.25% of people reporting for jury service were black, whereas United States census data indicate that 10.2% of adults in Delaware County are black. Appellant presented Dr. John Lamberth as an expert in: “jury selection in terms of the process in the county which results in an expected or systematic underrepresentation of African-Americans, statistical analysis as it relates to jury selection, representation and underrepresentation of groups within the selection process, including racial minorities, and attitudes toward the Death Penalty along racial lines.” Based in <em>part on </em>the public defender’s survey, Dr. Lamberth testified that the jurysummoning procedures used in Delaware County result in significant underrepresentation of blacks and that between blacks and whites there is a statistically significant difference in attitudes toward the death penalty. In addition, this argument identifies eighteen- to twenty-one-year-old adults and economically disadvantaged people as cognizable groups whose systematic exclusion resulted in a jury array not fairly representative of the community.</p>

He claims, specifically, that he was forbidden to inquire about the jurors’ attitudes about racial prejudice and stereotyping, and attitudes regarding domestic violence and violence against police officers.

The voir dire was conducted as follows. The judge collectively asked the jury panel preliminary voir dire questions. Any juror who responded to any of those questions was examined further at sidebar regarding his response. After that preliminary voir dire, each prospective juror was taken separately into a hearing room where the trial judge, defense counsel, and the prosecutor each had the opportunity to ask additional questions. This questioning dealt mainly with the prospective juror’s ability to impose the death penalty, but each juror was questioned about other issues as well, particularly if the juror had responded affirmatively to one of the preliminary voir dire questions. This is precisely the method of voir dire which was approved in <em>DeHart, supra.</em>
