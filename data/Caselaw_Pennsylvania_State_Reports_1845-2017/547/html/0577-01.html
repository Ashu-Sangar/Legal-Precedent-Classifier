On April 8, 1992, appellee was paroled from prison and his case was assigned to Parole Agent Schuler of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole for supervision. Before being released from prison, appellee signed a form entitled “Conditions Governing Parole/Reparole.” As a condition of his parole, appellee listed his residence as being on West Sixth Street in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania and he agreed to abstain from <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>the unlawful possession or sale of narcotics.

However, prior to visiting appellee, Agent Bray received information from a person he regarded as a reliable confidential informant that appellee was once again involved in dealing drugs. Agent Bray’s inquiry to the local police also confirmed his confidential informant’s information since the local police informed Agent Bray that one of their confidential informants also reported that appellee was involved in dealing drugs.</p>

Agent Bray asked appellee’s mother if he could look around and appellee’s mother initially consented.

This contention is meritless.

We adopt this approach because it accommodates the interests of both the Commonwealth and the parolee in having a parole system that can operate efficiently and fulfill its objectives.
