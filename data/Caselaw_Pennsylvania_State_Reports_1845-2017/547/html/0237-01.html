The first is whether an adjudication of delinquency in which the juvenile court maintains supervisory authority over the juvenile is a final order subject to appeal. The second issue is whether the trial court erred in preventing defense counsel from cross-examining an eyewitness as to whether he had been drinking prior to his observing the crime at issue. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>

The male appeared to the officer as if he were acting as a lookout. Officer Perez asked the driver of the car to circle the block and, upon returning to the same location, again observed the same male and two apparent companions holding bolt cutters and tampering with the lock on the cellar doors of the restaurant. When the three males looked in the direction of the vehicle in which Officer Perez was a passenger, they proceeded further into the rear of the same alley and began tampering with another lock on the side door of the restaurant. Officer Perez then flagged down a marked police car that was on routine patrol in the vicinity of the restaurant and <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>reported what he suspected to be a burglary attempt to the uniformed officers.</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[258,435,1161,1331]]]'>While Officer Perez was describing his observations to the uniformed officers, appellant and his two companions apparently observed the marked police car and immediately fled. Officer Perez pursued on foot and the uniformed officers pursued in their police vehicle. Appellant and his two companions jumped into a nearby waiting vehicle with an unknown driver behind the wheel who immediately began to pull away from the location. Officer Perez managed to reach the driver’s side of this vehicle, whereupon he reached into the driver’s window and attempted to remove the keys from the ignition while the vehicle was still in motion. He was unsuccessful in this effort, but he continued to hold onto the door handle of the moving vehicle until the driver hit two parked cars, at which time Officer Perez fell from the vehicle. The uniformed officers in the patrol car then continued to pursue the fleeing vehicle. Officer Perez returned to the scene and retrieved the bolt cutters. Meanwhile, the uniformed officers pursued the vehicle in question until it eventually came to a halt, at which time four males exited the vehicle and fled with the officers in pursuit on foot. As a result of the description of the four perpetrators broadcast over the police radio band by the pursuing uniformed officers, appellant was arrested by another police officer and was returned to the scene of the crime. Appellant was then positively identified by Officer Perez as one of the individuals he had observed tampering with the locks of the restaurant.</p>

A panel of the Superior Court in that case interpreted that order as an evaluative disposition to determine whether the juvenile was amenable to rehabilitation, which it held was not a final order and, therefore, not appealable. The <em>en banc </em>court in the present case determined, however, that the order in this case was distinguishable on the basis that the trial court did not describe appellant’s probation as “temporary,” and that, therefore, the probationary order was final and appealable.</p>

A juvenile has a right to appeal, which is governed by the Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>In the Interest of Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/533/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="533 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="1837517" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0572-01">533 Pa. 572</a>, 577, <a href="/pa/533/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="533 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="1837517" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0572-01">626 A.2d 150</a>, 153 (1993). Failure to appeal in a timely manner from a probation order results in waiver of the right to appeal any issues arising from the trial which resulted in the probation order. <em>Commonwealth v. Gilmore, </em><a href="/pa/465/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="465 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1712660" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0202-01">465 Pa. 202</a>, 205, <a href="/pa/465/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="465 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1712660" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0202-01">348 A.2d 425</a>, 427 (1975). The Juvenile Act expressly provides that placement of a juvenile on probation subjects the juvenile to ongoing court supervision and conditions. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(a)(2) (providing for placement of a delinquent child on probation under court supervision, subject to conditions). Therefore, by its very nature, any sentence of probation is “temporary,” and a trial court’s characterization of a probation order as “temporary” constitutes mere surplusage. If a trial court wishes to supervise a juvenile for a period of time prior to entering a final order, the Juvenile Act provides several alternatives by which to do so, including informal adjustment, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6323 (providing for a maximum of nine months’ supervision by a probation officer prior to filing a petition to have a juvenile adjudicated delinquent); consent decrees, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6340 (providing for up to on^year of supervision by a probation officer after the filing of a petition but prior to an adjudication of delinquency); and continuation of disposition hearings, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6341(e) (allowing a court to continue a disposition hearing for a “reasonable period to receive reports and other evidence bearing on the disposition or the need for treatment, supervision or rehabilitation”). To the extent that <em>In the Interest of K.B. </em>holds that a sentence of probation is not a final order, it was -wrongly decided and is expressly overruled.</p>

      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>With respect to the second issue, appellant contends that the trial court improperly restricted cross-examination by preventing defense counsel from asking Officer Perez on cross-examination if he had been drinking prior to observing the attempted burglary. A trial court has broad discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination, and rulings doing so will not be reversed absent a showing that the court abused that discretion. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, nothing in the record indicates that it was Officer Perez who was mistaken in the <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>race of the lookout.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Second, appellant emphasizes a discrepancy in Officer Perez’s testimony that he believed that two of the suspects who were apprehended were returned to the scene of the crime for identification at the same time, while the officers who apprehended those suspects testified that they did not recall seeing any other suspects at the time of the respective identifications.

This ruling, however, presents a practical problem with respect to the status of the case in the common pleas court while an appeal from such an order is pending. The general rule stated in Pa.R.A.P. 1701(a), is that “after an appeal is taken ... a trial court may ... no longer proceed further in the matter.” At the very least, it is far from clear that any of the exceptions to this rule would apply to allow the court to “proceed further” and modify the probation order so long as the appeal was pending, thus rendering the sixty day review of no effect. Hence, I believe the Court should clarify the application of the appellate rules in this context by specifically allowing the court to modify a disposition while an appeal from an adjudication of delinquency is pending.</p>
