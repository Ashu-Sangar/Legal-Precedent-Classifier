    <p id="b729-6" data-blocks='[["BL_729.5",729,[244,1252,1159,953]]]'>In <em>Beatty, </em>despite the concept of a unified judicial system, this Court preferred a traditional jurisdictional analysis for purposes of Section 110. In that case, we held that a conviction for a summary offense does not bar a subsequent prosecution for aggravated assault arising from a single criminal episode because, we held, the two offenses were not within the jurisdiction of a single court. We reasoned that the summary offense was a matter within the original jurisdiction of the district justice whereas the aggravated assault was within the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas. In reaching our conclusion, we recognized, however, the concurrent jurisdiction of the court of common pleas over summary offenses pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 931(b). Nevertheless, we construed the phrase “within the jurisdiction of a single court” to give effect to the traditional division of labor in our court system, casting the court of common pleas in the role of reviewing tribunal as opposed to the court of original jurisdiction for summary offenses.</p>

I do not disagree with the Majority’s conclusion that vicinage is a matter of venue. I, however, disagree with the Majority’s conclusion that, notwithstanding <em>Boyle, </em>the locus of a crime is a matter of venue and not jurisdiction for Section 110 purposes. The Majority correctly describes venue as the right of a party to have an action brought and heard in a particular locality, and jurisdiction as the competency of a court to hear and decide controversies in the nature of the matter involved. <em>McGinley v.
