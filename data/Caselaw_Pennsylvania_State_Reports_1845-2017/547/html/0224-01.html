Between September 10, 1990 and May 8, 1991, she was hospitalized for lead poisoning on three separate occasions. She also received outpatient therapy for lead poisoning in August 1991, and again in June 1992. During this time, she resided at only one home, located at 2840 West Stiles Street in Philadelphia. This residence, which had been rented by Skip-worth’s guardian, Pandora Williams (“Williams”), was estimated to have been built circa 1870. Testing of Skipworth’s <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>residence revealed the presence of lead-based paint at various locations throughout the home.</p>

(“LIA”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellants alleged that Skipworth suffered physical and neuropsychological injuries as a result of lead poisoning from the lead paint in her home. Appellants stipulated that they could not identify the manufacturer of the lead pigment which Skipworth ingested, and admitted that they could not identify when such pigment was made, sold, or applied to her home. Appellants, however, alleged that they had identified and joined in this action substantially all of the manufacturers of lead pigment used in residential house paint from 1870 until production of lead pigment ceased in 1977. Appellants thus proceeded against the pigment manufacturers and LIA (collectively referred to as “Appellees”) by invoking theories of collective liability, namely market share liability, alternate liability, conspiracy, and concert of action.</p>

A sharply divided California Supreme Court was the first court to adopt this theory of liability. <em>See Sindell v.

The <em>Sindell </em>case involved a plaintiff who developed cancer as a result of her mother’s ingestion during pregnancy of diethylstilbestrol (“DES”), a drug with an identical formula manufactured by several different companies. Because of the inability to trace the source of the DES due to its fungible nature and the long time lapse between its sale and the development of health problems, the plaintiff was unable to identify, through no fault of her own, the manufacturer of the DES ingested by her mother.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[241,986,1158,1063]]]'>The <em>Sindell </em>court concluded that the plaintiff need not identify which particular manufacturer made the DES ingested by her mother, and held that the manufacturers of the product identical to the one which harmed plaintiff were liable in shares proportional to their share of the market at the time plaintiffs mother ingested the drug, regardless of actual causation. <em>Id. </em>at 612, <a href="/citations/?q=607%20P.2d%20924" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="607 P.2d 924">607 P.2d at 937</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20132" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="163 Cal.

The <em>Sindell </em>court stated that market share liability is appropriate where the following factors are present: all the named defendants are potential tortfeasors; the allegedly harmful products are identical and share the same defective qualities (or were “fungible”); the plaintiff is unable to identify which defendant caused her injury through no fault of her own; and, substantially all of the manufacturers which created the defective products during the relevant time are named as defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 611-612, <a href="/citations/?q=607%20P.2d%20924" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="607 P.2d 924">607 P.2d at 936-937</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20132" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="163 Cal.

Such a comparison has revealed to us two major factors which compel us to conclude that adoption of market share liability in the context of a lead pigment case would unacceptably distort liability. First, the relevant time period in question is far more extensive than the relevant time period in a DES case. In this case, Appellants cannot identify any particular application, or applications, of lead paint which have caused Skipworth’s health problems. Thus, they “pinpoint” a more than one hundred year period from the date the house was built until the lead paint ceased being sold for residential purposes as the relevant time period. In contrast, the relevant time period in a DES case is necessarily limited to the nine months that the patient ingesting the product was pregnant.</p>

Over the one hundred year period at issue, several of the pigment manufacturers entered and left the lead paint market. R.R. at 336a-349a; 578a-579a. Thus, applica<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>tion of the market share theory to this situation would virtually ensure that certain pigment manufacturers would be held hable where they could not possibly have been a potential tortfeasor; therefore, the first prong of the <em>Sindell </em>test would not be met.</p>
    <p id="b417-4" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[238,618,1157,532]]]'>The second factor which persuades us that adoption of market share liability here would be inappropriate is that lead paint, as opposed to DES, is not a fungible product. All DES used for treatment of pregnant women was manufactured according to an identical formula and presented an identical risk of harm. <em>Sindell, </em><a href="/cal-3d/26/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="26 Cal. 3d 588" data-case-ids="2263750" data-case-paths="/cal-3d/26/0588-01">26 Cal.3d at 611</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=607%20P.2d%20924" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="607 P.2d 924">607 P.2d at 936</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20132" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="163 Cal.

Uncontested evidence shows that differing formulae of lead paint result in differing levels of bioavailability<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> of the lead. R.R. at 313a-314a. Because of differences in bioavailability, a child who ingests dust or chips of lead paint containing equal amounts of lead “derived from two lead paints will <em>not </em>generally develop equal elevation in internal lead level from the two paints. Rather, more highly bioavailable lead has a greater impact than lead in less bioavailable form.” R.R. at 314a-315a (emphasis in the original).

Yet, in this case, apportioning liability based upon a manufacturer defendant’s share of the market (even if it were possible to obtain an accurate statistic considering the lengthy relevant time period at question) would not serve to approximate that defendant’s responsibility for injuries caused by its lead paint. For example, a manufacturer whose lead product had a lower bioavailability than average would have caused less damage than its market share would indicate.

The California <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>Supreme Court held that where the evidence showed that the two defendants negligently shot at about the same time and that the pellets from one of their guns struck the plaintiff, the burden of proving which defendants’ shot struck the plaintiff shifted to the defendants; the court further held that in the absence of further evidence, judgment could be properly entered against both defendants. <em><a href="/citations/?q=199%20P.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="199 P.2d 1">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=199%20P.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="199 P.2d 1">at 86-88</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20P.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="199 P.2d 1">199 P.2d at 4-5</a>.</p>
