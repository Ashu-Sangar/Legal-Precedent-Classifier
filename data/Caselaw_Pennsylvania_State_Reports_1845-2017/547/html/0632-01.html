The truck was not registered and it had not been used on the highway since 1976. On July 28, 1993, Robert Swartz, a visitor at the Trout farm, was injured when the truck lunged forward while Louis Trout, who was working on the truck, attempted to start it.</p>

Union Mutual refused to pay the claim, asserting that the truck which injured Mr. Swartz was not covered under the terms of the policy because it was subject to registration. Union Mutual argued that even though the truck was not registered, it was subject to registration under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1302(10)(ii), which requires a biennial certificate of exemption.

    <p id="b820-4" data-blocks='[["BL_820.4",820,[274,795,1160,631]]]'>Section 1301 and the Acting Director’s letter notwithstanding, the trial court held that the truck was exempt from registration when the owner applies for and receives a certificate of exemption. Since the Trouts had never applied for the certificate of exemption, the court concluded that the truck was not exempted from motor vehicle registration, and the insurance company, therefore, was not liable under the terms of the insurance contract. In reaching this result, the trial court relied upon <em>Winkelman v. PFRACP, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="418 Pa. Super. 439" data-case-ids="916902" data-case-paths="/pa-super/418/0439-01">418 Pa.Super. 439</a>, <a href="/pa-super/418/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="418 Pa.

    <p id="b820-5" data-blocks='[["BL_820.5",820,[273,1446,1154,743]]]'>The Superior Court, in a memorandum opinion, reversed. It held that the truck in this case was never operated on the highway, and it was not, therefore, subject to registration. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1301. The Superior Court distinguished the <em>Winkelman </em>case from the present case by noting that in <em>Winkelman </em>the unregistered vehicle was an automobile, which clearly is not exempt from registration. Moreover, the issue in this case, according to the Superior Court, is whether the Trouts’ truck qualifies as a motor vehicle which is not subject to registration because of its use, not whether the Trouts were required to obtain an exemption certificate. As the Superior Court read § 1301, the truck was not subject to registration, and the bodily injury, therefore, was covered under the terms of the policy.</p>
    <p id="b820-6" data-blocks='[["BL_820.6",820,[271,2212,1155,153]],["BL_821.1",821,[253,316,1156,524]]]'>On appeal to this court, Union Mutual argues that the Trouts’ truck cannot be exempt from the requirement of registration unless a certificate of exemption is applied for, <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>since the Motor Vehicle Code defines a farm truck as one determined by the Department of Transportation as used exclusively for agricultural purposes,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and in the absence of a certificate of exemption, the vehicle cannot be designated as a farm truck (and therefore exempt from registration). Secondly, Union Mutual asserts that § 1301 does not excuse the Trouts from the need to register their truck because the Superior Court in <em>Winkelman </em>has determined that all vehicles, regardless of their use, must be registered unless they fall within an authorized exemption.</p>
    <p id="b821-4" data-blocks='[["BL_821.4",821,[252,863,1158,687]]]'>The key issue in the case, as identified both by the trial court and Union Mutual, is whether the truck which caused the injuries is “subject to motor vehicle registration.” The answer to this question and to the other matters raised by Union Mutual is revealed by an examination of the two provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code which apply to this case, §§ 1301 and 1302. The sense of § 1301 is that whenever motor vehicles are operated on the highways, they must, subject to the exceptions of § 1302, be registered. The sense of § 1302 is that farm vehicles and eighteen other classes of vehicles are exempt from the usual requirement that whenever a motor vehicle is operated on the highway, registration is required.</p>
    <p id="b821-5" data-blocks='[["BL_821.5",821,[250,1582,1162,686]],["BL_822.1",822,[270,316,1158,209]]]'>Pursuant to the terms of these statutes, in determining whether a motor vehicle must be registered, the first question is whether the vehicle is operated or moved on a highway. If it is, it must be registered unless it falls within one of the exceptions enumerated in § 1302. If it is not operated on a highway, it need not be registered, because § 1301 requires registration only when the vehicle is operated or moved on a highway. Thus, if the owner of an automobile has it raised on blocks in his garage and the car is not moved on a highway, it need not be registered under the plain terms of § 1301 <em>even if it does not qualify under any of the exceptions of § 1302. </em>The fact that it is not subject to an exclusion from registration pursuant to the terms of § 1302 is of no moment, for it need <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>not even be registered — much less qualify for an exclusion — if it does not operate on a highway. Insofar as <em>Winkelman v. PFRACP, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="418 Pa. Super. 439" data-case-ids="916902" data-case-paths="/pa-super/418/0439-01">418 Pa.Super. 439</a>, <a href="/pa-super/418/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="418 Pa.

    <p id="b822-4" data-blocks='[["BL_822.4",822,[270,581,1155,318]]]'>The same analysis applies to the farm truck in this case. The trial court believed that because the owners did not apply for the biennial exemption called for by § 1302(10), the truck was not exempt from registration. We disagree. The truck never left the farm. Since it did not operate upon the highways, it need not be registered by operation of § 1301.</p>
    <p id="b822-5" data-blocks='[["BL_822.5",822,[268,935,1155,642]]]'>It should be noted that this analysis does not read § 1302 out of existence, for § 1302 comes into play when the farm truck is operated on the highways, e.g., between parts of the same farm, or different farms located not more than ten miles apart, or when delivering farm supplies, or obtaining service on the truck. In those cases, § 1302 comes into operation and the owner of a farm truck must either register the truck or apply for the biennial certificate of exemption for a farm truck. In this case, the truck did not leave the farm. There was, therefore, no requirement of registration, and a fortiori, no requirement of application for the biennial certificate of exemption.</p>
    <p id="b822-6" data-blocks='[["BL_822.6",822,[267,1613,1155,423]]]'>Since the insurance policy provides that the insurer is liable for bodily injury when the accident occurs upon the premises during the maintenance of a motor vehicle “if it is not subject to motor vehicle registration because of its type or use,” and the truck in this case was being repaired on the Trout farm and was not subject to registration because it was used exclusively on the farm, the accident involving Mr. Swartz was covered under the terms of the policy.</p>
