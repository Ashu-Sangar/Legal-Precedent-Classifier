Appellant alleges that the imposition of the business taxes and licensing <a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>requirements impermissibly interferes with this Court’s constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law; and, accordingly, the imposition of the taxes and licensing requirements is unconstitutional. In granting the City’s preliminary objections, the trial court found that appellant was barred from bringing this civil action because he failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. The Commonwealth Court affirmed. Because we find that appellant prematurely filed this action without allowing the City an opportunity to commence the administrative process and therefore failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies, we need not reach the constitutional issue. Therefore, we affirm the Commonwealth Court.</p>

There is no indication in the record that the City took any further action to enforce the tax and license provisions such as issuing a notice of taxes due or a notice of delinquent taxes. Appellant filed a declaratory judgment action against the City seeking a ruling that the tax and license provisions as applied to him are unconstitutional. In his complaint, appellant argues that the City’s requirement that non-resident attorneys obtain a business privilege license impermissibly encroaches upon this Court’s regulation of the practice of law under the Pennsylvania Constitution. He also alleges that his appearances in Philadelphia courts do not rise to the level of minimum contacts required to give the City jurisdiction to require a non-resident to obtain a business privilege license. As a result, appellant sought an injunction to enjoin the city from imposing the taxes on him through civil or criminal procedures or from preventing him from appearing in the Philadelphia courts without a business privilege license.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
