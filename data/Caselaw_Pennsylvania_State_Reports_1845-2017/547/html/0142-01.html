The United States Supreme Court in <em>LaRue </em>stated that the Twenty-first Amendment required that California’s prohibition be given an added presumption in favor of its validity. The United States Supreme Court in <em>44 Liquormart </em>stated that the same result would have been reached in <em>LaRue </em>even had there been no reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment by the Court. <em>See 44 Liquormart, </em>517 U.S. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 1513-14, <a href="/us/517/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="116 S.

These sections of the opinion set forth the factual and procedural background of the appeal, the Court’s discussion of the Twenty-first Amendment and holding regarding the Twenty-first Amendment, and the Court’s holding regarding the First Amendment. The remaining sections of <em>44 Liquormart, </em>in which the reasoning leading to the holding regarding the First Amendment is set forth, did not gamer the votes of a majority of the Court, and in fact, generated several separate opinions: an opinion by Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; an opinion by Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; and an opinion by Justice O’Connor, who was joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment.</p>
