On February 15,1994, Appellant was found guilty by a District Justice. On March 17, 1994, Appellant, acting as his own counsel, filed a notice of appeal for a <em>de novo </em>trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County. That court originally scheduled the trial for May 25, 1994. On May 24, 1994, Appellant, still acting as his own counsel, filed a written motion for continuance of the trial. Appellant failed to comply with the Lebanon County local rule of court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which required that he provide a self-addressed stamped envelope so that he could receive a copy of the court’s signed order granting or denying the motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The motion for continuance was granted and the hearing was rescheduled to June 29, 1994.

Therefore, the Clerk of Courts has a mandatory duty to furnish a copy of orders by mail or personal delivery to each party or attorney. Here, the Clerk of Courts failed to comply with this mandatory duty. The trial court found in essence that this mandatory duty imposed upon the Clerk of Courts by Pa.R.Crim.P. 9025 was rendered non-mandatory by Appellant’s failure to comply with the local rule. The trial court ruled “[u]nder our local rules it is Defendant’s [i.e., Appellant’s] duty to take affirmative action, either by enclosing a stamped addressed envelope or by coming to the Clerk of Courts’ office, to determine whether his motion has been granted or denied----” <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, </em>No. 94-10220, slip op. at 2 (C.P. Court of Lebanon County, Criminal Division Oct. 19, 1994). This interpretation of the local rule clearly renders the local rule inconsistent with Rule 9025. The trial court’s interpretation of the rule shifts the burden of “furnishing a copy of the order, by mail or personal delivery” from the Clerk of Courts, upon whom Rule 9025 places the burden, to the movant. As this is inconsistent with Rule 9025, the local rule as interpreted by the lower courts cannot be given effect. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 6(b)(1) (“Local rules shall not be inconsistent with any general rule of the Supreme court or any act of the Assembly.”); <em>Feingold v.

Reyes, </em><a href="/pa/531/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="531 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1834401" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0072-01">531 Pa. 72</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="531 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1834401" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0072-01">611 A.2d 190</a> (1992) instructive. In <em>Reyes, </em>a local rule permitted defendants to file a pretrial omnibus motion to suppress with the Clerk of Quarter Sessions in Philadelphia, who then, according to the local rule/custom, placed a copy of the motion in a bin for the District Attorney. Apparently, someone from the District Attorney’s office would pick up the motions left in that bin once or twice a week. In <em>Reyes, </em>the Commonwealth alleged that no service of the motion to suppress had been made upon the Commonwealth and that it had no notice of the motion, and, therefore, it was unprepared to argue the merits <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>of the motion. Due to delay in trial caused by the Commonwealth being unprepared to argue the suppression motion^ the Defendant moved for dismissal based upon a violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100. The trial court dismissed the charges, finding that the Commonwealth did not act with due diligence as required by Rule 1100. The trial court relied upon its local rule, reasoning that because the local rule was complied with, it is presumed that the Commonwealth received notice of the motion to suppress in the absence of proof that the local rule had not been complied with. This court reversed, reasoning that Pa.R.Crim.P. 9023(b) squarely places the burden of service upon the moving party and “[b]y contrast, the local custom ... shifts the burden of effectuating service and the giving of notice from the movant and places that burden on the Clerk of Courts, who gratuitously acts as the District Attorney’s mailbox. This is unacceptable practice and must cease forthwith.” <em>Reyes, </em><a href="/pa/531/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="531 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1834401" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0072-01">531 Pa. at 77</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="531 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1834401" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0072-01">611 A.2d at 193</a>. Likewise here, Pa.R.Crim.P. 9025 places the burden of furnishing a copy of the order by mail or personal delivery squarely upon the Clerk of Courts; the lower courts’ interpretation of the local rule clearly shifts the burden to the movant. As <em>Reyes </em>found such a shifting of the burden unacceptable as being inconsistent with the statewide rule, so likewise in this case, the shifting of burden is inconsistent with Rule 9025 and, as such, is not enforceable.</p>

From our reading of the local rule, it is not at all evident that the way in which the lower courts interpreted the local rule in this case is compelled by the language of the rule. Indeed, the local rule is silent as to the effect of noncompliance. There is not one word of the local rule which absolves the Clerk of Courts from its mandatory duty to furnish a copy of the order to each party or their attorney. Accordingly, we do not hold that the local rule as written conflicts with Rule 9025; rather, we hold that the local rule as <em>interpreted and applied in this case </em>conflicts with Rule 9025. The lower courts interpreted the local rule as absolving the Clerk of Courts from fulfilling its mandatory duty to furnish a copy of the order when the local <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>rule is not complied with. As the lower courts did not create the mandatory duty, they are not empowered to negate the mandatory duty by means of enacting or interpreting local rules. In other words, in the absence of some general rule to the contrary, courts are not prevented from requiring that litigants provide addresses or envelopes or even to bear the costs of the court associated with sending orders, etc.; however, courts may not render void mandatory duties imposed upon them or their employees or the parties by statewide rules as a price for non-compliance with a local rule.</p>
