In <em>In re: King Properties, </em>supra, this court addressed the question of whether a forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Forfeitures Act is an excessive fine under either the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or under Article I, § 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. We held that for purposes of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 13 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania (the Excessive Fines Clauses), the Controlled Substances Forfeitures Act was punitive and that whether a forfeiture is an excessive fine does not depend upon the value of the thing forfeited, but on the relationship of the offense to the property which is forfeit.

Since the trial court properly instructed the jury on the Commonwealth’s burden and the jury subsequently determined that the property was used to facilitate Reitz’s illegal drug enterprise, the jury’s determination was tantamount to a determination that the forfeiture was not excessive.
