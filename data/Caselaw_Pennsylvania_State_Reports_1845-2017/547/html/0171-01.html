He enlisted the aid of a friend, Stanley Herzog, believing that his plan would require at least two persons in order to ensure that all persons who might be in the bank at the time of the robbery could be executed before an alarm could be pressed. It was also crucial to appellant’s plan that no eyewitness survive. The East Allen Township branch of the <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>First National Bank of Bath was selected as the target. Preliminary to the actual robbery, appellant and Herzog broke into the bank during the early morning hours of May 29, 1986, to ascertain the nature of the layout of the bank and the nature of its security system. During this burglary, the two men vandalized the bank in an attempt to deceive the police as to the purpose of the break-in. Appellant and Herzog then purchased handguns, appellant selecting a nine millimeter handgun for maximum ‘firepower.’ They practiced for the robbery by shooting at human silhouette targets. Appellant also took measures to estimate the time it would take the police to respond in the event the robbery would be reported while in progress.</blockquote>

Appellant, using a pay telephone, communicated a bomb threat to the airport located across the street from the State Police barracks closest to the targeted bank. He also telephoned the bomb threat to an Allentown radio station as well as the Allentown police. Appellant and Herzog then drove to the bank, entered, concealing their handguns, and each approached tellers’ windows for the ostensible purpose of obtaining change. Appellant shot both tellers in the back as they were attempting to comply with the request. One, Janice Confer, fell to the floor wounded. The other, Hazel Evans, was killed instantly. Appellant next fired two shots at the branch manager, Marcia Hauser, but missed. He then shot across the lobby at a bank official, Jane Hartman, and a customer with whom she had been conversing. The customer was wounded but survived. Ms. Hartman dropped to the floor and hid under her desk. Appellant then ran across the lobby and shot her twice in the back, killing her instantly. In the meantime, Herzog had entered Ms. Hauser’s office and shot her through the head. She survived but is permanently disabled.</blockquote>

In accordance with his master plan, he shot her again in the back, the bullet penetrating her heart and lungs and causing her death.

He also expressed concern that professional legal representation would hamper the prosecution’s case against him. The trial court conducted a thorough colloquy concerning Appel’s waiver of his right to counsel, and Appel indicated throughout the colloquy that he understood his rights and wanted to waive his right to counsel. Before accepting Appel’s waiver, the trial court ordered a competency evaluation.</p>
    <p id="b363-7" data-blocks='[["BL_363.7",363,[246,1528,1157,642]]]'>Janet Schwartz, M.D., performed the first psychiatric evaluation of Appel in 1986.

Before examining Appel, Dr. Schwartz met with John Weaver, a social worker for Northampton County’s Mental Health and Mental Retardation Unit, who had interviewed Appel and obtained a detailed social history. She also spoke with the stand-by counsel appointed by the trial court to represent Appel, and she reviewed various documents including police reports and Appel’s arrest record provided to her by the District Attorney’s Office.</p>

Lastly, Dr. Schwartz found no evidence of any psychosis nor any evidence of mental disorders that would affect Appel’s ability to function in court. When Dr. Schwartz asked Appel about the facts of the robbery and murders, he said that he conceived the idea about a month earlier, and that it was the fastest way to get a large sum of money. In her report to the trial court, dated June 17, 1986, which was made part of the record of the trial court, Dr. Schwartz stated the following:</p>

After reviewing Dr. Schwartz’ competency evaluation, the trial court accepted Appel’s waiver of his right to counsel. The trial court appointed two members of the Northampton County public defender’s office to serve as stand-by counsel, and the court made it clear that if Appel changed his mind, the court would appoint counsel to represent him. Appel said that he was a graduate of Blooms-burg State College with a B.A in psychology, having received his degree on May 10, 1980, and that he clearly understood everything that the judge was stating to him.</p>

During closing argument, the Commonwealth urged the court to sentence Appel to death. When again questioned concerning his position, Appel repeated his request for the death penalty. After deliberation, the trial court returned sentences of death for each of the three counts of first degree murder, finding that the Commonwealth had proved the following two aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) Appel killed the victims to prevent their testimony against him in a criminal proceeding, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5); and (2) Appel committed the killings in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6).

She testified that Appel was always talking about money, and that he once told her that he could kill everybody at a bank and get $15,000. Before the robbery, he told her that he was going to rob a bank and kill everyone so there would be no witnesses.

Appel also told her that he made her the beneficiary of his life insurance, and that he wanted her to get the insurance proceeds.

We reject Appel’s argument that standby counsel must ignore the pleadings of their criminal defendant clients and undertake an exhaustive survey of the client’s personal background in an attempt to establish incompetency. In a case where other facts do not suggest incompetency, we will not impose such a duty upon stand-by defense counsel. When two qualified psychiatrists find a defendant competent, and where the defendant insists he is competent, we will not hold that stand-by counsel should conduct an extensive investigation to uncover evidence of incompetency.</p>
