On the evening of December 11, 1993, Appellant and another man, Rasheed Miller, followed the decedent, Zachary Jackson, as he drove <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>through the streets of West Philadelphia. Jackson, a shopkeeper, had just left his store, and Appellant and Miller believed he was carrying a large sum of money. Jackson eventually stopped at an intersection in response to a red light. At that moment, Miller, who was driving, blocked off Jackson’s car. Appellant ordered Jackson out of his car at gunpoint, demanded money, and began frisking Jackson. When Appellant looked away briefly, Jackson tried to flee, but fell when Appellant shot him four times in the lower back and legs. Appellant again tried to search for money, but Jackson fought him off. Appellant then retrieved another gun from his car and shot Jackson once in the abdomen. Appellant and Miller then fled the scene. Jackson died the next day. An eyewitness, Denise Grant, viewed the entire episode.</p>

At 2:30 p.m. on December 31, 1993, the police received information from a robbery suspect implicating Appellant and Miller in the Jackson killing. Consequently, at 8:45 a.m. on January 1, 1994, Appellant was transported to the offices of the Homicide Unit for questioning concerning the Jackson case. He was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, by 1:55 p.m. that same day, he had confessed to killing Jackson. Miller, who was also being held on unrelated charges, also confessed on January 1, 1994 to his involvement in the case. Further, the weapon Appellant admitted using to shoot Jackson the fifth and final time was later recovered.

The decision whether to sever the trials of co-defendants is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent a manifest abuse of that discretion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Wharton, </em><a href="/pa/530/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="530 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1833002" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0127-01">530 Pa. 127</a>, 142, <a href="/pa/530/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="530 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1833002" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0127-01">607 A.2d 710</a>, 717 (1992). The decisive question is whether Appellant was prejudiced by the trial court’s decision. <em>See Wharton, </em><a href="/pa/530/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="530 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1833002" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0127-01">530 Pa. at 142</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="530 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1833002" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0127-01">607 A.2d at 717-18</a>. The burden is on Appellant to establish such prejudice. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em><a href="/pa/529/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="529 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1831156" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0320-01">529 Pa. 320</a>, 331, <a href="/pa/529/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="529 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1831156" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0320-01">603 A.2d 568</a>, 573 (1992).</p>
