PECO is required to report regularly to the PUC on a wide variety of statistical and performance information regarding its compliance with the regulations as interpreted by the PUC. Like other utilities, PECO is required to undergo a comprehensive management audit at the direction of the PUC approximately every ten years. The most recent audit was conducted by Ernst &amp; Young. The report issued in 1991 recommended changes in twenty-two areas, including criticisms and recommendations regarding PECO’s credit and collection function.</p>
    <p id="b787-5" data-blocks='[["BL_787.4",787,[246,864,1156,580]]]'>Two trustees, on behalf of a group of minority shareholders, made a demand on PECO, alleging wrongdoing by some PECO directors and officers. This Katzman demand, made in May, 1993, asserted that the delinquent officers had damaged PECO by mismanaging the credit and collection function, particularly as to the collection of overdue accounts. The shareholders demanded that PECO authorize litigation against the wrongdoers to recover monetary damages sustained by PECO. At its meeting of June 28, 1993, PECO’s board responded by creating a special litigation committee to investigate the Katzman allegations.</p>

The <em>Cuker </em>complaint, filed in July, 1993, made the same allegations as those in the Katzman demand, with extensive references to the Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young audit report. The <em>Cuker </em>complaint was filed before the special litigation committee had begun its substantive work of investigating and evaluating the Katzman demand, so the committee’s work encompassed both the Katzman and Cuker matters. Only the twelve nondefendant members of the PECO board acted to create the special committee, which consisted of three outside directors who had never been employed by PECO and who were not named in the Katzman demand or the <em>Cuker </em>complaint.</p>

It also concluded that the defendant officers “exercised sound business judgment in managing the affairs of the company” and that their actions “were reasonably calculated to further the best interests of the company.” The three-hundred-page report identified numerous factors underlying the conclusions of the special committee. Significant considerations included the utility’s efforts before the PUC to raise electricity rates in consequence of the expense of new nuclear generating plants. Other factors were the impact of PUC regulations limiting wintertime termination of residential service and other limitations on the use of collection techniques such as terminations of overdue customers, particularly with a large population of poverty level users among PECO’s customer base. These considerations were supported by PUC documents which criticized PECO for aggressive and excessive terminations in recent years. The report of the special litigation committee also described how PECO’s management had been attentive to the credit and collection function, with constant efforts to improve performance in that area. According to the report, limiting the use of terminations as a collection technique was a sound business judgment, reducing antagonism between the PUC and PECO and resulting in rate increases which produced revenue far in excess of the losses attributed to nonaggressive collection tactics. The report concluded that proceeding with a derivative suit based largely on findings of the Ernst &amp; Young audit would not be in the best interests of PECO.</p>

The press of market forces ... will more effectively serve the interests of all participants than will an error-prone judicial process.” The business judgment rule “expresses a sensible policy of judicial noninterference with business decisions made in circumstances free from serious conflicts of interest between management, which makes the decisions, and the corporation’s shareholders. Not only do businessmen know more about business than judges do, but competition in the product and labor markets and in the market for corporate control provides sufficient punishment for businessmen who commit more than their share of business mistakes.” “The fact is that liability is rarely imposed upon corporate directors or officers simply for bad judgment and this reluctance to impose liability for unsuccessful business decisions has been doctrinally labeled the business judgment rule.” Shareholders challenging the wisdom of a business decision taken by management must overcome the business judgment rule. “For efficiency reasons, corporate decisionmakers should be permitted to act decisively and with relative freedom from a judge’s or jury’s subsequent second-guessing.

Passage of the Business Corporation Law of 1933, however, merely modified the circumstances in which directors might be held liable; it did not vitiate the principles behind the business judgment rule. In other words, although a statute may alter the threshold circumstances which preclude application of the business judgment rule, a court must apply the business judgment rule if <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>shareholders fail to prove those threshold circumstances. Stated differently, if a court makes a preliminary determination that a business decision was made under proper circumstances, however that concept is currently defined, then the business judgment rule prohibits the court from going further and examining the merits of the underlying business decision. Whatever the effect of the Business Corporation Law of 1933, as amended, 15 P.S. § 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(repealed), the Business Corporation Law of 1988, 15 Pa.C.S. § 1101 <em>et seq., </em>the Directors’ Liability Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8361 <em>et seq. </em>(repealed), or the General Association Act Amendments Act, 15 Pa.C.S. § 511 <em>et seq., </em>application of the appropriate statutory standard is a preliminary question which must be decided before the merits of the underlying decision may be litigated. In this case, therefore, unless respondents can establish improper conduct by PECO’s board of directors (fraud, self-dealing, violation of statutory duties, etc.), the board’s decisions regarding PECO’s credit and collection function are beyond the scope of review of any court.</p>

Such business decisions of a board of directors are, unless taken in violation of a common law or statutory duty, within the scope of the business judgment rule. It follows that the court of common pleas erred when it held that the business judgment rule is not the law of Pennsylvania, and the Superior Court erred when it denied review rather than correcting the trial court by ruling on the first question certified under 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b), set forth in footnote one, supra.</p>

Without considering the merits of the <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>action, a court should determine the validity of the board’s decision to terminate the litigation; if that decision was made in accordance with the appropriate standards, then the court should dismiss the derivative action prior to litigation on the merits.</p>

If they do, the court will never proceed to an examination of the merits of the challenged decisions, for that is precisely what the business judgment rule prohibits. In order to make the business judgment rule meaningful, the preliminary examination should be limited and precise so as to minimize judicial involvement when application of the business judgment rule is warranted.</p>

Third, the principles set forth by the ALI are generally consistent with Pennsylvania precedent. Fourth, although the <em>ALI Principles </em>incorporate much of the law of New York and Delaware, other states with extensive corporate jurisprudence, the <em>ALI Principles </em>better serve the needs of Pennsylvania. Although New York law parallels Pennsylvania law in many respects, it does not set forth any procedures to govern the review of corporate decisions relating to derivative litigation, and this omission would fail to satisfy the needs evident in this case. Delaware law permits a court in some cases (“demand excused” cases) to apply its own business judgment in the review process when deciding to honor the directors’ decision to terminate derivative litigation. In our view, this is a defect which could eviscerate the business judgment rule and contradict a long line of Pennsylvania precedents. Delaware law also fails to provide a procedural framework for judicial review of corporate decisions under the business judgment rule.</p>
