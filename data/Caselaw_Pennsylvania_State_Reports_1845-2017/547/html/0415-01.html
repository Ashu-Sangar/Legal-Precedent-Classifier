While there, she was injured when she fell off an x-ray table that had a loose foot stand. The Court held that the Workmen’s Compensation Act did not preclude her from commencing an action against the hospital. The decision was based on the fact that there was no reason to distinguish the employee from any other patient who had been injured during the course of treatment in an emergency room open to the general public. <em>Tatrai, </em>however, is distinguishable from the instant case.

Snyder’s lawsuit is based upon a hospital’s negligent medical treatment. Like in <em>Tatrai </em>Snyder sought medical treatment at the hospital where she worked. The hospital holds itself out to the public as a medical service provider. It owes a duty of care to all of its patients. There is no basis to distinguish Snyder from any other member of the public injured during the course of treatment. Unlike in <em>Budzichowski </em>Snyder could have received treatment at the hospital even if she was not an employee. Because Snyder’s injury arose from a relationship separate and distinct from that of employer-employee and implicated different duties than an employer’s duties to its employees, the Workmen’s Compensation Act is inapplicable. <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>

The hospital dealt with Snyder in the dual capacities of employer and medical provider. Thus, Snyder may sue the hospital and Nurse Galozzo for negligent treatment.</p>

The employee claimed that the employer was liable for negligence under the dual capacity doctrine since it had independent duties as a product manufacturer. We held that worker’s compensation benefits were the employee’s exclusive remedy because the injury occurred while he was performing a work-related task. <em><a href="/pa/519/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="519 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1813560" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0274-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/519/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="519 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1813560" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0274-01">at 276-77</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="519 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1813560" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0274-01">546 A.2d at 1121</a>.</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[232,1421,1155,693]]]'>This Court’s holding in <em>Heath </em>and other cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">3</a> that the dual capacity doctrine does not apply where an employee is injured while working is consistent with the analysis in <em>Tatrai. </em>When an employee is working, he is dealing with his employer solely within an employer-employee relationship. If this were not true, an employee could sue his employer for a slip and fall injury at work, for example, and claim that the employer had an independent duty as a possessor of land. This result would render the Workmen’s Compensation Act meaningless. The dual capacity doctrine applies where employees deal with their employers outside of their employment. Only then are the parties in a relationship other than employer-employee and different duties apply.</p>

Snyder’s contraction of tuberculosis was a work-related injury and her exclusive remedy for that injury was worker’s compensation benefits. Her subsequent adrenal gland failure was the result of malpractice. If Snyder had sought treatment of her tuberculosis from a third party, she could recover for malpractice. The hospital or its insurer would have been entitled to subrogation for any benefits paid under the Act for negligent treatment. <em>See Powell v. Sacred Heart Hospital, </em><a href="/pa-commw/99/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="99 Pa. Commw. 575" data-case-ids="1350917" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/99/0575-01">99 Pa.

The hospital is similarly responsible for malpractice under the dual capacity doctrine. Snyder should be able to recover in tort and the hospital would be credited for any benefits paid under the Act for its negligent treatment.</p>

If it did, employers providing medical care could shield themselves from tort liability by establishing such programs. The record establishes that the hospital tested, monitored and treated members of the public for tuberculosis. Snyder received the same care as other patients and should be afforded the same remedies for negligence. Thus, the Superior Court’s decision should be reversed and this case should be remanded to the Superior Court to decide the remaining issues raised by Appellees on appeal.</p>
