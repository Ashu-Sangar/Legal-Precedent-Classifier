I would reverse the decision of the Superior Court and hold that 18 Pa.C.S. § 102 requires the Commonwealth to present evidence of the law of the jurisdiction where the crimes underlying conspiracy and solicitation charges were to be committed. This evidence is necessary to establish that Appellant was in fact conspiring to commit or soliciting the commission of <em>a crime, </em>as defined in the jurisdiction where the offense was to occur.</p>

Appellant subsequently offered to pay for Small’s airfare and accommodations if he would accompany her to India and “harm her husband.” Smalls declined. He later informed his supervisor of the offer, and was instructed to discover whether Appellant was serious about executing her plan. After Appellant re<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>peatedly requested Small’s assistance, her telephone lines were tapped. Conversations were recorded dining which Appellant stated that her husband had stolen five million dollars from her, that she wanted someone to travel to India to locate him to retrieve the money and, if unsuccessfid, to “hit him hard” and give him the “third degree.”</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[262,647,1158,475]]]'>A few days later, Smalls, wearing a body wire, and Trooper Steven Davis, a purported “contact,” met with Appellant in her hotel room. She reiterated that she wanted her husband located for the purposes of finding the stolen money and that she wanted him “hurt.” She also wanted her brother-in-law, her daughter’s boyfriend, and her business manager to receive “similar treatment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> She agreed to pay Davis $10,000, and stated that she would make the flight arrangements for July 26,1993.</p>

She further stated that she wanted to meet with Smalls and Davis at her hotel room to supply them with additional information. When the troopers arrived at the hotel, Appellant had her luggage ready and was prepared to execute the plan. She was then arrested. A search revealed a photograph of her husband, a list of names and addresses, airline tickets to India and $3,000.00 cash.</p>
    <p id="b434-7" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[256,1655,1154,475]]]'>A jury trial was held and Appellant testified that her husband had married another woman in India and had secreted substantial sums of money she had sent to him. He had also taken second and third mortgages on their real estate and had not paid federal taxes for several years. Appellant stated that she knew Smalls and Davis were police officers and that she hired them not as “hit men,” but rather as collection agents. It is undisputed that the Commonwealth presented no evidence concerning the law of any foreign jurisdiction.</p>

The Crimes Code provides that one is guilty of conspiracy if, with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of a crime, he agrees with another to engage in conduct which constitutes a crime or an attempt to commit a crime, or agrees to aid in the planning of such crime. 18 <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>Pa.C.S. § 903.

The phrase “is <em>also </em>an offense under the law of this Commonwealth,” implies that the intended result of the inchoate crime must be an offense in the jurisdiction where the act is to be completed. Examining § 102 in its entirety, it appears that the legislature did not intend to criminalize the planning of activity which, although an offense in Pennsylvania, may be legal in another jurisdiction.</p>
