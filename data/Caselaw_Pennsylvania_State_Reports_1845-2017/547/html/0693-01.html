After determining the scope of coverage, the court must examine the complaint in the underlying action to ascertain if it triggers coverage. If the complaint against the insured avers facts that would support a recovery covered by the policy, then coverage is triggered and the insurer has a duty to defend until such time that the claim is confined to a recovery that the policy does not cover. The duty to defend also carries with it a conditional obligation to indemnify in the event the insured is held liable for a claim covered by the policy. <em>Pacific Indemnity Company v.

The Allens argue, however, that the trial court has not disposed of all claims because the court cannot determine the duty to indemnify until the underlying action is fully resolved, including the exhaustion of all appeals. The question before a court in a declaratory judgment action is not whether the insurer owes <em>indemnification </em>in a specific amount, which would be a premature inquiry absent a full resolution of the underlying action. Instead, the question is whether the insurer has a <em>duty </em>to indemnify the insured <em>in the event </em>0/liability in the underlying action. A court can answer such a question because it is within the scope of a court’s power pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act. 42 Pa.C.S. § 7532 (courts have the power to declare rights, status and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be requested).
