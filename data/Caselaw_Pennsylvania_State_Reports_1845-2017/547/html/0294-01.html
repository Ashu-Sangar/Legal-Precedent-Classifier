The three men obtained weapons, disguises, and gloves in preparation for the burglary, and proceeded to Dumchock’s home in Kulpmont.</p>

Observing that Dumchock’s car was parked outside his house and concerned about the possibility of being discovered, the threesome left Dumchock’s residence but returned a few minutes later to again attempt to enter. Eventually, they broke a small window in the kitchen door and entered the residence.</p>

Inside the house, Sergeant Muldowney discovered that telephone cords had been cut. Upstairs, Sergeant Muldowney discovered the victim’s cold body lying at the top of the stairway landing. Sergeant Muldowney noted that Dumchock’s bedroom was disheveled, with drawers removed from the dresser and various items strewn on the victim’s bed. Pennsylvania State Police and County Coroner Richard Ulrich were called to the scene. The victim’s sister also arrived at his house and noted that Dumchock’s motorcycle was missing. The motorcycle was later recovered hidden in some brush where it had been abandoned. Dumchock’s brother-in-law informed police that guns, tools, and electronic equipment were also missing from Dumchock’s residence.

The coroner connected the items with the Dumchoek killing, and notified the District Attorney and State Police. Further, Ms. Chamberlain allowed Shamokin Police to come to her home and remove other items Mark had left there, including a telephone answering machine.

Ordinarily, our scope of review of an allegation that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence is limited to a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying relief of such claim. Since appellant proceeded according to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1410 here and did not file a post-sentence motion, the trial court has not had an opportunity to rule on this issue; however, since the penalty of death is imposed, we are considering this issue from the record.
