We are, therefore, bound by the analysis of <em>Catholic Bishop. </em>Thus, our first inquiry is whether the PERA clearly mandates the inclusion of teachers employed by <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>church-operated schools as public employees.

    <p id="b782-7" data-blocks='[["BL_782.8",782,[258,1162,1156,532]]]'>As the lower courts have observed, the statutory language defining public employees is not a model of clarity. The Commonwealth Court noted that it is not idiomatic in English to refer to an individual as “utilized” for any purpose. It concludes from this that the phrase “when utilized primarily for religious purposes” modifies “church offices or facilities.” In other words, the Commonwealth Court understands the statute to provide that an employee of a church-operated school is <em>not </em>a public employee when the school (“the church facility”) is primarily used for religious purposes.</p>
    <p id="b782-8" data-blocks='[["BL_782.9",782,[256,1720,1156,258]],["BL_783.1",783,[265,312,1154,99]]]'>Under this interpretation, the question then becomes whether the academy is primarily used for religious purposes. As the Commonwealth Court notes, the Association does not dispute that the academy is operated primarily for religious purposes. 671 A.2d at 1210.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The lower court concludes, <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>therefore, that the employees of the Academy are not public employees within the meaning of the PERA.</p>
    <p id="b783-4" data-blocks='[["BL_783.7",783,[263,450,1157,911]]]'>We agree with this interpretation, noting additionally that when an ambiguous clause acts as a modifier, it usually modifies the noun closest to the clause in question. Here, the language of the statute is: “ ‘Public employe’ ... shall not include ... employes ... at church ... facilities when utilized primarily for religious purposes____” The two possible meanings of this ambiguous sentence are that public employees do not include those who work at religious facilities so long as they are performing primarily religious duties; or that public employees do not include those who work at religious facilities so long as the facilities are being used primarily for religious purposes. In our view, the latter interpretation is the more plausible, both because English idiom favors a language pattern in which facilities are used for religious purposes rather than employees, and also because it is customary, as we already observed, to apply an ambiguous modifying clause to the closest noun rather than to a more remote noun.</p>

Of course, the General Assembly is free to amend the language of the PERA and to include lay teachers at religious schools if it so chooses, and in that event, we may then be required to consider whether the inclusion of lay teachers as public employees within PERA <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>violates the religion clauses of the First Amendment or of the Constitution of Pennsylvania.</p>
