Second, whether husband remains employed twenty years or twenty-five years, the effort expended by him in remaining employed is protected from encroachment by the wife by the coverture fraction: as the number of years worked increases the coverture fraction increases from 16/20 to 16/25, thus making the marital share available to the wife smaller as time increases and protecting his increased effort from encroachment. And once this increased effort is protected, that is all that is required by <em>Berrington. </em>The fact that husband’s pension is calculated at twenty years at 50% of his salary and at twenty-five years at 75% of his salary is unrelated to his post-separation “efforts or contributions,” and thus, may be shared by the wife.</p>

The husband was not guaranteed the increased benefit simply based on the passage of time.
