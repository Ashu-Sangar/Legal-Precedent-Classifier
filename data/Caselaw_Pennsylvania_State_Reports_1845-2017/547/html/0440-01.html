Upon his arrest Boucher was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and transported to the Haverford Township police station. At the station, Officer Carroll requested that Boucher perform a breathalyzer test. Officer Carroll informed Boucher that in accordance with the Implied Consent Law, if Boucher refused to submit to the test, his operating privileges would be suspended for one year. Officer Carroll did not inform Boucher that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were not applicable to the request to perform the breathalyzer test.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[254,952,1156,483]]]'>Boucher initially assented to the test. The first test result indicated the presence of mouth alcohol and was rejected. On two subsequent test attempts, Boucher failed to produce sufficient breath samples for analysis. Officer Carroll then gave Boucher the opportunity to take a blood test instead, but Boucher refused. Subsequently, Officer Carroll recorded the failed attempts as a refusal to submit to chemical testing. As a refusal was recorded, DOT notified Boucher that his operating privileges would be suspended.</p>

He challenged the suspension asserting that he had not refused to submit to a chemical test, and that he was not advised by the police officer that his <em>Miranda </em>rights did not apply when asked to submit to testing. At the hearing Boucher testified that he believed that he did not have to take the test because he was already arrested and was afraid of the reading that the test might produce. He indicated that the police officer’s recitation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights had led him to believe that he did not have to give a breath sample. He also testified that he thought he <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>was giving a sufficient sample during the three attempts but was hesitant about giving the samples to the officer.</p>

    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[262,830,1156,578]]]'>Officer Ross explained that the first test result indicated the presence of mouth alcohol, a residual amount of alcohol detected in the mouth. A slope detector device on the machine used during the test shut down the system when any mouth alcohol was detected. A second test was then administered, but Boucher did not cooperate during that test. Boucher provided an insufficient breath sample despite being shown how to provide a sample several times. Boucher was given the third test after a brief interval but failed again to give an adequate breath sample. Officer Carroll’s request that Boucher submit to a blood test was refused.</p>

Boucher was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the time of his arrest.

By deliberately failing to supply sufficient breath samples, Boucher had refused to submit to chemical testing.</p>

He concluded, however, that Boucher’s testimony did not establish that he felt he was entitled to a lawyer before he submitted to chemical testing. Nor did Boucher’s testimony indicate that he felt he needed or wanted a lawyer. Boucher did not testify that he told the police officer that he was confused and that his confusion caused him to give insufficient breath samples. The trial judge found that since Boucher had failed to express his state of confusion regarding <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>his <em>Miranda </em>rights to the police officers, no additional instructions were required under <em>Commonwealth, Department of Transportation v.

Based on Boucher’s testimony, the trial judge concluded that the police officer’s reading of <em>Miranda </em>rights was not the reason why Boucher failed to provide adequate breath samples. Accordingly, the trial judge denied his appeal and reinstated the suspension of operating privileges.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[247,840,1156,752]]]'>Boucher then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, asserting that the trial judge erred in affirming the license suspension because he had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to the request for a chemical test when there was no evidence that he had been advised that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were inapplicable to the chemical test procedure. The Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court’s order because there was no indication in the record that any of the police officers had told Boucher that his <em>Miranda </em>rights did not apply to the chemical test. The Commonwealth Court reasoned that in this case DOT had the burden of proving that Boucher had been provided with that information, commonly referred to as the <em>“O’Connell </em>warning.” Since DOT did not provide such evidence, the license suspension was found to be improper.</p>

We granted allocatur to address the issue of whether a police officer’s failure to explain the inapplicability of <em>Miranda </em>rights to chemical testing precludes suspension of the motorist’s license under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(b) when the motorist intentionally fails to supply an adequate breath sample for chemical testing.

Upon his arrest, appellee was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and transported to the Haverford Township police station. At the station, Officer Carroll requested appellee perform a breathalyzer test. Officer Carroll informed appellee that in accordance with the Implied Consent Law, if appellee refused to submit to the test, his operating privileges <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>would be suspended for one year. The record shows that Officer Carroll failed to inform appellee that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were <em>not </em>applicable to the request to perform the breathalyzer test and that appellee assented to the test. However, on three separate test attempts, appellee failed to produce sufficient breath for analysis. Officer Carroll then provided appellee with an opportunity to take a blood test but appellee refused. Subsequently, Officer Carroll recorded the failed attempts as a refusal to submit to chemical testing. As a refusal was recorded, the Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver’s Licensing (DOT) notified appellee that his operating privileges would be suspended. Appellee appealed from the notice of suspension to the Court of Common Pleas for a de novo hearing. At the hearing, the trial court made findings of fact and concluded that appellee was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the time of his arrest. (R.R. 52a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Additionally, the court found that appellee was advised that pursuant to the Implied Consent Law, a refusal to submit to chemical sobriety testing would result in the suspension of his operating privileges for one year. (R.R. 52a). Further, the court concluded that Appellee did, by purposely failing to supply sufficient breath samples, refuse to submit to chemical testing, (R.R. 53a) and that appellee’s testimony, regarding his confusion once he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then asked to submit to the breathalyzer test, was credible. (R.R. 55a). Notwithstanding the fact that appellee testified that his refusal was an exercise of his “right to remain silent.” (R.R. 55a), the trial court found that appellee had failed to express to Officer Carroll his state of confusion regarding his <em>Miranda </em>rights. (R.R. 56a). The trial court then concluded that as appellee failed to reveal his confusion to the officer, or to explain that this confusion was the basis for his failing to perform the chemical test, the officer had no duty to provide appellee with <em>O’Connell </em>Warnings. (R.R. 56a). Accordingly, the trial court denied appellee’s appeal and reinstated the suspension of operating privileges.</p>

I cannot agree with the Majority that the circumstances of this case present a situation warranting an exception to the legal principles so recently established in <em>Scott. </em>The arresting officer had an affirmative duty to provide <em>O’Connell </em>warnings when he requested appellee submit to the breathalyzer test. The officer’s failure to provide <em>O’Connell </em>warnings cannot be overcome by the conduct of appellee in assenting to the test and then failing to provide sufficient breath samples. The Majority opinion argues that although the officer failed to provide Appellee with <em>O’Connell </em>warnings, appellee’s conduct in purposely attempting to skew the test results by failing to provide sufficient breath samples should be deemed a knowing and conscious refusal. The obvious absence of <em>O’Connell </em>warnings leads me to a contrary conclusion. Although it appears more likely than not that appellee was in fact attempting to “beat <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>the machine,” without having first been warned of the consequences of his actions through the simple explanation of his <em>O’Connell </em>warnings, I cannot, given the circumstances of this case, conclude that appellee’s actions manifested a knowing and conscious refusal. The simple fact is that the arresting officer failed to provide <em>O’Connell </em>warnings as mandated by <em>Scott. </em>Without the required warnings, appellee’s subsequent conduct, whether intentional or inadvertant, is irrelevant as a matter of law.</p>
