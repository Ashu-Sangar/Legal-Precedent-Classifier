The trial court found substantial evidence supporting that Irwin Associates will suffer unnecessary hardship without the variances and affirmed. The Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court because Irwin Associates did not establish that its property was valueless without the variances. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b349-10" data-blocks='[["BL_349.9",349,[280,1462,1157,534]]]'>Irwin Associates bought a vacant lot in a multiple-family residential zone in 1985. The area where the property is located has residential, commercial and institutional uses. Irwin Associates intended to develop apartments on the property. After it learned that federal funding was unavailable for the project in 1992, Irwin Associates entered into contracts to sell the property in three parcels to the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, Allegheny Restorations, Inc. and West Park Non-Elderly Housing, Inc. for the development of housing. The total purchase price was $431,500.</p>

Remediation costs include estimated capital costs of <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>$2.5 to $3 million and annual monitoring costs of $10,000 to $20,000.</p>

The Zoning Board determined that Irwin Associates did not create its hardship, that the variances are not detrimental to the neighborhood, and that the variances are the minimum variances that will afford relief. It thus granted the variances and Allegheny West appealed.</p>

Its real estate financing expert testified that it was unlikely that a financial institution would lend money for a construction project on the property because it would expose itself to potential liability for remediation costs. Irwin Associates’ president testified that the relatively small size of the lot precluded other permitted uses not involving improvements. The environmental consultant estimated that the remediation capital cost would be $2.5 to $3 million and annual monitoring costs would be $10,000 to $20,000. There is thus substantial evidence that Irwin Associates cannot use the property for a permitted purpose or can only conform it for a permitted purpose at a prohibitive cost. Furthermore, notwithstanding Allegheny West’s offer to buy the lot, there is evidence that the property is now without value as zoned.
