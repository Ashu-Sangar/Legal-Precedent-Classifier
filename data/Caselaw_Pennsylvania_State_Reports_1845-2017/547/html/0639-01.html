The injury was occasioned by a severe <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>impact to Newcomer’s abdomen, which caused a perforated bowel and torn stomach and chest muscles. Newcomer did not return to work until April 17,1989. He was then assigned to light-duty work loading pallets of light bulbs onto a trailer. Within two days he stopped performing that job on the ground that it was too strenuous. He was assigned to another light-duty job on May 1,1989. This was an office job that consisted of emptying trash cans, answering telephones, and dispatching. However, claiming that stress associated with office work aggravated his pre-existing peptic ulcer and relying on the advice of his family physician, Newcomer quit working on November 1,1989.</p>
    <p id="b825-4" data-blocks='[["BL_825.4",825,[235,1013,1156,262]]]'>Newcomer subsequently filed a claim for reinstatement of temporary total disability benefits.

However, during the hearing, WTC offered Newcomer a job scanning bar codes on freight cartons. Newcomer agreed to try the job, so the proceeding adjourned. Around April 1, 1991, Newcomer worked at the job for a couple of shifts but then quit.</p>

He told Dr. O’Donnell that his shoulder had been injured in the same workplace accident that caused injuries to his stomach and chest. After performing various tests, Dr. O’Donnell diagnosed Newcomer’s problem as a torn rotator cuff and degenerative changes caused by osteoarthritis. Surgery was then performed.</p>

Baker, Jr. Dr. Baker, who had treated Newcomer on an ongoing basis for aftereffects of the workplace accident, stated that treatment had been directed at abdominal muscle tears and strains and that Newcomer had not fully recovered from the injury. He confirmed that around November 1, 1989, he had advised Newcomer to discontinue working in an office environment because job stress was aggravating Newcomer’s preexisting ulcer.</p>
    <p id="b826-5" data-blocks='[["BL_826.5",826,[271,1017,1156,313]]]'>In addition, Newcomer introduced deposition testimony given in 1992 by Dr. O’Donnell. Dr. O’Donnell testified that Newcomer should avoid repetitive motions with his right arm and avoid lifting more than fifteen pounds. He further testified that, due to such limitations, Newcomer was unable to work as a truck driver, trailer loader, or scanner.</p>
    <p id="b826-6" data-blocks='[["BL_826.6",826,[270,1357,1156,533]]]'>Significantly, Dr. O’Donnell stated his opinion that the shoulder problem was caused by the workplace accident that occurred on February 1, 1989. He acknowledged that he had not reviewed any of the hospital records relating to the original injury. Nor had he been involved in any of the treatment that immediately followed the injury. Instead, he based his opinion solely and <em>expressly </em>on the medical history provided by Newcomer. This was the only expert opinion offered by Newcomer to establish a link between the shoulder disability and the accident.</p>
    <p id="b826-7" data-blocks='[["BL_826.7",826,[267,1916,1157,470]]]'>Predictably, Newcomer testified at the 1993 hearing that he injured his shoulder in the workplace accident and that he continued to be affected by disability and discomfort that were not fully rectified by the 1991 surgery. He also testified that he quit the job operating a scanner in April of 1991 because wearing the scanner on a strap around his neck and repeatedly moving the scanning wand, a device similar in size and weight to a marking pen, caused discomfort in his right shoulder.</p>

During the hearing WTC offered Newcomer yet another job, this time as a night watchman. Dr. O’Donnell later provided an opinion, however, that Newcomer’s shoulder problem made him incapable of working as a night watchman.</p>

It ordered the continued payment of benefits for partial disability. The board’s rationale was that Dr. O’Donnell’s opinion had no basis in fact and was incompetent as a matter of law because it was based on a false medical history supplied by Newcomer.</p>
    <p id="b827-6" data-blocks='[["BL_827.6",827,[248,1464,1155,371]]]'>An appeal was taken to the Commonwealth Court. The board’s order was then affirmed insofar as it held WTC not liable for attorney’s fees, but it was reversed to the extent that it held WTC not liable for total disability benefits and medical expenses related to the shoulder injury.

During the 1991 hearing, Newcomer’s testimony made no reference to a shoulder injury. Newcomer described the accident as one in which he received a blow on the cheek and on the chest, resulting in damage to his chest muscles and lower abdomen. When asked about lingering effects of the injuries, he said, “I have constant pain in the chest, sometimes back under here in the rib cage.” When questioned about his ability to lift objects, he replied, “There’s a lot of things I can’t do. I can’t even sit and read the newspaper like this because it just falls out. I have to lay the newspaper on my — and if I reach up it just bothers me.” On cross-examination, Newcomer’s problem with lifting and reaching was further explored:</p>

Dr. Baker diagnosed Newcomer’s injury as a severe blow to the abdomen caused when a tool handle was set in motion by a co-worker’s fall. He testified that treatment had been directed at abdominal muscle tears and strains, and that a satisfactory recovery from these injuries had not yet been achieved. He stated that, as far as limitations on lifting were concerned, Newcomer “should not lift more than 20 pounds and only then occasionally.” On cross-examination, the reason for this limitation was elicited:</p>

    <p id="b829-7" data-blocks='[["BL_829.7",829,[232,864,1156,423]]]'>Dr. Baker also said that Newcomer reported severe pain when he attempted to return to work loading light bulbs onto a truck. Dr. Baker opined that the pain was due to having re-injured certain abdominal muscles. He also stated that the task of scanning bar codes on freight cartons was one that Newcomer should be able to perform. Nowhere in Dr. Baker’s testimony was there any indication that Newcomer suffered from any sort of shoulder problem.</p>
    <p id="b829-8" data-blocks='[["BL_829.8",829,[231,1312,1155,698]]]'>In his 1992 deposition testimony, Dr. O’Donnell indicated that shoulder pain is commonly “referred,” and that chest pain can be consistent with a shoulder injury. With regard to the specifics of Newcomer’s injury, Dr. O’Donnell testified about the medical history that he was provided. Newcomer told the doctor that his shoulder had been injured in the same workplace accident that caused injuries to his stomach and chest. He described the accident as one in which a co-employee fell into his back and on top of him while getting off of a truck. Newcomer said that his arm was positioned out to the side at the time and that a shoulder injury resulted. Newcomer told the doctor that, ever since that time, he had been troubled by pain in his right shoulder.</p>
    <p id="b829-9" data-blocks='[["BL_829.9",829,[230,2034,1154,368]]]'>However, this description of the accident plainly differed from his earlier descriptions of the event. At the time of the accident, Newcomer told treating physicians that he suffered abdominal and chest injuries when a co-employee who was getting off of a truck slipped and fell into an empty hand truck that in turn fell back and struck him in the lower abdomen. No mention was made of a shoulder injury.</p>

Dr. O’Donnell’s testimony was incompetent in that it was unsupported by the medical record and by the factual history of the accident. The description of the accident provided to Dr. O’Donnell was patently different from that which was the basis for treatment at the time of the injury. Newcomer was treated for an abdominal injury. For two and one-half years thereafter, he received absolutely no treatment for any shoulder problem. Dr. O’Donnell’s opinion as to causation was based solely on Newcomer’s representation that he suffered the shoulder injury in the work-related accident. The medical records of treatment following the accident simply do not support Newcomer’s claim. In short, Newcomer’s personal opinion of causation was the sole basis <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>for Dr. O’Donnell’s expert opinion.

    <p id="b832-4" data-blocks='[["BL_832.4",832,[254,458,1156,537]]]'>The decision of the Commonwealth Court must be reversed to the extent that it modified benefits from partial to temporary total disability status for the indefinite period after November 1, 1989, and to the extent that it allowed recovery of medical expenses related to the shoulder disability. A job within the physical limitations attributable to the work-related injury was available on or about April 1,1991, when Newcomer was given a job operating a scanner. Benefits must, therefore, be modified from temporary total to partial disability status as of that date.</p>
    <p id="b832-5" data-blocks='[["BL_832.5",832,[255,1022,1151,151]]]'>The order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the board for modification of benefits consistent with this opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

      <p id="b832-14" data-blocks='[["BL_832.7",832,[252,2157,1153,235]]]'> WTC has filed a motion requesting that we dismiss an issue contained in Newcomer’s brief, namely an allegation that the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the board's reversal of the award of attorney’s fees for unreasonable contest. Newcomer did not file a petition or cross-petition for allowance of appeal. WTC correctly asserts that this issue has not been preserved. Hence, the motion is granted.</p>
