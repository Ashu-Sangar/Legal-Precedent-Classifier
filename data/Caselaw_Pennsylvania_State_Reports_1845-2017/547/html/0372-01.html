It would be contrary to the purpose of the Act to hold that a child whose injuries were so severe as to require plastic surgery had not been attacked by the animal that inflicted the wounds. If the lower courts’ narrow interpretation were to be adopted, a dog could repeatedly inflict severe injury upon individuals and not be declared dangerous if the injuries were inflicted while the animal was “playing” or, as in this case, attempting to recover food. Each incident would not be considered an “attack” and therefore a “history or propensity to attack” could never be established. Although we cannot ascertain the intent of the <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>animal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> we presume that because the dog in fact severely injured the child, it intended to do so in order to recover the chicken she was attempting to eat.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Although the Dog Act does not define the term “provocation,” “to provoke” has been defined by <em>Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>948 (1986), as to “arouse to a feeling or action; to incite to anger; to call forth; to stir up purposely.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> A child attempting to eat a piece of chicken clearly does not fall within such definition.</p>

We disagree. We note that the terms “history” and “propensity” are stated in the disjunctive and are not defined in the statute. We therefore again refer to <em>Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>573 (1986), which defines “history” as “a chronological record of significant events.” Clearly this term implies successive occurrences. The word “propensity” is defined as “an often intense natural inclination or preference.” <em>Id. </em>at 943. The word “often” in the definition of propensity leads us to the conclusion that more than one event is required. Thus, the statutory language does not refer to an isolated incident, but rather a continued pattern of behavior. We find that the term “an incident” refers to the event which brings the question of the dog’s dangerousness before the district justice, and the determination of dangerousness is to be made upon evidence of a history or propensity to attack. The incident giving rise to the filing of the complaint cannot alone establish the dog’s history or propensity to attack.

Although previous case law regarding dog owner liability is of marginal relevance, we note that the common law rule provided that the dog owner was only liable for injuries inflicted by his dog if he knew or had reason to know of the dog's propensity to be dangerous. <em>Andrews v.

The majority has established a rule which resurrects the common law “one bite” rule the Dangerous Dog Law was intended to replace.
