Boyd asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for advising him to reject the prosecution’s plea offer and for advising him not to testify at trial. We find that the Superior Court erred in holding that Boyd’s claim that his counsel improperly advised him to reject the plea offer is not cognizable under the PCRA.

The two men began to fight and Boyd stabbed Jolly many times. Jolly ran to another apartment and the man who lived there took Jolly to the hospital.</p>

However, there is a vast difference between that failure and the circumstances at hand, where counsel advised the client not to accept an offer based upon his professional opinion that the client would be acquitted because of the weakness of the prosecution’s case.</p>

Prior to trial, trial counsel had attempted to negotiate a guilty plea to a charge of simple assault by mutual combat, a third degree misdemeanor which carries a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment. 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2701(b)(1), 1104(3). The Commonwealth did not agree to such a plea, and the case proceeded to trial. However, at trial the victim testified that he had committed perjury at the preliminary hearing. Immediately after the victim testified, the Commonwealth offered the same plea bargain which trial counsel had attempted to secure prior to trial. Given the credibility questions raised by the admission to perjury by the Commonwealth’s key witness, as evidenced by the Commonwealth’s change of heart regarding the earlier plea offer to a third degree misdemeanor, counsel certainly had a reasonable basis to believe the appellant would be acquitted. As the Majority acknowledges on page 7 of the slip opinion, this advice was reasonable.</p>

Petitioner was offered the same plea agreement of two years imprisonment that the one co-conspirator received, but rejected it on counsel’s advice. Petitioner was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a term of life plus eighty years imprisonment.

The mere fact that appellant was nevertheless convicted does not impact on trial counsel’s effectiveness or the reasonableness of his advice. To so hold would be nothing more than, using the well-known sports metaphor, “Monday morning quarterbacking.”</p>

Counsel had no legal basis upon which to make that assurance. Acting on this advice, the defendant withdrew his guilty plea and counsel stipulated to all the elements of the crime at trial, arguing only that his client was not sane during the commission of the crime. The defendant was convicted and was later sentenced to fifty years imprisonment. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that trial counsel was ineffective because he “affirmatively misstated the consequences” of standing trial rather than accepting the plea offer. <em><a href="/f2d/639/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="639 F.2d 262" data-case-ids="1361536" data-case-paths="/f2d/639/0262-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f2d/639/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="639 F.2d 262" data-case-ids="1361536" data-case-paths="/f2d/639/0262-01">at 266</a>.
