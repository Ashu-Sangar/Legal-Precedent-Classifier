For example, in a recent decision, <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>— U.S. —, <a href="/us/519/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="117 S.

The officers stopped the car and ordered the driver to get out of the vehicle. After noticing that the passenger, Wilson, was acting nervous, they demanded that he exit the vehicle also. As Wilson complied, an officer observed a bulge in Wilson’s jacket that proved to be a .38 caliber revolver and promptly arrested him.</p>

The United States Supreme Court disagreed. It weighed the public’s interest in protecting police from becoming victims of hidden weapons during traffic stops against the invasion of a passenger’s privacy interest in being ordered out of the stopped vehicle. It held that pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, an officer may order passengers to get out of a car pending completion of the police investigation of the driver’s traffic violation. <em>Wilson.</em>

When police are properly searching a suspect committing a crime, they may reasonably conclude, based on their experience, that the companion’s direct association with the suspect indicates that he or she is also involved in the criminal enterprise. This is particularly true where the companion is intimately linked to the criminal activity, yet does leave the scene or stop the ongoing crime. The potential for violence against police only increases when they investigate ongoing criminal activity by one person surrounded by bystanders. Therefore, pursuant to <em>Terry, </em>the police safety interests outweigh the companion’s diminished privacy interest and justify a police stop of the suspect’s companion.</p>
