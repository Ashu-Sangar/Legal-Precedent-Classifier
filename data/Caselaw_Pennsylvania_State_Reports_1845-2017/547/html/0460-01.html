The manager of the shopping center had become concerned because, while touring the mall during regular business hours, he noticed that one of the jewelry cases in the store which was visible from outside the store was broken and that no one appeared to be in the store even though the store was supposed to be open for business. The manager also noticed <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>that the store’s security door was locked.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Police disabled the security lock and entered the store, where they observed that one of the four glass jewelry cases was broken and empty of all jewelry.

Specifically, the trial court found that on February 26, 1991, appellant began making a series of phone calls to the Philadelphia police expressing his desire to speak with someone about the Slobotkin murder. On February 27, 1991, appellant met a Philadelphia detective outside of the Philadelphia Police Administration building.

Furthermore, defense counsel stated in his summation, “Mr. Bronshtein isn’t around those type of people anymore. He’s not around that type of activity anymore. He was a kid mixed up with the wrong people back at that time.” N.T. 4/20/94 at 71.

An example of this discrepancy is that appellant contends that the Montgomery County police initiated the contact that resulted in appellant making a statement regarding his involvement in this case. Obviously, the trial court made a credibility determination based upon the evidence and we will not disturb this determination. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, since appellant initiated the interview in which he gave statements concerning the Gutman murder, that he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that he waived his right to counsel on that date, we conclude that the statements were made after a voluntary waiver of appellant’s rights. <em>Commonwealth v.

This proffer indicated that if the expert had been asked if he ever heard of Karlitsky, his answer would apparently have been yes. It was therefore improper for the prosecutor to infer that the expert had never heard of Karlitsky.
