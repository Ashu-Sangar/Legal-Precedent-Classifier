Section 402A reflects the social policy that a seller or manufacturer is best able to shoulder the costs and to administer the risks involved when a product is released into the stream of commerce. Having derived a <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>benefit from engaging in business, manufacturers and sellers are particularly able to allocate the losses incurred through cost increases and insurance. <em>Walton v.

    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[247,1970,1156,424]]]'>Appellant’s theory of liability, inadequate warnings, is premised on the argument that Appellees should have anticipated the removal of the safety device and, therefore, should have provided additional warnings. Appellant contends that the warning on the blender, which stated, “DANGER, KEEP FINGERS OUT OF DOOR OPENINGS,” was inadequate to warn the user that the blades would continue to rotate after the power was terminated.</p>

      <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>Appellant’s initial error lies in the characterization of the “danger” as being the continued rotation of the blades of the meat blender after the power had been turned off. Instead, the danger to be cautioned against is the placement of the operator’s hands at any position near the blades. An instruction concerning the continued rotation of the blades becomes necessary only if the operator blatantly ignores the specific warning to keep fingers away from the door openings. Appellant is in effect suggesting that we require a manufacturer to warn against dangers that may arise if the stated warnings are not heeded. Such requirement is unreasonable and unwarranted since the law presumes that warnings will be obeyed. <em>See Baldino v. Castagna, </em><a href="/pa/505/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="505 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1788859" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0239-01">505 Pa. 239</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="505 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1788859" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0239-01">478 A.2d 807</a> (1984) (where a warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read and heeded); Comment j of Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[264,1214,1156,581]]]'>In a similar argument, Appellant maintains that the Superior Court erred in finding that the removal of the safety device by Appellant’s employer constituted a superseding cause of Appellant’s injury. This claim is likewise meritless. Disregarding the warnings stated in the owner’s manual and affixed to the machine itself, Appellant’s employer removed the safety devices so that a single employee could operate more than one machine at a time. This clearly constitutes a substantial change in the condition in which the product was sold that relieves the manufacturer of liability for Appellant’s injury.</p>

As evidence of foreseeability, Appellant asserts the following: the instruction manual accompanying the blender cautioned against removing the safety device; the hand controls were shipped separately from the blender; the safety device was incompatible with Equity’s procedure of two machines being operated by one person; and, the warnings placed on the blender were cogent only if the safety device was removed. We find untenable the proposition that a manufacturer must anticipate <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>that a specific warning <em>not </em>to operate a product without a safety device indicates to a user that the product <em>could, </em>in fact, be operated without the safety feature.

Moreover, an integral part of the product was an interlocking electropneumatic safety device and the product’s manual cautioned against its removal. The fact that Appellant’s employer chose to disregard such warning does not render the product defective.

The imposition of strict liability on Appellees in the instant case would be a futile attempt to promote the distribution of safe products when it is not the manufacturer but the purchaser who rendered the product dangerous. The manufacturer should not be responsible for the employer’s intentional removal of the safety device merely because the purchaser/employer is limited in liability to that recoverable in a workers’ compensation proceeding.</p>

The warning provided by Appellees did nothing to inform the user of the hidden danger that the blades would continue to rotate ten seconds after the power had been terminated. This warning did not apprise the user <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>that the machine was a danger regardless of whether the power needed to operate the machine was, in fact, utilized. In my view, it is unacceptable to conclude that in today’s mechanized world, a machine which, in fact, poses a danger to its user even when power is not being supplied to it, should not be the subject of a specific warning. I suspect that anyone would conclude that if the machine was not receiving the power needed for its operation, then the latent danger which was the subject of the warning given would be obviated. In a mechanized world, it is clear to me that based on the experience an average person collects during his or her life and the warning that was placed on the machine, any user would conclude that the danger in the machine is directly related to the machine being in operation. I would hold that where a machine poses a danger when it is <em>turned off, </em>then that danger is an unobvious one against which the user needs to be specifically warned.

Her duties included the operation of two blenders, manufactured by Bepex Corporation and Berwind Corporation (Appellees). Each blender had the capacity to mix 2,000 pounds of meat at one time. The blenders mixed lean and fat meats into regulation quality. Appellant was responsible for testing the meat in the blenders to assure that it met certain fat content specifications. Once the specifications were met, Appellant would operate each blender on its discharge mode to release the meat into a hopper where it would be carried on a conveyor belt to the next phase of processing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Because Equity had removed an interlocking safety device from the blenders, an operator, like Appellant, did not have to use both hands to depress the valves that opened the discharge doors to release the meat. The purpose of the safety device was to prevent an operator’s hands from coming anywhere near the rotating blender blades. Without the safety device, the discharge doors on the blenders would remain open until the operator returned the levers to the closed position.</p>

She then pushed the button to stop the mixing blades, turned off the conveyor, and reached toward the meat.

Citing <em>Baldino v. Castagna, </em><a href="/pa/505/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="505 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1788859" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0239-01">505 Pa. 239</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="505 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1788859" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0239-01">478 A.2d 807</a> (1984), the Majority concludes that where, as here, the manufacturer provides a warning, the manufacturer may reasonably assume that the user will heed it. <em>Baldino, </em>a negligence action, does not, however, stand for the proposition that an inadequate warning may relieve a manufacturer of liability. Instead, <em>Baldino </em>instructs that whether a user’s failure to heed a warning absolves a manufacturer of liability depends on the adequacy of the warning to alert the user of the particular dangers inherent to the product. Here, the manufacturer’s warning failed to inform the user of all inobvious risks inherent to the product. Therefore, the user may have proceeded in disre<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>gard of certain known risks, i.e., the danger of still blades, but without knowledge of the particular danger that caused her injury, i.e., the danger of rotating blades. As a result, the user’s failure to heed the inadequate warning should not absolve the manufacturer from liability.</p>

It was critical for Appellant to maintain a continuous flow of meat because all subsequent stages of the production line were dependant on the availability of the blended meat.</p>
