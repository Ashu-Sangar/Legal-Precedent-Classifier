      <em>OPINION OF THE COURT</em>

    <p class="author" id="b610-7" data-blocks='[["BL_610.7",610,[314,801,512,40]]]'>FLAHERTY, Chief Justice.</p>
    <p id="b610-8" data-blocks='[["BL_610.8",610,[270,869,1156,480]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from an order of the Commonwealth Court which reversed an order of the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (PHFA) which had affirmed a hearing examiner’s denial of an application for emergency mortgage assistance under the Homeowner’s Emergency Mortgage Assistance Act (Assistance Act), 35 P.S. § 1680.401c et seq. The application for assistance was filed by Antoinette Anela, appellee herein, in an effort to cure delinquencies in her mortgage payments.</p>
    <p id="b610-9" data-blocks='[["BL_610.9",610,[269,1375,1156,364]]]'>In 1989, Anela purchased a home in Philadelphia with her then-fiance, James R. Prem. Anela and Prem obtained a thirty-year mortgage on the property in the amount of $46,-700. Shortly after making the purchase, Anela and Prem ended their relationship. Prem never moved into the house. Anela moved in, however, and has since resided there with her son.</p>
    <p id="b610-10" data-blocks='[["BL_610.10",610,[269,1773,1156,259]]]'>In 1993, a judgment was obtained against Prem by John Harahan. Harahan subsequently initiated a sheriffs sale of Prem’s one-half interest in the property. Harahan purchased Prem’s interest at the sale. Harahan did not move into the house. He, in fact, never even met Anela.</p>
    <p id="b610-11" data-blocks='[["BL_610.11",610,[268,2059,1156,203]]]'>Early in 1993, Anela was laid off from her job as a legal secretary. She maintained the $509.81 monthly mortgage payments until January of 1994, at which time she defaulted. The total amount in arrears now exceeds $4,590.00.</p>

Under the act, the <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>PHFA is authorized to provide mortgage assistance loans to homeowners who face foreclosure for reasons beyond their control. 35 P.S. §§ 1680.401c, 1680.404c. The PHFA denied Anela’s application.</p>
    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.4",611,[243,555,1157,317]]]'>On appeal, a hearing examiner affirmed on the basis of a PHFA policy statement which requires that applications for mortgage assistance be joined by all of the owners of the property. Anela’s application for assistance had not been joined by Harahan, and Harahan is presumed to be unwilling to join in such an application.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[244,896,1156,257]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed and remanded for further consideration of Anela’s application. The court held that requiring all of the owners of the property to join in the application for assistance was contrary to provisions of the Assistance Act. Hence, it held the requirement invalid.</p>

(5) The agency has determined that there is a reasonable prospect that the mortgagor will be able to resume full mortgage payments within thirty-six (36) months____”) The PHFA has a duty to conduct a thorough review of each applicant’s financial position. 35 P.S. § 1680.404c(a)(6) (assistance not to be granted unless the “mortgagor has applied to the agency for assistance on an application form prescribed by the agency for this use which includes a financial statement disclosing all assets and liabilities of the mortgagor, whether singly or jointly held, and all household income regardless of source.”) See also 35 P.S. § 1680.404c(a)(9) (assistance to be granted only where “[e]x<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>cept for the current delinquency, the mortgagor shall have had a favorable residential mortgage credit history for the previous five (5) years.”); 35 P.S. § 1680.404c(a)(l) (property securing the mortgage must be the principal residence of the mortgagor). Further, the agency is to ensure that each assistance loan is backed by an adequate security interest. 35 P.S. § 1680.405c(g) (“Repayment of amounts owed to the agency from a mortgagor shall be secured by a mortgage lien on the property and by such other obligation as the agency may require.”)</p>
    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[263,872,1156,1022]]]'>In short, the legislature has placed responsibility on the PHFA to issue loans in a manner that assures repayment. To that end, it has authorized the agency to adopt rules, regulations, and procedural requirements. It is perfectly consistent with that authorization for the PHFA to consider information regarding all of a property’s owners to determine the likelihood that the original mortgage delinquency as well as the assistance loan will be repaid. If all owners of the property were not included in the application process it would be impossible for the agency to ascertain whether co-owners have the desire, intention, or financial ability to cure the mortgage delinquency. In addition, because all co-owners are benefitted by a mortgage assistance loan in that the proceeds are used to cure arrearages on the underlying mortgage, it is fair and reasonable for the agency to require information about such co-beneficiaries of the publicly funded loan. We conclude that requiring all co-owners to apply jointly for mortgage assistance is plainly within the scope of authority delegated to the agency.</p>
