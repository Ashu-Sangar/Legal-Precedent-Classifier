On November 22,1993, at approximately 10:25 p.m., Anthony Richardson and Lenora Grimes were standing in front of Grimes’ apartment on the 1800 block of Wilmot Street in Philadelphia.

Grimes asked him if he needed anything, but Appellant ignored her. Richardson then asked Appellant if he wanted anything. Appellant walked past Richardson but then turned, pulled out a .357 Magnum handgun, and shot Richardson in the right side, just below the chest. Richardson fell to the ground and said “[y]ou can take it all.” N.T., 12/2/95, at 59. Appellant then moved closer to Richardson and shot him twice in the back of the head.</p>
