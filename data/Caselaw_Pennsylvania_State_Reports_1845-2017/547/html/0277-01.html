Specifically, Stewart requested Reverend Heinenman’s personal records and the Diocese’s records concerning the priest’s alleged alcohol and/or drug abuse and sexual misconduct. Stewart argued that the church documents could help prove <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>that he acted in self-defense because of Reverend Heineman’s purported past violent conduct.</p>

In <em>Patterson, </em>a murder prosecution, a court assigned a priest to the defendant as a court-appointed counselor following the defendant’s unrelated arrests for indecent exposure. At trial, the priest testified concerning the defendant’s desire to confess to the murder. The Superior Court found no evidence in the record indicating that the defendant had communicated with the priest in his capacity as a minister rather than as a court-appointed counselor.

      <em>Fahlfeder </em>involved communications to a clergyman who was the director of a residence to which the petitioner had been assigned as a condition of his parole for morals crimes involving young boys. At the petitioner’s parole violation hearing, the director testified that the petitioner had admitted to associating with young boys while on parole. On appeal, the petitioner alleged error in the admission of the director’s testimony. The Commonwealth Court held that the statutory clergy-communicant privilege does not prohibit all testimony by members of the clergy. Instead, the court stated that it is limited to information told in confidence to the clergy in their roles as confessors or counselors. The court concluded that the record did not establish a confessor/penitent relationship between the petitioner and the director or that the petitioner offered his admissions in confidence. The court determined that the director’s role toward the petitioner was that of volunteer or auxiliary supervisor to help in his rehabilitation on parole. Without a showing that the director’s role was one of confessor or confidant, the court held that the challenged <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>admissions did not fall within the protection of the clergy-communicant privilege.</p>

By seeking to eliminate the requirement of a confessional or spiritual relationship between the communicant and the clergy person, the Diocese would so broadly construe the meaning of information acquired “in the course of [a clergyman’s] duties” as to effectively extend the privilege to communications involving entirely secular concerns. Contrary to the Diocese’s contention, limiting the privilege to communications penitential or spiritual in nature does not “insert” non-existent language into the statute. Instead, this requirement provides a rational and well-established interpretation of confidential information acquired “in the course of [a clergyman’s] duties.”</p>

The statute protects from discovery information that a religious leader acquires (1) from any person (2) in confidence (3) while in the course of his duties. It simply does not say that information is protected only when received in the course of a religious leader’s duties as a spiritual advisor.</p>

One may turn to a religious leader as a confidant or counsellor or for solace or other ministration. Often a religious leader is the only person one has to talk to. Religious leaders provide marital counselling. In the Catholic church, clergy conduct annulment proceedings where confidences are shared. In some communities, religious institutions fill in gaps in social services that the government is unable to provide. Aside from departing from the statute, allowing disclosure of confidential communications in these settings <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>may deter those who need a religious leader’s support from seeking it.</p>

L. <em>&amp; </em>R. § 4505</a> (McKinney 1996) (statute protects “a confession or confidence made to [a clergyman] in his professional character as spiritual advisor”); Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 2317.02(C)(Baldwin 1996)(statute protects “a confession made, or any information confidentially communicated, to the clergyman for a religious counseling purpose”). The law in other states, upon which the majority relies, is based upon different statutes. The majority cites no statute similar to Pennsylvania’s statute that applies only to spiritual communications.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[233,1163,1155,708]]]'>Federal cases interpreting the clergyman privilege are also inapposite. <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em><a href="/f2d/918/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="918 F.2d 374" data-case-ids="10534088" data-case-paths="/f2d/918/0374-01">918 F.2d 374</a> (3rd Cir.1990), cited by the majority, looks to Proposed Rule of Evidence 506. That rule expressly protects communications in a religious leader’s professional character “as a spiritual advisor.” In addition, the earlier Pennsylvania decisions that the majority cites do not construe the statute. <em>See Hutchison v.
