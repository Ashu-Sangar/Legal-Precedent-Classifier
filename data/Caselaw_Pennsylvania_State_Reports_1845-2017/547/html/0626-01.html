Because we find that the grant of nonsuit was improper, where, as here, no evidence was presented by appellants at trial as to liability, and because we find that appellants’ failure to file a motion to remove the nonsuit was not fatal to their appeal, we reverse the order of the Superior Court quashing appellants’ appeal and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

On December 26, 1989, Mrs. Lewis went to the Lawndale Community Hospital’s emergency room where she was examined by Dr. Edward Whalen. Dr. Whalen requested <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>x-rays of Mrs. Lewis’ spine, shoulder and right clavicle. Thereafter, appellee, Dr. Steven Munzer, examined the x-rays and determined that there was no dislocation or fracture evident. Thus, Mrs. Lewis was released from Lawndale Community Hospital.</p>

Appellants countered by making an oral motion to supplement the record with a revised expert report which would have stated the required degree of medical certainty. This request was based on appellants’ assertion that their medical expert was unable to initially formulate an appropriate opinion to the required degree of medical certainty since he was not timely given all relevant evidence by appellee. The trial court conducted hearings on these motions and on May 16, 1995, the trial court granted appellee’s motion <em>in limine </em>and denied appellants’ motion to supplement the record.</p>

Appellants did not file a post-verdict motion to remove the nonsuit with the trial court. Instead, on June 2, 1995, appellants filed a direct appeal to the Superior Court. Appellee filed a motion to quash the appeal alleging that appellants waived their right to appeal because of their failure to file a post-verdict motion to remove the nonsuit. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. 227.1(c) (motion to remove nonsuit must be filed within ten days after notice of nonsuit). On August 22, 1995, the Superior Court, in a <em>per curiam </em>order, granted appellee’s motion to quash the appeal.</p>

In <em>Gallagher, </em>the trial court, <em>sua sponte, </em>entered nonsuit against plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim before the trial began and before the plaintiffs presented any evidence as to liability. On appeal, the plaintiffs alleged that nonsuit should not have been entered pursuant to Rule 230.1 because a nonsuit may only be granted after the plaintiffs presented their evidence at trial as to liability. The Superior Court agreed and held that a trial court’s grant of nonsuit prior to trial could not be characterized as granting nonsuit under Rule 230.1, since such a motion may <em>only </em>be granted after a plaintiffs liability evidence has been presented to the jury. The Superior Court found instead that the trial court’s action should have been characterized as either a grant of summary judgment or a judgment on the pleadings. Thus, the Superior Court held that post-trial motions to remove the nonsuit were not required under Rule 227.1 since the proceedings did not constitute a trial. <em>Gallagher, </em><a href="/pa-super/421/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="421 Pa.

This Act, together with all of the cases decided thereunder setting forth the weight that a court must give to the adduced testimony and evidence, clearly indicates that a nonsuit is not to be entered prior to the taking of testimony. The law is clear that a compulsory nonsuit may not be entered at the commencement of trial on the ground that a plaintiffs proposed evidence is insufficient to sustain his cause of action.</blockquote>
