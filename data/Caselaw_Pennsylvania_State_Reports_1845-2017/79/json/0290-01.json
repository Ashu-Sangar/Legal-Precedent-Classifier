No offer was made to show that the lease had been terminated and the piano suffered to remain in the hands of Wilson, the lessee, as his property. His declarations of property, or the acts of other parties in attempting to treat the piano as his, could not, therefore, affect his lessors. The property remained in bailment and consequently was not liable to a sale for payment of his debts, or for taxes. Possession under a mere bailment for hire is not a constructive fraud; otherwise much of the business of men would be ended, and the poorer the bailee the less would be his ability to hire the use of property needful to him. We see no error in rejecting the defendant\u2019s offer. Judgment affirmed.",

The piano being in possession of Wilson was sold for taxes against him. Held, that the sale did not divest Kleber\u2019s ownership.\n2. No declarations of Wilson or the acts of other parties in attempting to treat the piano as his could affect Kleber.\n3. The property remained in bailment and was not. liable to a sale for Wilson\u2019s debt or for his taxes.\n4. Possession under a mere bailment for hire is not a constructive fraud.\nOctober 13th 1875.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Williams, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and .Woodward, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term 1875, No. 133.\nThis was an action of replevin, brought July 3d 1874 by Henry Kleber and Augustus Kleber, trading as H. Kleber & Brother, against S. J. Crist, for a piano, stool and cover.\nThe defendant gave a claim property bond and retained the goods.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit of claim was, that being the owner of the piano, stool and cover they entered into an agreement with one James Wilson to rent him the piano, &c. for the quarterly rent of $35. The agreement was'dated July 12th 1873 ; in consideration of the renting of the piano, &c., Wilson agreed to pay to the plaintiffs $35 from the date of the agreement until the 12th of October then next: \u201cbeing one quarter, the specified amount to be paid at the beginning of each quarter or term,\u201d the \u201c renting may be terminated at the option of the party of the first part at any time if the rent is not paid as above agreed, and they may at their option enter said premises and take possession of and remove said piano without process of law.\u201d Wilson was to have the right to purchase the piano at $450 in instalments, the last payable in nine months; in case of purchase, the sums paid for rent to be deducted from the price; the right of the plaintiffs to claim the piano as their property to remain in them as if the privilege of purchase had not been added to the agreement.\nThe affidavit further averred that in pursuance of the agreement the piano, &c., were delivered to Wilson, who failed to pay the rent and to comply with the provisions of the agreement, that the defendant has the piano, &c., in his possession and refuses to deliver it.\nThe affidavit of defence averred that the piano, &c., were lawfully seized and sold for taxes by the tax collector of the Sixth ward, Allegheny city, on the premises of Wilson, for city, county and state tax due by him; that T. P. Nicholson became the purchaser of the piano, &c., at the sale, and the defendant purchased them from Nicholson; it averred further that the defendant had no knowledge of the alleged agreement with Wilson, &c.\nOn the trial, April 12th 1875, before Stowe, J., the plaintiffs read their affidavit of claim under the rule of court. The defendant offered to prove the assessments against the real estate of Wilson; warrants issued to the collector; that the piano was found on the premises of Wilson and claimed by him, long after the expiration of the lease; that under the warrants the piano, &c., were sold to Nicholson, who sold them to the defendant: to be followed by proof that Wilson asserted whilst the piano, &e., were in his possession, that he had paid for them in full and that Wilson a short time before the sale had claimed them under an execution against him; that they were set apart to him and afterwards sold for the taxes.\nThe plaintiffs objected to the evidence; it was rejected by the court, and a bill of exceptions sealed.\nBoth parties then gave evidence as to the value of the piano, &c.\nThe court charged that under the evidence the plaintiffs were entitled to recover; the only question was as to damages.\nThe verdict was for the plaintiffs for $420.50.\nThe defendant took a writ of error and assigned for error the rejection o\u00ed his offer of evidence and the instruction of the court to the. jury.\nBigham Blalcely, for plaintiff in error,\ncited Davis v. Bigler, 12 P. F. Smith 242.\n6r. B. Cochran and A. M. Brown, for defendants in error.\nThe lease clearly asserted and maintained the plaintiffs\u2019 right of property in the piano; and the legality of such a bailment is lawful: Myers v. Harvey, 2 Penna. Rep. 479 ; Vandyke v. Christ, 7 W. & S. 373 ; Clark v. Jack, 7 Watts 375 ; Rose v. Story, 1 Barr 191; Henderson v. Lauck, 9 Harris 359; Linton v. Butz, 7 Barr 89 ; Rowe v. Sharp, 1 P. F. Smith 26. \u201c Caveat emptor\u201d is applicable to this purchase: Brown v. Wilmerding, 5 Duer 225."
