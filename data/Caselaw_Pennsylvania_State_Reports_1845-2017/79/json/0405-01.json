It, therefore, became necessary to establish the fact by such proof as rendered the belief a certain fact. This could be done, not by the proof that a certain engine emitted sparks incessantly, for non constat that this particular engine had passed the plaintiff\u2019s premises on that day. Hence it was necessary to permit the party to show that the emitting of coals and sparks in unusual' quantities was frequent and permitted to be done by a number of engines. Tbe range of the evidence in this respect of necessity carried it to a greater range as to locality also. We cannot say that the court below committed any error in the admission of the evidence assigned for error.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Pennsylvania Railroad Co. versus Stranahan.\nIn an action against a railroad company for burning a barn by sparks from the engine, there was evidence that the fire commenced at or near the railroad track, and that engines had passed shortly before the barn was fired, raising the presumption that it was fired by sparks from an engine, the particular one not being known. Held, that evidence by a witness living nineteen miles from the barn that it was a common occurrence for engines about where he lived to set fire for rods from the track, was admissible.\nOctober 22d 1875.\nBefore Agnew, O. J., Sharswood, Williams, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Mrie county: Of October and November Term 1874, No. 230.\nThis was an action on the case, brought by John D. Stranahan, against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, for the burning of the barn of the plaintiff by sparks thrown from one of defendants\u2019 locomotives.\nThe plaintiff owned a farm about twenty-three miles from the city of Erie, through which the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad, operated by the defendants, is constructed. On the 6th of November 1867, the barn of the plaintiff was burned, as he alleged, by sparks from one of defendants\u2019 engines.\nThe evidence was that between two and three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the plaintiff\u2019s barn was discovered to be on fire; two trains, had passed about noon; the barn was about one hundred and fifty feet from the railroad. The fire appeared to have commenced at the fence on the road, and burned over the field to the barn. The sparks falling set fire in many places along the road.\nThe plaintiff proposed to show by a witness that he lived four miles from the court house, on the line of the railroad, and also to show by him the extent to which the locomotives on the road, going east on or about the 9th of November 1867, threw sparks from the smoke-stacks of same.\nObjected to by defendant for the reason that the location of the witness and his knowledge of the facts is too remote from the place where the injury is said to have occurred.\nThe court (Wetmore, P. J.) admitted the evidence and sealed a bill of exceptions for defendants.\nThe witness said \u201c it is a common occurrence for the engines to throw sparks\u2019 and set fire for rods from the railroad track. They were from a pea to a walnut in size. It appeared worse sometimes than others. They were usually freight trains. Sometimes passenger trains. It is heavy grade past my place.\u201d\nThere was other evidence that there were fires in many \u201cplaces\u201d on the day the barn was burned.\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff for $1392.40.\nThe defendants took a writ of error and assigned for error the admission of the evidence objected to.\nJ. R. Thompson, for plaintiff in error.\nW. Benson, for defendant in error,\ncited Frankf. & B. Turnpike Co. v. Phila. & T. Railroad Co., 4 P. F. Smith 345; Selden v. Hudson R. Railroad Co., 4 N.
