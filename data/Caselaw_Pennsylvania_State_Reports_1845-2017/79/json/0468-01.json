Other cases might be cited sustaining the same principle. The affidavit of defence was therefore clearly insufficient.\nJudgment affirmed..",

    "head_matter": "Roberts et al. versus Riddle.\n1. A guaranty of the payment of a written obligation \u201c according to its terms,\u201d is broken by non-payment when the time of payment arrives, and the guarantor is liable without pursuing the debtor to insolvency.\n2. Campbell v. Baker, 10 Wright 243, followed.\nNovember 22d 1875.\nBefore Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford county: Of October and November Term 1874, No. 158.\nThis was an action of assumpsit, brought February 14th 1874, by William Riddle against W. B. Roberts, J. W. Humphreys and W. H. Abbott. The cause of action was a guaranty of bond issued by the city of Titusville. The bond and guarantee (which was endorsed on it) were as follows:\u2014\n1,1 It is hereby certified that the city of Titusville is indebted unto William Riddle in the sum of $10,000, redeemable .at the pleasure of the city of Titusville after the 24th day of April 1872, and payable on the 23d day of June 1872, with interest at the rate of eight per cent, per annum. * * * This debt is., authorized by the Act of Assembly of the state of Pennsylvania, approved the 8th day of March, A. D. 1872.\u201d\n\u201c For value received, we, the undersigned, guaranty the payment of the within bond according to its terms. April 24th 1872.\u201d The guaranty was signed by the three defendants.\nThe affidavit of defence, filed March 18th 1874, was :\u2014\n\u201c W. B. Roberts and W. II. Abbott, being duly sworn according to law, depose and say that they are two of the defendants in this case, and that they, together with their co-defendant, have a full, just, and, as they are informed by counsel, a legal defence to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the nature and character of which is as follows : That the defendants were simply guarantors for the payment of the bonds of the city of Titusville, upon which suit is brought, and not liable until after the said plaintiff, by due diligence in effort to collect said claim from the said city of Titus-ville, has failed by reason of the insolvency of said city ; that the plaintiff has not made proper efforts to collect said bonds'from the city of Titusville, the obligor, which said city has abundant assets, property and facilities for paying or,causing said bonds to be paid.\u201d On the 21st of May 1874, the court entered judgment for the plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence ; the damages were liquidated at $12,584.54.\nThe defendants took a writ of error and assigned for error, entering judgment for want of an affidavit of defence.\nDouglass S; MOoy, for plaintiffs in error.\nA guarantor is liable only if the creditor uses diligence in pursuing the debtor : 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 221; Johnston v. Chapman, 3 Penna. Rep. 18; Rudy v. Wolf, 16 S. & R. 79 ; Gilbert v. Kenck, 6 Casey 205; Hoffman v. Bechtel, 2 P. F. Smith 190 ; James v. Scott, 9 Id. 178; Brown v. Brooks, 1 Casey 210 ; Woods v. Sherman, 21 P. F. Smith 100.\nJ. B. Brawley, for defendant in error.\nA guaranty of contract implies a concurrent act of the original agreement, and when made at the same time becomes the essential ground of credit given to the principal debtor ; the consideration extends to the promise of the principal debtor and also of the guarantor : Snevily v. Johnston, 1 W. & S. 309 ; Amsbaugh v. Gearhart, 1 Jones 482. The guaranty being for the performance of the original contract according to its terms, the guarantor was liable without pursuing the debtor to insolvency: Campbell v. Baker, 10 Wright 245. Such contract is in nature of suretyship : Shannon v. Roberts, 1 Grant 261; Ashton v. Bayard, 21 P. F. Smith 134."
