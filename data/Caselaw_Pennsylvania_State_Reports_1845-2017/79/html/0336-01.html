The plaintiffs, having gone to trial upon the pleadings, could not allege that the plea of “ covenants performed,” was a nullity : Brubaker <em>v. </em>Taylor, 26 P. F. Smith 83.

The plea of “ covenants performed,” <em>absque hoe, </em>would have put the onus upon the plaintiffs. Yet the addition of <em>absque hoe </em>would merely have put in issue performance by the "plaintiffs : 2 Troubat &amp; Haly 33; Martin <em>v. </em>Hammon, 8 Barr 270; Zents <em>v. </em>Legnard, 20 P.

If covenants be alternative and either be performed there is no breach. An election is given to the covenantor to perform either. But here a breach of the former covenant is necessary to give effect to the latter. Hence there is no election in such case, except that which arises from a determination to suffer the consequence of a breach. Here them the former covenant is broken, and its breach must be shown to entitle the plaintiff to resort to the secondary covenant to pay the damages. Hence the plea of “ covenants performed” applied only to the breach alleged in the declaration, to wit, of the covenant not to engage in business. Here the affirmative plea is pregnant with a negative, and casts the proof of the breach on the plaintiff. The words <em>absque hoe, </em>when added to the plea of covenants performed, apply to those covenants of the plaintiff which he must prove as a preliminary to a recovery. We discover no error in the record.</p>
