This street' crossed the Philadelphia and Erie railroad, of which the defendants are the lessees; at the place of crossing there were two railroad tracks of the defendants on the south, and four tracks of the Lake Shore and Michigan railroad further north. The defendants’ depot was west of the crossing at Parade street, and at the time of the disaster the train had just left the depot and was moving eastward.

Nothing north of there ; saw man down Parade street coming to track rather fast; he was about one or two tracks from ours. He did not stop; his horse seemed wild and wanted to go. I saw him just as he drove on to the Lake Shore track; I saw him plainly; he could have seen the train if he had looked; the bell was ringing at this time; he might not have seen engine, but could have seen ears ; no cars on west side, uidess way over on north track, but they did not obscure my view; plenty of cars on east side of track. Noticed him in particular, because he had a nice horse, and was driving so fast; he struck the horse with a whip just before he reached track ; can’t say 'how fast we were running ; we may have been running twelve miles an hour. I ran every day there ; heard the whistle by Crouch’s elevator ; think we were running as usual.”</p>

They had given evidence of the negligence of the defendants, and no contributory negligence of the deceased appeared. The presumption of law was that he had done all that a prudent man would do under the circumstances to preserve his own life, and that he had stopped and looked and listened : Penna. Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Weber, 26 P. F. Smith 157. The onus of proving contributory negligence was thus clearly cast upon the defendants. “ It is true,” says Mr. Justice Williams, “that when the plaintiff’s own evidence discloses contributory negligence there can be no recovery; but if it does not, the burden is on the defendant to disprove care; and in such case the question of negligence is for the jury.” ' It is clear, then, that there was error in the binding direction given by the learned judge to the jury to find for the defendants. The testimony of one witness that Jacob Weiss did not stop, and that he could have seen the train if he had looked, did not justify the court in taking the case from the jury. ' The fact that the horse the deceased was driving became frightened and unmanageable a short distance from the railroad, if the animal was a gentle one, and was frightened through the negligence of the defendants, and being beyond the control of the deceased, rushed on the track, was an important element bearing upon the case.</p>
