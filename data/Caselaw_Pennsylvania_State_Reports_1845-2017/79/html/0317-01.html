But it is argued that the affidavit required by the act is conclusive of the facts stated in it; among others, that -the petition did contain the names of three-fifths of the taxable inhabitants of the territory to be annexed. This .allegation would have force if the statute so provided, but it does not. Ex parte affidavits are, at best, but a very weak kind of evidence, and generally form but the ground of some preliminary or interlocutory action, but are never,, unless it be especially so pro<a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>vided by Act of Assembly or rule of court, the foundation for final judgment or decree. So in this case, the affidavit was primá, facie evidence that the petition was what it purported to he, an expression of the desire of not less than three-fifths of the taxable inhabitants of a portion of Wilkins township for annexation to the city of Pittsburg; and the councils might, under such warrant, proceed with «any preliminary action necessary to ascertain the main fact upon which the validity of their final action must depend. To give it a force beyond this, would be to raise, by implication from the act and a forced construction of it, evidence on which to rest a power such as can only be derived from the strict letter of the statute itself: Borough of West Philadelphia, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 281" data-case-ids="477900" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0281-01">5 W. &amp; S. 281</a>; Borough of Little Meadows, 4 Casey 256; Devore’s Appeal, 6 P.

The other question — the right of a private citizen to maintain a bill such as that upon which this case is founded — is hardly open for argument. So many are the cases in which such hills have been sustained that one might suppose this matter to be no longer open for debate.. It was held, in Sharpless <em>v. </em>The Mayor, &amp;c., 9 Harris 147; Moers <em>v. </em>Reading, Id. 188; Page <em>v. </em>Allen, 8 P. F. Smith 338; and more recently in Wells <em>et al. v. </em>Bain <em>et al., </em>25 P. F. Smith 39, that the interest of a taxpayer, when money is to be raised by taxation, or expended from the treasury, is sufficient to entitle him to maintain a bill to test the validity of the law which proposes the assessment or expenditure. If, then, such an interest he sufficient to enable one to test the validity of an election law, which, at most, could increase his tax but to a trifling degree, a fortiori, shall one, like the plaintiff, who is threatened by most burdensome impositions, have the power thus to inquire into the right by which the councils of Pittsburg propose to act in subjecting his person and property to their jurisdiction for the purposes of municipal government and taxation.</p>
