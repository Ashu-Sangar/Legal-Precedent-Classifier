Ahl, owned iron land in Franklin county, in the vicinity of the projected road, the title generally being in the name of D. Y. Ahl. Some land was purchased by him afterward, and about March 21st 1868 he had about 5000 acres. After some efforts by D. V. Ahl, with a view to selling his lands and building a railroad, which were not successful, the subject came to the knowledge of Richmond L. Jones, Esq., of Reading, .and after some correspondence, he and D. V. Ahl had a conference with reference to it, on the 23d of November 1868. A plan was proposed, of which a written memorandum was made. It was: to organize a company with $800,000 capital, to which were to be transferred the charter and stock of the Caledonia company; Ahl to convey his lands, about 5000 acres, to the company for $50,000 in money, $50,000 in the bonds of the company, and $50,000 in capital stock. Jones and his associates to pay into the treasury $450,000, of which $50,000 were to be paid to Ahl for the land, and $400,000 applied to the construction of a railroad from the land to Chambersburg, or some more expedient point. Jones and his associates to receive for their advance $450,000 in the bonds of the company and $450,000 in its capital stock. In the memorandum it was declared that it was not to be binding as an agreement. There was much correspondence between Ahl and Jones, in which secrecy as to their plans was enjoined by Ahl and assented to by Jones. Ahl having informed Jones that the charter of the Caledonia Company could be obtained, they agreed that the enterprise should be carried on under it, and, as the master found, they entered into it “for their individual profit, using the machinery of the corporation for the purpose.” It was at first supposed that the railroad to be built would be eighteen miles long. It was after-wards ascertained that it would be twenty-four miles. About January 1869, the plan stated in the memorandum was changed, and it was then arranged that the quantity of land to he conveyed by the Ahls should be increased to 10,000 acres; that Jones and his associates were to receive for the construction of the road $625,000 in stock at 50 per cent., and $625,000 in the bonds of the company at 50 per cent.; the Ahls to be paid for the 10,000 acres, including stock and personal property, $200,000 in stock at 50 per cent., and $200,000 in bonds at 50 per cent.</p>

Thus, it matters not in the present inquiry, that Jones’ contract for the construction of the road should have been $400,000 instead of $600,000, that the stock subscriptions were gotten on false representations, or that Mr. Ahl was to get too much or too little for his land, or that through misrepresentation he was induced to exchange a good security for one that was worthless. None of these things, nor the intention of the director's in executing this mortgage, can now be inquired into ; the day for this has gone by. What remains for us to do is simply and only to distribute the fund among those to whom of right it belongs.

If we understand the general idea contained in his exceptions, it is that the second mortgage was made chiefly for the purpose of securing to him the balance of the purchase-money resulting from his sale of lands to the company, and that therefore he had a vested right in the mortgage from the date of its execution. That the tender of the bonds was only a recognition of his pre-existing right, and that his refusal to accept them did not either extinguish or weaken that right. But we hold his position to be untenable in this, that the mortgage was executed, not to secure his purchase-money, but to secure two hundred bonds of $1000 each. How could the agreement of the company to give him eighty of these bonds create a specific lien in his favor in the mortgage itself ? Suppose the bonds had never been tendered to him; that the company, in violation of their agreement, had refused to deliver them to him, could he, nevertheless, have recovered his $80,000 through a scire facias on the mortgage? We think not. It does seem to us that in such case his remedy must lie, either in covenant upon the agreement, or in a bill to rescind that agreement and restore him to his rights under his former contract. We are at a loss to discern, as alleged by his very eminent counsel, how his case is bettered by his steadfast and persistent refusal to accept of these bonds. It looks to us that this was a fatal mistake that is now past remedy. It is no doubt true that the company acted in bad faith in permitting the judgments Nos. 2Q3 and 204, August Term of the Common Pleas of Franklin county, to precede the execution of the mortgage, but neither does this help Ahl’s status with reference to that, mortgage.</p>

Now whether these were bonfl fide purchases from Boyer, or were taken with the knowledge that they were confessed to him without consideration from him, and for the mere purpose of sale, matters not. Creditors cannot inquire into the good faith of the transaction, unless it covers a fraud intended to affect them. On this the authorities cited by the master are full and to the point.

By the terms of the Act of 8th April 1861, 1 Brightly 290 pi., 49, these purchasers became “ vested with all the right, title, interest, property, possession, claim, and demand in law and equity of, in and to such railroad, with its appertenances, and with all the rights, powers, immunities, privileges and franchises of the corporation.”</p>

Jurisdiction having attached, equity comprehends within its grasp all incidental matters necessary to enable it to make a full and final distribution, and, therefore, to terminate litigation, while it affords a perfect remedy : Souder’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 502. Hence, in Kelly’s Appeal, 4 Harris 59, in a question of distribution, involving partnership property and individual creditors, Judge Bell said: “ The objection that the court or auditor had no power to state an account between the partners, is met by the answer, that the distribution of the proceeds of sheriff’s sales is to be determined according to law and equity, and it cannot be questioned that in such a case a chancellor from necessity would direct an account to be taken.” See also Overholt’s Appeal, <a href="/nc/47/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Jones 222" data-case-ids="8682199" data-case-paths="/nc/47/0222-01">2 Jones 222</a>. The doctrine is precisely the same in regard to distribution among creditors and others, in the Orphans’ Court. “ The power,” says Lewis, C. J., “ to decide all questions necessary to a proper distribution of the fund, follows the power of distribution, and vests in the Orphans’ Court as a necessary incident to the jurisdiction:” Bull’s Appeal, 12 Harris 288; Kittera’s Estate, 5 Id. 416. He states this further proposition. “ The right of each (claimant) to be heard in support of his claim, and in opposition to every claimant who interferes with it, is necessarily involved in the right to demand payment out of the fund.” See also Dundas’ Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 474. It was, therefore, a grave error, on part of the master, instead of distributing the entire fund among the several claimants according to their rights, to award to the counsel of the Farmers’ National Bank of Reading, the Reading Savings Bank, and Bushong &amp; Brother, the sum of $109,771.24, representing ninety-seven second mortgage bonds, and their overdue coupons, and a like error to award to the Kensington National Bank $73,536.57, representing sixty-five second mortgage bonds, and their overdue coupons. He should have awarded to the several parties named, the actual amount of their real debt, with interest to the day of sale, and the excess should have been distributed among the other creditors according to their rights. The effect of léaving this excess in the hands of these creditors, who held the bonds as mere cellaterals, was to ignore both the jurisdiction and the duty of the court, to make distribution of the entire fund in its hands according to law and equity. The error of the master was, in assuming that Richmond L. Jones would be entitled to this excess which would pass into his hands from these creditors, who had received the bonds through him, as collateral for the company’s debts. But the right of Mr. Jones to participate in the fund against other <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>creditors, and especially against Daniel V. Ahl, is one of the important questions in the distribution.</p>
    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[153,494,1166,1419]]]'>This brings us to consider the claim of Mr. Ahl to eighty thousand dollars for purchase-money, and his right to receive the same out of the fund in court which was produced by a sale under the second mortgage of $200,000. The battle before the master appears to have been fought over the question of the delivery of eighty bonds, from No. 1 to No. 80 inclusive, set apart by the railroad company for Mr. Ahl, and sent to Kennedy &amp; Stewart, attorneys of the company, for delivery. These bonds were not delivered to Ahl, and were recalled by the company. On this ground the master thought that Mr. Ahl was not entitled to participate in the fund. But he misconceived Mr. Ahl’s claim. It did not rest on a sale and delivery of so many bonds, but on his prior right to so much money as these securities represented. It is because in equity he was by the terms of his antecedeut contract, the owner of so much of the mortgage which was raised under the terms of that contract to secure payment to him. of the remaining $80,000 purchase-money. He was therefore entitled to a place in the distribution of the fund produced by that mortgage unless a higher equity in third parties has supervened. A short statement will exhibit the nature and the equity of his claim. He was the vendor to the company of the property from which the fund has been produced. By the terms of his first agreement of sale, December 7th 1869, his deed to the railroad company was held in escrow in the hands of a third person as a security for their compliance with the terms of sale. The company found it necessary for their purpose to have the title absolutely in themselves, and came to a new arrangement with Mr. Ahl, on the 4th of June 1870, whereby he released his title to them and they agreed to pay him $50,000 in cash, instead of the judgment of $50,000 in the first agreement, and to deliver him $50,000 in first mortgage bonds and $80,000 in second mortgage bonds, in lieu of the $130,000 of stock and of $130,000 of bonds in the first agreement.</p>
    <p id="b183-7" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[149,1911,1164,520]],["BL_184.1",184,[282,405,1164,985]]]'>By the terms of the agreement of the 4th of June, the company were bound, within sixty days, to execute a second mortgage, not to exceed in amount $200,000, and to deliver to Ahl eighty one thousand dollar bonds, secured by his mortgage. This mortgage was not a thing <em>in esse </em>for which the parties were bargaining, but it was to be created as the means of securing the sum of the unpaid purchase-money. The agreement of the 4th of June 1870, was, therefore, to the extent of the $80,000 of purchase-money, a deed to lead the use of the mortgage and not a mere agreement, for a purchase. As soon as the mortgage was executed, Ahl’s right attached to it in equity by virtue of the prior agreement to lead its use, as to so much of it. The money represented by this por<a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>tion of the mortgage and the bonds was his. It never belonged to the company. He had parted with his title on the express condition of the security of the second ’mortgage. His part had been performed, and in equity his right attached immediately. To this extent'the bonds accompanying the mortgage were his, and they were actually numbered and set apart to him; vide Treasurer Maltzberger’s letters to’Ahl, of 28th November 1870. As between him and the company it is clear the latter had no right to withhold them, and could not by their breach of good faith, in placing upon the property an intervening encumbrance, make his refusal to accept the bonds, until the encumbrance was removed an excuse to transfer them to others. When they afterwards handed them over to R. L. Jones, they were guilty of a breach of trust, and he, with a full knowledge of the facts, as the evidence clearly proves, gained no title to them. Ahl had a right to demand that the judgments should be removed before the company could be entitled to claim a full performance, of their agreement. Even a tender refused by him on this ground would not change the ownership of so much of the mortgage and bonds ; to be effectual the tender must bo kept up, and if an admission of ownership — Ahl’s refusal, on the ground of the actual bad faith of the company, did not change his title in equity to the security of the mortgage, as the stipulated protection for his purchase-money. %</p>

L. Jones, were ineffectual to transfer title to him, unless he had been a bond, fide purchaser for value, without notice of the rights of Mr. Ahl. But unfortunately for Mr. Jones, on the question of notice, there is not a shadow of doubt. He was himself the party, as attorney in fact, for the company who made the agreement of the 4th of June 1870, and signed it as such attorney. He knew precisely what the rights of Mr. Ahl were. ° W. H. Kemble’s testimony also brings home notice to him, and in addition wé have the significant fact that the treasurer recalled the bonds from Kennedy &amp; .Stewart, by letter of the 15th of August 1871, and on the 23d of the same month they were handed over to Jones, and the further fact, that Jones was <em>the, factotum </em>of the company. These bonds are next found in the possession of the Farmers’ Bank of Reading, the Reading Savings Bank, and Bushong &amp; Brother, placed there by R. L. Jones, as collaterals for the security of overdue debts against the company, and Jones and others. In the present state of the law, it must be conceded that railroad bonds, such as these, pass by delivery, and are protected in the hands of boná fide holders for value without notice, in the same manner as negotiable paper. Whether these Reading parties are such boná fide holders for value, is not altogether clear. The master thought there was a new consideration, <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>to wit, forebearance. The question, however, merits further inquiry. We have already adverted to the fact that these Reading creditors and the Kensington National Bank, even if bond, fide holders, can draw from the <em>fund </em>only the real amount of their debt and interest, and not the whole amount of the bonds held as collaterals, and that the surplus must be distributed among the other creditors entitled to participate in the fund, whether Jones, or Ahl or others. Besides, some of these creditors hold other collaterals for the same debts, received from R. L. Jones, who under the facts may be compelled to suffer other creditors, claimants on the fund, to be subrogated to these securities, or, which is the same thing,1 that these securities shall extinguish so much of the debts for which he placed the second mortgage bonds as collaterals along with them.- This is a proper subject of inquiry in making a new distribution. The principle of equitable substitution which displaces one lien creditor to make way for another, lower in the list, by reason of a superior equity in the latter, is one often acted upon. See the following cases: Erb’s Appeal, <em>2 </em>Penna. 296; Himes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, <a href="/watts/8/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts 39" data-case-ids="1848377" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0039-01">8 Watts 39</a>; Worrall’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20524" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Wright 524">5 Wright 524</a>; Barnes’. Appeal, 10 Id. 350. It is therefore a proper subject of inquiry, how far R. L. Jones, in pledging the bonds equitably belonging to Mr. Ahl, with a full knowledge of his rights, will not be postponed to him; and how far other collaterals, pledged along with these bonds, will not be required to exonerate these bonds, if found to be in the hands of boná fide holders for value. The argument so vehemently pressed that Mr. Ahl has received enough for his property, cannot be countenanced in a state where contracts have the protection of constitutional sanction. Courts cannot make new contracts for litigants. Under the agreement of June 4th 1870, the $80,000 of purchase-money is entitled to the same protection that is given to the first dollar paid upon the property.</p>

On 24th August the directors resolved to call in the stock subscriptions. Up to this time there had been no absolute agreement as to the conveyance of the land ; other land had been articled for and leases to Jones and Ahl procured.

May 1st 1870, the'time when Ahl’s $50,000 judgment-bond would be due,'he applied to Jones for payment; Jones declined to pay unless Ahl would cancel the agreement of December 7th 1869, telling him that the agreement did not express their original understanding, but that Ahl had taken advantage of the circumstances in which Jones had been placed to enforce its execution. The recording of the agreement had brought it to the notice of Mr. Watts, president of the’Cumberland Valley Railroad Company, who had been advancing money to the Southern Pennsylvania Company under their agreement; he refused to advance any more money unless the agreement of December 7th 1869 was cancelled. This brought about the agreement of June 4th 1870, heretofore referred to, by which, amongst other things, Ahl was to receive $80,000 in second mortgage bonds. In order to pay Ahl’s judgment, the company had authorized the president to borrow $75,000 on the company’s note, with judgment-bond and pledge of the corporation bonds as security. To raise this money Jones commenced a negotiation with the Farmers’ National Bank of Reading, of which H. H. Muhlenberg was cashier, and the Reading Savings Bank, of which E. P. Boas was cashier, and his father, A. F. Boas, president; E. P. Boas was also a director of the Southern Pennsylvania Company. To cover the usury to be paid, the company executed to Boyer the judgment-bond mentioned in the first master’s report, and two notes, dated June 1st 1870, to the order of McCarty, their president, for the same amounts; these notes were endorsed by McCarty and Jones; one of the notes was discounted by each of the banks, and the proceeds, $28,957.54 in the Savings Bank and $28,947.41 in the Farmers’ Bank, credited to Boyer; the discount was taken from these sums, and but $25,000 on each note paid to Boyer, who was to be paid for his services one-fourth of one per cent. The master found that the company owed him nothing; that the transaction was a loan to the company by the banks of $25,000 each for two years. Jones went to Chambersburg, and on June 4th 1870 paid Ahl by the treasurer’s checks $38,956, which was credited on his judgment, delivered to him the $50,000 first mortgage bonds, and the agreement for changing their arrangements was concluded; the judgments assigned to Boas and the bank were entered in Franklin county June 9th 1870. The balance, $11,544 of Ahl’s judgment, was paid July 16th 1870. Jones’s action in these matters was approved by the directors at a meeting June 25th. Ahl wrote to the secretary for the $80,000 of bonds on the 2d of September 1870, and again on the 25th of October 1870.

George Rice, one of the directors, was one of the sub-contractors of Jones for the building of the Southern Pennsylvánia road. The “ improvements” contemplated by the company were building a railroad from the road of the Southern Pennsylvania Company through their land to their ore-banks, and the various apparatus to prepare the ore for market. George Rice was to make these improvements for $75,000. .He was to pay for them, the other stockholders to be credited on their stock for this amount, Rice to get $25,000 of stock for nothing; and to be reimbursed for his outlay by being permitted to mine a certain quantity of ore. No money was ever paid into the treasury; no contract was made by Rice with the St. Charles Company,'but the arrangement was by an “understanding” between him and the officers of the Southern Pennsylvania Company. On the 19th of November 1870, the two .companies made a contract by which the St. Charles Company was to mine and prepare for the market, iron-ore not exceeding 20,000 tons per month, and deliver it on the Southern Pennsylvania Company’s road, for which that company were to pay them $1.50 per ton; the St. Charles to have the right also to mine for their own furnaces at fifty cents per ton. Rice commenced the improvements in the winter of 1871-1872.

The reduction of these judgments to the amount actually loaned by the banks, was right, and needs no discussion. Next comes the mortgage of $200,000. This also must be fully paid to the extent that the bonds are in the hands of boná fide holders for value. After which, if there be any surplus, it must be applied to the subsequent judgment.</p>
    <p id="b201-11" data-blocks='[["BL_201.8",201,[126,1212,1178,1074]]]'>The principal contention is over the second mortgage bonds. It is important to understand where they are, and by whom, and for what purpose held. The entire number, two hundred, of one thousand dollars each, were issued by the company, and are now held as follows: sixty-five thereof are held by the Kensington Bank as collateral security for two loans, aggregating $33,000, made to the company ; fifty of these bonds so pledged to the Kensington Bank, belong to Richmond L. Jones, and were a portion of a batch of seventy-five of said second mortgage bonds, issued to him by the company in lieu of $50,000 of the first mortgage bonds of said company, which he was entitled to receive upon account of his contract for the construction of the road. Mr. Jones agreed to receive these second mortgage bonds, and they were formally delivered to him in satisfaction of his claim to the first mortgage bonds. His title to them is therefore complete. Subsequently, as the master finds, he pledged fifty of these bonds ($50,000), with fifteen of the second mortgage bonds ($15,000), belonging to the company with Charles T. Yerkes, Jr., in order to raise money for the company; Yerkes obtained the money from the Kensington Bank and deposited the said sixty-five bonds as collateral. The bonds so pledged are liable to the bank for the amount of money loaned thereon. After the debt due the bank is paid, Mr. Jones is entitled to so many of the said bonds as may remain, and to come in upon the fund to that extent, unless prevented by a higher equity in some one else.</p>

His claim was properly allowed by the master. So, also, the claim of John Rice as to twenty-five ($25,000) of said bonds. There are ninety-seven ($97,000) of the bonds remaining. They are held by H. H. Muhlenberg, in trust for the Reading banks before mentioned, and for Messrs. Bushong &amp; Brother, bankers, as collateral for certain loans and advances made to the company. Said loans include the two judgments of $25,000 each, to which reference has already been made. These transactions were arranged by Richmond L. Jones, by authority of the company. In order to enable him to raise money for the corporation, as well as to secure him upon his own endorsements, and those of his friends, all that remained of the second mortgage bonds, amounting to one hundred and twelve ($112,000), were placed in the hands of Mr. Jones. Among the bonds thus handed over to him and pledged for the benefit of the company, and which are now held for account of the Reading banks and Messrs. Bushong &amp; Brother, are eighty of these second mortgage bonds ($80,000), Nos. 1 to 80 inclusive. These bonds were originally issued to Daniel V. Ahl, by the company, and intended as part payment for the ore-lands sold by Mr. Ahl to the said company. By his contract with the latter, Ahl was entitled to $80,000 of second mortgage bonds. When they were tendered him he refused to receive them, for the reason that the judgments of the Reading banks had been entered up before the second mortgage was executed and recorded. The effect of this was to make the mortgage a third instead of a second lien. These eighty bonds were sent to Messrs. Kennedy &amp; Stewart, attorneys-at-law, Chambersburg, Pa., for the purpose of delivery to Mr. Ahl, who refused to receive them as before stated. Upon this point the master finds the following facts: “ Shortly after November 28th 1870, Mr. Ahl called on Messrs. Kennedy &amp; Stewart, and he was told by them that they had the bonds to deliver to him, and would get them from the bank for him. He declined to accept the bonds, said they need not go and get them, and gave as his reason that the bonds were not, as he said, second mortgage bonds, such as he was entitled to receive under the agreement. This objection and refusal were made to Messrs. Kennedy &amp; Stewart repeatedly between that time and August 1871. He was accompanied by his counsel, and he asked Messrs. Kennedy &amp; Stewart to use their influence to get the officers of the company to remove the judgments ; and he was informed by them that Mr- Jones said it could not be done. Messrs. Kennedy &amp; Stewart regarded his refusal as final and conclusive.” Subsequently, as the. master finds, when the company became further embarrassed, and Mr. Ahl learned that they were in the hands of other parties as collateral, he expressed regret that he had not taken them, and said that he had been badly advised. Yet even then, he did not <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>allege that they belonged to him. Now, he claims these eighty bonds, and says that after setting them apart for him, the company had no right to authorize Jones to pledge them for its debts. That his refusal to accept them did not in equity change the property in the bonds, and that it was open for him to accept them at any time. This claim amounts to nothing as regards the Reading banks and Bushong &amp; Brother. They are holders for value, and the bonds passed by delivery. Nor is it valid against other lien-creditors of the company. Mr. Ahl has no legal claim upon the bonds or the fund before us. This is a question of lien. Mr. Ahl has no lien. The mortgage was a lien, but it was for the protection of the bonds issued under it, and which it was intended to secure. Aside from the ownership of the bonds, or a portion of them, Mr. Ahl has no interest, legal or equitable, in the mortgage. It was not created for bis benefit, but for the purpose of enabling the company to raise funds to meet its obligations. Among those liabilities was the §80,000 due Mr. Ahl. He was offered the security of the mortgage and declined it. He deliberately rejected the bonds when tendered. He rejected them under the advice of counsel. He certainly had a purpose in view in doing this. The bonds offered were not such a security as under his agreement he was entitled to receive. But they were the best the company could give him, and he was fully aware of this. He knew they could not raise the money to satisfy the judgments. He had already received the money realized upon the latter. _ He could only have had in view', therefore, the obtaining of better terms from this already embarrassed company. At that time he was still in possession of the furnace. He saw-they could not comply with the letter of the contract by giving him bonds which should be a second lien. He had a right of present action against the corporation, either for breach of covenant, or for the unpaid purchase-money. He could enforce this right by suit, or avail himself of it as a defence to an action of ejectment. He may very well have preferred a judgment payable presently, to even second mortgage bonds payable at a distant day. Whatever may have been his motive for rejecting the bonds, it is undisputed that he did reject them, and he must be held to all the legal consequences of his act. After such rejection the company had full control and dominion over them. They could sell them in the market, or pledge them for their debts. Ahl had no further claim upon them. He had a right of action against the company, nothing more.</p>

He has no standing in a court of equity to claim anything of this company until its debts are fully paid. The stockholders have an equity which entitles them to have its assets applied to the payment of its liabilities before Mr. Ahl can be allowed to lay his hand upon a dollar of its effects. This equity of the stockholders <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>enures to the benefit of the judgment creditors of the company.

We need only to refer to a few, about which there is little dispute. This corporation was gotten up by Daniel Y. Ahl and Richmond L. Jones. Each had an object. Ahl wanted to sell his ore-lands, and Jones desired the contract to build the road. Each succeeded in his purpose. Ahl sold his lands and Jones obtained the contract. They controlled the corporation absolutely. Ahl held a large majority of the stock originally, and elected a board of directors to do the work that Mr. Jones, his co-schemer, required done. There was the form of an organization; there were a few outside stockholders scooped up by Ahl’s net; but for all practical purposes the corporation was Ahl &amp; Jones, or Jones &amp; Ahl, it is not material which. In considering the question whether these gentlemen are entitled to any portion of the fund, we must scrutinize closely the contract made by each with the company. While the right of a stockholder to contract with his corporation and become its creditor, is conceded as a general proposition, the right of a person controlling a corporation to contract with it, rests upon entirely different principles, if it exists at all. Where a person has the actual control of a corporation, whether such control arises from the ownership of a majority of the shares, or from his position or influence, and enters into a contract with such corporation, he is to be held to the most rigid good faith. The onus is upon him to show the fairness of the transaction, if it is called in question. It is a principle too well settled to be now successfully controverted, that the promoters, directors or agents of a company, shall not make a profit out of it in buying lands for it, or in dealing with it. This principle runs through all the fiduciary relations : Simons <em>v. </em>Oil company, 11 P. F.

Tried by this crucial test what becomes of Mr. Ahl’s contract for the sale of his ore-lands ? The master finds that in his first negotiations with Jones, Ahl put his 5400 acres at $100,000, which was probably their full value. It is clear that the price originally contemplated for the lands was $50,000 in cash, $50,000 in stock and $50,000 in bonds. Yet after the company had been organized; after over $100,000 in outside subscriptions to the stock had been made, Ahl demands better terms. He had the company at a disadvantage, and he virtually .compels the agreement of December 9th 1869, by which he was to have $50,000 in money, $130,000 in bonds, and $120,000 in stock, for about <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>three-fourths of the laud which he had previously estimated at, and was willing to sell for §100,000. It was no answer to this to say, that as the previous negotiations had not been closed up Mr. Ahl had the right to make the best terms he could. This might have been so had he been dealing with' a stranger at arm’s length. ’ But he was not. He was dealing with a corporation that was practically his own creature. He was in effect dealing with himself. The agreement of December 7th, was virtually forced upon the company. So far as Mr. Ahl is concerned, that agreement was a fraud in law and a fraud in fact. That a man may get up a corporation for the purpose of selling his lands, and after gathering in a few innocent and unfortunate stockholders, from whom his purpose is studiously concealed, proceed to put off his lands upon them, not at a fair price, but for such sum as his avarice or the helpless condition of the company may tempt him to exact, is a proposition too monstrous to obtain the sanction of a court of equity. I am aware that a loose morality has prevailed to some extent in railroad and monetary affairs. It may be in part the result of the speculations induced by an inflated currency, and must run its course until checked by the reaction of a more healthy public sentiment.</p>
    <p id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[141,1335,1167,304]]]'>It will thus be seen that Mr. Ahl has no claim to any portion of the ninety-seven bonds. They were specifically pledged <em>by </em>authority of the company for certain claims of the Reading banks and Bushong &amp; Brother. I have already said that the latter were holders for value, and that the bonds passed by delivery. The master was clearly right in awarding to these claimants the amount of their claim for which said bonds were so pledged.</p>

Jones to the remainder of the bonds held by the Kensington Bank, after the debt of said bank is satisfied. He is of opinion that the claims of Ahl and Jones rest upon similar principles. Fortunately for Mr. Jones, the facts are different. The master does not find that the contract between Mr. Jones and the company for constructing the road was a fraud upon said company. Nor that he afterwards sought to alter it, and used his position to extort different and oppressive terms. He made bis contract and adhered to it faithfully. We have no means of knowledge as to rvhat extent it was profitable. Nor was Mr. Jones a party to Ahl’s fraud in the sale of his ore lands. He resisted it as far as he could. We think the master was right in finding that Richmond L. Jones contemplated no fraud upon the company. His chief offence appears to have been the undertaking of a work entirely disproportioned to his means; This involved struggles and shifts to raise money. That some of his transactions while thus engaged were irregular, is apparent. But we fail to perceive in any of them an intent to defraud the company. His acts, w’hether good or bad, appear to <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>have been the result of an honest endeavor to save the credit of the corporation. If, in the struggle, he has to some extent damaged his own, the punishment is by no means inconsiderable. The law does not require that we should add to it the loss of his bonds. The master has reported against his individual claim. <em>We </em>do not see any sufficient reason to disturb this finding; but his claim as a bondholder to the residue of the sixty-five second mortgage bonds, after satisfying the claim of the Kensington Bank, should have been allowed.</p>

Bushong &amp; Bro., upon a judgment entered against R. L. Jones for $5333.33, and also upon a note for $250. He also rejected the claim of the Reading' Savings Bank upon a note of R. L. Jones for $5806.91. These liabilities were incurred by Mr. Jones on the faith of the resolutions of April and May 1871. It is conceded they were for the benefit of the company. Are the holders of these claims entitled to the protection of the ninety-seven second mortgage bonds ? The principle is well settled, that where a surety, or a person standing in the position of a surety, for the payment of a debt, receives security for his indemnity, and to discharge such indebtedness, the principal creditor is in equity entitled to the benefit of that security, and it makes no difference that the principal creditor did not know of this at the'time, or give credit on the faith of it: Cornwell's Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 305" data-case-ids="481739" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0305-01">7 W. &amp; S. 305</a>; Erb’s Appeal, 2 Penna. R. 296; Himes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, <a href="/watts/8/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="8 Watts 39" data-case-ids="1848377" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0039-01">8 Watts 39</a>; Carman <em>v. </em>Noble, 9 Barr 366; Hancock’s Appeal, 10 Casey 155. The master concedes the truth of this general proposition, but says, substantially, that Jones’ relations to the company are such, that as surety, he is not entitled to claim, and that, therefore, these holders are not. We do not regard this position as sound. The debts upon which the claims are based, were contracted for the use of the company. The latter received the consideration. The bonds were placed in the hands of Jones to cover these among other liabilities. It is true they were not specifically pledged by Jones for these claims. But they were pledged <em>to </em>Jones <em>by </em>the company, for the purpose of procuring these loans, and therefore the holders of the claims are entitled to the benefit of the security. This right does not depend upon the equities between Jones and the company, arising out of other transactions. There is a surplus of bonds in the hands of the trustees. What disposition shall be made of them ? It is clear that Jones is not entitled to them as security for any balance the company may owe him on his individual account. They were not pledged as security for any such indebtedness to him, and if they were, the master has not found that the company is indebted to him, or that he is liable as guarantor or otherwise, for any other moneys obtained for the use of the company on the pledge or security of the bonds. The surplus bonds, therefore, whatever <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>their amount, belong to the company, which is not entitled to any portion of the fund until its debts are paid.</p>

If the language of our decree will bear such a construction, it must be modified. The interest is the product of the principal. Each of the parties is entitled to interest in exact proportion to his share of the capital earning such interest. So likewise as to the increase of the fund.
