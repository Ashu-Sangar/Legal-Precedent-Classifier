In 1862 or 1863, one Stephen H. Valentine made a contract with Buckley to purchase this land, and he also had a contemporaneous contract or arrangement with MeLallen to sell the sameland to him or to him and his wife. If you believe the evidence for the defence, the defendant was to furnish part of the purchase-money and to have an interest in or security on the land for her money. There is no dispute that she had some money, and if you believe the testimony of Thompson, Henry MeLallen admitted that the defendant’s money helped pay for the land. If the contract between Valentine and MeLallen and his wife was, that she was to .have an interest in the land when purchased, a deed made to carry out this contract, not made in pursuance of its terms, would not bind the purchasers of the land unless accepted with a knowledge of the difference between the terms of the deed and the terms of the contract. In the case of a party able to read a deed, the presumption would be that he received it with full knowledge of its <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>contents, but in a case where the grantee of the deed could neither read nor write, and in the absence of any evidence that the contents of the deed were made known to him, no such presumption could arise, and if as soon as the mistake was found out the grantee repudiated the deed, we think such repudiation would avoid the deed, for to hold otherwise would enable a grantor to practice a fraud upon an ignorant grantee. If then you believe from the evidence' that the original intention of MeLallen and his wife was to purchase this land jointly, and have the deed to them so made, and they or either of them ignorantly accepted a deed not in accordance with their intentions in this respect, which was repudiated by them as soon as its contents was known to them, it was no conveyance to them of the land in dispute.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[156,968,1171,1327]]]'>“ If the understanding between Valentine and Buckley 'was, that the deed from Buckley to MeLallen was for the purpose of carrying out the arrangement between Valentine and MeLallen and wife, and if the deed was not in accordance with that contract, and was accepted by MeLallen under the circumstance before referred to, the delivery of that deed to MeLallen did not so convey the land to him that it could not be corrected by a new deed in pursuance of the real contract; and after the destruction of the first deed, with the knowledge and consent of all the parties to the contract, we are of the opinion that the second deed conveyed a good title to the grantees in that second deed. But even if Mc-Lallen did accept the first deed, with full knowledge of its contents, if the purchase-money was paid in part by the defendant here, under an arrangement on his part that she should have an interest in the land, and afterwards he assented that the deed which did not carry out this arrangement should be destroyed and a new one to himself and wife jointly be made in pursuance of the original understanding, we are of the opinion that the second deed conveyed a good title to the land, and that MeLallen was by his acts in connection with the second deed estopped from gainsaying the sufficiency of the last deed, and his children are in no better situation in that respect than he was. * * * If this second deed was made to induce her to use money to pay for the land, and with the assent of all the parties, it was a good consideration to Henry MeLallen and sufficient in equity to sustain the new arrangement as against MeLallen, and the plaintiff cannot recover. MeLallen had a right as against himself to treat the first deed as no conveyance of the title to the land and to surrender the deed for destruction, and, with the assent of all parties, have a new deed made to himself' and wife or to his wife alone, if he did not thereby convey to her more than a fair share of his estate.</p>

It had been agreed that the deed should be made to McLallen and his wife, and it was made to him alone. He accepted it, but there was evidence that he could not read. When Mrs. McLallen discovered that she was not named in it as grantee, she refused to receive it, and declared that she would not advance the purchase-money for the payment of which, as part of the contract, she had stipulated. It was destroyed by the common consent of the parties, and a new deed to the defendant and her husband was prepared and delivered. There was nothing in the relations of the parties, and nothing in the subject-matter of the contract, to stand in the way of the agreement which was made to substitute the second conveyance for the first. Indeed, upon the facts found by the jury, it would have been a fraud upon the plaintiff if the purchase-money had been obtained from her upon the delivery of the first deed to her husband.

The very subject of the controversy was the land which had been conveyed jointly to her husband and herself. She was asserting title to it in a suit with her husband’s representatives. And her testimony was in relation to circumstances which occurred at the very time when the joint title was acquired. Inseparable as her interest was from that of her husband in his lifetime, it became adverse to that of his heirs when upon his death they set up a claim to the property! An inquiry into the transactions that resulted in the conveyance by Buckley to Mr. and Mrs. McLallen was necessary in order to ascertain the relation to the title which each of the parties bore. To permit the defendant to testify to those transactions was to create the inequality against which Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner, 16 P. F. Smith 297, proves it was the object of the proviso to the 1st section of the Act of the 15th of April 1869, to guard. The question here is not distinguishable from that which arose in Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner. The death of her husband sealed the defendant’s lips, for she became at once, as to the plaintiffs, the surviving party to a transaction out of which the adversary claims involved in this litigation have grown.</p>
