It, therefore, became necessary to establish the fact by such proof as rendered the belief a certain fact. This could be done, not by the proof that a certain engine emitted sparks incessantly, for <em>non constat </em>that this particular engine had passed the plaintiff’s premises on that day. Hence it was necessary to permit the party to show that the emitting of coals and sparks in <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>unusual' quantities was frequent and permitted to be done by a number of engines. Tbe range of the evidence in this respect of necessity carried it to a greater range as to locality also.
