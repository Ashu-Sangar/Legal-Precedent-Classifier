This includes every imaginable sort or kind of moneyed capital, and was taxable for county purposes until the Act of April 4th 1868. This act provides as follows: ‘That all mortgages, &amp;c., * * * shall be exempt from all taxation except for state purposes; and that from and after the first day of December next no taxes of any description shall be assessed or collected except for state purposes, on or from mortgages, judgments, recognisances, or moneys owing upon articles of agreement for the sale of real estate, Tyhether made and executed before or after the passage of this act.’ The plain<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>tiff’s counsel contend that by the provisions of this act there is moneyed capital exempt from all taxation except for state purposes, and consequently the Act of Congress which provides that the shares of national banks shall not he taxed by a state ‘ at a greater rate than is assessed upon any other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state,’ exempts national bank shares from all taxation except for state purposes. But I do not think this is the reasonable construction of the Act of Congress. When the Act of Congress restricts the rate of taxation so that it shall not be at a greater rate than that upon any other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state, the intention of Congress was to prevent the shares of national banks from being taxed at a greater rate than other moneyed capital was taxed by the general laws of the state taxing this kind of property. It was not intended that if a state excepted some particular items of moneyed capital from taxation, leaving every other imaginable sort and kind subject to taxation under the general laws taxing moneyed capital, that the shares of national banks should come within the exception and not within the general rule. If a state exempts the purchase-money payable on the sale of real estate from taxation, to avoid the injustice of double taxation, by taxing first the land in the name of the vendee and the unpaid purchase-money in the name of the vendor, leaving all other moneyed capital of its citizens subject to taxation, I cannot think that Congress intended that such exemption would preclude the state from taxing the shares of national banks in the hands of her citizens. Suppose the same provision was made by Congress as to the taxation of the real estate of national banks, if it could be made constitutionally, could it be urged with the semblance of plausibility, that because the state exempted from taxation churches, cemeteries, colleges, academies, &amp;c., therefore the state could not tax the real estate of national banks ? This would be a case in every respect analogous to the present. I am, therefore, of opinion that Congress did not intend that the shares of national banks should fall within particular exemptions from the general law, but be subject to its provisions as all other moneyed capital in the state, which is not excepted from the general provisions of the general tax laws.</p>

The 3d section of this act enacts, ‘ That all the shares of national banks, located within the state, and of banks and savings institutions incorporated by the state, shall be taxable for state purposes at the rate of three mills per annum upon the assessed value thereof, and for county, school, municipal and local purposes, at the same rate as now is or may hereafter be assessed and imposed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of other individual citizens of this state.’ The 4th section of the same act provides — ‘ That in case any hank or savings institution <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>as aforesaid shall elect to collect annually from the stockholders thereof a tax of one per centum upon the par value of all the shares of said bank or savings institution, and pay the same into the state treasury, on or before the 20th day of January in every year, the said shares, capital and profit shall be exempt from all other taxation under the laws of this Commonwealth.’</p>

This subjects the shares of all banks and savings institutions to a three mill state tax, and to county, school, borough or township taxes at the same rate assessed upon other moneyed capital of the citizens of the state. Under this section it cannot be questioned that national bank shares are subject to pay the same taxes that are imposed by the laws of the state on other moneyed capital, except the state tax which is limited to three mills, leaving the county, school and municipal taxes to the limits imposed by the laws of the state. •</p>

But when is the bank required to elect and pay into the state treasury? The act says on the 20th day of January in every year. But the act was passed on the 31st of March 1870. Certainly the legislature could not have intended that the bank should elect to pay and pay to the state the one per centum tax more than two months before there was any law requiring it to do so.
