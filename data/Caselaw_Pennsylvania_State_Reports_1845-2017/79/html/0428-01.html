S. Sayers had died seised of a tavern in Waynesburg, a tract of eighty acres and a piece of seven acres of land in Franklin township ; and some other pieces of real estate, and also an interest in other lands; the petition further represented that “ said real estate is unprofitable to his said wards and in such a state of dilapidation and decay that it would be to the <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>interest of his said wards to have the same sold.” He therefore prayed for an order to sell the real estate; an order of sale was awarded. Shortly after this and before the day of the sale, Ephraim died. On the 81st of March 1866, the guardian reported that he had sold the tavern for $3532, “ the widow’s dower to be released,” one-third of the purchase-money to be paid on the confirmation of the sale, the other two-thirds to be paid in two annual payments; also the two parcels of land in Franklin township, for $2569, “ the widow’s dower to be released and the purchasers to receive a title to the whole estate, as well the interest of the deceased child as the widow and surviving child,” the payments to be as those of the tavern; that other parts of real estate were sold for $692, the widow’s dower to remain in it, one-half of two-thirds to paid in one year, and the other in two years, &amp;c. The sale was confirmed on the same day.</p>

After the confirmation of the sale, the widow executed to the purchasers a release of her entire interest.</p>

Lindsey, and died in the spring of 1870, intestate, leaving no children, but leaving her husband, to whom administration of her estate was granted. Knox, at June Term 1870, settled the account of his guardianship, showing in his hands a balance of $5062.62, which was the subject of the distribution under consideration.</p>

In support of this view, it is urged that the policy of law is hostile to the conversion of the real estate of minors into money, and that the Act of April 13th 1853, commonly known as the Price Law, being so beneficial and remedial in its purposes, that it should be held to be exclusive in its operation, and embrace all sales made under order of the Orphans’ Court, where a fund is left for distribution.</p>

The law may be adverse to the conversion of the real estate of minors into money, but it is rather to save the estate of the minor from loss than to protect any contingent interest that might be affected by a conversion, and at any rate the argument can have but little force after the conversion has been effected, and we can see nothing in the act itself to warrant the general application contended for. * * *</p>

The reason given is the dilapidation of the property, and the specific object “the interest of the minor.” In view of the provisions of the Act of April 13th 1853, so minutely enumerated as to the petition, the order, the sale, the return and confirmation, and the acknowledgment of the deed, were observed by the guardian, and it • is safe to conclude, that the proceedings" were not under that act, but were under the prior law before referred to. * * *</p>

But after it has so vested in the persons entitled, it is to be treated as money in his hands, and, in case of his subsequent death, goes to his personal representatives as personal estate.
