We are of the opinion that, if the company had been in the habit of carrying the plaintiff on this train without a ticket, its agents had no right to eject her from the car, unless she had notice of the change of the rule. It matters not how she had that notice, if she did have it before she went upon the train, the conductor had a right to put her off, using as much force as was necessary for that purpose, and putting her off in a reasonably proper place.” ********</p>
