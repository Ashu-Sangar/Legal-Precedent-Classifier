In so doing he failed to perform an essential act under such circumstances imposed upon him by law, one which the law considers necessary for her protection. If the mode followed in this case had been considered sufficient, the legislature could easily have said, when enacting this form: ‘ or said justice shall otherwise satisfy himself that the said wife otherwise had knowledge of the contents.’ But the act does not so read.

No matter what the magistrate may have sworn to upon the trial, the plaintiffs were entitled to have his official act go to the jury-</p>
    <p id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[145,832,1171,1028]]]'>The certificate of a justice of the peace of the acknowledgment of a deed or mortgage is a judicial act. It is conclusive of the facts certified to in the absence of fraud or duress. This is the current of all the authorities in this state: Jamison <em>v. </em>Jamison, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%20457" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Whart. 457">3 Wharton 457</a> ; Hall <em>v. </em>Patterson, 1 P. F. Smith 289; McCandless <em>v. </em>Engle, Id. 309. In the case first cited, it was held that parol evidence of what passed at the time of the acknowledgment was not admissible for the purpose of contradicting the certificate, except in cases of fraud and imposition. In a number of cases parol evidence has been freely admitted to overthrow the certificate, as in Michener <em>v. </em>Cavender, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20337" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Wright 337">2 Wright 337</a>; Louden <em>v. </em>Blythe, 4 Harris 541; and Schrader <em>v. </em>Decker, 9 Barr 14. But in all these cases gross fraud and imposition had been practised, affecting the acknowledgment itself. There is another class of cases in which parol evidence has been admitted to show facts <em>de hors </em>the certificate, as in Keen <em>v. </em>Coleman, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20299" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 Wright 299">3 Wright 299</a>, where a married woman fraudulently represented that she was a widow. The true rule deducible from the authorities is, that the certificate of the justice of the acknowledgment of a deed or mortgage is a judicial act, and in the absence of fraud or duress, conclusive as to the facts therein stated. A purchaser, bond, fide, and without notice of the fraud, is protected against it; but as to all other persons parol evidence has been admitted to show fraud or duress connected with the acknowledgment.</p>
    <p id="b83-7" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[145,1861,1164,205]]]'>There was not a particle of evidence in this case to indicate either fraud or duress in anything that occurred at the magistrate’s office.
