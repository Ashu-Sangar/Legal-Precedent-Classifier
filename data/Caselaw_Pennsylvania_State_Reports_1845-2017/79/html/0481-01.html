The sale was made by his committee on leave of the court. The appellant claims the money should be applied to a judgment in his favor on the land sold. After the entry of this judgment, Clinton was by inquisition duly found to be an habitual drunkard. It does not appear that the court then made any order in regard to the payment of the costs attending the inquisition, as is made its duty by the second section of the Act of 16th April 1849, Purd. Dig. 981, pi. 13. Those costs appear to be unpaid. There now appearing to be no personal estate out of which they can be paid, the auditor reported and the court decreed that they be paid out of the proceeds of the real estate. The fund is insufficient to pay the judgment of the appellant. If these costs are thus paid, it takes that amount from the appellant, which he would otherwise receive on his judgment.</p>

In the absence of any order or decree of the court charging these costs on the estate of the lunatic, I am unable to see how they have the forcé of a lien. But surely they cannot now occupy any better position than if the court had, on the confirmation of the proceedings, made an order of record that they be paid out of the estate. If they had then become a recorded lien, they would not thereby have acquired a preference over the prior judgment lien of the appellant. It is urged, however, that the expenses incurred in conducting the proceedings in lunacy should be paid out of the estate in the hands of the committee. • Weir <em>v. </em>Myers, 10 Casey 377, is cited in support of this view. The correctness of that case is conceded whenever the facts admit of its application. No question arose there in regard to a prior lien on real estate. Nor does it appear that the fund then in the hands of the committee for distribution arose from the sale of real estate. The question now is not whether the costs of the proceedings shall be paid by the committee out of the assets in his hands, but whether he can take from a prior judgment-creditor the fruit of his vested lien ? We are clearly of the opinion that he cannot thus divert the property which in equity belongs to another. The second and third assignments are sustained.</p>

The data given is insufficient to enable us to separate them on correct principles. Such as are reasonably connected with, or necessarily leading to the sale, should be paid out of the proceeds <em>; </em>all preceding items should be disallowed.</p>

To settle this, an issue is now pending. It cannot, therefore, at present be determined how much of the judgment will ultimately be sustained.

They charge the improper rejection of certain mechanics’ claims, in the distribution of a fund raised by a sale of real estate. The sale was made by the committee of an habitual drunkard. The mechanics’ claims had been filed against a “ double dwelling-house,” &amp;c. The objection taken was that <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>the structure against which the lien had beén filed was not a “ double house,” but was two distinct houses, and the claim was not apportioned.</p>

Hence, if the building against which the lien was filed, was composed of two distinct houses, the claimants had disregarded the clear mandates .of the statute, and their claims must be postponed to those of other lien creditors: Thomas <em>v. </em>James, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 381" data-case-ids="481753" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0381-01">7 W. &amp; S. 381</a>; Chambers <em>v. </em>Yarnall <em>et al., </em>3 Harris 265; Goepp <em>v. </em>Gartiser, 11 Casey 130.</p>

A reference to the evidence clearly justifies this conclusion. They are shown to be as distinct as any two houses in a row; completely divided by partitions from lower floor to top of attic; the cellars separated by double chimney and substantial partitions; no communicating doors between the two buildings; separate outside doors, both front and rear, for each; and the front yards separated by a fence extending from the division line between the buildings to the street fence. It is true they were contiguous parts of one block, yet they were separate houses and so occupied. But being a disputed question, it was for the auditor to find the fact: Munger <em>v. </em>Silsbee, 14 P. F. Smith 454. He found correctly.'</p>
