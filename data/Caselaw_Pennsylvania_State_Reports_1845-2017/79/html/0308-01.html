This, however, is unfounded, as will be seen upon referring to the Acts of 26th March 1859, Pamph. L. 253, and 11th of April 1862, Pamph. L. 448, creating the offices of assistant and associate judges for this county, and the Act of 4th of May 1865, Pamph. L. 842, conferring certain powers upon them.

The cases of The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Zephon, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 382" data-case-ids="483397" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0382-01">8 W. &amp; S. 382</a> ; Kilpatrick <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 7 Casey 198 ; and In re Application of Judges of the Eighth and Tenth Districts, 14 P.

    <p id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[189,939,1162,472]]]'>The amendment of the indictment from “ October” 1874 to “November” 1874, is justified by the 13th sect, of the Act of 31st of March 1860, relating to the criminal procedure, especially when read in connection with the powers of amendment set forth in the 11th and 12th sects. A clause in the 13th sect, reads thus : “ Or in the name or description of any matter or thing whatsoever therein named or described.” The month of October was named in the indictment, and the precise day described by the number eleven. The amendment fell clearly within this power, which is strengthened by the large powers of amendment intended to be conferred by the sections stated.</p>
