    <p class="summary" id="b455-9" data-blocks='[["BL_455.7",455,[162,1465,1163,516]]]'>“1. The consideration to the extent of $1100 was abalance which Andrews had become liable to pay the plaintiff, by reason of accommodation endorsements theretofore made, on the promissory notes of one Paul W. Garfield, which said Garfield procured to be discounted and obtained loans of money upon from the plaintiff. At, the time of Andrews’s endorsements of said notes, the liability of Garfield to the plaintiff for money borrowed was about the sum of $60,000. The amount of plaintiffs’ capital stock paid in was only $300,000. The said loan by the plaintiff to said Garfield, being in excess of one-tenth‘part of the capital stock of the plaintiff, was in violation of law and the contract of loan void. Thus alleges the affidavit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-10" data-blocks='[["BL_455.8",455,[160,1981,1164,475]],["BL_456.1",456,[274,395,1170,604]]]'>“The 29th section of the Act of Congress of June 3d 1864, commonly called the National Bank Act, provides that: ‘ The total liabilities to any association, of any person, or of any company, corporation or firm, for money borrowed ’****&lt; shall at no time exceed one-tenth part of the amount of the capital stock of such association actually paid in.’ Let it be conceded that the loan by the plaintiff to Garfield was in violation of law, and for this reason was within the well-settled rule, that no action can be maintained on a eontract, the consideration of which is either wicked in itself or prohibited by law. Although the borrower was a party to the violation of the law and had the lender’s money in <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>his pocket, he could have defended against its payment, because the law will not enforce an act which it has prohibited. The only reason for the rule is for the public good. No court will aid a man who founds his cause of action on an illegal act, for he has no right to be assisted when, from his own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise on an immoral or illegal contract. Surely the defence is not upon any merit of the borrower. It was said by Lord Mansfield: <em>‘ </em>The objection that a contract is immoral or illegal as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill -in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed; but it is founded in general principles of policy, of which the defendant has the advantage, contrary to real justice as between him and the plaintiff,, by accident, if I may so say.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b456-6" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[268,998,1166,945]]]'>“ How far the principle is to affect subsequent or collateral contracts, the direct or immediate consideration of which was not inducive to the original illegal act, is an intricate question. It was long ago decided in England, and has often been repeated by our own courts, that ‘ the test, whether a demand connected with an ’illegal transaction is capable of being enforced at law, is whether the plaintiff requires any aid from the illegal transaction to establish his case.’ In Thomas <em>v. </em>Brady, 10 Barr 164, after referring to the test, Rogers, J., approvingly quotes from Story on Contracts : ‘ If an act in violation of either statute or common law be already committed and a subsequent agreement entered into, which, though founded thereupon, constituted no part of the original inducement or consideration, such an agreement is valid.' The rule has sometimes been carried to inconvenient lengths, not because of its unsoundness in itself, but in its application to particular cases. It should be rigorously applied to all unlawful transactions; but not extended so far as to encourage violations of contracts for payment of honest debts, as between the parties, because they grow out of tainted originals. If the taint of the original vitiated every contract growing out of it, however remotely connected with it, it would give protection to fraud upon individuals without compensation in the benefit of the public.</p>

It is certain that Garfield’s notes, endorsed by Andrews, were arranged in some way, and that the latter gave his own obligation with security for the balance. The plaintiff needs ño aid from the original transaction to make out his case. Garfield is no party to the note. The defendant attempts its defeat, not by showing anything done at the time it was given, but because of the turpitude of the borrower and lender when Garfield borrowed money of the bank in excess of the amount the latter was permitted to loan to one <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>person.

Smith 456, holding a mortgage void when given to secure future loans, because of violation of the 28th section of the National Bank Act, impelled me to apply the like principle to a violation of the 29th section in an action brought upon the note given by the borrower for the .money loaned. Perhaps, as contended on one part, the principle does not apply to both sections, but I have been unable to draw a distinction. I am not prepared to go further than I understand the authority of the decision in Fowler <em>v. </em>Scully, and, until better advised, cannot apply the rule to the case of one who, after the loan, upon some new and undisclosed arrangement, voluntarily gave another security.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b457-8" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[148,1543,1169,846]]]'>“ On all the loans and discounts Andrews was an accommodation endorser. He borrowed no money, paid no interest, and has no right of action on account of illegal interest paid by the company. The affidavit and schedule show that the company at divers times borrowed a large amount of money from the plaintiff, all of which has been paid except $1824.37, the amount of the note in suit, after deducting $1100, — which sum grew out of Garfield’s business. By some arrangement this comparatively small sum then still owing by the company, was included in Andrews’s note endorsed by Bly. The affidavit avers that the company paid the interest. Not half the interest was paid within the last two years, the time limited within which to commence an action to recover it back. The 30th section of the National Bank Act provides that when illegal interest is knowingly reserved or charged, or agreed to be paid, it shall be held and adjudged a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note or evidence of debt carries with it. When it has been paid, the person paying the same, or his legal representative, may recover back, in action of debt, twice the amount of the interest thus paid, from the association taking or receiving the same.</p>

That company may yet bring suit, if they have not settled the claim. Nothing appears to show' why any portion of the interest should be set off in favor of Andrews, except by a liberal construction of the affidavit, the sum of $82.42 be defalked as forfeiture, by reason of its having been charged at the rate of 10 per centum on the note in suit.</p>
