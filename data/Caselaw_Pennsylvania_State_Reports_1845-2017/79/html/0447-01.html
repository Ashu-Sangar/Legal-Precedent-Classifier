The plaintiff in this case, William P. Braham, complains that the defendant committed a trespass, we might say a serious trespass, upon his property. He is the owner of a farm in Mercer township, this county. The proof is that the defendant here, some three or four years ago, entered upon his premises, took possession, so to speak, with their teams and hands, excavated and filled the surface, and built and constructed a railroad across his farm and property, as he swears to you, and in doing so they committed a trespass and inflicted an injury upon his property. The testimony and the proof is all for you. You must keep in your minds a record of the testimony so that you can readily apply the testimony to the law. It will be for you to say how far the plaintiff has given you proof of the trespass and injury inflicted upon his property by the defendant. He says, in the first place, that the defendant entered upon his premises without permission ; that he never gave them any right of way; that he never gave them permission to enter upon his premises. Under the law the defend<a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>ant had a right to go upon his farm regardless of his consent. He says they did so take possession of the premises in the way and manner proven to you. * * * In addition to this, he has given proof, whether it.satisfies you or not it is for you to remember the proof, that they have committed a trespass upon his property, to what extent will be for you to say from the testimony in the case, by their workmen and teams passing indiscriminately over his farm during the building and construction, of the road, throwing down fences, passing through fields, trampling upon and injuring the soil for present and probably future cultivation.</p>

The Supreme Court lays down this rule by which the jury may measure the damages; the jury may take into consideration and ascertain from the proof, the fair market value of the property at and immediately before the railroad company took possession of the farm or property for the purpose of constructing a railroad. That is one point to ascertain. Then you may take into consideration the fair market value of the farm after the railroad has been constructed ; then as you deduct the less from the greater, that would be, under the rule, the proper measure of advantages and disadvantages.

Then, if you find that the injuries exceed the benefits, in that point of view that would be the measure of damages, the excess of the injuries over the advantages would be the fair amount to return a verdict for in favor of the plaintiff.

This cause was put at issue as in an action of trespass <em>quare clausum, fregit. </em>The form of the issue was allowable under the Act of Assembly. It does not follow, however, that because the issue was formed in trespass, the defendants were trespassers, and it was error to try the cause upon his theory. The defendants were not trespassers. Their entry upon the land of the plaintiff was legal. They took the land in pursuance of an Act of Assembly authorizing such taking. We think, therefore, they have cause to complain of that portion of the charge of the court in which the jury were told that the defendants had committed a trespass upon the property of the plaintiff.

In one of the early cases upon this subject (Schuylkill Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411), it was held by this court, that the jury <em>“ </em>should consider the matter just as if they were called upon to value the injury at the moment when compensation could first be demanded; they are to value the injury to the property without reference to the person of the owner, or the actual state of his business, and in doing that the only safe rule is to inquire what would the property unaffected by the obstruction have sold for at the time the injury was committed ? What would it have sold for as affected by the injury ? The difference is the measure of compensation.” This rule has been followed in the Penna.

Co. <em>v. </em>Thoburn, where it was said by Tilghman, C. J.: “ The uncertainty of the business the plaintiffs will be engaged in, and the uncertainty of the profits of the <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>business, is a reason for excluding particular use. Indeed, the use of the land is a collateral consideration.”</p>
    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[149,510,1168,689]]]'>It was the market value of the <em>land </em>before and after the alleged injury which the jury were to consider, not the value of the farm as a farm. The word “ farm” is employed merely to designate the use to which the land has been applied by the owner. The particular use, as was remarked by Chief Justice Tilghman, is a mere collateral consideration. In estimating the market value of the land everything which gives it intrinsic value is a proper element for consideration. Land may be applied to various purposes and possesses value for distinct objects. It may be devoted to agriculture ; improved by the erection of buildings or the opening of mines; or it may be adorned for the sole object of contributing to the pleasure or gratifying the taste of the owner. The construction of a railroad through it might utterly destroy its value for some purposes, and yet greatly increase it for others. It is its general market value for any purpose that will induce persons to purchase, which is the true test.</p>
