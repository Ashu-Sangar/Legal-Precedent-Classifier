Well, we find, that on the 2d June 1815, less than three months before he died, he did dispose of this Cox tract among others: that he conveyed it to John Miller, in trust for Elizabeth' Ege, wife of his son George, and her heirs, for her separate use, <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>apart from her husband.

The legal result of all, up to this point, is to put the title to the land now in dispute in Elizabeth Ege, the wife of George Ege, who was one of the three sons of Michael Ege aforesaid; and that title remained in her during her life, and descended upon her death to her children, and to the heirs of the latter, where any have since deceased. Those heirs or their descendants are here in court, asserting their mother’s title against the present claimants of this Cox survey, for with that only have we now to do. It follows, then, that unless something has been done by this mother, Elizabeth Ege, in her lifetime, or some title has been acquired in some way, before or since her death, which defeats the title which was vested in her, these plaintiffs must recover the land in controversy.]</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b26-8" data-blocks='[["BL_26.6",26,[322,1214,1165,686]]]'>“ So far, then, as George Ege claimed by sale or gift from his father, it is our duty to say that neither is clearly established by the evidence. That the father placed him there and set him at work is doubtless true, but nothing like an agreement to sell or gift of the property to George is shown ; an intention by the father to do so was expressed, but he never deeded the property by any conveyance that George would accept. [On the contrary, on the death of the father Michael, this Mount Holly property (but not this land in dispute) was valued and appraised, together with the other lands of the father, in due form, in the Orphans’ Court of this county, and accepted by George Ege, at the valuation, and thus he got title to the Mount Holly lands, but the Cox survey was not embraced. It was not, nor were the remaining six tracts, embraced in the trust, included among old Michael Ege’s land, by the inquest, and this tends to support the trust deed; because at his death he did not own the lands embraced therein.]</p>

[It is a tract having distinct lines of its own, marked upon the ground, with several of the lines, corners and monuments still standing to this day ; and although cut over by George Ege, Woodburn and Peter Ege, up to 1888, without regard to lines, and was used along with other lines for coaling, its identity was distinct from 1785, when the original survey was made, and is now.]</p>

      <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>“ Then, has any one else other than George Ege acquired title by adverse possession ? Title by adverse possession must be an actual, adverse, visible, notorious, hostile and continued possession for twenty-one years. All these ingredients must be pr-esent, or might as well be absent; if any one be wanting — for instance, that of <em>continued </em>possession — a dereliction in that quarter is fatal. George Ege’s lands, and this tract, as if his, among them, were sold at sheriff’s sale in 1838, and since that, George Ege, the husband, has had nothing to do with the Holly lands or this tract; and since that year, any one who claimed and resided on it by himself or tenants, year by year, so that the owner of the paper title, coming there to look up his land, would have found a person in possession of it, against whom he could have brought suit, if desirable, and instead of suing such occupier, he was permitted to sit there and occupy for twenty-one years, he would acquire title. To constitute such possession, the person so claiming to occupy must live within the lines of the survey, or cultivate a portion of the land within the lines. If such occupier stayed awhile and then left, and the property remained vacant -for a year or more, that would not be continued possession, and no title would be acquired. If a portion was cultivated .only every few years, so that for several years together no cultivation or farming was done, that would not be such use of the land as would give title by adverse possession.' [Now, apply these principles to the facts of this case, and what have we? As to the occupancy of the old house in the forks of the Gettysburg and Laurel Forge roads, about which much testimony has been given, it is rendered.certain by the surveyors called by defendants that it never was within the lines of the Cox survey"; so that its occupancy goes for nothing. Then there was another old log house that was on the Cox tract, situated on the .left-hand side of the Gettysburg road, on what is called the Rocky road, which was used and occupied by the employees of George Ege up to 1835, and possibly up to 1838 or 1839 ; but in that year (1839) Conrad Peffer, called by defendants, swears that he was there personally on the ground, and the house was then gone, dilapidated, unoccupied, and even the garden had been abandoned as early as in 1847, if not before ; for he says when he first saw it in 1839, the house was gone, and that from 1839 to 1847 he never saw anything growing there; so that from 1838 to 1847, conceding it occupied would make no title by the statute, and thus this branch of the defence fails. Cutting timber and coaling over the land gave no title by adverse possession, where the lines as here individuated the tract, it is simply trespass.]</p>

Is it his deed, and was it delivered ? [The law presumes both execution <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>and delivery from the recorded deed as it appears. In order to overthrow it, there must be some satisfactory evidence pointing to it as a fraud, or justifying the conclusion that it was never delivered. It was not put upon record until 7th June 1848, which it is contended excites suspicion, and so it does seem singular that it remained so long unrecorded. But the circumstance of the seven tracts 'embraced in the deed being omitted from the Orphans’ Court inquisition on old Michael Ege’s estate, and the amount of the seven tracts reaching over 2000 acres, and that inquest, held only one year after the death of Michael Ege, the father, seem corroborative of the valid existence of this trust deed, that the lands aforesaid were known not to be a portion of his estate, that he parted with them before his death, and hence properly omitted, as being no part of his estate. And if parted with, to whom were they conveyed ? Not to his sons, nor any one of them, for they can show no deed ; whereas the trust deed to Miller, for the wife of Greorge, embraces these very tracts. Peter Ege, a son, seventy-one days after his father’s death, petitioned the Orphans’ Court for the inquisition, and although he specifies and individuates fifty-nine tracts of land, leaves out these seven. Why? He was a son, and heir of this opulent -landowner, and yet he made no claim to the seven tracts, embracing over 2000 acres.] * * *</p>

      <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court, May 24th 1875,</p>

This again hinges upon the question, whether the William Cox tract was any part of the land described in the proceedings for the partition of the estate of Michael Ege, deceased. If it be clearly determined that the William Cox tract was no part of the Mount Holly Forge and Furnace Estate, set apart in the proceedings to Ege, the second son of Michael Ege, in the year of 1816, it follows as clearly that the deed of June 2d 1815, from Michael Ege to William Miller, as trustee of Elizabeth Ege, for the William Cox tract with others, must have been delivered. The execution of this deed is clearly established, and if the William Cox tract was not included in the petition for partition filed November 11th 1815, and subsequent proceedings, it leaves no doubt that the legal presumption of delivery, derived from the acknowledgment by Michael Ege, the possession of the deed by Mrs. Elizabeth Ege’s husband, and recording of it, is true in fact. Michael Ege conveyed on the 20th of June 1815, and died on the 31st day August following, and the proceedings to divide his estate were commenced on November 11th succeeding. The estate was one of great value, the heirs were men and women of mature age, and the proceedings conducted and participated in by the foremost men of that part of the country. The proceedings themselves are minute and particular. The Mount Holly estate is twice described with the utmost precision, first in the petition, and next in the inquisition, as consisting of “ twelve tracts,” and these tracts are designated by name and number of acres. The warrants are all stated severally and by name; and the William Cox warrant and survey are not among them. Thé number of tracts would be thirteen if it had been included, instead of twelve, as stated, and therein particularized. It is very clear, then, that the Mount Holly estate, as accepted by and assigned to George Ege, did not embrace the Cox tract. It is impossible to suppose that these grown men and women, and their .eminent friends and advisers, did not consider and describe well the Mount Holly estate, or that they committed an error in leaving out of so important a proceeding a large portion of the estate of Michael Ege, deceased, for on this point we have to consider, not only the William Cox tract, but the other six tracts embraced in the deed of June 2d 1815. Then, in connection with this, we have the fact of the making of the three deeds of the 3d of June 1815, by Michael Ege to his three sons, Peter, George and Michael; Peter, the petitioner, reciting the advancement of Michael in lands in the lifetime of his father; coinciding with the undisputed fact, <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>that Peter and George refused their deeds, while Michael accepted his. Now, when we consider that the deed to Miller, as trustee of Elizabeth, was made the day before, for seven tracts of land, it is impossible to doubt that the family all knew well of this deed, and, consequently, that none of these seven tracts were embraced in the partition.</p>
    <p id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[313,659,1164,472]]]'>The deed of June 2d 1815 being thus established beyond all doubt, the assignments of error to the rejection of evidence, to show that in the lifetime of Michael Ege, Sr., the William Cox tract had been at an early day brought into the Mount Holly estate, are immaterial. For the moment that he, as the owner of the whole estate, separated it from the Mount Holly Foi’ge and Furnace property, and his heirs following his act, left it out of the Mount Holly estate in the partition, it no longer constituted a part of that property: George took no title to it by his acceptance of the.purpart containing the Mount Holly estate, and those claiming his title under that proceeding stand in no better relation.</p>
    <p id="b32-7" data-blocks='[["BL_32.5",32,[302,1130,1171,899]]]'>This view of the case disposes substantially of all the assignments of error, for all bear on the question of the execution and delivery of the deed of June 2d 1815 ; and its establishment strips the defendants of all pretence of title. The only assignment of error bearing on this question having seeming weight, is the seventh, and this intrinsically has but little, for the acts of George Ege, and 'of adverse claimants of some of the tracts contained in the deed of June 2d 1815, can have but little weight in repelling the clear proof in law and fact of the execution and delivery of that deed. The offer affords scarcely more than a scintilla of evidence; and there is a decisive objection to the consideration of this assignment, consisting in the fact that the papers set forth in it' have not been copied and presented for our consideration by the plaintiff in error. A party alleging error must prove it. He must therefore produce the documents by copies to show us what their bearing is. Now, not one of the papers referred to in the seventh assignment is printed and laid before us. The only knowledge we have of them is by the defendant in error, and these, as read, tend to show, that the court committed no error in rejecting the whole offer. This assignment of error out of the way, and nothing is left about which there can be any doubt.</p>
    <p id="b32-8" data-blocks='[["BL_32.6",32,[311,2030,1158,386]]]'>Upon the evidence, the question of the Statute of Limitations is out of the case. In the lifetime and during the ownership of the Mount Holly estate by George Ege, the husband of Elizabeth, the statute did not run, even if the evidence was satisfactory of an actual possession of the whole tract by George Ege. His relation to her forbade the existence of adverse possession. After the estate passed out of his hands by the sheriff’s sale, the evidence shows no continuous actual possession, the premises often being vacant, and the entries at intervals, and but for temporary occupation.</p>
