Since the 1980s, WSA was the broker of record for health insurance provided to employees of Procacci Brothers Sales Corporation (“Procacci”). Appellee, Brokerage Concepts, Inc. (“BCI”), is a third party administrator of employee benefit plans. In 1994, at the recommendation of WSA, Procacci retained BCI as administrator of its insurance plans, and BCI paid commissions to WSA based on premiums paid by Procacci.</p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[147,884,1156,627]]]'>In 2005, Procacci requested that BCI lower costs, but BCI would not meet Procacci’s proposal. Procacci then notified BCI that it would be moving its business to another third-party administrator. Shortly thereafter, BCI’s employee Kimberly Macrone wrote a letter to Procacci asking it to reconsider its decision, and in the process advising Procacci of the amount of compensation WSA had been receiving as broker of record. The amount was apparently higher than Procacci believed WSA had been earning, but there is no dispute that Macrone’s statements about WSA’s compensation were true. As a result of Macrone’s letter, Procacci terminated its longstanding contractual relationship with WSA.</p>

In the fourth count, WSA alleged that BCI had tortiously interfered with the WSA/Procacci contractual relationship by disclosing the amount of WSA’s compensation. In its answer and new matter, BCI alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that it could not be held liable for tortious interference because the information it provided to Procacci was truthful, or otherwise justified and privileged, and not confidential. The parties went to trial on the tortious interference claim. At the charging conference, BCI requested a jury instruction on truthfulness as a defense pursuant to Section 772(a), but the court denied it. Instead, the court’s <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>instruction on tortious interference tracked two other Restatement provisions, Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 766 and 767.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The jury, so charged, specifically found that BCI had intentionally and improperly interfered with the WSA/Procacci contract, caused Procacci to terminate that contract, and awarded WSA $330,000 in damages.

WSA insists that the trial court properly held that truth is not a defense to a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. According to WSA, the court properly instructed the jury to consider the following factors in evaluating Ma-crone/BCI’s conduct: a) the nature of the actor’s conduct; b) the actor’s motive; c) the interest of the other with which the actor’s conduct interferes; d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor; e) the social interest in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other; and f) the relations between the parties. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767 (listing factors relevant to determining whether interference is improper); <em>Adler, Barish, Daniels, Levin &amp; Creskoff v. Epstein, </em><a href="/pa/482/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="482 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1749725" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0416-01">482 Pa. 416</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="482 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1749725" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0416-01">393 A.2d 1175</a> (1978) <em>(“Adler Barish </em>”) (considering Section 767 factors in analyzing whether defendants’ conduct was actionable). Applying these factors alone, WSA argues, the jury <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>correctly determined that BCI’s conduct was improper and unjustified, and caused the termination of the Procacci account, to WSA’s financial detriment.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[262,508,1155,893]]]'>Moreover, argues WSA, only this Court, and not the Superi- or Court, may adopt a section of the Restatement not previously applied in Pennsylvania. According to WSA, the Superi- or Court should have relied on this Court’s decision in <em>Adler Barish. </em>In that case, certain associates of the Adler Barish law firm left that firm and opened a competing firm; the former associates sent letters to Adler Barish clients informing them that they could now choose to be represented by the new firm instead of Adler Barish, and included a form that the clients could complete and return to Adler Barish (in an enclosed, addressed and stamped envelope) severing their relationship with that firm. WSA argues that these client letters were “true,” and yet this Court nonetheless held that the communications were actionable. From these factual circumstances, WSA argues that <em>Adler Barish </em>stands for the proposition that truth is not a defense to its tortious interference claim against BCI in this case.</p>

According to WSA, this retroactive change in the law has led to an inequitable result by reversing a jury verdict, after years of litigation which proceeded on the basis that Section 767 — not Section 772 — was the law of the Commonwealth. WSA claims that because it was aware that at least portions of the BCI letter were true, WSA “would not have even brought its claim for tortious interference if [Section] 772(a) were the applicable <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>law,” and thus “changing] the playing field” now is a great hardship to WSA.

BCI argues that in a case like this, where there is no evidence that the amount of WSA’s compensation was somehow private or confidential, and where no other state interest — such as violation of an ethical rule or industry custom — could justify regulation, the First Amendment protects truthful speech against a claim for damages for tortious interference.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Indeed, BCI contends, strong public policies weigh heavily in favor of disclosure of health care costs, including the amount of compensation paid to an insurance broker. <em>See, e.g., </em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201023" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §§ 1023">29 U.S.C. §§ 1023</a>(c)(3); 1106(a)(1)(D); 1108(b)(2) (under ERISA, employers have right and obligation to know and monitor amount of compensation paid to insurance broker providing services to its health plan).

According to BCI, this case involves the termination of an at-will contract as the result of a letter accurately describing WSA’s compensation, which information was not entitled to confidentiality or privacy, and where the disclosure did not violate industry customs or ethical standards. Moreover, BCI claims, the social utility of the disclosure is “obvious.” Even under comment f to Section 767, an “interference” designed to further one’s own economic interests “will normally prevail over a similar interest of the other if the actor does not use wrongful means.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> BCI argues that WSA’s loss in this case is not the kind the law should protect, as it resulted from the termination of a contract that did not involve a meeting of minds because Procacci believed it was paying a different amount to WSA.

The Restatement provision, which was first published in 1979, merely explicates the longstanding, existing rule concerning improper interference; the specific application follows logically from the general principle and nature of the tort. Our formal “adoption” of Section 772(a) as an accurate application of the general principle respecting what amounts to “improper” interference does not overrule any governing contrary precedent, and no existing “old rule” is impaired. Indeed, if anything, our agreement with, and adoption of Second Restatement Section 772(a), was foreshadowed by this Court’s citation to former Section 772 in <em>Menefee, </em>our reliance on related Sections 766 and 767 in <em>Adler Barish, </em>and the very fact that we have looked to the Restatement in our prior considerations of the tort.</p>

      <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>WSA’s argument that it would not have gone to the expense of the lawsuit and trial if it had known that Section 772(a) would be deemed applicable is not the sort of “injustice or hardship” that would weigh in favor of denying BCI the benefit of our sustaining its logical position. Notably, WSA does not claim that its primary conduct — the failure to disclose information to Procacci that might imperil its contractual relationship — occurred because it had an expectation that it could sue anyone who disclosed the truth to Procacci, and that expectation has now been unsettled. But, even if WSA had argued such an expectation, it is difficult to see why BCI, having itself gone to the expense of defensive litigation, should be denied the benefit of a rule that ensures a proper calibration of policy in claims of tortious interference. Since the pleading stages, BCI maintained that it was shielded from liability because its statements to Procacci were true or otherwise privileged. At trial, BCI requested a jury charge on Section 772(a), and also argued its applicability in post-trial motions and on appeal. BCI’s position was rooted squarely in the nature of the tort and in the history and structure of the Second Restatement, and there was nothing in our governing decisional law to suggest that we would reject this logical elaboration. BCI had as much right to advocate for recognition of the elaboration as represented by Section 772(a) as WSA had to urge that the tort should be deemed frozen in time.</p>

It is beyond peradventure that the Superior Court must follow this Court’s mandates, and it generally lacks the authority to determine that this Court’s decisions are no longer controlling. <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/520/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="520 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1815633" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0385-01">520 Pa. 385</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="520 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1815633" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0385-01">554 A.2d 50</a>, 51-52 (1989). Moreover, the intermediate appellate courts are duty-bound to effectuate this Court’s decisional law. <em>See, e.g., Behers v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, </em><a href="/pa/577/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="577 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="91559" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0055-01">577 Pa. 55</a>, <a href="/pa/577/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="842 A.2d 359" data-case-ids="91559,91666,9286850,9286868" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0055-01,/pa/577/0054-01,/a2d/842/0359-01,/a2d/842/0359-02">842 A.2d 359</a>, 367 (2004) (task of lower courts is “to effectuate the decisional law of this Court, not to restrict it through curtailed <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>readings of controlling authority”). But, WSA’s suggestion that the Superior Court lacked the authority to apply Section 772(a) simply because the provision had not yet been explicitly adopted by this Court is mistaken. Also incorrect is WSA’s assertion that <em>Adler Barish, </em>which relied on Section 767, provides the exclusive method for analyzing a tortious interference claim, and is thus controlling precedent in this case. As we have stated, Section 772(a) was not considered by this Court in that case. <em>But see In re Estate of Stephano, </em><a href="/pa/602/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="602 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="4195280" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0527-01">602 Pa. 527</a>, <a href="/pa/602/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="981 A.2d 138" data-case-ids="4195280,7292130" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0527-01,/a2d/981/0138-01">981 A.2d 138</a>, 141-42 (2009) (lower courts erred in ignoring controlling Supreme Court precedent directly on point and instead adopting new Restatement of Trusts provision). When open questions, or close questions, are presented to the intermediate appellate courts, they should look closely to our precedent for guidance. There is nothing improper in those courts deciding new or close issues, consistently with their duty to master, and act consistently with, this Court’s teachings. This is the same role this Court plays when deciding many questions of federal law; there is no institutional prohibition upon the power of the intermediate appellate courts to act to decide the questions fairly, and squarely, presented to them.</p>
