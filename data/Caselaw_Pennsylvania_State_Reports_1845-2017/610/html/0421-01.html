Appellees emphasize that the supervision of sex offenders on probation and parole is highly regulated in Pennsylvania through comprehensive and detailed statutes. According to appellees, Megan’s Law, “expressly contemplates residency by sex offenders within residential neighborhoods and proximate to schools and day care facilities following assessment and with monitoring, treatment^] and notification.” Appellees’ Brief at 26. The release into the community of sex offenders is based on individualized assessments by criminal justice and mental health professionals, and is controlled down to “every aspect of [the offenders’] existence, including specifically where they may or may not live.” Appellees’ Brief at 17, 25.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The Board’s policy is to prohibit sex offenders whose victims were minors from living within two blocks of the same schools <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>and. day care centers; but, the County created a restriction that vastly exceeds in scope the Board’s prohibition. According to appellees, the County usurps the Board’s power to approve a sex offender’s residence by essentially excluding all sex offenders from Allegheny County and thus limiting the discretion of courts and of the Board in sentencing and paroling, or in exempting a sex offender from notification requirements where appropriate. According to appellees, the Ordinance essentially prohibits residency in areas of Allegheny County that state law allows and “unduly” restricts the liberty of sex offenders on parole. Appellees claim the Ordinance is a blunt instrument that fails to take into account individual circumstances and the professional judgment of experts who assess individual sex offenders and their residency requirements.</p>

Appellees note that greater access to treatment, employment, family, and other familiar community supports are generally identified with a decreased risk of recidivism and successful rehabilitation and reintegration of sex offenders into the community. But, the Ordinance deprives sex offenders seeking to return to Allegheny County of these advantages by “single-mindedly focusing on excluding sex offenders from living in the most habitable portions of the County.” Appellees’ Brief at 29 (citing 61 Pa.C.S. § 6102(1)).

The Ordinance banishes many sex offenders from their pre-adjudication neighborhoods and support systems. The Ordinance also consigns all offenders to isolated suburban areas of Allegheny County that presumably will provide less access to transportation, employment, counseling, and supervision. Moreover, it is not even apparent, from the record provided, whether there is appropriate residential housing available in the areas to which registrants would be banished; what we do know is that those areas, even if residential, are isolated from other aspects of most residential communities, such as parks and community and recreation centers. The Ordinance appears to attempt to ensure public safety, in certain parts of Allegheny County, by isolating all Megan’s Law registrants in localized penal colonies of sorts, without any consideration of the General Assembly’s policies of rehabilitation and reintegration.</p>

Thus, the County’s residency restrictions limit the options available to sex offenders in designing adequate plans upon release for approval by sentencing courts or the Board. For example, a sex offender who has a strong family support structure in Pittsburgh may well have difficulty devising a plan for parole that would both meet the restrictions of the Ordinance and the Board’s criteria for an adequate release plan. Considerations of whether the sex offender can meet family responsibilities and receive family support in return are often weighty in formulating a plan for release. These relationships contribute to emotional and financial stability, as family may assist the offender in seeking and maintaining employment and attending counseling. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

It cannot be seriously disputed that the Ordinance will interfere with the “efficient and timely” administration of the parole system and significantly affect the quality of the Commonwealth’s probation and parole systems. <em>See </em>61 Pa.C.S. §§ 6102(3); 6131(a)(5). These administrative deficiencies may well also produce an unintended effect of threatening public safety, by depriving sex offenders of access to resources which have been shown to reduce the risks of recidivism.

The General Assembly adopted instead a calibrated regulatory scheme of registration, notification, and counseling for sex offenders— Megan’s Law. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9795.1, 9795.2, 9797, 9798, 9798.1, 9799.4. Residency restrictions are not excluded but they play a far more limited role in the state’s legislative scheme than in the scheme adopted by the Ordinance.

The Ordinance would thus obstruct the operation of the statewide statutory scheme by requiring courts and the Board to abandon the tailored and proportionate approach of the General Assembly and attempt to devise new approaches that would satisfy the County’s wider-reaching restrictions.

In this instance, the General Assembly has already weighed in on the policy priorities of the Commonwealth with respect to the reintegration of offenders, including sex offenders, and has devised an approach for how to best accomplish them. The County reveals no countervailing local concerns to justify its attempt to opt-out of the General Assembly’s overall scheme of balancing public safety and the offenders’ best interests, from its policies of rehabilitation, reintegration, and diversion from prison, or from the means by which the Legislature sought to promote these policies.</p>

Isolating all sex offenders from their communities, support systems, employment, and treatment is an approach contrary to that of the General Assembly, which requires individually tailored assessments and assistance with rehabilitation and reintegration for appropriate offenders.

Thus, appellees argue that the general tenor of the Parole Code reflects a legislative intention that it should not be supplemented at a local level. According to appellees, the General Assembly directed the Board to promulgate regulations establishing "uniform Statewide standards” for supervision of probationers governing every aspect of an offender's life, including residency, and provided the Board "exclusive power” over the parole system. Appellees also emphasize a "special need for uniformity" in the areas of probation and parole. In response, the County argues that there is no precedent for finding field preemption with respect to the regulation of probation and parole, and that this Court has only recognized field preemption with respect to regulation of alcoholic beverages, banking, and anthracite mining. Because we conclude that the Ordinance is preempted pursuant to the conflict preemption doctrine — which was the ground for decision of the District Court — we do not reach the issue of field preemption and express no opinion as to its operation here.</p>

According to the County, the Ordinance is an appropriate exercise of the County’s police powers in response to the safety and health risk that sex offenders pose to the public at large.

We also reject the County's secondary argument premised on the notion that parole regulations require offenders to abide by local ordinances. County's Brief at 28-29 (citing 37 Pa.Code § 63.4(4)). Regulation 63.4(4) states that if parole is granted, the parolee shall “[cjomply with municipal, county, State and Federal criminal statutes, as well as the Vehicle Code and the Liquor Code.” The County suggests that the regulation gives the Ordinance validity by recognizing that the Board does not have “blanket authority to override validly enacted local laws dealing with local health, safety and welfare.” <em><a href="/pa/531/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="531 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1834372" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0078-01">Id.</a> </em>at 28 (citing <em>Ogontz, </em><a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">483 A.2d 448</a>). Setting aside the issue of whether the Ordinance is criminal legislation (and also any <em>Apprendi </em>concerns), the County’s argument is not persuasive. <em>See Commonwealth v. Lee, </em><a href="/pa/594/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="594 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="3596230" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0266-01">594 Pa. 266</a>, <a href="/pa/594/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="935 A.2d 865" data-case-ids="3596230,8364535" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0266-01,/a2d/935/0865-01">935 A.2d 865</a>, 873 (2007) (citing <em>Apprendi v.

In <em>Ogontz, </em>this Court held that a Commonwealth agency was permitted to acquire property but the agency's use of the property as a mental health facility was subject to the municipality's zoning ordinance. <em>Ogontz, </em><a href="/pa/505/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="505 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1788903" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0614-01">483 A.2d at 455</a>. The Court explained that the contest in <em>Ogontz </em>was “between two [equal] instrumentalities of the state,” the Commonwealth agency and a home rule municipality. <em>Id. </em>at 452. Here, however, the direct conflict is between the General Assembly’s acts and a County ordinance, between which, the statewide enactments must prevail. <em>See Holt’s, </em><a href="/pa/608/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="10 A.3d 902" data-case-ids="4199377,4199946,7289799,7289852" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0146-01,/pa/608/0145-01,/a3d/10/0902-01,/a3d/10/0902-02">10 A.3d at 907</a>. Even if we were to assume that the Board’s regulation intended to, and could, vest counties with greater powers than those legislatively granted, a county has no authority to exercise its power contrary to the policy and operational imperatives of the General Assembly. <em>See Cellucci, </em><a href="/a2d/706/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="706 A.2d 806" data-case-ids="11863798,281240" data-case-paths="/a2d/706/0806-01,/pa/550/0407-01">706 A.2d at 810</a>; 53 Pa.C.S. § 2961.</p>
