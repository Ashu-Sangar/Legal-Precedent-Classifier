Thus, the question of whether the protections afforded by the Shield Law may yield to the governmental interests in the investigation of alleged violations of grand jury secrecy again need not be resolved at this juncture.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>In this instance, we are satisfied that Special Prosecutor Blakey need not be directed to do more to force the issue. We arrive at this determination for two primary reasons. First, Special Prosecutor Blakey’s investigation and report has already served a salutary purpose by identifying the procedural misjudgments in this case which created an atmosphere that invited a breach of secrecy; this case should serve as a reminder to prosecutors and supervising judges to avoid such measures. As <em>Castellani </em>and <em>In Re: County Investigating Grand Jury VIII, 2003 </em>confirm, the secrecy essential to grand jury proceedings and the imperatives and incentives of the free press often are in tension. The primary duty of judicial officers and officers of the Court,- in this instance, is to assure the proper functioning of the grand jury. The convening of a grand jury is not an occasion for prosecutorial grandstanding. The overarching purpose of the grand jury process is to seek the truth, and in that pursuit there is an equally important obligation to craft measures that preserve grand jury secrecy. There generally is no legitimate reason, consistent with the imperative of grand jury secrecy, for the District Attorney to publicize the date, time and place of the proceeding. There generally is no legitimate reason, consistent with the imperative of grand jury secrecy, for the District Attorney to take measures that obviously provide the opportunity for members of the media to identify and interact with grand jury witnesses — such as here, where Special Prosecutor Blakey found that:</p>

Special Prosecutor Blakey’s investigation and report does not foreclose further inquiry by an appropriate investigative or prosecutorial body that may wield the authority to obtain the reporters’ evidence, and that of other individuals, concerning the alleged violations of grand jury secrecy.
