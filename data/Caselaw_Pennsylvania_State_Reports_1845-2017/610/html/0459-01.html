According to the <em>mandamus </em>petition, in December 2005, claimant William Radel suffered a work-related injury while lifting a bundle of rebar for employer Re-Steel Supply Company, Inc. In January 2006, employer issued a medical-only notice of compensation payable (“NCP”), voluntarily accepting liability for an injury described as a hernia. Radel underwent surgery to repair an umbilical hernia at Crozer in February 2006. On March 20, 2007, Crozer sent records and billed employer’s insurer, Zurich North American Insurance Company (“Zurich”), for the treatment it provided Radel. Zurich did not pay the medical care provider’s bill. <em>See </em>Crozer’s Petition at ¶¶ 5-9 &amp; exh.

In March 2008, the Department rejected and returned the application as premature, because it found that there was “an outstanding issue of liability/compensability for the alleged injury.” The Department also denied Crozer’s request for a <em>de novo </em>administrative hearing. Consequently, the medical care provider filed its <em>mandamus </em>petition with the Commonwealth Court. <em>See id. </em>at ¶¶ 4-5, 7-11,13 &amp; exh. C.</p>

Crozer responded with its own preliminary objections, asserting that the Department was seeking demurrer relief on the basis of documents supplementing the petition for review, contrary to the prohibition against speaking demurrers. Crozer’s Objections at 2 (citing <em>Hall v. Goodman Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/310/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="310 Pa.

Department’s Objections at exh. A. Following a hearing, the Commonwealth Court sustained Crozer’s preliminary objections and stated that it would not consider any exhibits attached to the Department’s filing. But, the Court also sustained the Department’s substantive objections and dismissed Crozer’s <em>mandamus </em>petition.

      <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>Crozer claims on appeal that its <em>mandamus </em>action was improperly dismissed because the averments in its petition established the Department’s mandatory duty to issue (and Crozer’s clear legal right to receive) a determination on the merits of the fee review application. Crozer argues that Zurich issued a medical-only NCP, which had not been modified or terminated at the time of the medical treatment and, thus, pursuant to the Act, the NCP constituted a voluntary and binding admission of liability for Radel’s umbilical hernia. According to Crozer, because Zurich is precluded from terminating benefits unilaterally or retroactively, the existence of an “open” NCP at the time of Radel’s treatment is an “unequivocal admission” that Zurich must pay Crozer. Thus, the medical care provider disputes the Department’s conclusion that an unresolved issue of liability remained at the time of the fee review application. In view of the “open” NCP, Crozer offers, the Department was not faced with making any legal determination of Zurich’s liability as part of its fee review. Crozer therefore requests that we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s decision and order the Department to resolve the merits of the fee review application.</p>

Specifically, the Department argues that Zurich denied liability, but that Crozer nonetheless sought to force the Department to decide that the “open” NCP estopped Zurich from denying liability. The Depart<a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>ment notes that these decisions are not as simple as Crozer believes. According to the Department, deciding whether the NCP is “open,” whether Zurich’s denial was proper, and whether Crozer was entitled to payment under the circumstances, “far exceeds the jurisdiction and administrative capabilities of the fee review authorities.” Department’s Brief at 7. The Department further notes that, although ill-equipped to do so, the Department’s hearing officer would be required to determine the credibility of insurers and providers, inquire into whether the NCP included the treatment billed by the provider, resolve whether the NCP was rescinded, accurate, or authentic, and determine issues of estoppel. The Department maintains that, in view of these inherent practical challenges, the regulatory prohibition against litigating liability within the context of the fee review process is sensible. The Department argues that issues of liability, even where an “open” NCP exists, are better litigated before workers’ compensation judges, pursuant to the Act and relevant regulations. Crozer, the Department concludes, failed to establish a clear legal right to a determination on the merits of its fee review application and, therefore, the Commonwealth Court properly dismissed Crozer’s action.</p>

According to the court, Crozer essentially argued that “when an insurer’s denial of liability appears to violate the [Act], the Department should be required to make a determination.” <em>Crozer Chester Med. Ctr. v.

Specifically, in the court’s view, Crozer maintained that Zurich’s denial violated the Act in light of the “open” NCP. The court rejected Crozer’s <em>mandamus </em>argument, concluding that to grant Crozer relief would entail requiring the Department to exercise legal judgment and evaluate the credibility of witnesses, the legal effect of documents and of other evidence. Thus, the panel recognized that Crozer “[was] not attempting to enforce a right which ha[d] been established beyond peradventure, but <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>[was] seeking to have [the court] direct the Department to determine the issue of liability in [Crozer]’s favor.” <em><a href="/a2d/955/1037-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="955 A.2d 1037" data-case-ids="8215325" data-case-paths="/a2d/955/1037-01">Id.</a> </em>The Commonwealth Court therefore held that Crozer had failed to plead a legally cognizable claim in <em>mandamus. <a href="/a2d/955/1037-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="955 A.2d 1037" data-case-ids="8215325" data-case-paths="/a2d/955/1037-01">Id.</a></em>

The controlling question is whether the factual averments in Crozer’s petition for review are legally sufficient to state a cause of action for <em>mandamus </em>in light of the relevant provisions of the Act and the regulations of the Department. A <em>mandamus </em>action lies only “to compel official performance of a ministerial act or mandatory duty where there is a clear legal right in the plaintiff, a corresponding duty in the defendant, and a lack of any other adequate and appropriate remedy at law.... While <em>mandamus </em>will not ordinarily lie to compel a series of particular acts or conduct or to compel the performance of a particular discretionary act, it is available to direct that discretion be exercised.” <em>Delaware River Port Auth. v.

Understandably, the General Assembly directed that most disputed compensation issues be litigated between claimants and insurers before skilled workers’ compensation judges in the first instance, and reserved few narrow issues to be litigated by the medical care provider before a fee review hearing officer. The Department’s Regulation 127.255, which fills procedural gaps within the fee review legislative scheme, enforces this understanding by explaining that the Department will reject a medical care provider’s application for fee review if the “insurer denies liability for the alleged work injury” or a request for utilization review is pending. 34 Pa.Code § 127.255(1), (2); <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>

According to Crozer, the Act establishes that an “open” NCP is Zurich’s “unequivocal admission” of liability for Radel’s December 2005 injury. Crozer concludes that, as a result, the Department should have reached the merits of its fee review application, presumably to order Zurich to pay Crozer’s bill. At the center of Crozer’s claim is the assumption that the so-called “unequivocal admission” of liability to Radel absolutely establishes Zurich’s liability to Crozer for the medical costs of the February 2006 treatment, as well as the settled nature of Crozer’s claim, whose merits the Department should have reached. We disagree.</p>

Paragraph 9 of the <em>mandamus </em>petition describes Zurich’s refusal to pay Crozer for the February 2006 surgery, which, in light of the Act’s mandate that insurers pay “timely for any treatment or portion thereof not in dispute,” is essentially a denial of liability for the treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">7</a> This averment, though adverse to Crozer’s legal interest, must be accepted as true, on par with all other allegations in the petition. <em>See Werner, </em><a href="/pa/545/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="681 A.2d 1331" data-case-ids="465149,7868153" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0570-01,/a2d/681/1331-01">681 A.2d at 1335</a> (“Court must consider as true all the well-pleaded material facts set forth in appellant’s [pleading]”).

This is a legal argument, sounding in estoppel, which simply adds another layer to the dispute over liability.</p>

The NCP is an agreement between an employer or an insurer and a claimant regarding liability for the claimant’s injury. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 731 (NCP issued to “employe or his dependent”). But, liability for an injury is distinct from liability for a particular treatment or its cost. The NCP, even if “open” and binding with respect to liability for the injury, is not dispositive as to the medical care provider’s claim for reimbursement for the cost of a particular treatment. As a result, here, the so-called “open” NCP does not bar Zurich from disputing liability for payment to Crozer for Radel’s February 2006 surgery. <em>See, e.g., Gallie; Waugh; Gregory, <a href="/a2d/926/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="926 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="8372391" data-case-paths="/a2d/926/0564-01">supra.</a> </em>Thus, the “open” NCP simply cannot be construed as compelling a fee review on the merits if an insurer, rightly or wrongly, refused payment. <em>See Catholic Health Initiatives, </em><a href="/a2d/720/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="720 A.2d 509" data-case-ids="11801669" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0509-01">720 A.2d at 511</a>; 34 Pa.Code § 127.255.</p>

Fee review is a process for medical care providers to dispute “the amount or timeliness” of an insurer’s payment for a particular treatment, which are relatively simple matters. 77 P.S. § 531(5). But, Crozer’s petition contains no allegations that the medical fee had not been paid timely or had not been calculated in accordance with the compensation fee schedule or medical billing protocols. <em>See </em>34 Pa.Code §§ 127.208, 127.210 (timeliness provisions); 127.101-127.135, 127.151-127.162, 127.205-127.207 (amount calculation provisions).

Thus, the Department did not err in concluding that Crozer’s application did not raise either of the two narrow issues appropriate for fee review. Rather, Crozer sought a legal decision from non-qualified personnel within the Department on whether it was entitled to payment at all in view of the so-called “open” NCP. This type of decision is properly viewed as the province of specially qualified workers’ compensation judges, to be rendered within the context of claimant-insurer litigation.

Thus, the allegations in Crozer’s petition for review did not state a cause of action in <em>mandamus. </em>The Department did not err in applying Section 306(f.l)(5) of the Act and Regulation 127.255, and thereby dismissing as premature the application for fee review filed by appellant Crozer.

If a Regulation 127.209 explanation is not provided, an insurer may also dispute the necessity of treatment, or the corresponding bill, by filing for utilization review (UR) within the thirty-three day period in which the insurer has to satisfy the submitted bill. 77 P.S. § 531(5).

Any credit card company will tell its subscriber that nonpayment of a bill will incur late fees, as the bill was not paid in a timely manner.

By issuing a NTCP, employers invoke a statutory procedure which permits them to “initiate compensation payments without prejudice and without admitting liability” for the injury, while simultaneously commencing an investigation into the nature of the injury. 77 P.S. § 717.1(d)(1). Subsection (d)(2) specifies that <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>employers/insurers must notify claimants that the NTCP is “not an admission of liability of the employer with respect to the injury which is the subject” of the NTCP.

Prior to this statutory modification, there was uncertainty in the law. It was implicitly unclear whether, under what circumstances, and for what length of time, an employer or insurer could attempt to invoke material incorrectness to abrogate a previously issued NCP. This potentially prejudiced both employers/insurers attempting in good faith to do the right thing by paying compensation to an injured employee while preserving their ability to investigate, as well as employees who could never be sure when their NCP was absolutely final. The legislature has wisely ended this uncertainty, and thereby ended the <em>Beissel/Bama </em>conflict. When an employer/insurer recognizes that it may be liable for compensation, but wants time to investigate, its remedy is to issue a NTCP. It knows it has ninety days, and no more, to accept permanent liability by doing nothing, or to serve notice that it will not accept liability, and that a claimant must act to pursue a claim <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>within the normal course. The Commonwealth Court’s holding in <em>Mahon, </em>yields the statutorily unintended, if not absurd, result of permitting an employer to first issue a NTCP, wait ninety days and have it converted into a NCP, and then take the proverbial “second bite at the apple” by arguing material incorrectness under <em>Bama. </em>Accordingly, and consistent with the provisions of Section 717.1, the holding in <em>Beissel </em>that an issued NCP is final and admits liability for a work-related injury remains sound. Further, the exception to <em>Beissel </em>created by <em>Bama, </em>and employed by the <em>Mahon </em>majority, has been supplanted by the passage of Section 717.1(d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_16" id="ref_footnote_2_16">16</a>

I recognize that Section 771 grants a WCJ at any time the ability to review, modify, or set aside a NCP, if proven that such NCP is materially incorrect. As noted herein, however, an uncertainty existed between <em>Beissel </em>and <em>Bama </em>as to when Section 771 could be used to correct "investigative” mistakes in issued NCPs. In my view, any uncertainty between these two decisions has been resolved by the General Assembly’s enactment of Section 717.1 regarding NTCPs. I do not dispute the continued availability of Section 771, but giving employers and insurers the opportunity to challenge retroactively liability after issuing a NCP would turn Section 717.1 into a nullity.</p>
