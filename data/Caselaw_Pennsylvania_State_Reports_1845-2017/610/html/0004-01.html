The Order of the Superi- or Court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the Superior Court for consideration of whether the stop and frisk was supported by reasonable suspicion, a separate claim respondent raised that the panel did not reach given its disposition.</p>

The Commonwealth, as verdict winner, is entitled to have the facts reviewed in the light most favorable to it. <em>Commonwealth v.

The facts, viewed accordingly, reveal that respondent was in the precise place of an attempted break-in, at the precise time of the break-in, and carrying a tool consistent with the one used in that attempt. Two witnesses, including a police officer, observed respondent walking in the enclosed rear yard and through the gate of the property. The evidence further demonstrated damage to a door, doorknob, and window, consistent with an attempted burglary. These findings are sufficient to support respondent’s convictions of attempted burglary, attempted criminal trespass, criminal mischief, and possession of an instrument of crime.</p>
