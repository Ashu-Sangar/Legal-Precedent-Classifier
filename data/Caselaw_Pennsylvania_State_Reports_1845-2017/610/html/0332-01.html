A fuller life history emerges from their testimony than was heard by the jury at the penalty phase. Appellee was the first child of Joan Gibson, who married Appellee’s father, Ronald Gibson, Sr., at the age of 19, and became pregnant with Appellee shortly thereafter. The elder Mr. Gibson was an alcoholic and maintained a highly controlling attitude toward Mrs. Gibson, enforcing his will through threats and <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>violence directed at her. Some of the testimony indicated that he struck Mrs. Gibson while she was pregnant with Appellee. Ronald Gibson, Sr. eventually left the family when Appellee was 21 months old and never returned. Mrs. Gibson consumed alcohol while pregnant with Appellee, although there is no indication that Appellee suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome or any cognitive limitations as a result. <em>See </em>N.T., May 13, 2009, at 222-23, 293.</p>
    <p id="b400-4" data-blocks='[["BL_400.5",400,[258,743,1153,833]]]'>Mrs. Gibson used alcohol and marijuana in the home in Appellee’s presence. After the elder Mr. Gibson’s departure, Mrs. Gibson had a series of boyfriends who were violent and were also alcohol and drug abusers. Their substance abuse took place in Appellee’s presence in the home while he was a minor. Furthermore, Appellee was disciplined by Mrs. Gibson with her hand and with belts and sticks, sometimes while she was heavily intoxicated. Appellee stated that, during some of these beatings, he wished he were dead, although he denied suicidal ideation and reported no history of suicide attempts. <em>See </em>Report of John S. O’Brien at 4, <em>reproduced in </em>Petitioner’s Composite Exhibit II, at Tab 2 (O’Brien Report). Overall, Mrs. Gibson was unloving toward her children, and neglected them often, preferring to go out, “party,” and drink alcohol with her friends, rather than stay home and care for her children.</p>

His maternal grandparents and their other children (Appellee’s aunts and uncles) lived on the floors below. They could hear when an altercation was taking place on the third floor, and would bring Appellee downstairs to stay with them on such occasions. Although Appellee’s grandparents were alcoholics, they tried to provide a nurturing environment. Thus, Appellee preferred to be with them because they were kinder toward him than was Mrs. Gibson who, in any event, was often absent. Appellee’s aunt, Leora Johnson, who lived on the first floor of the house, tried to attend to Appellee’s needs when his mother was not at home. Appellee’s grandfather, Lavesta Bryant, also cared for Appellee, but he was strict and would discipline Appellee by admin<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>istering corporal punishment. According to Mr. Bryant, Appellee was amenable to discipline, and would never have to be warned twice not to misbehave. Indeed, Mrs. Gibson confirmed at the penalty phase that Appellee had no serious disciplinary problems while he was a minor. <em>See </em>N.T., Oct. 10, 1991, at 10.</p>

He was admitted to Simon Gratz High School, a “magnet” school in Philadelphia. While there, he performed well on standardized achievement tests and graduated near the top of his class, having been elected class president by his peers. Thereafter, Appellee attended community college in Philadelphia for a year. He also held a clerical position with the Social Security Administration for approximately three years, beginning in his later high school years. Appellee fathered a daughter with his girlfriend, Niema Williamson, who testified at the penalty phase that Appellee was a good father.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> During the 2009 post-conviction hearing, Ms. Williamson added that Appellee’s father’s absence from Appellee’s life bothered him, and she described Appellee’s escalating alcohol and drug use after graduating high school. <em>See </em>N.T., May 13, 2009, at 180-83.</p>

Although that evaluation reflects Appellee’s statement he had used alcohol and marijuana since age 17, testimony from other witnesses and Appellee’s admissions to health experts indicate that he began drinking earlier, at age 14, and that his alcohol consumption increased over the years. Furthermore, notwithstanding that Appellee was doing well academically in high <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>school, by the time he was a senior he was also using cocaine and, shortly thereafter, began smoking “turbos,” which are marijuana cigarettes laced with cocaine.</p>

He continued to operate as a drug dealer for several years before the homicides occurred in this case. During those years, Appellee regularly carried a .38-caliber weapon for protection, which he felt was necessary because he was selling thousands of dollars’ worth of drugs each day. This lifestyle, involving the trafficking of significant quantities of drugs, as well as the regular consumption of drugs and alcohol, continued until Appellee committed the present homicides at age 22, although there is little indication in the record that Appellee had acted violently on any prior occasion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

While the testimony is conflicting as to the amount of alcohol Appellee consumed in the hours leading up to the murders, it appears undisputed that he drank at least several shots of Southern Comfort (a type of liqueur) at Dooner’s Bar, where he was socializing before he travelled to Woody’s Playhouse Bar where the killings occurred. According to Derrick Hook, Appellee imbibed a 40-ounce bottle of beer early in the evening before Hook and Appellee walked to Dooner’s, and then Appellee drank a half-bottle of champagne at Dooner’s in addition to the shots of Southern Comfort. Further, there was testimony that Appellee may have tempo<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>rarily passed out at some point in the evening, either at a table at Dooner’s or in the car on the way to Woody’s.</p>

At this point, Appellee’s gun dropped and the clip fell out. Appellee quickly retrieved the firearm, put the clip back in, and scrambled over the bodies of numerous patrons lying on the floor to make his way from the back of the bar to the front. Appellee then looked back and noticed Officer Dukes reaching for his weapon. In response, Appellee crouched down to avoid being shot, pulled the slide back on his gun, and fired three shots toward Officer Dukes — at least two of which struck their target — all while backing out of the bar. Appellee immediately fled the scene on foot and met up with Tancemore and Green in the latter’s car.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> He then rode to Green’s residence and hid the .45-caliber pistol under Green’s mattress in an apparent attempt to conceal evidence.

Dr. O’Brien explained that Appellee was not alcohol “dependent,” as there was no evidence that he ever experienced withdrawal symptoms, but that substance abuse was a separate category of behavior in which a person continues to use significant amounts of an agent in spite of its harmful effects on his functioning. <em>Id. </em>at 232-33; <em>accord </em>N.T., May 14, 2009, at 36-37 (testimony of Dr. Bernstein that substance abuse means “you are using the agent in a highly dysfunctional way with a number of adverse consequences”); <em>id. </em>at 91-92 (same). The witness also referenced a multi-generational pattern of alcohol abuse spanning at least three generations, starting with Appellee’s grandparents, as supporting the concept that Appellee may have a genetic predisposition toward substance abuse. <em>See </em>N.T., May 13, 2009, at 209, 211. As regards specific mitigating factors, Dr. O’Brien articulated a general impression that there was some basis for the (e)(8) “catchall” mitigator predicated upon the dysfunctional family environment in which Appellee was raised. In this respect, Dr. O’Brien considered Appellee’s childhood history to have involved parental neglect and physical abuse (as opposed to discipline) at the hands of his mother, albeit Appellee had consistently denied being abused. <em>See id. </em>at 218-19, 228-29. Dr. O’Brien also identified “interpersonal aggressiveness in the home that wasn’t directed at the kids”— <em>i.e., </em>presumably between Appellee’s mother and her husband or boyfriends — as a factor contributing to the generally dys<a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>functional home environment during Appellee’s childhood. <em>Id. </em>at 220.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Upon questioning by the Commonwealth, Dr. O’Brien clarified that Appellee could appreciate the criminality of his conduct, as indicated by his flight and concealment of evidence. <em>See </em>N.T., May 13, 2009, at 239-40, 242. Because subsection (e)(3) is phrased in the disjunctive, Dr. O’Brien felt that any substantial impairment in Appellee’s ability to conform his conduct to the law’s requirements had independent relevance. He concluded that Appellee’s ability to conform was, indeed, substantially impaired, in light of evidence indicating that Appellee ingested a large quantity of alcohol on the night in question. Dr. O’Brien explained, in this respect, that alcohol <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>has a disinhibiting effect on users, causing them to act impulsively and use poor judgment and — with someone who is an alcohol abuser — can still leave the person capable of performing tasks requiring physical coordination. <em>See id. </em>at 282-83; <em>accord </em>N.T., May 14, 2009, at 108-10 (testimony of Dr. Bernstein). As applied here, Dr. O’Brien thought that such alcohol-induced disinhibition was a factor in Appellee’s actions, <em>see </em>N.T., May 13, 2009, at 214, 227-28, 237-38, 242, 253, 276, 299, particularly because Appellee, armed with a loaded weapon, confronted someone much larger than himself and acted in an aggressive or belligerent manner that Dr. O’Brien felt was uncharacteristic of Appellee. <em>See id. </em>at 295; <em>cf. </em>N.T., May 14, 2009, at 46 (reflecting Dr. Bernstein’s opinion that Appellee had “a marked propensity not to be violent”); <em>id. </em>at 135 (describing Appellee’s behavior as “[djisinhibited and atypical”).</p>

Dr. O’Brien reasoned that Appellee’s pattern of drug and alcohol use, starting from the time he was in school, had ultimately caused an “extreme disruption in his pathway,” from being a high-achieving academic performer with gainful employment and some college-level education, to an habitual criminal engaged in regular drug trafficking and drug and alcohol abuse on the streets of Philadelphia. N.T., May 13, 2009, at 206; <em>see also id. </em>at 214-15, 228, 298.

Along similar lines, the Commonwealth minimizes the importance of the 1999 affidavits which, it claims, are materially inconsistent with each other and with the trial and PCRA testimony, and purport to detail evidence from eight years earlier with “amazingly precise ‘recollections’ of’ the number of drinks Appellee had on the evening in question, when the affiants also claimed to have been drinking. <em>Id. </em>at 44; <em>see also id. </em>(observing that, of all Appellee’s friends who supplied affidavits, only one, Derrick Hook, testified).

Appellee also addresses the standard for entitlement to relief: that a “reasonable probability” of a different outcome must exist if the mental-health and intoxication evidence had been placed before the jury. He claims that such a probability exists here because the defense expert witnesses — who were “highly qualified, experienced psychiatrists” credited by the fact-finder — provided significant and weighty testimony “establishing the (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(8) mitigating circumstances.” Brief for Appellee at 50-51.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Moreover, Appellee echoes the PCRA court’s assessment that even the Commonwealth’s expert agreed with much of the defense mitigation case when he conceded that Appellee was <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>raised in a dysfunctional household, a circumstance that is known to enhance the risk of substance abuse. Appellee generally argues, as to all of these proofs, that they would have cast the good-character evidence presented by trial counsel in a new light, making that evidence seem more mitigating in view of the troubled circumstances in which Appellee was raised. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 59 (“Because the jury did not know about [AppelleeJ’s traumatic upbringing, ... the prosecutor ... was able to put a <em>negative </em>spin on the good character testimony ..., telling the jury [Appellee] was someone who was raised in a positive environment but ‘who threw away, who took no advantage of some of the things God had given to him.’ ” (quoting N.T., Oct. 10, 1991, at 47) (emphasis in original)).</p>

Nevertheless, we can evaluate the relative strength of the aggravation and mitigation, as well as the parties’ arguments in light of the full record. In this regard, we note our agreement with some of Appellee’s proffer. For example, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Commonwealth would have had difficulty in placing what Appellee terms a “negative spin” on the good-character testimony that he presented at the penalty hearing, if a fuller picture of his childhood had been put before the jury. On the other hand, we are less certain than Appellee that the jurors would have given more weight to the (e)(1) mitigator if they had learned more details about his background. That statutory factor, by its terms, pertains to the lack of a significant history of prior criminal <em>convictions, </em>and the jury was instructed accordingly. <em>See </em>N.T., Oct. 10, 1991, at 78. The fuller picture of Appellee’s life history, as presented to the PCRA court, confirms that he <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>distributed illegal drugs on a daily basis for months, if not years. Thus, while the jury may have still have found the (e)(1) factor based on a dearth of convictions, it would have understood that Appellee was, as his own expert testified, a “chronic criminal,” and that the absence of convictions meant that he was able to avoid being held criminally responsible.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[140,632,1159,1557]]]'>In light of the above and other factors previously discussed, and upon a careful review of the mitigation and aggravation as reflected in the entire trial and post-conviction record, we conclude that the new evidence in mitigation, even subsuming the intoxication evidence, is not reasonably likely to have swayed a juror to alter his or her vote. While we do not diminish the childhood troubles or substance abuse evident in Appellee’s background, the aggravation found by the jury was powerful: Appellee fired three rounds into a crowded bar, instantly killing Vernae Nixon, mortally wounding Officer Dukes, and imposing a grave risk of death upon other patrons, all during an attempted robbery. Against these aggravating factors, the life-history and mental-health mitigation is not compelling for reasons already discussed, including that it placed substantial emphasis on Appellee’s decision to abandon educational and professional opportunities in favor of a life on the streets using alcohol and drugs, carrying a gun, and selling illegal drugs, and on his voluntary actions in becoming intoxicated before committing the murders. <em>See generally Lesko, </em><a href="/pa/609/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="609 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="4201010" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0128-01">609 Pa. at 191-95</a>, <a href="/pa/609/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="15 A.3d 345" data-case-ids="4201010,7338275" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0128-01,/a3d/15/0345-01">15 A.3d at 383-84</a> (discussing <em>Smith v.

Fahy, </em><a href="/pa/512/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="512 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1800478" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0298-01">512 Pa. 298</a>, 317, <a href="/pa/512/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="512 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1800478" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0298-01">516 A.2d 689</a>, 698 (1986) ("At sentencing, the defendant is free to introduce any evidence in mitigation which might persuade the sentencer to be lenient in determining his penalty.”). Hence, the issue of whether the testimony in question supports subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3), as opposed to (e)(8), does not finally determine the question of prejudice — particularly where, as here, we agree with the PCRA court's determination that Appellee established a reasonable probability that the jury would have found the (e)(8) mitigator <em>(see infra).</em>

As noted, although Dr. Bernstein described the mood disorder as being organic, he stated that this did not imply there was any brain damage. He also explained that the term "organic,” in this context, means that there was an identifiable source for the disorder — namely, the drugs and alcohol — so that the mood changes were not merely idiosyncratic. <em>See </em>N.T., May 14, 2009, at 127-28.</p>

Appellee candidly acknowledges this standard, but avers that it is incorrect because it implies that the (e)(3) mitigator can never be proved based on voluntary intoxication alone, since by the time a penalty hearing is convened the jury has already determined that the defendant had a specific intent to kill. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 69 n.7. We note, however, that <em>Flor </em>and <em>Marinelli </em>are binding precedent, and the jury may consider voluntary intoxication of a lesser degree under subsection (e)(8). <em>See supra </em>note 16.</p>
