Briefly, the circumstances of the case, as set forth by this Court on direct review and/or by the PCRA court, are as follows. On February 2, 1995, having already committed three homicides in the prior two days, Appellant abducted Ms. Amstutz in or near her Harrisburg home. Holding her hostage, he directed her to cash two checks at two different banks, transactions- that were filmed by security cameras. Appellant also used Ms. Amstutz’s credit card to purchase items from a sporting goods store and to check into a Carlisle hotel. In the early evening, two witnesses observed a white male standing along a Carlisle road close to a parked car matching the description of Ms. Amstutz’s vehicle. Later in the evening, Appellant and two other individuals, Charles Carothers, an acquaintance, and Michelle Rhinehart, the mother of Appellant’s two children, smoked crack cocaine in the hotel room. Mr. Carothers subsequently left the hotel and drove Ms. Amstutz’s car to the apartment of Ms. Rhinehart’s sister.</p>

Later in the morning, police stopped Ms. Amstutz’s car, in which Ms. Rhinehart’s sister and a <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>friend were traveling to pick up Appellant and Ms. Rhinehart at the hotel. Police then surrounded Appellant’s hotel room and apprehended him after a lengthy standoff.</p>
    <p id="b100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[274,492,1150,511]]]'>A post-arrest search of the hotel room yielded the following: blood-stained jeans; a knife; credit cards issued in the name of Penny Gunnet, one of the previous murder victims; and an itemized accounting, written by Appellant, of the money he had stolen and his expenditures on crack cocaine and other items. Bullets recovered from Ms. Amstutz’s body and from the location where her body was discovered matched a nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol in Appellant’s possession. Appellant’s fingerprints were found on Ms. Amstutz’s car, and blood on his shoe was consistent with that of Ms. Amstutz.</p>
    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.6",100,[272,1036,1152,996]]]'>Appellant was tried by a jury for Ms. Amstutz’s murder in May 1996. Appellant’s 17-year-old sometime girlfriend, Christina Noland, testified for the Commonwealth regarding Appellant’s actions and motivation in the two days prior to the abduction and murder of Ms. Amstutz. Two days before Ms. Amstutz’s murder, Ms. Noland was with Appellant in his mother’s home in Clearfield County when he shot and killed his brother, Dustin Spotz, during an argument. Appellant and Ms. Noland fled to Schuylkill County, where, in need of a vehicle, Appellant abducted June Ohlinger, stole her car, and murdered her. After a short trip to Delaware, Appellant and Ms. Noland returned to Pennsylvania, this time to York County, where Appellant abducted Penny Gunnet, stole her car, and murdered her. Appellant then went on to Cumberland County without Ms. Noland, where the abduction and murder of Ms. Amstutz took place. Other evidence admitted at trial showed that the bullets used to kill Ms. Amstutz, Dustin Spotz, Ms. Gunnet, and Ms. Ohlinger all matched Appellant’s pistol.</p>

After hearing testimony from numerous witnesses, the jury found three aggravating and two mitigating circumstances, determined that the former outweighed the latter, and accordingly imposed the death penalty. The aggravating circumstances were that Appellant had committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); had a significant history of violent felony convictions, § 9711(d)(9); and had been convicted of another murder, § 9711(d)(ll). The mitigating circumstances were that Appellant had been neglected during his childhood and had a poor upbringing by his parents. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Following formal sentencing on June 17, 1996, Appellant filed a direct appeal to this Court, during which time he continued to be represented by Mr. Andrews.

We concluded that the killings were “logically connected primarily by the fact that [Ajppellant committed all four of them.” <em>Spotz III, supra </em>at 1286.

Another individual, Phillip Devenshire, was convicted of Mr. Thompson’s murder in 1993, although three witnesses at Mr. Devenshire’s trial, including the defendant himself, testified that Mr. Car-others was the shooter. Mr. Devenshire was convicted nearly three years before Appellant’s trial, and Appellant provides no evidence that Mr. Thompson’s murder was in any way related <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>to Ms. Amstutz’s murder.

First, the involvement of Mr. Carothers in the murder of Mr. Thompson is a matter of pure conjecture. Mr. Carothers was not arrested for, not charged with, not tried for, not convicted of the Thompson murder. The “evidence” that Mr. Carothers killed Mr. Thompson consists of some testimony presented at the trial of Mr. Devenshire. Three witnesses, one of whom was Mr. Devenshire himself, testified that Mr. Carothers was the shooter, but the jury must have concluded that the testimony was not credible, as it found Mr. Devenshire guilty of the first-degree murder of Mr. Thompson. Second, regardless of whether Mr. Carothers participated in Mr. Thompson’s murder, it is simply unfounded, improper, and indeed outlandish to suggest, as Appellant does, that because Mr. Carothers committed one murder, he must also have committed a second, unrelated murder years later. There is literally no way that the evidence implicating Mr. Carothers in the murder of Mr. Thompson could possibly be exculpatory of Appellant for the murder of Ms. Amstutz. <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>Finally, Appellant fails to suggest how the Commonwealth could have withheld, willfully or otherwise, testimony presented in a public trial.

The prosecutor’s reference to a gun must be considered in the broader context of Appellant’s lengthy history of felony convictions. Specifically, the following felony convictions were presented to the jury to support the aggravating circumstances of a significant history of violent felony convictions, pursuant to subsection 9711(d)(9): voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault convictions, on September 27, 1995; two felony robbery convictions on, respectively, June 12, 1990, and July 3, 1990; conspiracy to commit felony robbery conviction, on June 12, 1990; and three felony burglary convictions, on April 3, 1990.

Appellant baldly asserts, without benefit of accompanying argument or rationale, that the failure to provide such a jury instruction violates either the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or due process, in the following ways: violates the Eighth Amendment because the jury was not permitted to consider all relevant mitigating evidence and was presented with a false choice of sentencing options; violates the Eighth Amendment bar against arbitrary and capricious sentencing; offends evolving standards of decency in violation of the Eighth Amendment; violates due process by imposing a death sentence on the basis of inaccurate, material information which the defendant had no opportunity to rebut; and violates the right to an impartial jury by skewing the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Appellant’s Brief at 66-67. Appellant’s “argument” for each of these alleged constitutional violations consists, in its entirety, of footnote lists of United States Supreme Court opinions, devoid of even a parenthetical explanation, much less any development of the relevance or significance of the listed opinions to the relief Appellant seeks. <em>See <a href="/pa/590/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="232" data-cite="913 A.2d 220" data-case-ids="3851924,8436764" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0501-01,/a2d/913/0220-01">id.</a></em>

The children were released into the care of their grandmother, but subsequently they moved back into their mother’s home. Then, in 1983, as a result of “severe family dysfunction,” Appellant was admitted to the Children’s Aid Society; Appellant claimed that he had been beaten and mentally abused at home, although he also stated that he missed his family and wanted to maintain some contact with them. <em>Id. </em>at 1700-01. Appellant was placed in several foster homes, but because of his severe <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>behavioral problems, the placements were short-term.

The capital PCRA petitioner, if indigent, is entitled under our Rules to the appointment of PCRA counsel, at state expense.

The resources the Defender was able to bring to bear in litigating this state collateral attack border on the perverse, and this fact, combined with the tactics employed, and the obvious global efforts of the Defender to obstruct capital punishment in Pennsylvania at all costs, strongly suggests that there is more at work here than non-political, professionally responsible, “zealous advocacy.”</p>

But, the Defender has the resources and the luxury to pursue a more global agenda, and its conduct to date strongly suggests that, if it once engaged in mere legitimate zealous defense of particular clients, it has progressed to the zealous pursuit of what is difficult to view as anything but a political cause: to impede and sabotage the death penalty in Pennsylvania.

Our Court, like the U.S. Supreme Court and unlike the Third Circuit, is the highest court in its jurisdiction. Like the U.S. Supreme Court, we have finite manpower, and one of our most important functions is determining which cases on our discretionary dockets warrant review. Like the U.S. Supreme Court, we do not have the resources to grant review in every case: we look for cases posing new questions, close questions, questions affecting a wide range of cases, questions which have divided courts, cases posing supervisory questions, cases with apparent egregious errors, etc. Also like the U.S. Supreme Court, the cases we accept typically pose a very limited number of discrete issues.

In fact, counsel have no idea what actions have been undertaken by this Court in its deliberations. The Defender and Ballard then go on to attack this Court’s entire handling of its capital docket. The Defender and Ballard contemptuously declare that, “Based on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s track record of deciding capital appeals, [appellant’s] opportunity for any substantive state court review of his case is still years away.” The Defender and Ballard then declare that they face “continued inordinate delay before a state court that has proven itself incapable of managing its capital docket,” later accusing the Court of “leaving [the appeal] to languish” and falsely alleging that it has been held “in suspense.” The Defender and Ballard declare that “judicial delays in the determination of initial PCRA appeals have become routine.” The Defender and Ballard then complain of the undecided “active” cases on our docket, making no attempt to account for: the record and briefing status of cases; whether there have been remands; whether they are serial PCRA petition appeals (appeals, frequently time-barred and frivolous, most often filed by the Defender, which generate automatic delay in the disposition of pending federal <em>habeas </em>petitions); and the role of individual circumstances — such as delays requested by or chargeable to the Defender itself.

The Commonwealth argues that appellant’s stated rationale for refusing to introduce relevant evidence before the PCRA judge of his supposed mental retardation — a professed fear of thereby waiving his claim of an existing “right” to a jury determination — is “nonsense,” since appellant made an objection before the PCRA court, which the court specifically noted that the objection preserved the jury question for this Court’s review. The Commonwealth hypothesizes that such a facially risky position suggests that appellant and his counsel have their strategic sights set on <em>de novo habeas corpus </em>review in the local federal courts, which appellant’s federal lawyers view as a more sympathetic forum in capital matters. Luring this Court into finding the <em>Atkins </em>claim waived, the Commonwealth argues, “would offer them their best long-term prospect for relief,” since “if no <em>Atkins </em>hearing is held in state court, defense counsel will argue on <em>habeas </em>review that defendant is entitled to such a hearing in federal court. And, since it has been decades since the federal courts have upheld a sentence of death with respect to any Philadelphia prisoner who did not consent to be executed, they will find themselves in a remarkably favorable forum for that argument.” <em>See </em>Brief of the Commonwealth at 19-20.

But, the Defender is financed and positioned to strategize differently and globally. In Pennsylvania capital cases, the Defender routinely argues in federal <em>habeas </em>court that various Pennsylvania procedural default rules are arbitrarily applied, and therefore should be ignored. The reward, if the federal court accepts the argument, is <em>de novo </em>federal review, unimpeded by state court findings, and unimpeded by the federal <em>habeas </em>standard of review requiring deference to state court decisions. The result of this perverse system of incentives for professional capital counsel who ping-pong back and forth between state and federal courts, and who have seemingly inexhaustible federal resources and ample cases to choose from, is an opportunity and incentive to feign that they do not know how to comply with state procedural rules, <em>see Steele, </em><a href="/pa/599/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="385" data-cite="961 A.2d 786" data-case-ids="3440642,8191812" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0341-01,/a2d/961/0786-01">961 A.2d at 834-38</a> (Castille, C.J., joined by McCaffery, J., concurring); and in the process attempt to generate “uneven” <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>procedural default rulings by the state courts. Then, counsel will proceed to argue in federal court that the particular default rule should be ignored in all cases. The state response, faced with continuing federal criticism that our procedural rules have.too much discretionary flexibility to be considered legitimate expressions of state sovereignty, is to adopt less flexible rules. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b249-17" data-blocks='[["BL_249.18",249,[175,2317,1107,41]],["BL_250.1",250,[264,306,1153,625]]]'>Nolas’s argument respecting the PCRA court’s power to <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>decide was straight out of “Catch-22.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> He argued that the PCRA court: (a) could not dismiss the serial <em>Brady </em>claim (a new PCRA claim that led Ñolas to secure a federal stay of the <em>habeas </em>appeals pending in the Third Circuit) without also ruling on the pending <em>Atkins </em>petition; and (b) could not rule on the <em>Atkins </em>claim, because the court somehow lacked authority to do so, and Ñolas would have to object. So, according to Ñolas, the PCRA court could act on neither “claim,” and counsel had already succeeded in having the federal <em>habeas </em>appeals held until the PCRA court acted on the <em>Brady </em>claim. Then, Ñolas appealed the non-final order. This Defender strategy assured a <em>de facto, </em>perpetual stay of execution.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[261,955,1157,831]]]'>It bears mentioning that the argument advanced by Ñolas that the PCRA court in <em>Porter </em>lacked power to rule on <em>Atkins </em>was frivolous. There is no basis in the PCRA or any other governing rules or law to hold serial PCRA petitions in abeyance; and there most certainly is no basis in law to hold a PCRA petition in stasis merely to permit the petitioner to seek federal <em>habeas </em>relief. Likewise, Nolas’s earlier argument that there was “no point” in deciding the serial <em>Atkins </em>issue until the Third Circuit decided other, already-exhausted, non-<em>Atkins </em>claims is baseless. The appeals before the Third Circuit in <em>Porter </em>will not eliminate the <em>Atkins </em>claim. If the district court’s grant of relief on a perceived penalty phase instructional error is reversed, Porter’s death sentence will stand. If the determination is affirmed, the Commonwealth is free to seek the death penalty in a new proceeding. Either way, it is a capital case and the <em>Atkins </em>issue must be decided.</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[262,1812,1154,464]]]'>Not once, by the way, did Ñolas forward the Defender’s new-found concern with delay while ensuring delay in both judicial systems in <em>Porter, </em>instead telling each court it could not act. The very same group — the Defender — engaged in these shenanigans in <em>Porter </em>and then forwarded the “court can’t manage its docket” complaint in <em>Dougherty. </em>These are the sorts of abuses that keep us from addressing all of the Defender’s over-maximum briefs simultaneously in their other cases, and rendering decisions according to their schedule.</p>

Another case cited by the Defender in the <em>Dougherty </em>federal pleading as an example of this Court’s incapacity is <em>Commonwealth v. Banks, </em>Nos. 461, 505, and 578 CAP, which also prominently features Billy Ñolas. <em>Banks </em>concerns narrow issues of competency to be executed, and is a case in this Court’s plenary jurisdiction. This Court is well familiar with the record in <em>Banks. </em>Nolas’s strategic maneuverings in <em>Banks, </em>including but not limited to forwarding unauthorized motions before our masters to impede the Commonwealth’s expert’s examinations of Banks, caused numerous, lengthy periods of delay; and in addition, required this Court to step in on multiple occasions and assure that the fair hearing we had ordered would be held, consistent with our directive. <em>Commonwealth v.

Much of this Court’s time has been taken up with the Defender’s strategic diversions. The Defender obviously has no fixed position on delay. When delay advances their global litigation strategy, they do their best to grind state courts to a halt, as with their prolix pleadings and abusive briefing in this case, and their more extreme conduct and/or misconduct in cases like <em>Banks, Abdul-Salaam, </em>and <em>Bracey. </em>When faux outrage about the delays their overall strategy necessarily induces serves their purpose, they forward that claim, accusing Pennsylvania courts of incompetence or laziness, their argument unencumbered by concerns for accuracy, honesty, and candor.</p>

Two examples of Defender delay in cases the Defender calls “active” and “pending” and “languishing” due to this Court's supposed incapability are illustrative of the abusiveness of the federal motion filed in <em>Dougherty. Commonwealth v. Clayton, </em>573 CAP, involves a serial PCRA petition filed in 2004. That matter was not briefed and submitted to the Court until March 29, 2011. Before filing the underlying serial petition, the Defender had successfully moved to have Clayton’s federal <em>habeas </em>petition held in abeyance so he could ping-pong back to state court to pursue serial claims. State relief was denied in June of 2008 because the serial petition was untimely; yet, the Defender appealed. Thereafter, the matter was delayed because the Defender failed to discharge its duty as appellant to ensure the forwarding of the record. It was only after the Commonwealth filed a Motion to Dismiss in March of 2010 that the logjam broke, and the Defender, in response to the Motion, requested that a briefing schedule issue. The Defender obviously knew these facts when it filed its federal motion in <em>Dougherty. </em>The defendant, and then the Defender, also caused the bulk of the delay in <em>Commonwealth v. Ali, </em>437 CAP, as detailed in our recent opinion deciding that case. <em>See </em><a href="/pa/608/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="417" data-cite="10 A.3d 282" data-case-ids="4199816,7283852" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0071-01,/a3d/10/0282-01">10 A.3d 282</a>, 290 (Pa.2010). The PCRA petitioner in <em>Ali </em>sought to represent himself, and we remanded for a hearing on the issue. The Defender opposed its client's wishes every step of the way, which included claiming that Ali must be incompetent if he did not want its services, filing an interlocutory appeal, attempting to add new collateral claims in violation of the limited remand order, and then filing an unauthorized appeal after the PCRA court granted Ali’s request to represent himself. It is debatable whether all of these procedural maneuvers were legitimate; what is not debatable is that it was the defendant's request, and the Defender's ensuing maneuvers, not judicial indifference, that delayed the case.</p>

I am persuaded, however, that counsel’s assessment that the hearsay evidence produced from fellow prisoners implicating Carothers in the killing was not sufficiently trustworthy to warrant admissibility. <em>See </em>N.T., May 10, 2007, at 230-39. Furthermore, it would appear to me that, much like the evidence of voluntary intoxication, the evidence of Carothers’ involvement was a two-edged sword in any event. For example, one of the prisoners testified on post-conviction that, before she was killed, Ms. Amstutz had been placed in the trunk of her car while Appellant and Carothers were “riding around” and “getting high.” <em>See id. </em>at 98.

Spotz, </em>CP-21-CR-0794-1995, <em>slip op. </em>at 54 (C.P. Cumberland, June 26, 2008), I have reservations about the majority’s categorical dismissal of Appellant’s concerns here. While it is true that this Court has indicated that it is permissible for a prosecutor to “disparage” mitigation evidence proffered by a defendant, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 97-OS, 18 A.3d at 291-92, certainly a prosecutor may not deny there is some mitigating effect of the circumstances the Legislature expressly has denominated as mitigating, nor may he <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>inject unfair prejudice into the proceedings. Thus, as with many other issues, assessment of these types of claims involves matters of degree and not mere categorization. Notably, moreover, some other jurisdictions have taken a more restrictive approach to overt denigration of a mitigation case. <em>See, e.g., Williamson v. State, </em><a href="/so2d/994/1000-01" class="citation" data-index="443" data-cite="994 So. 2d 1000" data-case-ids="8209862" data-case-paths="/so2d/994/1000-01">994 So.2d 1000</a>, 1014 (Fla.2008) (highlighting that the Florida high court has “long recognized that a prosecutor cannot improperly denigrate mitigation during a closing argument”). To the degree we continue to see prosecutorial arguments implying that no weight should be afforded by jurors to statutorily-prescribed mitigators and/or approaching the boundaries of fairness, it seems to me advisable to consider a similar approach.</p>
