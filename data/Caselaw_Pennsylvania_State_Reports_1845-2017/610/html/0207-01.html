      <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>Regarding the recusal of the PCRA judge from this matter on remand, however, I respectfully feel compelled to comment upon why I believe such action is necessary. At a PCRA hearing in February 2008, the PCRA court judge called Appellant “vile.” <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony (N.T.), Mar. 7, 2008 at 7. When Appellant’s counsel reviewed the February 2008 PCRA hearing transcript, however, he found this remark directed to his client had not been transcribed. This prompted counsel to write to the court reporter requesting that she not destroy or discard any audio recordings of the proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[148,916,1153,523]]]'>In response to this letter, the PCRA judge ordered that a hearing take place on March 7, 2008. At that hearing, the PCRA judge conceded that she had made the above comment, <em>see id. </em>at 7 (“Oh, you know what, the record should reflect that. I did call him vile, period, I did.”); and, importantly, also acknowledged that she had privately directed the court reporter to remove various comments from the record, which she deemed “non-judicial.” <em>See id. </em>at 5-6 (“I told [the court reporter] to [remove] words that are less than judicial because I’m Southern and I say words like flipping or sucker____”).</p>
    <p id="b269-6" data-blocks='[["BL_269.6",269,[145,1461,1156,630]]]'>The PCRA judge’s personal affront to Appellant, while inappropriate, would not precipitate this concurring statement; nor, in my view, recusal of the PCRA judge. The alteration of the transcript, however, is another matter. Litigants and the appellate courts alike have but one vehicle through which to examine a trial court’s proceedings for potential irregularities: the certified record. Therefore, to alter a record is to strike at the very pillars of meaningful appellate review, and concomitantly therewith, the basic tenets of due process. Thus, it is my opinion that a judge’s extraordinary action in altering the official record of judicial proceedings, regardless of any protested justification, should precipitate serious repercussions.</p>

While the utterance of the slight could be understood as an emotional outburst during a difficult proceeding, when it is coupled with a subsequent attempt to suppress its existence, there is a sufficient appearance of <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>impropriety to warrant the culpable judge’s disqualification. <em>See </em>Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(C)(1) (“Judges should disqualify themselves in a proceeding in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned----”).</p>

In my respectful view, as fully explained above, the actions of the PCRA judge instantly evince, at the very least, an “appearance of impropriety,” necessitating my conclusion that she abused her discretion in denying Appellant’s oral motion for recusal. The comments by the judge that Appellant was a “vile” human notwithstanding, to direct privately a court reporter to alter an official transcript, the only vehicle through which appellate courts can ensure the due process of law, is <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>reprehensible and should be condemned universally. The PCRA judge’s explanation was that words which were “less than judicial” were removed, <em>see </em>N.T., Mar. 7, 2008 at 6, somehow asserting a <em>“de minimis </em>excuse” to rationalize transcript alteration. To me, there can be no justification or excuse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">4</a> Moreover, to attack counsel personally for requesting recusal, when the law requires such motions to be put forth before the judge whose actions are in question in the first instance, is obviously inappropriate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">5</a>

Nevertheless, it should be noted that the majority of this Court ordered the PCRA judge's recusal. Moreover and importantly, this case does not involve only inappropriate comments. Rather, it involves the <em>sub silentio </em>alteration of a transcript, an infringement of process that I cannot countenance under any circumstances.
