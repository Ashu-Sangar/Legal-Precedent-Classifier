The trial court noted that Petitioner had presented fraudulent evidence; the fraudulent evidence was material to the defense case; and the issue arising from the discovery of the fraud was a fact question for the trial court to decide.

The General Assembly has vested jurisdiction in this Court over “final orders of the Superior Court” and has provided that such orders may be reviewed by this Court “upon allowance of appeal.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 724. A “final order” is broadly defined by Pa.R.A.P. 1112 and includes “any order that concludes an appeal.” The double jeopardy claim forwarded in the Petition for Review filed in Superior Court was not a traditional “appeal;” rather, it was primarily an attempt to secure pretrial review of the trial court’s finding that the double jeopardy challenge was “frivolous.” As we will explain below, the <em>Brady </em>case relied upon by the Superior Court specifically provided that a narrow and unique form of pre-trial review of such determinations would be available. However, <em>Brady </em>did not specify precisely how this review would occur, or in which court, and subsequent case law developments have confused matters further. For purposes of the case <em>sub judice, </em>what matters is that the Superior Court’s order of denial, which <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>neither quashed the “appeal” nor transferred it to this Court, certainly “concluded” the pre-trial <em>Brady </em>appeal, such as it was; and thus, it was a final order, subject to this Court’s discretionary jurisdiction under Section 724.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Pa.R.A.P. 1102 governs improvident appeals and provides that if an appeal is improvidently taken to this Court under Rule 1101 (relating to appeals from the Commonwealth Court) and the proper filing was a PAA, “this alone shall not be a ground for dismissal, but the papers whereon the appeal was taken shall be regarded” and acted on as a PAA. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1102. While the context of Rule 1102 and its wording indicate that it is unique to appeals from the Commonwealth Court, this Court has invoked this Section as a basis for treating a petition for review as a PAA in a matter involving an appeal from the Superior Court. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The Court conceded that it was possible that a meritorious double jeopardy claim could be “overlooked by both a hearing court and the appellate court in which a stay is sought.” But, on balance, the Court concluded that this minimal risk was justified by the need for prompt trials and <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>expeditious dispositions. The Court pointed out that the availability of an automatic stay upon filing a <em>Bolden </em>appeal “encourages the use of frivolous appeals as a means of avoiding prosecution.” Such “needless delays engendered by frivolous appeals hinder the administration of justice as well as the public interest.” <em>See <a href="/pa/510/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="510 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1797026" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0336-01">id.</a> </em>at 291 &amp; n. 4.</p>

We embrace the <em>Brady </em>Court’s view that a defendant, who has had a pre-trial double jeopardy challenge dismissed as frivolous, may seek preliminary appellate review of that conclusion as of right. We also direct that the stay must first be sought in the court where the <em>Bolden </em>
      <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>appeal would lie if there had been no finding of frivolousness — the Superior Court in most non-capital cases. We specifically disapprove of the <em>Learn </em>court’s alternative interpretation. Finally, we take the liberty of reconciling <em>Brady </em>with the framework for appellate review established by our Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[259,680,1157,895]]]'>Turning first to the question of whether the Superior Court has jurisdiction over a Brady-style request for review, we recognize that there is no explicit rule that gives that court jurisdiction over such a request. The procedure adopted and outlined in <em>Brady </em>was <em>sui generis, </em>involving this one narrow class of “stay appeals.” Nevertheless, it is clear that <em>Bolden </em>appeals (in most non-capital cases) proceed to the Superior Court. Moreover, the effect of <em>Brady </em>was to take orders which had been recognized as final orders by this Court in <em>Bolden </em>and devise a procedure by which those appealable orders would become non-appealable — but subject to narrow appellate review — where the trial court explicitly found that the double jeopardy issue was frivolous. There is no indication in the <em>Brady </em>Opinion that this Court intended double jeopardy review requests in non-capital cases to proceed directly to this Court, rather than to the court where the <em>Bolden </em>appeal ordinarily would lie.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[262,1597,1156,786]],["BL_623.1",623,[134,317,1153,148]]]'>The difficulty with <em>Brady </em>is that, in a single, cryptic comment, it channeled the necessary appellate review into a standalone “stay” procedure. <em>See Brady, </em><a href="/pa/510/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="510 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1797026" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0336-01">508 A.2d at 291</a>. Notably, however, there can be instances in which judicial review of a trial court’s finding of frivolousness is required but a stay is not. For example, in the present case, the trial court has continued the retrial proceedings awaiting the outcome of Petitioner’s submissions in the appellate courts. Accordingly, there was no imminent need to request a stay from the Superior Court. More importantly, as made evident in <em>Learn, </em>the <em>Brady </em>Court neglected to consider the jurisdictional foundation for a stay request of the Superior Court in the absence of an underlying appeal. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1702 (“Stay <em>Ancillary to Appeal </em>” (emphasis added)); Pa.R.A.P. 1781 (“Stay <em>Pending Action on Petition for Review </em>” (emphasis <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>added)). Thus, it is manifest that there are practical, conceptual, and jurisdictional difficulties associated with the <em>Brady </em>Court’s undeveloped conception of a “stay appeal.”</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[133,489,1156,791]]]'>We believe the most efficacious remedy is to employ the existing procedures of Chapter 15 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure and permit a petitioner seeking review of a trial court’s finding of frivolousness to file a Petition for Review in the Superior Court, as Petitioner has done here. The centerpiece of Chapter 15 is the use of the “petition for review” as the vehicle for implicating the jurisdiction of the appellate court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1511. Significantly, under Pa.R.A.P. 1501, matters designated by general rule are appropriately channeled into Chapter 15. Here, we consider it a modest adaptation of <em>Brady </em>to so designate the procedure invoking the review which it contemplated. Indeed, such approach dovetails with the review of orders refusing to certify interlocutory orders for immediate appeal, which are reviewed by the appellate courts under Chapter 15. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1501(a)(4).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
