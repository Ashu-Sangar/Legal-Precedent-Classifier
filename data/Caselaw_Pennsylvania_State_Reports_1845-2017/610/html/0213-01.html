(Father) on August 27, 2001. Mother and Father were living together but not married at the time of L.J.B.’s birth, and separated when L.J.B. was eleven months old. Upon their separation, in accord with a written agreement between Mother and Father, L.J.B. lived primarily with Mother and her half-siblings, while Father enjoyed physical custody on, essentially, alternating weekends. Four months after the separation, in November of 2002, Father married W.B. (Stepmother), and soon thereafter filed a custody complaint in the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>Clinton County Court of Common Pleas, seeking increased physical custody. After substantial proceedings, on November 19, 2003, the Honorable J. Michael Williamson, President Judge of Clinton County, granted Father’s request for increased physical custody of L.J.B., awarding him six consecutive days during each two-week period.</p>
    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[137,643,1155,310]]]'>Before proceeding further, it is necessary to detail what was Father’s irresponsible conduct involving the child in his quest to undermine Mother’s custodial and parental rights. It is also necessary as part of this discussion to specify what we respectfully view as an appearance of impropriety by Judge Williamson, who presided over the custody proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.6",279,[134,977,1158,736]]]'>During the approximate year (November 2002 through November 2003) that the custody proceedings between Father (and, essentially, Stepmother) and Mother were ongoing, the relationship between Father and Mother deteriorated significantly. In fact, on approximately six occasions during the year, Father took L.J.B. to medical professionals claiming that Mother had sexually abused the child, subjecting her to pelvic examinations and pelvic cleaning.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Additionally, Father reported Mother to Clinton County Children and Youth Services (CYS) making the same allegations. In due course, the physicians and CYS caseworkers involved determined that Father’s allegations were without merit. Eventually, Judge Williamson entered an order, on October 20, 2003, enjoining further unnecessary medical examinations of L.J.B.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Mother appealed this order to the Superior Court. During the course of the appeal, Father again accused Mother of sexually abusing L.J.B., this time by way of an ex parte letter sent to Judge Williamson on November 9, 2004.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Rather than disregard the ex parte communication, Judge Williamson held a hearing on November 24, 2004 to entertain Father’s allegations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> As part of the hearing, a memorandum from a CYS caseworker to Judge Williamson concluding that Father’s accusations were unfounded was entered into the record. Nevertheless, in an order dated November 30, 2004, Judge Williamson revoked his previous order to cease the continuous pelvic examinations of L.J.B., and permitted Father (and it appears only Father) to subject L.J.B. to such examinations by an agreed upon pediatrician, Dr. Henry Dietrich.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[263,1261,1150,406]],["BL_281.1",281,[133,310,1153,358]]]'>According to Mother, over the course of the next year, Father continued to exhibit aggressive behavior toward her. Mother related that Father repeatedly threatened her over the telephone, followed her home, and arrived at a custody exchange of L.J.B. with a loaded .357 handgun. On January 25, 2006, Father again sought custody modification, this time filing a petition with Judge Williamson for primary physical custody of the child. Two days later, and despite the order of <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>November 30, 2004, that any further medical examinations were only to be conducted by Dr. Dietrich, Father took L.J.B. to an emergency room at 11:00 p.m. for what would be the child’s eighth vaginal examination since November 2002. The record reveals that an intrusive examination, complete with color photographs, was undertaken. As with the prior exams, this one revealed no evidence of sexual or physical abuse.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[135,692,1151,460]]]'>After the January 2006 examination, CYS sent a second memorandum to Judge Williamson, in which it threatened to “open an abuse investigation if [Father and Stepmother] continue to have the child unnecessarily examined or cleaned.” Moreover, the Agency stated that it would “also request a temporary change in visitation <em>\e.g., </em>the custody/partial custody arrangement] during the course of the investigation.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.), Docket No. 802-02, Feb. 10, 2006 at 43.</p>
    <p id="b281-6" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[134,1185,1152,518]]]'>Notwithstanding CYS’s obvious concerns over Father’s conduct and L.J.B.’s well-being, on February 10 and March 2, 2006, Judge Williamson held a hearing concerning Father’s petition for primary physical custody. The court reserved ruling on the matter, instead referring Mother and Father to a court-appointed psychologist “for the purpose of enabling [the psychologist] to submit to the Court his observations and thoughts with regard to the psychological background of these parents.” <em>C.L.F. v. </em>No. 802-02, Order of Court (Mar. 6, 2006) (Williamson, P.J.).</p>

In the subsequent termination proceedings, Mother explained that she felt she had no choice but to give up her custody battle and leave the area to protect L.J.B. from continued pelvic examinations. She elaborated that Father had continued to threaten her, in her view CYS had failed to take any action against Father or to protect L.J.B., and she believed Judge Williamson to be biased against her. Thus, according to Mother, in an effort to protect L.J.B., <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>she surrendered physical custody of her to Father, and moved to Tennessee. Upon Mother’s relocation, Judge Williamson evidently viewed the litigation over primary physical and legal custody as moot, and entered an order granting Father sole physical and legal custody of L.J.B. In the court’s order, it explained that in its view Mother had “abruptly and without prior notice to anyone, dropped her children off with their various fathers, and moved to Tennessee.” <em>Id., </em>Order of Court (Apr. 3, 2006) (Williamson, P.J.).</p>
    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.5",282,[261,800,1154,679]]]'>Over the course of the next year, Mother attempted to maintain contact with L.J.B. from Tennessee through arranged weekly telephone conversations. She also accepted a proposed visitation arrangement (brokered by the court-appointed psychologist) of one weekend a month with the child. According to Mother, however, Father and Stepmother repeatedly cut short the telephone conversations, and circumvented Mother’s attempts to visit. Indeed, it was not until December of 2006, after the psychologist and the court intervened, that Mother finally visited with L.J.B. This visit consisted of a two-hour meeting at a McDonald’s in Clinton County, where Father and Stepmother remained present throughout the reunion of Mother and L.J.B.</p>
    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[259,1505,1158,846]],["BL_283.1",283,[141,318,1159,255]]]'>Throughout 2007, Mother continued her attempts to remain in contact with L.J.B. Her efforts included the making of telephone calls, the sending of presents, and the arranging for “proxy calls” by L.J.B.’s half-siblings. According to Mother, however, these efforts were thwarted by Father and Stepmother. This led L.J.B.’s maternal Grandmother to petition for visitation in the summer of 2007. During the hearing on this petition, Judge Williamson continuously berated Grandmother for both her and Mother’s actions over the course of L.J.B.’s life. As detailed <em>infra, </em>Part III, Judge Williamson voiced his disgust over what he viewed as Mother’s abandonment of L.J.B., and went so far as to suggest that Father seek to terminate Mother’s parental rights. <em>See </em>N.T., Docket No. 818-07, Jul. 11, 2007 at 9,11. Despite his expressed viewpoint regarding Mother and, apparently by derivation, Grandmother, Judge Williamson granted Grandmother one supervised <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>visit with L.J.B. <em>See B.J.B. v. S.M.B., </em>No. 818-07, Order of Court (Jul. 11, 2007) (Williamson, P.J.) (directing CYS to “arrange a supervised visit between Grandmother and the child; following which, we will consider the entry of a further Order.”).</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[142,602,1156,735]]]'>A meeting between Grandmother and L.J.B. did, in fact, occur and, afterwards, CYS memorialized to Judge Williamson that Father was not going to allow any further meetings. <em>See </em>Memorandum from CYS to Judge Williamson (Jul. 23, 2007) (“[CYS caseworker] attempted to schedule additional visits but [Father] refused. He said that he is unable to do so due to his work schedule. [Caseworker] pointed out that [Stepmother] can bring [L.J.B.] into the office, but [Father] said that he would speak to his lawyer. He left the visit angry. It is clear that some, if not all of [L.J.B.’s] reluctance to visit [with Grandmother] is because of [Father’s] attitude.”). Judge Williamson then placed another order on the record, directing that Father was to permit Grandmother visitation once a month.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[141,1372,1157,740]]]'>Immediately thereafter, Father’s counsel submitted a letter to Judge Williamson, noting that Judge Williamson’s initial order pertaining to Grandmother’s visitation only directed Father to take L.J.B. to meet with Grandmother once. <em>See </em>Letter from Marc S. Drier, Esq., to Judge Williamson (Jul. 26, 2007). Counsel contended that Grandmother “disturbed” the child by stating that Mother and her half-siblings missed her. <em>Id. </em>Without a hearing, Judge Williamson terminated Grandmother’s visits. <em>See B.J.B. v. S.M.B., </em>No. 818-07, Order of Court (Sep. 4, 2007) (Williamson, P.J.). Following this order, Mother continued to attempt to contact L.J.B. by telephone and the sending of gifts; but Father and Stepmother refused or cut short the calls and apparently did not give L.J.B. the gifts.</p>

Mother explained that she gave up the custody fight and moved to Tennessee because she believed that this was the only way to save L.J.B. from the continuing medical examinations. Mother stated that she intended to commence new custody proceedings in Clinton County once Judge Williamson retired because she believed that he was biased against her.

Much of his reasoning concerned what Judge Miller termed as Mother’s mistaken belief that Judge Williamson was biased against her.

On this point, we must note that the plague is certainly not solely on Judge Williamson's house. As revealed above, Father subjected L.J.B. to no less than eight pelvic examinations before the child's eighth birthday. Notwithstanding the lack of any evidence to the contrary, Father continuously accused Mother of sexual abuse of L.J.B., and in a vain attempt to gather evidence in support of this contention, forced L.J.B. to undergo and endure the trauma of these examinations. This reprehensible conduct, however, is at least partially derivative of Judge <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>Williamson’s refusal to enforce his own orders banning the examinations.</p>

The father, who was on active duty in the Marine Corps, conversely testified that during the prior three and one-half years, all of his attempts to see his son were thwarted by his ex-wife. The father went to Legal Aid, but, since he did not meet the income guidelines, he did not initiate legal action to enforce his parental rights.

The sole basis highlighted by the Superior Court in refusing to give credence to all of Mother’s continued efforts to perform parental duties rested upon Mother’s failure to pursue court intervention after 2007. Indeed, Mother acknowledged that she did not continue legal intervention after the custody court failed to enforce its orders prohibiting Child’s repeated pelvic examinations and permitting Mother’s weekend partial custody following her relocation from Pennsylvania. No one — not Father, the GAL, the orphans’ court, or the Superior Court — has explained how Mother was to maintain contact with Child, let alone assert prominence in her life, in the face of Father’s unfounded allegations of sexual abuse, heinous exposure of this young child to multiple vaginal examinations, and abhorrent interference in the mother-child relationship.

In fact, the petitioning mother admitted that she had “no plans to have the child adopted by a stepparent or any other person.” <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the trial court, in the first instance based upon evidence of record, properly rejected her petition. In <em>T.R., </em>the trial court in reaching its decision to terminate applied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. On appeal, this Court determined that the proper standard of proof, in accord with <em>Santosky v. Kramer, <a href="/us/455/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="455 U.S. 745" data-case-ids="11307633" data-case-paths="/us/455/0745-01">supra,</a> </em>was clear and convincing evidence. Thus, we vacated the termination decree and remanded for a new termination hearing applying the proper standard.</p>

When the case was decided by the trial court (under the proper standard) and appealed to the Superior Court, the record establishes that adoption by Stepmother was contemplated. When this Court granted Mother’s petition for allow<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>anee of appeal, the record substantiates that adoption by Stepmother was contemplated. Currently, the record confirms that adoption by Stepmother was contemplated, as neither Stepmother nor Father has filed any formal documents averring otherwise. Indeed, the OAJC acknowledges that a “final decision regarding mootness cannot be made by this Court upon this record.” OAJC at 1109. Hence, I submit that the mere assertion of changed circumstances is an insufficient basis to invoke this prudential rule, which requires the changes to “finally and conclusively dispose of the controversy.” <em>National Development Corp., </em><a href="/citations/?q=439%20A.2d%201308" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="439 A.2d 1308">439 A.2d at 1310</a>.</p>

Instead, it “vacate[s] the order of the Superior Court and remand[s] ... to the court of common pleas for an immediate evidentiary hearing to determine if the instant action is now moot,” based upon mere assertions made in <em>ex parte </em>letters that were subsequently made part of the record, and directs the court to dismiss this matter if it determines that Stepmother has changed her mind about adopting L.J.B. OAJC at 1101, 1113. If not based on the merits of these mere assertions, on what basis does the OAJC vacate the Superior Court order? The OAJC has envisioned only one resolution herein, and it unnecessarily leaves Mother and Child in a state of flux if Father’s and Stepmother’s intentions have not changed. The OAJC is deafeningly silent concerning where this case stands if Father and Stepmother intend to proceed with adoption, which, as I have established, is in accord with the formal record as it exists today. Mother has proceeded through her direct appeal, and this Court has wisely chosen to grant discretionary review. The briefs have been filed, considered, and the matter is ripe. If, as the OAJC contemplates, Father does not intend to seek adoption by Stepmother, the orphans’ court is directed to dismiss the case. Hypothetically, Father could now be divorced from Stepmother, remarried to someone else, and still seek to terminate Mother’s rights so that his subse<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>quent spouse can adopt L.J.B. There would be no disposition on the merits of the decree before us detailing Father’s shameful treatment of his child solely to eliminate Mother from L.J.B.’s life, despite the fact that the instant record, in my view, compels such a result. Due to the OAJC’s refusal to address the issue before us and instead, remand, at least five years will have passed since Mother’s last contact with L.J.B. The OAJC’s mandate is neither necessary nor legally compelled.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_10" id="ref_footnote_5_10">10</a>

Indeed, if on remand, the orphans’ court determines that Father contemplates Stepmother’s adoption of L.J.B., the matter will then return to this Court.

By this statement, the OAJC appears to assert that an order terminating parental rights is conditioned upon the subsequent adoption. As the OAJC recognizes earlier in its opinion, however, termination occurs prior to adoption. <em>See </em>OAJC at 15 (noting that “[termination of the natural parent’s rights <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>prior to adoption and allowance of stepparent adoption is for purposes of protecting the integrity and stability of the new family unit” (emphasis added)(quoting <em>Adoption of J.D.S., </em><a href="/a2d/763/0867-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="763 A.2d 867" data-case-ids="11174266" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0867-01">763 A.2d at 871</a>)). This two-step process necessarily engenders potential for changed circumstances.
