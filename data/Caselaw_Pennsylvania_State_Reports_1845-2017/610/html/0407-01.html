    <blockquote id="b468-11" data-blocks='[["BL_468.12",468,[314,1508,1106,518]]]'>(1) Whether application of 77 P.S. § 411(2), the “disease manifestation” provision of the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act (“Act”), in concert with 77 P.S. § 481, the “exclusive remedy” provision of the Act, results in an unconstitutional denial of the “reasonable compensation” mandate of Article III Section 18 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which underlies the historical <em>quid pro quo </em>worker’s compensation bargain, for a latent occupational disease that is invariably non-compensable under the Act?</blockquote>
