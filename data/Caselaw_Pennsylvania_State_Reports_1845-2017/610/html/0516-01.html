    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.6",579,[138,553,1156,1174]]]'>In late 1999, the Board began to explore the possibility of constructing a garage in which to house its buses. Staff member Robert J. Keegan, Jr., was placed in charge of the garage construction project, and in June 2001, he began discussions concerning the project with Dale Roth, an architect who had previously worked for the CLIU. Sometime between February 2002, and March 18, 2002, Mr. Roth told Appellee that the design for the planned garage might involve a pole building,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and Appellee agreed to provide pricing and planning information for the project. Subsequently, Appellee informed the executive director of the CLIU that he was resigning from the building committee because of his possible business involvement with construction of the garage. At the March 18, 2002 meeting of the Board, Appellee’s resignation from the building committee was accepted. The solicitor for the CLIU opined that, although Appellee could properly participate in the construction of the garage, he should abstain from any votes of the Board relating to that project. The Board, with Appellee abstaining, voted to make Mr. Roth’s architectural firm, known as Roth Marz Partnership, its agent in pursuing a lease-purchase agreement for the proposed garage site.</p>

The construction arrangements were formalized on July 12, 2002, with a written contract between Kistler Pole Building Company and Cornerstone LLC, another of Mr. Roth’s businesses. At its July 15, 2002 meeting, the Board, with Appellee again abstain<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>ing, approved a sales agreement, a lease agreement, and an option agreement with Cornerstone LLC. Appellee filed two conflict of interest abstention memoranda, both dated August 19, 2002, explaining that he had abstained from Board votes on March 18, 2002, and July 15, 2002, because of his company’s possible participation in the construction of the garage. Kistler Pole Building Company started construction of the garage in September 2002, and completed the project in February 2003.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[266,811,1154,890]]]'>While planning the garage construction, the Board was also occupied with a second facility, the Lehigh Learning and Adjustment School (hereinafter “the School”). On June 17, 2002, after it became apparent that the building in which the School was then housed had a mold problem, the Board terminated its lease and authorized Mr. Roth to pursue construction of a new facility. Appellee voted in favor of both of these actions. In April 2003, after Appellee learned that Mr. Roth was considering a pole building design for the School, Appellee ceased any involvement with the Board on the School project. At a meeting on October 20, 2003, the Board authorized Mr. Roth to begin construction of the School, and on May 17, 2004, the Board approved a lease agreement between Mr. Roth and the CLIU for the School. Appellee abstained from both votes. On June 17, 2004, Appellee and Mr. Roth executed an agreement under which Kistler Pole Building Company would construct the building for the School.</p>

Appellee contacted counsel, specifically, the law firm of the CLIU solicitor, to inquire as to whether he would be in violation of the Ethics Act if he were to fulfill his contractual obligations to construct the School. In a letter dated August 27, 2004, counsel opined that Appellee had not violated the Ethics Act.

First, the Commission determined that Appellee had "violated subsection 1103(a), the conflict of interest provision, on June 17, 2002, when he had voted to authorize Mr. Roth to pursue construction of the School while simultaneously seeking a subcontract from Mr. Roth for construction of the garage. In addition, the Commission determined that Appellee had violated subsection 1103(f) by entering into subcontracts with Mr. Roth’s businesses for construction of the garage and the School, respectively on July 12, 2002, and on June 17, 2004, because the Board had not solicited and accepted competitive bids prior to awarding the contracts to Mr. Roth. The Commission concluded that all the alleged violations were unintentional because Appellee had voted and had entered into the subcontracts in reliance on the solicitor’s legal advice.</p>

In general, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain language of a statute. <em>Malt Beverages, supra </em>at 1149. “When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b).

Subsection 1103(a) bars a public official from engaging in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest, where conflict of interest is defined in relevant part as the “[u]se by a public official ... of the authority of his office ... for the private pecuniary benefit of himself ... or a business with which he ... is associated.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 1102 (emphasis added). There is no explicit intent element in subsection 1103 or in the definition of conflict of interest.

Cmwlth.2002). The word “use” is not defined in the Ethics Act. The dictionary definition of the noun “use” is “[t]he act of using or putting to a purpose^ <em>e.g.,\ </em>the use of a car;” analogously, the definition of the verb “use” is “1. [t]o bring or put into service or action: employ[, <em>e.g.,\ </em>use a pen [or] use your imagination^ or] 2. to put to some purpose: avail oneself of[, <em>e.g.,] </em>use the bus to get to work.” Webster’s II New College Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1995, at 1215. Thus, the common and approved usage of the word “use,” which must guide our inquiry, indicates an action directed toward a purpose. Accordingly, to violate subsection 1103(a), a public official must act in such a way as to put his office to the purpose of obtaining for himself a private pecuniary benefit. Such directed action implies awareness on the part of the public official of the potential pecuniary benefit as well as the motivation to obtain that benefit for himself.</p>
    <p id="b583-4" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[125,1226,1157,837]]]'>That the General Assembly intended such an interpretation of subsection 1103(a) is strengthened by a declaration in the Ethics Act’s purpose provision: “The Legislature hereby declares that public office is a public trust and that any effort to realize personal financial gain through public office other than compensation provided by law is a violation of that trust.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 1101.1(a) Purpose (emphasis added). The dictionary defines “effort” as “[e]xertion of physical or mental energy to do something.” Webster’s II New College Dictionary at 360. In other words, an effort is an activity directed toward a goal. Accordingly, pursuant to the Ethics Act, violation of the public trust arises from activity directed toward the goal of realizing personal financial gain through public office. This is entirely consistent with the understanding of the word “use” in the context of the statutory definition of “conflict of interest” set forth above.</p>

    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[125,692,1154,1163]]]'>Second, the Commonwealth Court looked to the Commonwealth Procurement Code, and noted that, although the general rule requires all Commonwealth agency contracts to be awarded by competitive bidding, there are numerous exceptions. <em>Kistler, supra </em>at 1098 (citing 62 Pa.C.S. §§ 511, 515(1), and 516 (respectively, general rule; exception applicable when only a single contractor is capable of providing the supply, service, or construction; and exception applicable for emergency procurements)); <em>see also </em>62 Pa.C.S. §§ 514 and 515(2)-(10) (exceptions applicable, respectively, for small procurements and under miscellaneous circumstances). If subsection 1103(f) of the Ethics Act is interpreted to require competitive bidding, then any official who enters into a subcontract with a contractor chosen under one of these exceptions would violate subsection 1103(f). For example, a public official would violate subsection 1103(f) if he or she entered into a subcontract with a contractor chosen to address a threatened emergency under the emergency procurement exception. The Commonwealth Court argued that this is an absurd and unreasonable result, inconsistent with 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1), under which we presume that the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable. <em>Kistler, supra </em>at 1098 &amp; n. 12.</p>

To that end, the General Assembly specified its intent “to define as clearly as possible those areas which represent conflict with the public trust.” <em>Id. </em>at 1097 (quoting 65 Pa.C.S. § 1101.1(a)). We agree with the Commonwealth Court that the Ethics Act simply does not expressly state or otherwise make clear a legislative intent <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>that the phrase “open and public process” invariably must mean a competitive bidding process.</p>

For example, 58 P.S. § 58202(a), which pertains to the regulation of contracts by incorporated towns, provides in part as follows: “All contracts [ ] of incorporated towns in excess of ten thousand dollars ... shall not be made except with and from the lowest responsible bidder, after due notice in one newspaper ... at least three times at intervals of not less than three days.... The first advertisement shall be published not less than ten days prior to the date fixed for the opening of bids.” <em>See also </em>53 P.S. §§ 56802(a) and 68102(a) (setting forth similar, although not identical, requirements for, respectively, first class and second class townships). In addition, several statutory provisions set forth a requirement for separate bids for plumbing, heating, ventilation, and electrical work. <em>See, e.g., </em>53 P.S. § 1003 (pursuant to general municipal law, “it shall be the duty of the person or persons authorized to enter into contracts for the erection, construction, or alteration of such public buildings to receive separate bids upon each of the said branches of work, and to award the contract for the same to the lowest responsible bidder for each of said branches.”); 53 P.S. §§ 53205 and 56805 (setting forth the same requirement with regard to, respectively, an incorporated town and a first class township). With regard to bridges, viaducts, and culverts, the Second Class County Code provides that “the county commissioners, in conjunction with the city, borough or township, ... shall advertise for bids and award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder.” 16 P.S. § 5855. With regard to waters and water supply, general municipal law requires that any public works or improvement involving an expenditure of more than $10,000 be “let to the lowest responsible bidder after due advertisement, once a week for two successive weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation.” 53 P.S. § 2863(a). For contracts of greater than $4,000, but less than $10,000, this statute requires that at least three price quota<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>tions be requested, unless there are fewer than three qualified contractors in the market area. 53 P.S. § 2863(b). The Public School Code of 1949 also sets forth specific directives for contracting work related to the construction, repair, or maintenance of school buildings, which depend, <em>inter alia, </em>on the total cost of the contract and whether the work is necessitated by an emergency. 24 P.S. § 7-751. The general rule for work exceeding $10,000 requires the school district to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder; however, under certain circumstances for work of lesser cost, the school board is not required to solicit competitive bids. 24 P.S. § 7-751(a), (a.l), and (b).</p>
    <p id="b595-4" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[134,985,1159,850]]]'>The Ethics Act is not a procurement statute, and there is no indication that the General Assembly intended it to constrain or modify the numerous statutory provisions, <em>e.g., </em>those summarized above, that do set forth specific procedures for awarding contracts. Regardless of whatever statutory or regulatory provision may define the established procedures for awarding a public contract in any particular case, the Ethics Act sets forth the ethical standards to which the public officials involved are expected to conform. The Ethics Act “emphasizes guidance to public officials [ ] regarding [those] ethical standards,” and intends to provide guidelines in as clear a way as possible. 65 Pa.C.S. § 1101.1(a) and (b). Accordingly, for these reasons, we decline to infer that when the General Assembly chose to use the phrase “an open and public process” in the context of subsection 1103(f), its actual intent was to specify a competitive bidding process.</p>
