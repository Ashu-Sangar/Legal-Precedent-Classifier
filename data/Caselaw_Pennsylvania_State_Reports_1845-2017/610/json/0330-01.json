The issue as stated by the Petitioner is:\nWhen a candidate commits a \u201cfatal defect\u201d by failing to timely file his ethics \u201cstatement of financial interests\u201d contrary to both prevailing statutory and case law due to his reliance for legal advice from clerical personnel in the local election board, is such reliance unreasonable and inexcusable therefore mandating that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s affirmation of the trial court\u2019s decision allowing the candidate to amend his filings nunc pro tunc, constitutes an error of law and an abuse of discretion?\nIn briefing the issue, the parties are directed to discuss whether the Ethics Act applies to judicial candidates, regardless of incumbency, with special attention paid to the following decisions: Kremer v. State Ethics Commission, 503 Pa. 358, 469 A.2d 593 (1983), and In Re Nomination Petitions of Owen, 922 A.2d 973 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007).\nIt is further ordered that David Howells, Jr., is to remain on both the Republican and Democratic ballots as a candidate for the office of Magisterial District Judge for District 31-1-04. In so ordering, we express no opinion on the merits of the decisions by the trial court and the Commonwealth Court.",
