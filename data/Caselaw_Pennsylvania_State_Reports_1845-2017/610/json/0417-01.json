The Application to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs Answer to the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is DENIED. The Application for Leave to File Post Petition Communication is DENIED. The Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED LIMITED to the following issues. The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\na. Whether this Court should accept this appeal to consider whether the Superior Court erred for the fourth consecutive time, by failing to apply the proper standard and scope of review when it reversed the trial court\u2019s decertification of a 600,000 member class, disregarded this Court\u2019s instruction to review the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits, misconstrued the significance and holding of the Superior Court\u2019s prior decision in the case, and made no finding of abuse of discretion but simply substituted its own view of the facts for that of the trial court?\nb. Whether this Court should accept this appeal to consider whether, contrary to this Court\u2019s decision in Frowen v. Blank, Plaintiffs in a consumer class action case may demonstrate the level of \u201covermastering influence\u201d sufficient to establish a confidential relationship solely with general information about a corporation\u2019s advertising campaign \u2014 without any evidence that individual class members were influenced by the campaign, let alone showed \u201cweakness\u201d or \u201cdependence\u201d or \u201ctrust, justifiably reposed\u201d based on information they saw or heard?\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.",
