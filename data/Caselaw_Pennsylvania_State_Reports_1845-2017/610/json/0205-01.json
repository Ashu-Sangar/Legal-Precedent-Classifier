Nevertheless, I am persuaded by the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the rationale of the Superior Court, and the suggestion by a plurality of this Court that the writing of separate policies, and enforcement of the household exclusion, is justified relative to motorcycle insurance coverage.
