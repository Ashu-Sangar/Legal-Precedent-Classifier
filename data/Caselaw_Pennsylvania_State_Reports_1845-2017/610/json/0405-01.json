The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Whether application of 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), the \u201cdisease manifestation\u201d provision of the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d), in concert with 77 P.S. \u00a7 481, the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d provision of the Act, results in an unconstitutional denial of the \u201creasonable compensation\u201d mandate of Article III Section 18 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which underlies the historical quid pro quo worker\u2019s compensation bargain, for a latent occupational disease that is invariably non-compensable under the Act?\n(2) Whether it is a violation of the Open Courts and Remedies Clause of Article I Section II of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions to foreclose a common-law remedy in exchange for providing a wholly emancipated \u201csubstitute remedy\u201d in contravention of the \u201creasonable compensation\u201d mandate of Article III Section 18 for an occupational disease which is invariably non-compensable under the Act?\n(3) Whether the plain language of 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2) defines an \u201cinjury\u201d under the Act such that it excludes from its definition an occupational disease that first manifests more than 300 weeks after the last occupational exposure to the hazards of such disease, so that the exclusivity provision of 77 P.S. \u00a7 481 is not invoked?\nJustice TODD did not participate in the consideration of decision of this matter.",
