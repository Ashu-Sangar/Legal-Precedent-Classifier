Did the Commonwealth Court err and misinterpret the meaning of \u00a7 306(b)(2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 512(2)[,] in determining that a job is available to a claimant for purposes of said Act even when a claimant applies to each individual job contained in a labor market survey and does not receive an offer of employment?\nb. Did the Commonwealth Court err in failing to remand the matter to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge for a determination of whether or not the jobs identified by the employer\u2019s vocational expert were open and available in light of the fact that the holding of the Commonwealth Court in the within matter altered the status of the law at the time of the decision rendered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge?",
