Allocatur is DENIED as to all other issues. The issue as stated by Petitioner is:\nWhether the Superior Court\u2019s decision departed from the accepted judicial practices because it failed to apply the abuse of discretion standard required in reviewing transfer of venue cases, and substituted its own judgment for that of the trial judge, thus this Court\u2019s intervention is needed to correct the error as well as reassert and enforce the deference to be afforded to the trial court\u2019s ruling under Pa. R.C.P. 1006(d)(1)?",
