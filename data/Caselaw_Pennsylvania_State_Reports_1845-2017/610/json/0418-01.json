Whether the Pennsylvania Superior Court erred [by] denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of respondent for lack of jurisdiction, since the appeal involved a judgment of sentence issued by a Magisterial District Judge, and there was no order of Common Pleas entered?\nb. Whether a Defendant who seeks to change a plea of guilty previously entered before a Magisterial District Judge must do so within ten days afforded by rule, or be precluded from challenging the entry of the plea?",
