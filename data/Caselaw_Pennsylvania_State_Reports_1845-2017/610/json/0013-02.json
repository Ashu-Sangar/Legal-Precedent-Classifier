        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 29th day of April 2011, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, the Order of the Superior Court is REVERSED and the judgment of sentence is REINSTATED, pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Lucarelli, 601 Pa. 185, 971 A.2d 1173 (2009).\nA divided Superior Court panel, with one judge concurring in the result and one judge dissenting, reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence for second-degree murder and related crimes, and remanded to the trial court for a new trial, finding that the trial court improperly denied respondent his right to counsel. In so holding, the lead memorandum opined that the record failed to demonstrate that respondent\u2019s behavior \u201cunreasonably clog[ged] the machinery of justice or hamper[ed] and delay[ed] the state\u2019s efforts to effectively administer justice.\u201d Super. Ct. Op. at 10, quoting Lucarelli, 971 A.2d at 1179. This was a plainly erroneous application of Lucarelli.\nThe trial court first determined that respondent had waived his right to counsel, as the trial court had done in Lucarelli. However, in the case sub judice, the trial court issued an addendum, concluding that respondent, in light of Lucarelli, had forfeited his right to counsel by his pattern of deliberate and dilatory behavior. That behavior included, inter alia, firing his original privately retained trial counsel, who was prepared to proceed to trial; refusing to hire new counsel; and refusing to meet and cooperate with two court-appointed lawyers.\nRespondent\u2019s claim before the Superior Court that the trial court improperly deprived him of his right to counsel is specious. The trial court made every effort to accommodate respondent and to protect his right to counsel in spite of his obstructive behavior over a period of more than one year. While it is true that respondent was entitled to choose his own counsel, he was not \u201cpermitted to unreasonably clog the machinery of justice or hamper and delay the state\u2019s efforts to effectively administer justice.\u201d Lucarelli, 971 A.2d at 1178-79. Further, respondent\u2019s refusal even to meet with court-appointed counsel illustrates his insistence on retaining private counsel. \u201cWhere a defendant knowingly and intelligently refuses appointed counsel while insisting on privately retained counsel without taking steps to secure such private counsel, the defendant must be prepared to accept the consequences of his or her choice.\u201d Id. at 1179.\nTherefore, in accordance with Lucarelli, despite the initial finding of waiver of counsel by the trial court, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion in its addendum \u2014 that respondent forfeited his right to counsel. Some measure of deference must be shown to the trial court, which is in a better position to assess a defendant\u2019s sincerity and motivation in delaying a trial and to determine whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is genuine or obstructive. The trial court here correctly concluded that the record establishes that respondent\u2019s conduct was an orchestrated plan to manipulate the system. Accordingly, as contemplated by Lucarelli, respondent\u2019s behavior constituted extremely dilatory conduct sufficient to result in the forfeiture of his right to counsel.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting statement.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent from the per curiam, merits-based disposition of this case. The allocatur stage is normally reserved for making the threshold determination of whether to grant discretionary review, see Supreme Court IOP \u00a7 5C, and as occurred here, the respondent ordinarily does not file a brief, as none is required. The majority, however, undertakes merits review at the allocatur stage to conclude that Respondent\u2019s behavior constituted extremely dilatory conduct sufficient to result in the forfeiture of his right to counsel under Commonwealth v. Lucarelli, 601 Pa. 185, 971 A.2d 1173 (2009).\nI continue to adhere to the view that the Court should exercise greater restraint at the discretionary review stage. Cf. Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Henry, 607 Pa. 94, 4 A.3d 153 (2010) (Saylor, J., dissenting); County of Berks v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters Local Union No. 129, 600 Pa. 128, 963 A.2d 1272, 1272-73 (2009) (Saylor, J., dissenting). While, like the intermediate court, I understand the trial court\u2019s frustration with the difficult and trying problems presented by Respondent\u2019s actions, I do not subscribe to circumventing briefing and ordinary consideration by this Court, given the factual dynamics. Cf. id.-, Supreme Court IOP \u00a7 3(B)(5).",
