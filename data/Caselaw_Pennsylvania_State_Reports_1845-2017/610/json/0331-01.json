The first issue, rephrased for clarity, is:\n(1) Whether the payments made by Excelsior Insurance to Claimant, for which Excelsior Insurance sought reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund, constituted payments of compensation within the meaning of Section 443 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7 999(a), and were, therefore, subject to reimbursement by the Supersedeas Fund, or whether such payments constituted the payment of costs associated with obtaining the settlement of Claimant\u2019s third-party tort action under Section 319 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 671.\nThe second issue, as phrased by Petitioner, is:\n(2) Whether equity requires that the Supersedeas Fund reimburse the insurer\u2019s pro rata share of attorney fees and costs incurred by a claimant in recovering from a third-party tort feasor?",
