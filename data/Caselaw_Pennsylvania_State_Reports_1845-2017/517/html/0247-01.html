The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, in granting appellees’ Motion for Summary Judgment, held that, at the time the cause of action arose in this case, seizure of property was an indispensible element of an action for abuse of process. Further, the lower court held that on the facts alleged, there was no seizure or deprivation of appellant’s property to sustain an action for abuse of process. The Superior Court affirmed, holding that for the appellant to prevail “she must establish that she was deprived of her property or was arrested.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We disagree and now reverse.</p>

Grammes &amp; Sons, Inc. On August 28, 1968 the appellant sustained a work related injury to her right thumb while she was working as a welder in the employ of L.F. Grammes &amp; Sons, Inc. Shortly after she suffered the <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>injury, appellant and her employer entered into an agreement for compensation at the rate of $60.00 per week. The compensation agreed to was payable for an indefinite period commencing September 4, 1968.</p>

The employer’s Petition to Terminate was denied by the Referee and the employer appealed to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Board). After reviewing the record, the Board remanded the case for a physical examination of the appellant by an impartial physician.</p>

On appeal, the Board affirmed the suspension of compensation, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the Board. We granted allocatur and held that based upon the record, the employer had failed to satisfy its burden of proof in that the evidence did not show either that appellant’s disability had ceased or that her continued disability was the result of an independent action. <em>McGee v.

We reversed the order of the Commonwealth Court that affirmed the order of suspension and remanded the case to the Board. Upon remand, the Board, on July 13, 1978, set aside the suspension order of the referee and ordered that compensation be reinstated at the rate of $85.51 a week.

When the Board properly rejected the request as being “tantamount to a negation of the most recent holding of the Supreme Court", Grammes compounded the situation by appealing this frivolous claim to the Commonwealth Court.

We note that neither Grammes or the intervening insurer has appealed from the Board’s July 13, 1978 order, in accordance with Pa.Appellate Procedure Rule 1512, replacing 77 P.S. § 833 (Workmen’s Compensation). The first complaint relating to the weekly rate of compensation as established by the order of July 13, 1978 was raised in a Petition for Rehearing which was filed with the Board on October 26, 1978 long after the thirty day period for appeal of the July 13, 1978 order had expired. Thus any objection to the weekly compensation order as established by the July 13, order was waived. We also note that the question as to the rate of weekly compensation set forth in the July 13, 1978 order was not raised in the answer to the Petition to Enforce Judgment entered on the July 13, 1978 order but was first set forth in the Application for Re-Argument after our grant of the Petition to Enforce Judgment.</blockquote>
