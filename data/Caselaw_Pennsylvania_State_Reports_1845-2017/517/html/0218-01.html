This is so because we believe that <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>insurers, when faced with information which contradicted an insured’s revelations, would almost always opt to rescind the contract, which under the insurers’ proposal can be done unilaterally, rather than follow the statutorily dictated termination procedures. The consequences of such an action would be to require an insured to proceed to common pleas court to contest this action. In the meantime the individual would be without insurance, and without any decision as to whether his insurance was rightfully or wrongfully terminated. The result would be that this individual would have been effectively denied his driving privileges without any immediate recourse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[245,1215,1153,681]]]'>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we believe that in passing Act 78 the legislature intended that insurance questions were intended to be primarily resolved under the auspices of the Insurance Commissioner: a scheme which has the advantages of providing for expeditious resolution of claims before a body which has particular expertise, as well as eliminating from the dockets of the trial courts a host of relatively minor cases, which could be time consuming and expensive to the individual litigants. Appellants’ position would certainly frustrate this judicial economy rationale by allowing the insurer an option to pick its forum, and thereby divest the Insurance Commissioner of his jurisdiction.</p>

The Statutory Construction Act provides us with certain presumptions in ascertaining legislative intent. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922. Among them is the rule that “[t]he General Assembly <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>intends [an] entire statute to be effective and certain.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2). Appellant’s position in this case would fly in the face of that presumption because it would throw open to uncertainty part of the contractual relationship which it was the legislature’s intent to control, i.e., the ability of an insurer to terminate a policy.</p>
    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[236,649,1157,1328]]]'>Appellants have also argued in this case that a decision in favor of the appellees effectively punishes them and rewards dishonesty. This is certainly not our intent, and appellants’ argument ignores the fact that they are merely the victims of their own haste. There is no requirement in Act 78, or anywhere else, that an insurer must accept an applicants’ answers at face value and offer immediate coverage. The law provides insurers with an opportunity to verify information before extending coverage. However, as a marketing tool some insurers, such as appellants, have opted to make immediate coverage available to their customers based on nothing more than up-front money and the customer’s representations. The insurers are now seeking our protection from such business practices by claiming that they should not be the victims of their own blind faith. We see no strong social policy dictating such protection. In fact there is at least one strong social policy operating against the court’s assuming such a position, and that is that we would be effectively discouraging insurers’ from verifying their applicants’ representations, since such information would only become relevant when a claim was filed at which time any inconsistencies would be a basis for an attempted rescission. Obviously, this would only engender havoc in an area where the General Assembly specifically sought to avoid it.</p>

Section 4 of Act 78, 40 P.S. § 1008.4, provides the grounds for which the cancellation may be granted. Section 5, 40 P.S. § 1008.5, provides the procedure to be followed before that cancellation becomes effective. Under the terms of the Act, the policy remains in effect until the insurer “shall deliver or mail, to the named insured ...” such notice of cancellation. 40 P.S. § 1008.5. Although section 4 provides for cancellation upon a showing of a misrepresentation, “material to the acceptance of the risk by the insurer”, 40 P.S. § 1008.4, this right would not defeat a claim of loss arising between the issuance of the policy and the effectuation of the cancellation of that policy as required by section <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>5 of the Act. Thus the Act makes no provision for the rejection of a claim where the policy was in fact obtained through the material misrepresentation between the issuance of that fraudulently secured policy and the effectuation of the cancellation of that policy.</p>
    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[216,619,1160,904]]]'>The premise of the Opinion Annoucing the Judgment of the Court is that, since the Act does not expressly provide for a right of rescission, we must infer a legislative intention to abrogate the well recognized right to rescind, <em>ab initio, </em>a fraudulently procured policy. <em>See Safeguard Mutual Insurance Co. v. Huggins, </em><a href="/pa-super/241/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="241 Pa.

This result was reached in the Opinion Announcing Judgment even though it is there conceded that the false procurement of the policy may well amount to a criminal act. 40 P.S. § 474. To ascribe this intent to the legislature is to attribute to them an absurd result, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922. In my view the fact that the legislature decided to provide a procedure for cancellation or refusal to renew policies and placed these matters under the auspices of the insurance commissioner does not warrant the inference of the elimination of the well recognized contract remedy of rescission where a fraud has occurred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>.</p>

This disparagement ignores the fact that the major purpose of the automobile insurance laws was to support the policy of this Commonwealth that drivers of motor vehicles should be financially responsible for injury or damage they may cause upon our highways. <em>See </em>Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1701 <em>et seq. </em>If thorough verification must be <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>made to assure the veracity of the responses before coverage is afforded, to guard against the relatively small number of cases where there may be a deliberate attempt to deceive, such an approach would serve to undermine that policy rather than support it.</p>
