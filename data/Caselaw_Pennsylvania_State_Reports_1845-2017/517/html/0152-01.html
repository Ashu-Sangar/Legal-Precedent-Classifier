She received medical treatment for injuries sustained in the accident from Dr. Seymour Shlomchik, who was authorized by Mrs. Sender to collect payment for the medical treatment from her insurance carrier, State Farm Insurance Company (“State Farm”). Dr. Shlomchik submitted claims for payment to State Farm, which paid $645 of the claims submitted on Mrs. Sender’s behalf. It is undisputed that the last uncontested payment was a disbursement of $80 made to appellant via Dr. Shlomchik on February 9, 1979. A balance of $240 remained unpaid on that date.</p>

Dr. Shlomchik was authorized by each of these patients to collect payment directly from State Farm for medical services rendered. When the insurance carrier refused to pay the claims presented by the physician, he aggregated the claims and brought suit.

While it is apparent that State Farm did not evaluate the merits of each of the three hundred claims during settlement negotiations and even disclaimed liability, it is equally evident that the terms of the settlement do not contain any indication by State Farm that certain individual patients’ claims were to be excluded from the settlement. Absent a clear indication from the agreement itself that certain claims were to be excluded, it is incumbent upon this Court to recognize that all the claims advanced by Dr. Shlomchik were discharged by the settlement.</p>
    <p id="b225-4" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[223,942,1154,593]]]'>Since the claim was for medical services rendered to its insured, it is clear that the settlement of the claim constituted a payment of benefits. Payment of medical expenses incurred as a result of an accident for which the No-fault insurance coverage was in effect, constituted a benefit of a policy to which the insured was legally and contractually entitled. The fact that the provider of these services agreed to a modification of his fees by virtue of the lump sum settlement does not negate the effect of the insurance company’s undertaking. State Farm paid benefits to Linda Sender, its insured, by virtue of the settlement.</p>

Thereafter, the insurance company could settle the claim or a number of claims without exposing itself to liability for payment of further benefits as of the date of settlement. Thus, if the lower courts’ analysis prevailed, the insurance companies could defeat the purpose for the “rolling” statute of limitations simply by settling claims with a service provider rather than by making timely payment of submitted claims as required by section 1009.106 of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
