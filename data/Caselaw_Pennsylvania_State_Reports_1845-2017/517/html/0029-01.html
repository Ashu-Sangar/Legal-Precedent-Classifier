Appellant, L. Stanley Wall, filed an answer in which he asserted that a marital relationship had never existed between the parties and moved for the dismissal of the complaint. After a full evidentiary hearing on the question as to the existence of a. valid marriage, the court found that a valid common-law marriage did exist between appellant and appellee. This finding was affirmed by the court <em>en </em>banc. Appellant proceed<a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>ed to appeal the finding of the existence of a valid marriage to the Superior Court. The Superior Court determined that, since there had not been an entry of a decree in divorce, the ruling appealed from was an interlocutory one, and quashed the appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=509%20A.2d%201326" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="509 A.2d 1326">509 A.2d 1326</a>. The single question before this Court in this matter is whether the Superior Court was correct in its determination that the appeal to them was premature. We granted review to respond to that question, and for the reasons that follow conclude that the order of the Superior Court should be affirmed.</p>

While we agree that a declaration as to the validity of a marriage, pursuant to section 206 of the Code, would be final and thereby reviewable, this fact is of no comfort to the instant appellant. While the issue of the validity of the marriage could have been a subject for declaratory relief and thus reviewable, here it was merely one of the issues subsumed in the larger question before the trial court. The court’s <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>determination as to the validity of the marriage was merely its decision as to a particular legal issue without being a “final” resolution of the overlying claim or cause of action.</p>

Viewing the issue in these terms persuades us that the Superior Court correctly characterized the order as non-appealable.</p>

The prompt judicial resolution of these issues focusses "primary consideration [upon] the welfare of the family rather than the vindication of private rights ...", 23 P.S. § 102(a)(3); assists in mitigating "the harm to the spouses and their children ...", 23 P.S. § 102(a)(4), and makes "the law for legal dissolution of marriage effective for dealing with the realities of [the] matrimonial experience", 23 P.S. § 102(a)(1). The wife, in <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>instituting the action for divorce under § 201(d) concedes that the marriage was irretrievably broken and was attempting to terminate it. The putative husband who denies that a marriage ever existed was obviously not concerned with perpetuating such a relationship. His interest was directed to the consequences that may flow from a finding of a valid marriage upon the distribution of the property and the assessment of alimony. If, at the conclusion of the proceedings below it is subsequently determined on appeal that there was in fact never a valid marriage, the financial arrangements can then be adjusted. In the interim, no harm can accrue to Mr. Wall from the determination of a relationship he has contended throughout did not exist. Thus Mr. Wall cannot establish that the claimed right will be irreparably lost if review is postponed until final judgment, as is required by <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra. </em>These controversies undermine the financial as well as emotional stability of those involved in the family unit. The practical effect of a prompt judicial resolution of all of the interrelated issues is to allow the parties to move on with their lives guided by a legal determination of their relative rights and responsibilities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p class="author" id="b102-7" data-blocks='[["BL_102.8",102,[297,1821,594,42]]]'>ZAPPALA, Justice, dissenting.</p>
    <p id="b102-8" data-blocks='[["BL_102.9",102,[255,1881,1150,149]],["BL_103.1",103,[227,310,1148,148]]]'>I must dissent from the majority’s holding that the Appellant’s appeal from the trial court’s finding that a valid common-law marriage existed between the parties is prema<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>ture. I would hold the trial court’s holding was a final determination as to the validity of the marriage and was immediately appealable.</p>
    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[225,476,1152,724]]]'>The majority’s conclusion rests solely upon the nature of the action which initiated the dispute between the parties as to the existence of a marriage. Citing § 206 of the Divorce Code, 23 P.S. § 206, the majority concedes that a declaration as to the validity of a marriage would be final and reviewable if the action was initially brought as a declaratory judgment action. Nevertheless, the majority disregards the fact that the trial court has entered a declaration as to the validity of the marriage in the instant case because the action originated as one in divorce. Although § 206 permits a party to bring an action for a declaratory judgment to determine the validity of a marriage, the statute does not preclude the issue from being raised in any other proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.6",103,[221,1219,1153,778]]]'>The majority’s holding improperly premises the finality and appealability of an order relating to the validity of a marriage upon the nature of the proceeding, rather than its substantive effect. The effect of the trial court’s order in this case is the same which results from one entered in a declaratory judgment action. The relief sought and obtained by the Appellant in the trial court is identical to that requested in a declaratory judgment action — a determination as to the marriage’s validity. The majority would have the Appellant file an action separate from the divorce action originated by the Appellee to insure the finality of the judgment. The duplicative nature and unnecessary expense of such a proceeding are abhorrent to the concept of avoiding piecemeal litigation and increased litigation costs which the majority uses in an attempt to support its holding.</p>
    <p id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.7",103,[223,2014,1151,358]],["BL_104.1",104,[229,321,1153,252]]]'>The majority views the trial court’s order as a mere decision as to a particular legal issue without a final resolution of each of the Appellee’s economic claims. But, the very rights and obligations created under the law from which the Appellee seeks to benefit necessarily arise out of and are attendant to the existence of a marital relationship. While the trial court’s finding did not resolve the Appellee’s <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>claims for divorce, alimony, and equitable distribution, it finally resolved the Appellant’s contention that no marriage existed. If the Appellant’s challenge would be sustained on appeal, then resolution of the Appellee’s remaining claims would be unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[226,592,1152,840]]]'>It is absurd to burden the Appellant with the expense of defending economic claims arising out of a relationship which may not exist. The policy concerns expressed in <em>Fried v. Fried, </em><a href="/pa/509/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="509 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1795198" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0089-01">509 Pa. 89</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="501 A.2d 211" data-case-ids="1795198,1795333" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0089-01,/pa/509/0088-01">501 A.2d 211</a> (1985) for the social and emotional well-being of the parties are not compelling when the existence of the marriage itself is challenged. Indeed, the prompt disposition of that issue is more critical to the parties' well-being for the existence of a marriage has its own grave legal and social consequences. Fried was based upon the presumption that the individuals are in fact spouses. In the instant case, no such presumption may be made. This is a crucial distinction which dictates a different result. I would not find <em>Fried </em>to be controlling, and note further that the concerns which I expressed in my dissent in that case are exacerbated by the extension of that analysis to the case before us.</p>
