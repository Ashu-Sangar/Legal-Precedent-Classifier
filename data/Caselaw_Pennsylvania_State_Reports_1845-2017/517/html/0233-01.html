Appellee, R.A. Smith, is a jockey whose license was suspended by appellant, the State Horse Racing Commission, on charges that he conspired to fix the outcome of a horse race.</p>
    <p id="b303-10" data-blocks='[["BL_303.10",303,[230,1373,1155,421]]]'>The salient facts, as set forth in the Commission’s adjudication, are as follows. Early in 1984, Smith met another jockey, one Vergara, who was unknowingly acting as an agent of investigators from the Attorney General’s office. Vergara was participating in a scheme to entice other jockeys to agree to fix a race at some time in the future. In return for his agreement, each jockey received $500. Vergara received $100 per jockey for every jockey he enlisted.</p>

Vergara advised Smith that the agents were “bad people” and that Smith could “help him out” if Smith joined Vergara in the agents’ car and went along with whatever these bad people were proposing. Smith did so. He entered the car, talked about the plans to fix races, and accepted $500 in cash. <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>Once out of the car, Smith and Vergara went to a bar where Smith attempted to give Vergara the $500. Vergara convinced Smith to keep the money saying that Smith had “helped him out of a tight spot” and that Smith might not ever be called concerning a race.</p>

This policy is laudable. Because instances may arise in the administrative setting, where, in order to prompt otherwise innocent licensees to violate laws and thereby lose their licenses, officials employ investigative techniques which are so egregious as to shock men of good conscience, we will not announce a rule which would preclude a tribunal so disposed from frustrating the intent of the overreaching officials by preserving the status of the licensee. Query, however, whether a licensee should avoid a revocation where the basis for that revocation is not a specific violation of an applicable statute or regulation but general fitness to <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>hold the license as reflected in his or her behavior as is the case here.</p>

Code § 163.58. This fact is made out not because he succumbed to his friend’s entreaties to appear to go along with the “fixing” of races for the sake of the friend, but because in so doing he compromised both his own integrity and that of the industry. He voluntarily pursued a course of conduct which was calculated to make at least some members of the public believe that the outcome of races is the product of influences beyond the talent, ability and good fortune of the participants.

What it gives with the left hand, it takes away with the right. While concluding that the common law defense of entrapment is available in administrative proceedings, the majority then permits the conduct in question to be used against the entrapped party to blacken his character and revoke his license. In the area of administrative licensing proceedings, the defense of entrapment would not only fail to serve any useful purpose in the distorted manner it is applied to the instant facts, but further would frustrate the intended purpose behind both the statutory and common law rationales underlying the defense. Following the logic of the majority, in licensing procedures, where character or general fitness to hold the license is always a factor in disciplinary proceedings, the availability of the defense of entrapment as permitted by the majority, is totally illusory since the licensee is now faced with the “Hobson’s choice” of either complete denial (and therefore foregoing the defense) or interposing the entrapment defense which, as in this situation, concedes that he has committed the crime even though entrapped. Implicit in this concession is the further admission that by virtue of this event, the licensee lacks the requisite character to hold the license he is attempting to preserve.</p>
    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.7",308,[203,1698,1156,689]],["BL_309.1",309,[232,344,1154,694]]]'>This holding is shallow at best. The majority points out, two elements which are necessary before the entrapment defense can be interposed. They are that (1) the defendant is <em>not disposed </em>to commit the crime and (2) that police conduct likely to entrap the innocently disposed is present. Majority Opinion at page 5 citing <em>Commonwealth v. Conway, </em><a href="/pa-super/196/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="196 Pa. Super. 97" data-case-ids="754922" data-case-paths="/pa-super/196/0097-01">196 Pa.Super. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.2d%20776" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="173 A.2d 776">173 A.2d 776</a> (1961). If the licensee proves the two elements necessary to sustain the defense, it is not for us to then penalize him based upon the act conceded when it was shown that he was not predisposed to commit that act. Any finding of bad character of one who was not predisposed to commit the act is necessarily tainted. In addition, to allow this result would frustrate the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>purpose for allowing such a defense, namely, to restrain law enforcement officials from instigating crime. I find this totally illogical and unwarranted. I would hold that in the administrative licensing area, proof of the defense of entrapment would be a complete bar to both the offense and the revocation of a license based solely on the character or fitness of the licensee as reflected by that specific factual situation. To hold otherwise, as the majority does today, is not only an exercise in futility, but also opens the policing of licensees to the abuses of officials which the defense of entrapment was intended to protect against. If the defense is to be permitted, it must be embraced with all its policy and implications. I therefore dissent.</p>
