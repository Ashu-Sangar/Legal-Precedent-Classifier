He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a IV2 to 5 year term of imprisonment. Appellant served the minimum sentence and was paroled. He completed his parole without violation. Twice married, appellant raised six children and fulfilled all his support obligations. He advanced from an entry-level, laboring position with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to his current position as Shelter Supervisor, overseeing fifty employees and exercising budgetary and policy formulation responsibilities. Appellant has represented the SPCA in numerous public appearances and has advised the Philadelphia Police Department in its canine activities. In addition, appellant actively participates as a volunteer in various church and community programs, some of which involve the counseling of youngsters who are in trouble with the law. It is clear that, in all respects, appellant has lived an exemplary life since he served his sentence thirty years ago.</p>
