In the primary elections held in May of 1987, Panucci ran in both the Democrat and Republican contests to become a candidate for a seat on the school board of the Sto-Rox School District in Allegheny County. Mr. Panucci was victorious in both primaries, and thus became the candidate of both parties for the upcoming November 1987 municipal election.</p>

Seeking to be re-elected to his seat on the school board in the November, 1987, municipal election, Mr. Matthews entered the May primaries of the Democrat and Republican parties. He, like Mr. Panucci, won both primaries and became the candidate of both parties for the election to be held in November of 1987.</p>

They first contended that, because the office of <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>school director is non-partisan in nature, their efforts to be elected to the post do not constitute “partisan political activity” within the meaning of our 1987 guidelines. In support of that argument, they focussed on the exception in the guidelines permitting “involvement in non-partisan or public community organizations or professional groups.” According to Messrs. Panucci and Matthews, the pursuit of a directorship on a public school board constitutes “involvement in a non-partisan or public community organization,” and thus is not proscribed political activity. As a further effort to establish that their respective candidacies do not represent <em>partisan </em>political activity, each of the above two petitioners pointed to the fact that he was the candidate of both the Democrat and Republican parties for the school board seat he was seeking. For the reasons that follow we rejected those arguments as being without merit.</p>

In 1976 and 1977 the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania promulgated, on behalf of this Court, a series of directives prohibiting partisan political activity by court-appointed employees and subjecting offenders to the sanction of discharge if such activity was not terminated within a given period of time. The scope of the prohibition announced by those directives included running for elective office, holding a position in the organizational structure of a political party, and working on behalf of a party or candidate.</p>

In that case three court-appointed employees, two of whom were law clerks seeking election to school boards, sought exemption from the prohibition. The other employee was a' tipstaff who also held a seat on a borough council.

One of the clerks, in a further effort to exempt his candidacy from being considered political activity, drew to our attention the fact that he had won the nomination of both major political parties and was thereby virtually assured of election. We rejected the foregoing arguments, and concluded that the quest by the law clerks for school board seats put them in violation of the directives.</p>

We cannot accept this argument; even were a political campaign held to be nonpolitical because no other person has been nominated to office, the argument overlooks the fact that it is the holding of the office as well as the obtaining of it which is interdicted. Nor can we agree with petitioners Gobel and Silvestri that election to the office of school director, because it pertains to public education, is not election to a political office. Thus we conclude that each of the petitioners is covered by the directives in question.</blockquote>

In the petitioners’ view, this statutory provision is a legislative recognition that the office of school director is nonpartisan in nature. For that proposition they rely on language in <em>Thompson v. Morrison, </em><a href="/pa/352/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="352 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="464058" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0616-01">352 Pa. 616</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2055" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="44 A.2d 55">44 A.2d 55</a> (1945). There, this Court stated that one of the purposes of section 1004 of the Code, in allowing candidates for certain offices to run on the ticket of more than one party, “was to provide for the nonpartisan selection” of candidates in that class. <em><a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2055" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="44 A.2d 55">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/352/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="352 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="464058" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0616-01">352 Pa. at 620</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2055" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="44 A.2d 55">44 A.2d at 57</a>.</p>

Based on that consideration, the petitioners would have us disregard our holding in <em>Prohibition of Political Activities by Court-Appointed Employees, supra, </em>and conclude that the office of school director is nonpartisan and that seeking the office is nonpartisan political activity for purposes of our order of June 29,1987. The petitioners’ argument along these lines is devoid of merit for several reasons.</p>

And, merely because a seeker of public elective office is the candidate of the two major political parties does not necessarily render his efforts nonpartisan. He may even have to vie against a third-party or independent candidate in the general election. Moreover, the doc<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>trine of separation of powers, enshrined in the Pennsylvania Constitution, vests in this Court supervisory power over the judiciary, including its employees. <em>Kremer v.

    <p id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[216,799,1155,1331]]]'>We turn now to the third petitioner in the instant matters, Marjorie L. Dobson. The factual posture of her case differs from that of the other two petitioners, as does the nature of the relief she requested us to provide. In 1977 Mrs. Dobson was elected Tax Collector of Baldwin Borough, in Allegheny County, for a four-year term. She was reelected to that office in 1981. <em>In 1984, </em>while still serving as Tax Collector, she became a tipstaff of a judge of a Court of Common Pleas and has continued to hold that judicial position. In the election of November 1985 Mrs. Dobson was reelected to her third successive term as Tax Collector. Her current term of office will expire in January 1990. The relief sought by this petitioner is leave to complete the remainder of her present term as Tax Collector without being compelled to relinquish her position as tipstaff. Her argument for such relief is based in part on the fact that our 1987 guidelines do not expressly mention incumbents. In that regard, Dobson asserts that the prohibition against political activity is concerned with candidacy and other partisan activities, not with the actual holding of political office. In further support of her claim for reliefcts Dobson reminds us that under our decision in <em>Prohibition of Political Activities by Court-Appointed Employees, supra, </em>an incumbent councilman was permitted to complete his current term without losing his judicial position.</p>
    <p id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.7",95,[216,2153,1150,202]],["BL_96.1",96,[238,303,1151,735]]]'>Mrs. Dobson’s first argument ignores that in the above-cited case we held that the prohibition interdicted both the running for public office and the holding of it. <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">473 Pa. at 561</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="473 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1730258" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0554-01">375 A.2d at 1260</a>. There is nothing in our 1987 <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>guidelines to even suggest a retreat from that principle. As for her second argument, it is true that in <em>Prohibition of Political Activities by Court-Appointed Employees </em>we did permit an incumbent to complete his term. However, the incumbent there involved was already in his elected office prior to the promulgation of our first prohibition, the directives issued in 1976 and 1977. On the other hand, when Mrs. Dobson became a tipstaff in 1984, those same 1976 and 1977 directives against political activity by court employees were already in force. Therefore, she assumed her judicial position subject to that mandate: a mandate she violated by running for reelection as Tax Collector in 1985. The violation was not extinguished by her subsequent swearing-in ceremony.</p>
    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[235,1058,1151,571]]]'>Mrs. Dobson lastly contends that when she ran for reelection in 1985 the Ethics Act of 1978<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> gave her the right to do so, and thus was in conflict with our directives of 1976 and 1977. However, as we have already mentioned, the legislature cannot constitutionally infringe upon the power of this Court to supervise employees of the jurdiciary. <em>Kremer v. State Ethics Commission, <a href="/pa/503/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="503 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1785881" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0358-01">supra.</a> </em>It is to be noted that our decision in <em>Kremer </em>was rendered before Dobson became a judicial employee, and should have removed any notion that her employment would be governed by anything other than the valid dictates of this Court.</p>
