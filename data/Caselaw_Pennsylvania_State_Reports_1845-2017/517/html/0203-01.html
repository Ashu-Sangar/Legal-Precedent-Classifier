Cummins were named in a federal indictment for fraudulently obtaining state highway contracts. These three men, acting with one Stephen Koratich, formed a business entity, the Cummins Construction Company, to lease construction equipment to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, (hereinafter “the department”), Greene County Maintenance Office. Shultz, the appellant herein, was the Greene County Sheriff and the Democratic Chairman. He had the power to determine who would lease equipment to the department and who would be hired by the department. Mitchell worked in the department from 1971 until 1978. During this time, Mitchell personally approved and signed thirty-six rental agreements between the department and Cummins Construction Company, of which he was a secret owner.</p>

An amended complaint was filed on December 29, 1982. Shultz and Mitchell filed answers to both complaints. Mitchell is now deceased and is succeeded by the Estate of Harold L. Mitchell. Default judgment was entered against Cummins for lack of appearance and defense. One of the corporations, Appalachian Pipeline, was removed at the request of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[214,880,1153,624]]]'>Based on the guilty plea, the department moved for summary judgment. On May 20, 1985, Commonwealth Court granted summary judgment as to liability only against Shultz and Mitchell. An appeal to this Court from that judgment was quashed on November 22, 1985. Thereafter the department moved for summary judgment on the issue of damages, and on May 2,1986 Commonwealth Court granted that motion also, awarding damages in the amount of $892,450.71, the full amount of rentals paid by the department. The damages were assessed against Shultz and the estate of Mitchell. Shultz now appeals as of right from the lower court’s order.</p>

In <em>Hurtt v. Stirone, </em><a href="/pa/416/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="416 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1893052" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0493-01">416 Pa. 493</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20624" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="206 A.2d 624">206 A.2d 624</a> (1965), the trustee in bankruptcy of a concrete contractor sued to recover sums extorted from the contractor by one Stirone. The trustee’s claim was that Stirone threatened to use his position as a “labor leader” to cause the contractor to lose certain construction contracts which he then had unless the contractor paid a certain sum of <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>money. As a result of the payments at issue in the trustee’s case, but prior to trial of the trustee’s case in Pennsylvania courts, Stirone was tried and convicted in federal court of violation of the Hobbs AntiRacketeering Act. His federal conviction was introduced in the trustee’s case as some evidence of duress and to impeach Stirone. The trial court charged the jury that the defendant’s record of criminal conviction was conclusive evidence of extortion, and therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to a directed verdict for the sums paid. In the appeal which followed, this Court formed the issue as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[269,947,1109,143]]]'>In a civil suit against a convicted extortioner to recover the extorted money, is proof of the conviction of the extortion conclusive evidence of the fact of extortion?</blockquote>

After noting that there is disagreement about the treatment of this issue in other jurisdictions and that in Pennsylvania “judgments in criminal cases for years were held inadmissible to establish the facts in a civil case,” this Court held that the lower court was correct in regarding the federal conviction as conclusive evidence of the fact of extortion:</p>

His case was twice presented to a federal jury which found him guilty of extortion beyond a reasonable doubt, upon the same facts which are now urged as the basis for his civil liability. To now hold that the effect of those jury determinations is <em>nil </em>not only would be to fly in the face of reason, but also would be a general indictment of the whole American jury system. We are not now prepared to say that the mere technical effect of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel regarding identity of parties is sufficient to overcome the policy which requires us to give conclusive effect to the prior conviction herein. The defendant should not now be heard to deny that which was established by his prior criminal conviction, without proof that his conviction was <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>procured by fraud, perjury or some manner of error now sufficient to upset the conviction itself.</p>

The Commonwealth’s purpose in entering into the rental contracts with Cummins Construction Company was not only to rent equipment, but also it was to insist on and preserve a fair and impartial procedure in securing the rentals. When Shultz and the other owners of Cummins purposely and fraudulently frustrated the purpose of fair and impartial dealing and breached the contractual requirement which plainly stated that no owner of Cummins be an employee of the department and that no department employee have a pecuniary interest in the contract, the Commonwealth was substantially injured.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[241,1208,1157,1063]]]'>And what was the nature of the injury? By contracting with persons who are their own employees, the department participated, unwittingly, in a scheme which undermined and called into question the impartiality and fair dealing of a department of government. Additionally, it involved government in a scheme in which it was uncertain as to whether tax dollars were being spent for value, and a scheme which was in violation of a the State Adverse Interest Act. When government is perceived — perhaps by those who may have been told of the fraud — as no longer fair and impartial, it is seen as a center of corruption and criminal opportunity. Additionally, all branches of government become tarred, in the public eye, with the same brush as the supposedly corrupt department. In short, the injury is to the confidence that citizens may have in their government and to the certainty that value has in fact been received for tax dollars spent. If left unchecked, the injury is also that others, equally adept at fraud and deception, may themselves decide to participate in misrepresentations and scams involving government contracts.</p>

What is the value of <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>fair dealing and confidence in government? Without being able to determine what it is worth, we have no difficulty in determining that forfeiture of rental payments made under this contract is not excessive, and is therefore, in traditional contract terms, not a “penalty,” but rather, “liquidated damages.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[242,649,1154,739]]]'>Further, Shultz claims that the amount of damages is arbitrary in that the amount to be forfeited, which is the sum already paid in rental fees, depends upon when the deception is discovered. If the deception is discovered early, the forfeiture will be relatively small; if it is discovered late, the amount will be large. We disagree that this forfeiture scheme is arbitrary. In fact, far from being arbitrary, the forfeiture required is precisely proportionate to the injury inflicted by the fraud. If the fraud is discovered early, the injury will be relatively less severe and the forfeiture also will be of lesser amount. That the fraud may not be discovered for some time is an eventuality caused by the perpetrator himself and may not be used as an argument in favor of disproportionality.</p>

We disagree. The department’s remedies should not be limited to actions apart from the contract. Shultz and the others need not have signed the contracts in this case. They need not have perpetrated the fraud that they did. <em>They </em>were not deceived or the victims of sharp practice. On the contrary, they were the deceivers, and they were made aware, by virtue of the plain <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>language of the contract, that if they deceived the department as to ownership of the company, they would be liable to pay back that which they had fraudulently received. Why should the department now have to initiate criminal or tort proceedings in this case to recover <em>that which the parties already agreed would be recovered? </em>There is an elegant simplicity, an equitable proportionality, and a clear sense of justice involved in this contractual scheme which we are loath to disturb. Assuming that words mean what they say and are not mere inkblots on paper, the owners of Cummins Construction Company <em>knew </em>what they risked by perpetrating their fraud. They should not now be heard to complain that the risk was too great or that it should be litigated in some other forum on some other theory of law.</p>
