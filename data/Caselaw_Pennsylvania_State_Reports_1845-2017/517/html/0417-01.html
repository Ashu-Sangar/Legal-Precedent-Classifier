One of these judges is a member of the Municipal Court, with the remaining judges serving on the Court of Common Pleas. The Board initiated an inquiry following public disclosures involving a labor racketeering investigation being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On October 23, 1986, a federal grand jury sitting in Philadelphia returned a multi-count indictment charging nineteen individuals associated with Roofers Union Local 30-30B (“Roofers Union” or “Union”) with racketeering acts. Among other things, the grand jury charged that Stephen Traitz, Jr., the business manager for the Union, and other Union representatives used money obtained through kickbacks to make cash payments to public officials, including members of the Philadelphia judiciary.</p>

The Board also concluded that the Roofers Union is a potential litigant before the Philadelphia courts of which respondents are members. The Board determined that receipt of the cash gift by the respondents constituted a violation of Canons 1, 2 and 5 C(l) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. Finally, the Board recommended that each of the respondents be removed from judicial office, a disciplinary sanction authorized by Article Y, Section 18(d) of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The practice of law is a private pursuit, even though it has a significant impact upon a public function. Where a lawyer is found to have been derelict in his or her responsibilities, it primarily affects those who elect to repose their trust in that individual. In such cases, disciplinary action is necessary to prevent a continuation of the objectionable behavior and to repair where possible the damage to the integrity of the process that resulted from that errant conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> By suspension or disbarment the miscreant is prevented from causing further harm and his or her responsibilities can be assumed by others who will faithfully discharge them. Thus a period of suspension impacts only upon the offending lawyer. Where a judicial officer breaches the trust vested in one holding that office, the injury is further compounded because a public trust has been betrayed. <em>See, e.g., Gardner v. Broderick, </em><a href="/us/392/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="392 U.S. 273" data-case-ids="6169210" data-case-paths="/us/392/0273-01">392 U.S. 273</a>, <a href="/us/392/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="392 U.S. 273" data-case-ids="6169210" data-case-paths="/us/392/0273-01">88 S.Ct. 1913</a>, <a href="/us/392/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="392 U.S. 273" data-case-ids="6169210" data-case-paths="/us/392/0273-01">20 L.Ed.2d 1082</a> (1968). Moreover, the responsibilities of that office may only be discharged by one who has been chosen by the people to perform those duties. At this time when court case loads have reached unprecedented levels, the need for all of our authorized judges to be functioning efficiently has never been greater. Thus to employ a punishment that would render the office inoperative would compound the injury caused to the system by the misconduct of the offending judge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Such a result was never intended under our constitution.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[205,1839,1152,313]],["BL_494.1",494,[221,335,1157,934]]]'>Under Article 5, section 18(d), a judge who experiences a disability which seriously interferes with the performance of the duties may be retired and the office filled by one able to perform the tasks required by the office. In such instance the inability to perform does not arise from fault on the part of the jurist but rather from illness or other <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>disability for which the jurist cannot be held accountable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Even in instances such as these there is a clear expression under the scheme set up in our constitution that recognizes the need to fill the office with one capable and competent to carry out the responsibilities demanded by the position. The sanction of removal, which carries with it an automatic bar from ever holding judicial office in this Commonwealth in the future, expressly mandates forfeiture of the office. Art. V, § 18(l). <em>Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Bd. v. Snyder, supra. </em>Thus a vacancy is created and the errant jurist can be replaced. Equally apparent is that the sanction of "discipline", which does not provide for the termination of the jurist's salary, was not intended to include a cessation of his or her performance of the duties of the office of judge. <em>See In the Matter of Arthur S. Kafrissen, </em>No. 93 Judicial Inquiry and Review Board Docket (1986). Thus the concern presently being considered is not a factor in the imposition of that type of sanction.</p>

To conclude otherwise would render suspension a useless sanction. Obviously, the latter position was not the intent of the People in adopting Article V.</p>
    <p id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[217,695,1155,963]]]'>A sanction is designed not only to punish the offender and deter others who may be tempted by similar inducements, but where possible it should assist in ameliorating the injury caused by the dereliction. Under no circumstances should the sanction compound the injury. Any interpretation of the constitutional sanction of suspension which would preclude the replacement of the offending jurist would serve the interest of the offender and ignore the needs of the offended. Obviously such interpretation must be rejected. We therefore conclude that although the sanction of suspension does not require an automatic forfeiture of the office, we in our discretion can require a forfeiture with the sanction of suspension where it is appropriate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Such a reading still maintains a distinction between the two sanctions.

It is also appropriate to read the Code promulgated by this Court as prohibiting that conduct expressly condemned under section 17(c). Section 17(b) vested in this Court the responsibility to prescribe canons of legal and judicial ethics. Clearly that direction intended that we prohibit behavior that the constitution expressly forbids.

No rights of the respondents are offended by this Court assessing the conduct presented in this record in light of the prohibition set forth in 17(c), while reviewing the specific charges found to have been sustained by the Board. We are also satisfied that fair warning has been given by section 17(c) as to the type of conduct it was designed to prohibit and that a judicial officer offending that provision cannot be heard to raise a claim of inadequate notice.

He responded to formal proceedings by the Board with a general denial of the charges, and has scrupulously avoided any explanation of the circumstances of the gift. Respondent was subpoenaed to appear and testify before a federal grand jury regarding receipt of this gift.

Having reviewed these passages, we find they prove nothing more than a possible friendship between Traitz and respondent, and Traitz’s knowledge of the judge’s wedding. Instead, our review of the surveillance evidence discloses an intended plan by Union officials to influence judges of the Philadelphia court system.

He attempts to distinguish his case from the other judges who he argues converted the Roofers’ money to their own use. This contention is obviously specious.

We find that the evidence conclusively establishes that Judge Cunningham accepted the cash and further entered into an “illicit agreement” with Traitz.

There is no such authorization for the stopping of the salary of a jurist in the case of an interim suspension where the matter has yet to be finally adjudicated. Moreover, an interim suspension is not expressly provided for in article V, section 18 as a type of discipline to be imposed as a sanction for misconduct or misbehavior in office.

Indeed a contrary view would create serious due process questions since the validity of the accusations have yet to be finally determined. It is for this reason that this Court did not accept the Board’s recommendation as to the stopping of the pay of these judges during the interim suspension.

I fear that the majority’s confusion of the Constitution’s words “suspension” and “removal” has emasculated an otherwise viable means vested by the People of this Commonwealth to aid the judiciary in the appropriate disciplining of its justices, judges, and district justices. Furthermore, I am deeply concerned that the majority has centered its inquiry not on the activities of the jurist, but on those who would take advantage of him.</p>

It is not a means of regulating the behavior of others by exerting control over them through our judicial officers. There will always be individuals who for their own motives will seek to manipulate and gain advantage of public officials.

This places the jurist in the untenable position of discerning the motives of those whose relationships would not ordinarily cause one to undertake that analysis. Even in the context of the closest social relationship, there is very little which can withstand such scrutiny without seeding doubt that another’s motives are not purely altruistic. It is common experience that the mere existence of social relationship may lead one to believe that he is in the position to exert influence on another. Yet if one of the individuals is a jurist, the other’s conduct must be probed and his motives are immediately suspect. This is unnatural and unreasonable. I would not burden a jurist with this paranoia. The proper focus is on the conduct of the judicial officer as the recipient of a gift, not upon the giver’s motives. Although evidence of the giver’s actions may be relevant to establish whether the acceptance of a gift was improper, the impropriety of the judge’s conduct does not rest upon the giver’s intent.</p>

(A fourth action, compulsory retirement, is specified for conduct interfering with the performance of judicial duties that is less culpable because arising out of disability.) It is readily seen, and is conceded by the majority, that these three punishments vary in degree of severity. In its ordinary and common usage, the term “suspension” connotes a temporary condition, after which the prior condition is resumed. To impose a forfeiture of office is a punishment in addition to, and not subsumed within, the punishment of “suspension” as that term is commonly understood. I find no basis in the language of the Constitution for this <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>Court to order a judicial officer to forfeit his office without ordering that he be “removed” from office.

In the “silence” as to the consequences of a suspension, the majority sees an opportunity for the Court to conduct its own assessment of the needs of the system and fashion its own penalties.

In my view, by providing for the vacancy caused by removal and compulso<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>ry retirement and not making similar provision for the filling of a vacancy caused by other forfeiture of office, the Constitution recognizes that there are no other means by which the judicial office may be forfeited.</p>

The delegates had an intimate familiarity with the problem of overburdened courts. I, therefore, cannot accept the view that the scheme of punishment they crafted, allowing for replacement of the offending jurist in some instances and not in others, must be specially “interpreted” to accommodate this circumstance.

Indeed, it would appear that the majority’s “suspension with forfeiture of office” inures more to the benefit of the offending jurist than would suspension without pay for an extended period. A jurist under <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>suspension who remains in office would remain subject to all the constraints of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Constitution. His activities would necessarily be greatly limited. A suspended jurist who has forfeited his office, however, would be removed from the supervisory authority of this Court and be free to engage in any legitimate undertaking available to him. Ironically, this could include immediately running for election to the same office vacated by his forfeiture.</p>

By way of example, it is noted that the Fifth Judicial District (Allegheny County) is presently operating with four seats vacant, with no certainty as to the time in which they will be filled.
