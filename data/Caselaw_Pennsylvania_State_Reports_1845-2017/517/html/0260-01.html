Peetros, brother of Appellant James Peetros, in Delaware County on May 23, 1981. Pursuant to the investigation of that murder, certain items were removed from the decedent’s apartment by the Delaware County detectives. In conjunction with the Peetros murder, Officer Elefterios Mitsos of the Philadelphia Police Department was specially assigned to help Delaware County authorities in the investigation due to his familiarity with the Greek community in which the incident occurred and his <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>ability to communicate in the Greek language, which was predominantly spoken there. Officer Mitsos commenced his investigation by interviewing members of the community in the restaurant of an acquaintance, Peter Louvaris. Louvaris had been a close friend and associate of Harry Peetros and had also known Officer Mitsos for many years. Louvaris assisted Mitsos in the investigation of Harry Peetros’s death by providing his restaurant as a place where Mitsos could interview witnesses in the community — witnesses whom Louvaris would help to identify and contact.</p>

Appellant was on furlough from Graterford Prison. He inquired of Louvaris whether Louvaris knew any of the Greeks who owed money to his brother, as he was attempting to collect the money owed for his sister-in-law (Harry’s widow) and nephews. Louvaris indicated that Harry had carried a particular brown book and that he (Louvaris) probably knew the detective who “can help us, who will help me — because I know him for a long time — to get to the books”. N.T., Oct. 13, 1982, pp. 109-110. Peetros indicated he would be very interested.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Louvaris communicated Peetros’s interest in the loan records to Detective Mitsos. At some point, Mitsos indicated to Louvaris that the books of Harry Peetros were for sale.

Louvaris indicated that shortly thereafter Mitsos gave him his telephone number, which he gave to Harry Peetros’s widow and to James Peetros, and that that was the extent of his involvement.</p>

Peetros indicated to Mitsos that he was interested in collecting whatever was owed to his brother to help his sister-in-law and her children. Mitsos testified that Louvaris subsequently indicated to him in late June or early July that someone was interested in obtaining the books of Harry Peetros and “that he (Mitsos) could make himself a lot of money.” Louvaris later indicated that the person interested was Peetros.</p>

At this point, Mitsos indicated, he informed his immediate supervisors in Philadelphia and in Delaware County of the contact. The next meeting between Peetros and Mitsos occurred on July 24, 1979 at the Roundhouse. While both Peetros and Mitsos acknowledge that a meeting did take place, their testimony is contradictory as to the substance of that meeting. Peetros indicated that at the meeting he expressed anger at Mitsos for standing him up at a meeting scheduled for July 4, 1981 at Louvaris’s restaurant, at which time an exchange of $10,000.00 for the books was to be made.

During these conversations, it was agreed that $5,000.00 would be paid at the time of the transfer, and $5,000.00 at a later date.

His direct testimony, therefore, indicates only that $250.00 was paid per week over an approximately twenty-week period, and this amount equals the amount which was borrowed. The Commonwealth’s <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>contention that the simple arithmetic of (principal) x (rate) X (time) should lead us to a different conclusion is simply not substantiated by the ambiguousness of the testimony. Nor did Soublis’ testimony establish the 52 percent rate alleged by the Commonwealth since, even though he characterizes fifty dollars per week as “interest”, this is not consistent with the twenty-week payoff of the $5,000.00 debt to which he testified. Therefore, that testimony is, at best, inconclusive and cannot support a reasonable inference that the loan carried a 52 percent interest rate. More importantly, however, Soublis’s testimony as to Appellants visiting him to discuss a debt and, further, Eden’s subsequent visit and the resultant discrepancy in the amount owed no more establishes an attempt to collect an illegal debt given by the deceased than it does a misunderstanding as to <em>some </em>“debt” which was owed. Further, nowhere is the debt testified to and the debt allegedly attempted to be collected identified as one and the same. On this basis, we must agree with Appellants’ assertion that the Commonwealth has failed to sufficiently establish that the Appellants were in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 911(h)(l)(iv) since, at best, the Commonwealth has established only one instance of misconduct under that act, which is insufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. We must therefore reverse Appellants’ convictions on the charge of corrupt organizations.</p>

Since a retrial in this matter has been ordered, we feel it necessary to address the propriety of the Commonwealth's repeated references to “loansharking or loansharking books". It is incumbent upon the prosecution as well as the trial court to refrain from any reference to "loansharking” or "loansharking books" unless there is introduced some substantive proof of either the commission of such crime or the illegality of the objects identified. Unless this rule is adhered to, these remarks, as the Appellants claim in their brief, are highly prejudicial to their case and will again result in a retrial and/or discharge on appeal. The prosecutor must understand that he cannot "have his cake and eat it, too." If he chooses not to introduce direct evidence of the books confiscated from the decedent, a strategy which he is certainly free to pursue, he cannot, at that point characterize that evidence as a proven fact when in reality no substantive proof has been introduced.</p>
