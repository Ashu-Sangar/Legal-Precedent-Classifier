The Superior Court had affirmed in part and reversed in part an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County which had dismissed appellees’ action in ejectment and granted appellant’s prayer for specific performance.</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[243,823,1154,692]]]'>The facts relevant to this controversy are as follows. On September 15, 1970, after approximately two years of negotiations appellees/lessors, Carl and Elizabeth Cimina, entered into a lease agreement with appellant/lessee, Tony Bronich, concerning 26.25 acres of real estate in Perry Township, located in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. The lease had an original term of two years with a right of renewal for ten additional one-year terms. The rental amount for this property was $100.00 per month. In addition, the lease afforded appellant an option to purchase the leasehold property for $18,600.00 at any time during the initial term of the lease, or any of the subsequent renewal periods.</p>
    <p id="b448-7" data-blocks='[["BL_448.7",448,[243,1536,1151,258]]]'>This parcel was part of a larger tract owned by the Ciminas. Appellant occupied the adjacent property and desired to expand and utilize the premises as a location for his business of buying and selling used heavy construction equipment and earth-moving vehicles.</p>
    <p id="b448-8" data-blocks='[["BL_448.8",448,[240,1815,1153,367]]]'>As adjoining neighbors the parties enjoyed an amiable relationship over the years. However, in early 1980 this association began to deteriorate when the Ciminas questioned the financial wisdom of their arrangement, particularly the purchase option held by appellant. Consequently, the Ciminas sought to terminate the lease, and this desire precipitated the present lawsuit.</p>
    <p id="b448-9" data-blocks='[["BL_448.9",448,[241,2203,1150,97]],["BL_449.1",449,[214,313,1154,515]]]'>Up until this point it was appellant’s custom to hand deliver his payments in return for a signed receipt. How<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>ever, in the beginning of 1980 appellees began to resist signing a receipt and eventually the payments altogether were refused. This pattern of behavior continued until appellant, upon consulting with his attorney, established a rent escrow account and continued to make regular payments. It was at this time that appellant, through his attorney, informed appellees of his intention to hold them to their legal obligations and more significantly, to exercise his purchase option on the property prior to the expiration of the final renewal term of the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[211,848,1155,676]]]'>Over the course of the next several months the relationship continued to worsen. Finally, on June 18, 1981, appellee sent a letter which read in its entirety: “Request your payment of all money due me through March 14, 1981.” Appellant was confounded by this request since he was under the impression that he was current in his payments. The situation finally peaked when appellant received on August 7, 1981, a “Notice to Quit” demanding that he forfeit the lease and vacate the premises within ninety days because of his alleged breach of the agreement. Specifically, appellees asserted that appellant was in breach of the provision regarding the payment of real estate taxes on the leased portion of the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[210,1542,1153,150]]]'>It is undisputed that the lease specified that the tenant must pay the real estate taxes on the leasehold premise. The relevant provision of the agreement provided that:</p>

If the real estate taxes on the leased premises <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>are combined with real estate taxes on other property now owned by Lessors, then Lessee will pay only those taxes attributable to the leased premises and any improvements which may hereafter be erected thereon.</blockquote>
    <p id="A2i" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[236,539,1153,632]]]'>However, from the inception of the lease the real estate taxes assessed to appellees’ total acreage were paid each year by Elizabeth Cimina. Mrs. Cimina was apparently unaware of appellant’s contractual liability, and was neither informed by her husband nor sought from appellant his share of the taxes. Appellant, on the other hand, maintained that at least once every year he asked Mr. Cimina if he owed any taxes and was assured that none were due. Appellant never refused to pay these taxes and always stood ready to perform, but was never informed of his share. The real estate taxes in question amounted to approximately $500.00.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[233,1190,1153,681]]]'>Following receipt of the “Notice to Quit”, appellant’s attorney on August 24, 1981, notified appellees of his intention to exercise the option to purchase the property. Meanwhile, on October 15, 1981, appellees filed their confession of judgment in ejectment which, in turn, was answered by appellant’s petition to open on October 23, 1981. One week later, appellant filed a separate petition seeking specific performance on the purchase option. Both actions were consolidated for purposes of a non-jury trial. Following two days of hearings the trial court ruled in appellant’s favor on both petitions, dismissing appellees’ action in ejectment and granting appellant’s prayer for specific performance.</p>

However, while admitting that the breach was not sufficient to mandate a forfeiture, the court held that appellant did in fact breach the agreement, and moreover, failed to demonstrate his clear right to specific performance. Therefore, the court reversed the grant of specific <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>performance. Appellant petitioned our Court for allowance of appeal, which was granted.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[243,459,1153,199]]]'>The basic issue in this case is whether the Superior Court properly denied specific performance based on a technical breach where that breach had previously been determined to be immaterial.</p>

The value of the object sought transcends money because it has no peer of location, antiquity, artistry or skill. Thus, when two persons want only what one can have, only the clearest right can prevail, and it cannot be decided by reasons other than the most careful discrimination of long precedent and careful scrutiny of the equities arising from the facts.

Where credibility of witnesses is important to the determination, the Chancellor’s findings are entitled to particular weight because of his opportunity to observe their demeanor. Where a reading of the record reasonably can be said to reflect the conclusions reached by the Chancellor, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Chancellor. A reviewing court, however, is not bound by findings which are without support in the record or have merely been derived from other facts, (citations omitted).</blockquote>

Furthermore, appellant never refused to remit his share of the taxes. With the exception of this failure to pay the taxes, the Chancellor found appellant had been in full compliance with all the terms of the agreement. In finding that appellant had not materially breached the agreement, and that the breach could be remedied by payment of the taxes, the Chancellor held that appellant properly exercised the option to purchase precisely in accordance with its terms and that there was no other impediment to granting specific performance. We are of the opinion that this holding was correct and supported by adequate evidence in the record.</p>

In their amended complaint, appellees alleged that in addition to his failure to pay the real estate taxes on the leased property appellant had breached the agreement in the following additional aspects: violation of the local zoning ordinance with respect to the operation of his business; noncompliance with certain water and sewage regulations of the Department of Resources; noncompliance with the rules and regulations of the Commonwealth’s Department of Transportation regarding highway access; and failure to maintain the leased premises in good order and repair as required under the lease.

Additionally, the court made much ado about the fact that it was not until appellant had been notified of the breach and received the "Notice to Quit” did he attempt to exercise the purchase option on the property. However, a reading of the record reveals that approximately one year prior to this event, appellant, through his attorney, notified appellees of his intention to exercise the option. Therefore, for the court to intimate that appellant acted in bad faith is without foundation.</p>

There is no question that alternative remedies can exist for a breach under separate contracts, e.g., forfeiture vs. loss of entitlement to specific performance.
