This program (an “enrichment” program) added certain materials to the regular curriculum, but did not attempt to provide accelerated instruction in particular academic areas. Terry’s parents agreed that their son should participate in the enrichment program, but they asserted that the enrichment program was insufficient to address Terry’s need for accelerated instruction in reading and mathematics. Because the parents and the school district could not agree on the IEP, the parents requested a due process hearing as provided for in <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013.32" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 Pa.

The fact that most school districts meet this obligation by providing a part-time program of educational enrichment does not mean that such programming is appropriate for all mentally gifted students. In order to provide an appropriate program for an individual student, that student’s IEP must be developed based on <em>his </em>current educational levels and needs regardless of administrative considerations. Further, unlike other educationally exceptional students, mentally gifted students may receive their education within the regular and/or special education programs of the school; this determination is to be based on the student’s individual needs and IEP as well.</blockquote>

But it does not follow from the school district’s completion of this threshold requirement that it is excused from completing the other requirements found in the regulations concerning exceptional children.</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.6",618,[221,1719,1153,690]]]'>Among these other requirements are that the school district identify all children who may be in need of special education programs or services, 22 Pa.Code § 341.12; that the district evaluate such students, <em>id. </em>§ 341.13; that the district prepare an individualized education program for each child assigned to the special education program, <em>id. </em>at 341.15; that the district conduct a conference with the parent concerning the IEP, <em>id. </em>§ 341.16; that the IEP be developed jointly by parents and school personnel, and if parents disagree with the program, they may request a hearing before a hearing officer, who will issue an opinion and order defining the assignment, program and services to be provided the child. <em>Id. </em>at § 341.18, § 13.1.</p>

      <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>Since the State Board of Education has been mandated to promulgate regulations concerning the “proper education and training of all exceptional children,” and since these regulations have been duly promulgated and instruct the school districts as indicated above, it is difficult to understand the school district’s claim that the districts are required to do no more than provide the generalized “enrichment” programs mentioned earlier.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[201,769,1154,417]]]'>It is true that the School Code itself does not identify individualized education programs and does not speak, as do the regulations, of the unique needs of each exceptional child. That is to be expected, for when the General Assembly delegated to the State Board of Education the duty of providing the details of “proper education and training of all exceptional children,” 24 P.S. § 13-1372(1), it had no need to be more specific.</p>
    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.6",619,[198,1209,1155,473]]]'>The district argues, however, that even if the State Board is empowered to promulgate regulations, these particular regulations exceed its authority.

The curriculum of this program is to be adapted from the regular basic education curriculum. In this regard, the district witnesses testified on the hearing record that Scott had exhausted the district's curricular offerings in mathematics____ In other words, we may assume that Scott has exhausted the district’s curricular mathematics offerings in both regular and special education and has completed the mathematics courses required for graduation. Yet, Scott’s parents wish him to be provided with more.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b620-9" data-blocks='[["BL_620.6",620,[247,1312,1112,627]]]'>We can find neither legal nor factual basis for this. The district has addressed Scott’s giftedness, specifically in the area of mathematics for several years. This has been accomplished by accelerating Scott to higher level classes or by providing independent study____ In this manner the district addressed Scott’s individual needs for mathematics instruction. However, to provide Scott with yet another mathematics course at this point in time <em>would go beyond adaptation of the district’s legally required mathematics curriculum </em>and ... constitute provision of more than an appropriate program of special education to Scott.</blockquote>
