      <em>Leon </em>signals a halt in the headlong plunge into the delusion that we can prevent crime by proving to criminals that we are perfect; an idea savored among those who believe one offense is as good as another; a killer freed is a victory in teaching police to cross “t’s” and dot “i’s”. <em>Leon </em>teaches that improperly obtained evidence is not, <em>eo ipso, </em>suppressible as a constitutional right; that reasonable honest mistakes are not prizes awarded to plain, flat-out criminals.</p>
    <p id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[218,1551,1155,680]]]'>Although both <em>Leon </em>and <em>Sheppard </em>involved police acting in good faith reliance upon a defective warrant the analysis applied by the Court could ultimately extend to other good faith efforts of police. This approach would by far be the most reasonable since much of what appears as an inexplicable and sometimes degrading paradox would be obviated by distinguishing between actual misconduct and the mistakes of honest men. In this case one with bales of poisonous and illegal contraband escapes sanction because the police acted without the requisite formal authority of the occasion. Two wrongs, usually of very unequal weight, should never equal a right to escape when caught <em>flagrante delictu.</em>

    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[226,522,1152,739]]]'>One of the primary purposes of the exclusionary rule is to deter future police misconduct, and one of the crucial inquiries in evaluating the effect of the exclusionary rule as a remedy is whether it will accomplish such deterrence. Experience, however, has proven more often that dangerous criminals escape than that police have been made perfect on the killing ground. To apply the exclusionary rule in a situation like the present will not deter misconduct, it will only deter conscientious police work which often depends on the reasonable suspicions of the officer on the scene; reasonable suspicions on which, all too often, our very lives depend. Indeed, to apply the rule in this case breeds a disrespect and contempt for reason so profound as to make the law seem an ineffectual fool.</p>
