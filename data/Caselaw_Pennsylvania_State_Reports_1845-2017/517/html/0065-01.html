Simultaneously, the County also requested this Court to assume extraordinary jurisdiction over the matter.

It further alleged that because the number and compensation of employees necessary for the functioning of the court are controlled by county officials other than judges of the Court of Common Pleas, there are continuing disputes between the County and the Court of Common Pleas concerning the funding of these employees. Similarly, according to the County’s application, there are recurrent disputes over the level of funding necessary for supporting facilities and services, which the County acknowledges it is required by statute to provide. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 3721(a).</p>

    <p id="b143-5" data-blocks='[["BL_143.6",143,[222,789,1152,743]]]'>First, the employment of staff. The purpose of a unified judicial system is to provide evenhanded, unbiased and competent administration of justice. The expectation is that cases will be processed as well in one county as another. In order to meet this expectation, however, judicial resources and staffing must be proportionately similar in all judicial districts. There must be uniform hiring practices and standards, and judges must be free to hire competent staff, not merely those referred by local political figures. If the staffing of court-related positions is treated as an opportunity to repay political debts rather than as an opportunity to serve the public by hiring qualified people who are able to make the system work efficaciously, the system will be neither evenhanded nor competent.</p>
    <p id="b143-6" data-blocks='[["BL_143.7",143,[223,1551,1150,739]]]'>A second matter is the public’s perception of the judicial system. The citizens of this Commonwealth have a right not only to expect neutrality and fairness in the adjudication of legal cases, but also, they have a right to be absolutely certain this neutrality and fairness will actually be applied in every case. But if court funding is permitted to continue in the hands of local political authorities it is likely to produce nothing but suspicion or perception of bias and favoritism. As the framers of our constitution recognized, a unified system of jurisprudence cannot tolerate such uncertainties. All courts must be free and independent from the occasion of political influence and no court should even be perceived to be biased in favor of local political authorities who pay the bills.</p>

Thus, it is inaccurate to contend that the differences brought to light and resolved in those <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>isolated lawsuits establish the existence of an irreconcilable state-wide breakdown of the local funding process. Moreover, it is ludicrous to suggest that direct state funding will eliminate disputes over appropriations. The nature of the relationship between an appropriating body, whether it be the county commissioners or the General Assembly, and the would-be recipient of funds renders some degree of disagreement inevitable. It would be unrealistic to suggest that direct funding for the courts of common pleas will provide a more harmonious process.</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[221,911,1156,806]]]'>The underlying public policy in the area of public employment in this Commonwealth has been to establish and maintain a harmonious relationship between the public employer and the public employee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> It must be emphasized that the public policy in furthering the harmonious relationship between public employer and public employee is not here involved. In fact the judicial system has been unique in avoiding the disruptive disputes that so frequently plague other areas of public employment (e.g., the teachers strikes) and the private sector. The instant dispute is' nothing more than an instrumentality of the sovereign attempting to challenge the judgment of that sovereign. In my judgment such a controversy clearly does not justify the unprecedented response that the majority today is willing to bestow.</p>

In addition to the fact that this is not a judgment to be made by the judicial branch, the validity of that assumption is far from clear. This state is unique in its economic diversity. The cost of living varies significantly throughout the state. Presently, the salaries paid through local funding are based upon the cost of living <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>within that area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Any effort to standardize salaries according to function to accommodate the suggested direct funding would greatly inflate the present cost of operation without assuring any enhancement in the quality of the services rendered. To accommodate those areas with a higher cost of living to assure the ability to attract competent personnel will result in raising the cost in other areas far beyond what would be necessary to find competent help in the latter areas. Conversely, any effort to set the rates based upon the economy of areas having a lower cost of living or attempting to seek a medium between two extremes would render it impossible for those areas at the top of the economic scale to obtain competent staffing. Since these areas are the most populous, with the heaviest case loads, such a result would be disastrous.</p>
    <p id="b149-4" data-blocks='[["BL_149.5",149,[224,1202,1154,590]]]'>The utilization of the delegated taxing power of the counties in financing the functioning of the local court systems has proven helpful in insulating the judiciary from direct involvement in labor disputes with their employees. This salutory effect of the present relationship is evidenced by the fact that since the passage of Act 195,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> there has not been a strike of any group of court employees. Again, it is to be noted that the instant complaint is not being made by court employees, nor is there a complaint against the judges. The squabble is between the county and its parent as to the former’s responsibilities in this area.</p>
