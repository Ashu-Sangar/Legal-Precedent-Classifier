The memorandum contains a rather lengthy preamble in which the parties disclaim any intent to place the row officer in the position of “public employer” as defined under PERA, but which then also guarantees the right of either party to go into court and either prove or negate that understanding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>Recorder responded that the discharges were actually layoffs and as such did not constitute grounds for a grievance under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding. At that point SEIU filed unfair labor practices charges with the PLRB against the Recorder of Deeds and the Board of County Commissioners. The two claims were consolidated for hearing and the hearing examiner issued a proposed order dismissing the charges against the Commissioners, but finding that the Recorder, by his refusal to submit the grievances to binding arbitration, had committed an unfair practice in violation of § 1201(a)(1) and (5) of PERA. The Recorder filed exceptions which the PLRB dismissed and upheld the preliminary determination of the hearing officer. The Recorder appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, which found that the Recorder was not a “public employer” under PERA and that the Memorandum of Understanding was not a valid collective bargaining agreement. The PLRB appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed the Common Pleas Order. Commonwealth Court found a type of estoppel, stating that</p>

While this theory may have an equitable appeal, the approach and the result are contrary to the intent and purpose of the Act. The Commonwealth Court's holding in effect grants legitimacy to the individual row officers as <em>independent "public </em>employers" capable of collective bargaining within the scope of PERA. This was never the purpose of PERA as stated by the legislature or interpreted by the courts.

The proviso merely recognizes that, under PERA, matters affecting the hiring, discharge and supervisory powers of the public employer are not subjects of collective bargaining. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 1101.702 (selection and direction of personnel not subject to collective bargaining); 43 P.S. § 1101.706 (employer’s right to discharge for cause not impaired).

To allow otherwise would deviate from the stated intent of having all bargaining with the County emanate from one voice, i.e. the Commissioners, by inviting unwarranted piecemeal bargaining amongst individual row officers and the union, and, more importantly, would create chaos in the orderly process of determining and providing for both budgetary and other economic and employment matters within the Counties' purview.

    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.8",426,[226,604,1159,1603]]]'>The primary issue in this case is <em>not </em>whether the Recorder of Deeds is a public employer within the meaning of Act 195<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> (the Public Employer Relations Act) <em>nor </em>whether the Recorder of Deeds could enter into negotiations as representative for Allegheny County and reach a collective bargaining agreement with the representative of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Our cases, and the relevant legislation [Act 195 and section 1620 of the County Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>], have established that the Recorder of Deeds, judges and other county row officers are "public employers" under Act 195 as to matters affecting the hiring, discharge and supervising of public employees, <em>and that </em>the County Commissioners are the exclusive representatives of the public employer who, although prohibited from unilaterally bargaining so as to "affect the hiring, discharging and supervising rights and obligations" of the judges and county row officers, must nevertheless bargain <em>on behalf of </em>(and in cooperation with) those judges and county officers with respect to those subjects. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel. Bradley v. PLRB, </em><a href="/pa/479/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="479 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1742131" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0440-01">479 Pa. 440</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="479 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1742131" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0440-01">388 A.2d 736</a> (1978) and companion cases, <em>and County of Lehigh v.

Thus, as the majority states, the "Memorandum of Agreement" entered into by the Recorder of Deeds (and other Allegheny County row officers) only, without approval of or ratification by the County Commissioners, is not a valid collective bargaining agreement under Act 195. (The majority holds: "the County Commissioners are the sole managerial representatives possessing authority to enter into collective bargaining agreements with unions under the terms of PERA." At 809.)</p>

      <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>However, unlike the majority, I do not believe our inquiry ends there. We must now determine whether a public employer who is not the managerial representative commits an unfair labor practice in refusing to submit a dispute as to discharge of employees to arbitration, where such grievance arbitration procedure is provided for under Act 195 as well as by mutual agreement between that public employer and the employees. I agree with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board and the Commonwealth Court in this case, that the Recorder of Deeds did commit such an unfair labor practice in failing to abide by its agreement, even though it was an agreement which was not adopted as a valid collective bargaining agreement. Not every unfair labor practice stems from breach of a specific provision of a collective bargaining agreement. The unfair labor practices found by the Board in the instant case were section 1101.1201(a)(1) and (5), 43 P.S. § 1101.1201(a)(1) and (5) which provide that public employers are prohibited from: "Interfering, restraining or coercing employes in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Article IV of this Act." and from "Refusing to bargain collectively in good faith . . . including but not limited to the discussing of grievances with the exclusive representative." These unfair labor practices arose from the obligation of a public employer to arbitrate grievances, an obligation found within the Act itself, <em><a href="/pa/507/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="507 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1792345" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0270-01">id.</a> </em>at § 1101.903, as well as in the mutual agreement of the parties. As we stated in <em>Pittsburgh Joint Collective Bargaining Committee v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/481/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="481 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1747337" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0066-01">481 Pa. 66</a>, 74, <a href="/pa/481/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="481 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1747337" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0066-01">391 A.2d 1318</a> (1978):</p>

      <em>In the instant case the challenge is directed to the capacity of the employer to submit this particular subject to arbitration. </em>This distinction however does not require a different result. The relationship between the public employer and the designated bargaining unit is one which must be sustained for years, during which a number of contract negotiations will occur. To sustain a harmonious relationship it is necessary for each of the parties to be pliable and willing to recognize the other’s position. Nothing could be more disruptive to such a relationship than a demonstration of bad faith bargaining on the part of one of the parties.</blockquote>
