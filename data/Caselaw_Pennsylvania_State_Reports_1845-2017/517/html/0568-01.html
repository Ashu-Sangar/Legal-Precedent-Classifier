First, the right or procedure is expressly <em>not </em>set forth under Section 303. This is consistent with the gradually increasing scale of procedural rights established under this statute and described above. Second, as the facts of this case amply demonstrate, there is good reason not to include a right to a private hearing as a fixed attribute of an informal hearing in the context of mental health treatment. The short term involuntary treatment (not to exceed twenty days), which must be proceeded by an informal hearing, will usually not be based on detailed in depth psychological or psychiatric studies. Indeed, confinement and treatment for twenty days or less would often be needed for the purpose of <em>acquiring </em>more extensive psychological or psychiatric studies in the first place. We can discern no reason why the legislature would establish a mandatory mechanism to deal with the revelation at an informal hearing of sensitive personal information (that was originally conveyed to a doctor or psychiatrist) when such problems will seldom, if ever, occur. More to the point, the legislature has not done so.</p>

The lower court notes, however, that by custom in Allegheny County, parties against whom involuntary treatment is sought are afforded these procedural rights even in an informal hearing, and that proceedings under Section 303 tend to be more formal then strictly necessary, and hence, that many procedural rights are provided. It is perfectly understandable that this trend toward increasing formality would occur. Nevertheless, this is no excuse to create a potentially troublesome procedural device where none exists nor does it justify over-reaching to resolve a non-existent conflict of constitutional rights.</p>

Appellant was not, and realistically could not, have been exposed to a deprivation of a protected constitutional right by the fact that this informal hearing was open to the press and to the public. None of Appellant’s medical records was presented as evidence of her mental condition. No information was disclosed which intruded upon Appellant’s privacy, and no testimony was given in violation of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Accounts of Appellant’s psychiatric history, containing far more detail than the evidence adduced at the commitment hearing, had already been published in the local newspapers. Thus, because the court would not have been protecting any privacy right of Appellant by closing the hearing, the decision to make it an open hearing was correct. Before closing a judicial proceeding, a trial court must determine that closure will effectively protect the compelling interest endangered by openness and that the information sought to be withheld from public exposure will not be made public anyway. <em>Globe, supra, </em><a href="/us/457/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="457 U.S. 596" data-case-ids="6192549" data-case-paths="/us/457/0596-01">457 U.S. at 608-610</a>, <a href="/us/457/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="457 U.S. 596" data-case-ids="6192549" data-case-paths="/us/457/0596-01">102 S.Ct. at 2620-22</a>; <em>United States v.

While on its face, Section 304(e)(4) does appear mandatory at first reading, due caution is necessary. If a private hearing is "requested,” this does not necessarily mean, as a matter of verbal logic, that the request <em>must </em>be honored. A recent trial court decision in Lehigh County apparently held that Section 304(e)(4) was discretionary and not mandatory. <em>See, In Re Fitzinger, </em>13 Med.L.Rprt.
