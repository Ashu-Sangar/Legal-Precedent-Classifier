    <p id="b623-10" data-blocks='[["BL_623.11",623,[214,1248,1155,690]]]'>Lewis Cudo (decedent) was an employee of Hallstead Foundry, Inc. (employer) for 22 years. For the five years preceding his death, decedent worked as a grinder, which position involved standing in a booth, grinding and turning metal castings weighing between 25 and 150 pounds. On May 17, 1979, decedent performed his normal tasks at work for seven hours. As he awaited the lunch whistle, he fell over and, shortly thereafter, was pronounced dead on arrival at Binghamton General Hospital. The autopsy listed the causes of death as advanced coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and acute congestive heart failure. Decedent had had a pre-existing heart condition which had been alleviated by surgery in 1966.</p>

Dr. Grace, who had not prepared the autopsy report and who could not recall ever having treated dece<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>dent, testified that the stress and tensions of decedent’s regular work were directly related to decedent’s heart attack and resulting death. On the basis of this testimony, the referee awarded death benefits of $117.30 per week to appellant and directed that the employer’s insurance carrier pay $70.00 for medical expenses and $1500.00 for funeral expenses.</p>

This request was refused, and the Board reversed the referee, finding that the medical testimony of Dr. Grace was equivocal on the issue of whether decedent had suffered a work-related injury resulting in death. An appeal was erroneously taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Susquehanna County. While that appeal was pending and within 18 months of the Board’s decision, appellant filed a petition for rehearing pursuant to section 426 of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> Appellant alleged in her petition for rehearing that after discovered evidence had become available, which evidence would show unequivocally that decedent’s death was work-related.

See 77 P.S. § 871 (Board may grant rehearing pending appeal).

On January 8, 1981, the Board granted the petition for rehearing and remanded the case to the referee, and at the same time the Board set aside its order dated September 4, 1980 which had reversed the referee’s award of benefits. Appellant was permitted, therefore, to introduce the testimony of the heart specialist at the rehearing. After receiving this testimony, the referee once again ruled that compensation was to be awarded. On August 80, 1985, the Board affirmed the referee’s award. An appeal was taken to the Commonwealth Court, whereupon the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the Board had abused its discretion in ordering a rehearing. The instant appeal ensued.</p>

Further, it is to be noted that when the medical testimony was in fact introduced at the rehearing, the heart specialist giving that testimony indicated that his previous role as a treating physician for appellant’s husband had been well known for a number of years, and that he might have been available in the local area to testify at the time of the original hearing. He was not consulted, <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>however, regarding the possibility of testifying in this case until October, 1980, approximately one year after the original hearing.

The pathologist offered his opinion, which was later judged by the Board to be equivocal, on the question of whether the cause of death was work related. See <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/508/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="508 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="1794052" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0360-01">508 Pa. 360</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="508 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="1794052" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0360-01">498 A.2d 800</a> (1985) (medical evidence establishing causal connection between injury and work-related activity must be unequivocal in nature). Thus, it is evident that appellant chose to rely on the testimony of the pathologist to prove that the cause of death was work related, and that the decision not to call the heart specialist as a witness at the,original hearing was not due to lack of knowledge as to the availability of such a witness. In short, the testimony provided by the heart specialist at the rehearing did not constitute newly discovered evidence.</p>

The evidence introduced at the instant rehearing was not after discovered evidence, and the Board itself conceded this fact in its opinion supporting the grant of the rehearing. In short, the Board granted a rehearing so that appellant could present additional evidence, thereby permitting appellant to strengthen what the Board regarded as, essentially, “weak proofs which [had] already been presented.” See <em>Young, </em>supra.</p>

As noted previously, however, an appeal of the Board’s decision dated September 4, 1980 was in fact taken, though it was filed, erroneously, with the Court of Common Pleas of Susquehanna County. A controversy exists as to whether that appeal was ever disposed of in any manner. Appellant contends that the Court of Common Pleas made no disposition of the appeal, and asserts that the Board simply recalled the case in conjunction with granting a rehearing before the referee. In the memorandum opinion of the Commonwealth Court that is presently under review, however, there is a statement that the Court of Common <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>Pleas quashed the appeal, and there is set forth some speculation that the reason for quashing the appeal was that the Court of Common Pleas lacked jurisdiction. Appellant denies that the appeal was ever quashed. Nevertheless, on grounds that no effective appeal had ever been taken, the Commonwealth Court declined to review the question of whether the Board’s order of September 4, 1980 was in error.</p>
    <p id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[237,804,1154,1468]]]'>Doubt may certainly be entertained that the appeal was quashed for lack of jurisdiction, in view of provisions in the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure which state that erroneously filed appeals are not to be quashed or dismissed. Pa.R.A.P. 751. Such appeals are to be transferred to the proper court having jurisdiction over the appeal, with the appeal to be treated as if originally filed in the transferee court on the date first filed in the transferor court. <em>Id. </em>Examination of the record, however, does not reveal with certainty what in fact occurred, for the official record as presented contains no documents from the Court of Common Pleas indicating whether the appeal was quashed, withdrawn, transferred, or otherwise disposed. It is perplexing that relevant appeal papers are not included in the record. Recognizing this, appellant has submitted a photocopy of what purports to be an unsigned notice from the Susquehanna County Prothonotary addressed to the Court Administrator, dated April 3, 1981, stating that, as of that date, a notice of rehearing by the Board was the last document filed in the case and stating that the case had not been praeciped for trial or otherwise disposed. Based upon this notice, it does appear that the appeal was not quashed or otherwise addressed. It is not possible, however, to determine with certainty, based on the official record in this case, whether there was any basis for the Commonwealth Court’s conclusions that the appeal was quashed and that appellate review was waived.</p>

If, as it appears, appellant did pursue a timely appeal of the order until such time as the Board set the order aside and granted a rehearing, then it cannot be said that appellant waived review. To hold otherwise would result in a manifest injustice, for appellant would have been afforded no opportunity to challenge the validity of the Board’s original decision that became controlling when the order granting a rehearing was held by the Commonwealth Court to have been improper.</p>

Likewise, there is no basis for the conclusion set forth in the opinion authored by Mr. Justice Larsen that there was need for a rehearing to conduct a “full and complete medical inquiry.” Indeed, a full and complete medical inquiry had already been conducted at the time of the first hearing. If the Board erroneously deemed the testimony from that hearing to be equivocal, an appeal was the proper means of challenging the Board’s determination, where the Board did not correct its error through reconsideration of the record as it then existed.
