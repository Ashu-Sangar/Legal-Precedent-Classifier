The charges related to a burglary of Appellant’s residence. A preliminary hearing had been scheduled for the morning of April 5, 1982, before District Justice Betty Lloyd. Appellant arrived at the magistrates’ office that morning and had conversations with police officer Fantaski and appeared clear and coherent. While in the magistrate’s office, Appellant, without warning, approached Ms. Jones and said, “[t]his is what you need,” aimed a gun at her head and fatally shot her. Appellant was immediately searched and a knife was found in his possession. Later, when questioned, Appellant stated that, having been a police officer, he was aware of his constitutional rights. Nevertheless, his <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to him and thereafter he freely gave a statement in which he admitted the shooting. Several eyewitnesses gave testimony that Appellant acted normally and was calm and rational during this period. Appellant was rewarned of his rights prior to giving a recorded statement.</p>

Appellant called Thomas M. Eberle, Ph.D., a clinical and forensic psychologist, who stated that he diagnosed Appellant as suffering from schizophrenia, paranoid variety, chronic, in a somewhat obsessive-compulsive personality. He testified that Appellant had a bright-normal I.Q. and had no evidence of organic abnormality. However, he concluded that Appellant was legally insane at the time of the shooting.

The Superior Court’s holding that the remarks made by the trial judge were not prejudicial to the Appellant was based upon the rationale that the witness was testifying as, to sanity and he is a doctor of psychology and not a medical <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>doctor who is certified in the field of psychiatry, as were the Commonwealth experts. Superior Court reasoned that the trial court, perhaps a bit too spontaneously, was simply expressing the traditional view that when an expert testifies with respect to sanity it is commonly a psychiatrist. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Woodhouse, </em><a href="/pa/401/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="401 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1294504" data-case-paths="/pa/401/0242-01">401 Pa. 242</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.2d%2098" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="164 A.2d 98">164 A.2d 98</a> (1960). However, this nuance was never explained by the trial judge to the jury. The jury was clearly given the impression that because Dr. Eberle was a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist, his testimony was not deserving of the same weight as the testimony of the psychiatrists.</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[209,965,1155,972]]]'>While the question of the qualification of a witness to express an expert opinion is one for the discretion of the trial judge, whose ruling thereon will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion, his credibility, of course, is for the jury to pass upon. <em>Commonwealth v.

In the instant case, upon the request of Appellant, Dr. Eberle was appointed by the court, in fact by the same judge who questioned his qualifications to render an opinion under M’Naughton; this was the very purpose for which he was appointed. The trial judge did not challenge his qualifications at the time of appointment nor when the defense called him as an expert. The Commonwealth neither challenged the qualifications of Dr. Eberle, nor objected to his testimony. We think that any reservations held by the judge as to his qualifications should have been expressed at the time of appointment, or prior to his being permitted to testify at trial.</p>
    <p id="b652-6" data-blocks='[["BL_652.6",652,[208,1969,1152,424]],["BL_653.1",653,[196,333,1161,1808]]]'>At trial, after Dr. Eberle first recited his extensive professional qualifications as a clinical and forensic psychologist, he then proceeded to review Appellant’s mental state without challenge by the court. He next testified, unchallenged by the court, that Appellant met the criteria for legal insanity. It was only when trial counsel asked Dr. Eberle to address Appellant’s mental state with regard to M’Naughton, that the court challenged his qualifications to <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>render such an opinion. Although Dr. Eberle was permitted to give his opinion under M’Naughton, and the court, in its charge reiterated Dr. Eberle’s qualifications to the jury and emphasized that it was for the jury alone to decide whether to accept or reject the expert testimony, we believe these cautionary instructions could not have reaffirmed the jury’s role in determining credibility, thereby minimizing the impact of statements made by the court. The judge had already told the jury that Dr. Eberle was not as qualified in the field as the Commonwealth experts. He misled the jury to the prejudice of the Appellant. The prejudicial effect was emphasized by the fact that the court did not refer to Appellant’s expert as “Doctor” in its charge. Although the charge indicated that the witness was a psychologist and a professional whose credibility was to be determined solely by the jury, the cumulative effect of the court’s challenge to the expert’s qualifications and failure to address the expert by his earned title in the charge clearly left the jury with the impression that Dr. Eberle’s opinion was not as reliable as the Commonwealth’s experts’. This was extremely prejudicial to the Appellant, since his sole defense was one of insanity. His actions in killing the victim were undisputed and he pled no justification other than his purported delusions. His entire defense consisted of his own testimony, and the psychiatric testimony of his expert witness, which was denigrated by the judge’s expressed opinion that Dr. Eberle was not as qualified as the Commonwealth witnesses. Appellant was entitled to a fair opportunity to present his defense of insanity to the jury without the trial judge usurping the province of the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses. On this record, we do not believe that Appellant had such an opportunity, consequently, he is entitled to a new trial.</p>

Thus, the comments which were made by the trial judge were not without foundation, in that he merely questioned the competence of the psychologist to testify, and stated what we have recognized as a fact, that a psychiatrist is more competent to testify than a psychologist. I think the trial judge would have been well within his bounds to have refused to allow this psychologist to testify at all; then we would only be concerned with whether that was an abuse of discretion. However, since the trial judge, despite his legitimate concerns, allowed the psychologist to testify, the Court is now saying he erred in voicing those concerns. I must dissent from this decision.</p>
