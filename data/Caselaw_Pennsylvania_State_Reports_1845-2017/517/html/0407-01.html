The Appellant was sentenced to three concurrent terms of imprisonment of from four and one-half months to twenty-three months on the homicide convictions. Sentence on the remaining summary offenses was suspended.</p>

Now, as I mentioned there are three statutory considerations with regard to the operation of the Vehicle Code.</blockquote>

One cannot operate a motor vehicle knowing or should have known of defective brakes and be heard to say that there is reason for a violation but there’s no reason for a violation such as a red light or reckless driving or driving at an unsafe speed. If so operated in causing the death and the Commonwealth has established this beyond a <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>reasonable doubt then you will find the defendant guilty of homicide by vehicle.</blockquote>
