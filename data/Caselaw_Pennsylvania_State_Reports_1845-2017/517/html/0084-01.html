The orphans’ court en banc unanimously held that the charges for services in connection with the adoption in this case were excessive, and thus, reduced the fee.

In addition, he drafted the consents of the natural parents to the adoption,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the notice of hearing and the affidavit of service of notice of hearing to confirm the consents, and, of course, the report of intermediary.

The 1980 amendment of subparagraph 8 deleted the phrase “fee or expenses”, and substituted the language now appearing. Act of October 15, 1980, P.L. 934, No. 163. The 1982 amendment added paragraph (c), which clearly spells out the power of the orphans’ court to review all payments to intermediaries and to fashion appropriate relief. Act of June 23, 1982, P.L. 617, No. 174. Elimination of the word “fee” in the 1980 amendment indicates a clear legislative intent that intermediaries not receive compensation for intermediary services. Moreover, it is clear that the reason the intermediary report requires a listing of monies or other forms of remuneration received by the intermediary is to give the orphans’ court an opportunity to pass on the propriety of such payments, not to suggest that all such payments are permissible.</p>

By now the practice should be so abhorrent to every American that no one would traffic in human life for profit. Unfortunately, the lessons of the past are already forgotten; and due to the current small <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>supply of babies available for adoption relative to the demand for those infants by prospective parents who are ready to pay, if they must, to get an infant, our society has experienced a degree of principle-shifting.</p>
