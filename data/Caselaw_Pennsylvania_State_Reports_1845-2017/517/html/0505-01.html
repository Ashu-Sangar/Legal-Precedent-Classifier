The minutes of the meeting indicate that the resolution was based solely on the Law Department’s recommendation that the award was advisory only ([Appellee’s] Exhibit B), without a shred of discussion of the merits or fiscal impact of the award. Such a summary rejection in no way constitutes a “consideration” of the award, and clearly illustrates the very evil about which our Supreme Court has been so concerned — that all arbitration awards covering public employees can be summarily and automatically rejected.</p>

This increase was intended by the County to bring ACAPE employees’ salaries in line with the raises that had been given other County employees in 1979 and 1980, while nevertheless continuing to challenge in court the validity of the salary increases awarded by the arbitrators.

However, as the record demonstrates, funds earmarked for a particular purpose or to a particular line item are not necessarily expended as originally anticipated. Thus the term "excess or surplus funds” should be understood in this context to mean funds earmarked for an express purpose or a particular account which are not actually used or needed for the purpose or account originally anticipated.
