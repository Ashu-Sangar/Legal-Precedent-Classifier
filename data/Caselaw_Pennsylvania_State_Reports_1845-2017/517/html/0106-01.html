In 1967 Charles and Helena Brown transferred title to the subject property from their own name to a partnership — Fair Winds Farm. Fair Winds Manor, Inc. in turn leased the property from Fair Winds Farm. The partners of Fair Winds Farm were Charles and Helena Brown and their three children Alfred, Nadine, and Zarah Brown Blair. The children were later each given a one-fifth interest in Fair Winds Manor, Inc. In 1972 Nadine Brown sold her one-fifth share in Fair Winds Manor, Inc. to her brother-in-law Kenneth Blair.

Kenneth Blair contacted the Nursing Home Loan Agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Agency) to ascertain the availability of funds required for construction.

Faced with this refusal, and thereby the certainty of discontinuing the facility’s operation, Kenneth and Zarah Brown Blair purchased the interest of Alfred and Marlene Brown as well as Charles and Helena Brown in Four Winds, Ltd. on November 6, 1980. The result of this transaction was that Four Winds, Ltd. was dissolved and the subject property was titled in Kenneth and Zarah Brown Blair as tenants by the entirety. Consequently, Fair Winds Manor, Inc. now leased the realty from Kenneth and Zarah Brown Blair.

DPW's field auditor, instead of denying the entire depreciation allowance, merely adjusted the depreciation expense to what it would have been based on the original cost of the real estate. Such an adjustment could only be made if Manual Section IV(D)(13) applied. 8 Pa.Bull. 2837 (1978). Actual depreciation, interest, taxes and related property costs could be taken in lieu of rent only if the organization was related to the facility by common ownership of more than ten percent equity, control, etc. For fiscal years ending June 30, 1979 and June 30, 1980 when Four Winds Ltd. owned the property this adjustment was appropriate.</p>
      <p id="b180-8" data-blocks='[["BL_180.9",180,[248,1792,1120,421]]]'>Based on how the Four Winds, Ltd. transaction was structured, i.e. Blair's joint ownership of the real estate, the lease payments for fiscal year ending June 30, 1981, would not appear to be an allowable cost. Manual Section IV(D)(14) — Rental of property and plant, 8 Pa.Bull. 2837 (1978), specifies that reasonable rental expense is an allowable cost for leasing of facilities from <em>nonrelated parties </em>in an <em>arm’s length transaction. </em>By virtue of the fact that the Blairs were the owners of both Fair Winds Manor, Inc. and the subject realty, the facilities could not, it appears, be considered to be leased from a nonrelated party in an arm’s length transaction so as to come within the regulation then in effect.</p>

Ironically, Fair Winds Manor, Inc., in an attempt to bolster its argument that interest income on the savings accounts should be applied to current indebtedness interest expense, appears to rely on the April 23, 1980 memorandum. Fair Winds Manor, Inc. claims that investments are defined by DPW as "permanent or long term securities with a value but which are normally not available for immediate withdrawal.” Appellant's brief p. 36. Fair Winds Manor, Inc. has failed to either include a copy of the memorandum or alternatively properly cite the source of the quote. The result is that Fair Winds Manor, Inc. did not meet its burden of proof.</p>
