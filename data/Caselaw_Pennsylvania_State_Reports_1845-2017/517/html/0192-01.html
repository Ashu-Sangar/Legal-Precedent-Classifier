Traveling northbound on Route 141 in Lancaster County, Heck approached the intersection with Union Schoolhouse Lane. He proceeded to make the gradual left-hand turn onto the lane and entered the intersection. The motorcycle, which had been traveling southbound on Route 141, struck the right front fender of Heck’s automobile. The impact caused the motorcycle to bounce backwards about eighteen feet, throwing Ginder through the air. Ginder died as a result of the injuries which he sustained in the accident.</p>

While we believe this observation of the Superior Court arises more from a dissatisfaction with precedent than from a strict reading of this Court’s analysis in prior decisions, nevertheless, we agree that this dissatisfaction has merit.

Review of the evidence lead them to conclude that the Commonwealth had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellee’s conduct “... involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor’s situation.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(b)(4).</p>
