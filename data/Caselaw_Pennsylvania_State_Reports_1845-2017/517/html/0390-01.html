The Commonwealth has challenged our jurisdiction to hear this appeal on the grounds that neither 42 Pa.C.S. § 722(5) (concerning direct appeals to this Court on matters which affect the convening, supervision, administration, operation, discharge of an investigating grand jury, or any investigation conducted by it), nor 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b) (concerning interlocutory appeals by permission) confers jurisdiction on this Court.</p>
      <blockquote id="b463-9" data-blocks='[["BL_463.10",463,[257,1621,1118,154]]]'>We agree with the Commonwealth’s analysis.

Lang’s criminal prosecution is a plenary matter which did not arise from any grand jury proceeding, but as the result of independent investigation. We conclude, therefore, Rule 3331 limits the application of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 722(5) so as to deprive this Court of procedural jurisdiction in this case. The fact that this Court agreed to address a question certified by the lower court does not, of itself, confer procedural jurisdiction where it does not otherwise exist.</blockquote>
