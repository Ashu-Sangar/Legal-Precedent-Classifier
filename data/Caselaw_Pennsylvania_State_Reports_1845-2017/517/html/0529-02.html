Appellant and a co-defendant were arrested on June 6, 1986, in connection with a bank robbery on the same day in East Allen Township, Northampton County, in the course of which three persons were killed and two others seriously injured. Appellant was brought before the trial court on June 12, 1986, at which time he indicated his desire to represent himself and expressed concern that professional representation would hamper the prosecution’s case against him. N.T. June 12, 1986 at 22. The trial court then conducted a thorough colloquy on the question of waiver and ordered a psychiatric evaluation as to appellant’s competency to make a knowing, voluntary and intelligent decision to waive his right to counsel. A psychiatrist’s report, received by the trial court on June 20, 1986, expressed the professional opinion that appellant was suffering from no mental disorders and was competent to make such a decision. Appellant was again brought before the trial court and repeated his intention to proceed without counsel. The court then accepted appellant’s waiver and appointed two <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>members of the Northampton County public defender’s office to serve as standby counsel. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 318(d).</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[205,500,1154,358]]]'>Appellant subsequently waived his preliminary hearing, and, on July 20, 1986, pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal homicide, two counts of attempted homicide, one count of robbery, two counts of aggravated assault and various other charges. Appellant’s request to plead guilty to first degree murder on the criminal homicide counts was refused. Instead, pleas were entered to murder generally.</p>
    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[201,876,1157,925]]]'>A degree of guilt hearing was conducted beginning on August 7, 1986. The Commonwealth presented extensive testimony and numerous exhibits over a three-day period. After the conclusion of the hearing on August 9, 1986, the trial court found appellant guilty of three counts of first degree murder. Appellant was subsequently informed of his right to counsel during the sentencing phase of the proceedings and again waived counsel. The Commonwealth presented no additional evidence at the sentencing hearing. Appellant testified in support of the validity of his guilty pleas and indicated that he would not appeal from whatever judgments of sentence might be imposed. He also offered as mitigating circumstances the facts that he had no prior felony convictions and was employed at the time of the commission of the crimes of which he had been convicted. Appellant then expressed the view that the death penalty was the only possible verdict and requested that he be sentenced to death.</p>
    <p id="b601-7" data-blocks='[["BL_601.7",601,[199,1828,1154,567]],["BL_602.1",602,[237,326,1154,461]]]'>During closing argument, the Commonwealth urged the court to sentence appellant to death. When questioned as to his position, appellant again requested the death penalty. After deliberation, the sentencing court returned a verdict of death on all three counts of first degree murder. That court found that two aggravating circumstances had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt: that the victims were killed to prevent their testimony against him in a criminal proceeding, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5), and that the killings were committed in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6). The court also found one mitigating circum<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>stance, appellant’s lack of a prior record of felony convictions, but concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed that factor in mitigation. Appellant declined to file any post-verdict motions and, on September 3, 1986, the death sentences as well as consecutive sentences on related charges were formally imposed. Notwithstanding appellant’s desire that no appeal be filed on his behalf, the' record was subsequently transmitted to this Court in accordance with Rule 1941 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>

The testimony establishes that, in early May of 1986, appellant decided to rob a bank. He enlisted the aid of a friend, Stanley Herzog, believing that his plan would require at least two persons in order to ensure that all persons who might be in the bank at the time of the robbery could be executed before an alarm could be pressed. It was also crucial to appellant’s plan that no eyewitness survive. The East Allen Township branch of <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>the First National Bank of Bath was selected as the target. Preliminary to the actual robbery, appellant and Herzog broke into the bank during the early morning hours of May 29, 1986, to ascertain the nature of the layout of the bank and the nature of its security system. During this burglary, the two men vandalized the bank in an attempt to deceive the police as to the purpose of the break-in. Appellant and Herzog then purchased handguns, appellant selecting a nine millimeter handgun for maximum “firepower.” They practiced for the robbery by shooting at human silhouette targets. Appellant also took measures to estimate the time it would take the police to respond in the event the robbery would be reported while in progress.</p>
    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[222,1039,1155,1148]]]'>On June 6, 1986, appellant and Herzog drove to the vicinity of the bank. Appellant, using a pay telephone, communicated a bomb threat to the airport located across the street from the State Police barracks closest to the targeted bank. He also telephoned the bomb threat to an Allentown radio station as well as the Allentown police. Appellant and Herzog then drove to the bank, entered, concealing their handguns, and each approached tellers’ windows for the ostensible purpose of obtaining change. Appellant shot both tellers in the back as they were attempting to comply with the request. One, Janice Confer, fell to the floor wounded. The other, Hazel Evans, was killed instantly. Appellant next fired two shots at the branch manager, Marcia Hauser, but missed. He then shot across the lobby at a bank official, Jane Hartman, and a customer with whom she had been conversing. The customer was wounded but survived. Ms. Hartman dropped to the floor and hid under her desk. Appellant then ran across the lobby and shot her twice in the back, killing her instantly. In the meantime, Herzog had entered Ms. Hauser’s office and shot her through the head. She survived but is permanently disabled.</p>

In accordance with his master <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>plan, he shot her again in the back, the bullet penetrating her heart and lungs and causing her death. The robbers had collected approximately $2,280.00 when an automobile approached the bank’s drive-in window, whereupon they fled in appellant’s vehicle.</p>

In light of the court-ordered psychiatric examination that found the defendant to be competent at the time of his trial and the absence of any evidence that he was incompetent at the time he gave his confessions or that his confessions were in any manner coerced, we can only conclude that the evidence supports beyond a reasonable doubt the trial court’s findings that defendant was guilty of three counts of first degree murder.

In those cases we held that the aggravating circumstance defined in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5) requires that the motive for the killing of the victim must be the intent to remove that individual as a witness. It is the fully formed intent prior to the event to kill a potential witness that provides the animus upon which this particular aggravating circumstance rests. As indicated in <em>Commonwealth v. Crawley, <a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">supra,</a> </em>the obvious intention of the drafters was to address this "type of frontal assault upon the criminal justice system.” <em><a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">Id.,</a> </em>514 Pa. at 561, 526 A.2d at 345. To emphasize this thrust, the Court created the "pending” requirement. <em>See Commonwealth v. Caldwell </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Crawley, <a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">supra.</a> </em>While this concept was superimposed upon 42 Pa. C.S. § 9711(d)(5), it served to limit the application of that section to clear instances where the requisite animus was present. In this instance, however, it is clear that the requisite animus was present, since the predesigned purpose for the killings was to eliminate the potential of witnesses in a prosecution against appellant and his accomplice. To insist upon the court-created device in this case would exalt form over substance and result in denying the application of this aggravating circumstance in a case where it was clearly intended to be applied.</p>

        <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>We maintain the position that the existence of this aggravating circumstance cannot be established circumstantially unless the victim was in fact a witness in a pending grand jury or criminal prosecution. However, the killing of a potential Commonwealth witness before either of these bodies results in the same frontal assault upon the criminal justice system. To ignore this erosion in the process where it can be established by direct, rather than the less reliable circumstantial evidence, would unduly restrict the obvious legislative intent. Therefore, we will permit a finding of the existence of this particular aggravating circumstance where the killing results from the intention to eliminate a potential witness, if such facts can be established by <em>direct </em>evidence. Such is the case here.</p>
