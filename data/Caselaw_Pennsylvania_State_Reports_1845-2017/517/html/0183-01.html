Due to expansion of Action’s business, land and buildings were purchased in At-glen, Pennsylvania, to manufacture load detonators.

Mr. Tamany was entrusted with the day-to-day management, including, recruitment, hiring and firing of employees. Amcom employees specifically reported to Mr. Tamany regarding all aspects of their work.

On May 30, 1978, an explosion occurred at the Atglen plant seriously injuring Appellants. Maxine Kiehl is totally, permanently disabled.

Ms. Kiehl also suffers from episodes of vertigo which cause her to fall and prevent her from working or driving.

Today, complex corporate entities like Action often conduct business through subsidiaries to protect the parent from the financial, contractual and tort liabilities of its subordinate units. “Piercing the corporate veil” was a doctrine originally designed by the courts to protect innocent parties by treating the corporation and its shareholders, or as in this case the parent and subsidiary, as identical for purposes of suit.

It is clear from the record that Joe Tamany exercised almost exclusive control over hiring and firing Amcom workers. Both Appellants were interviewed and hired by him without consultation by Action. Mr. Sweeney, personnel director for Action, testified that his only involvement in staffing the plant was a form letter sent from the home office, to former employees to announce reopening of the facility. Mr. Tamany could fire employees without the consent of Action and, by Mr. Sweeney’s own admission, Tamany only consulted him when disciplinary action was involved. Amcom had no check writing authority, but, employees were paid from separate payroll, with Amcom checks from Amcom’s separate checking account.</p>
