While he held the office his wife was in fact the tax collector. His office was charged with collection of taxes for three different entities: the County; the Borough; and the West Shore School District. For tax purposes two separate bank ac<a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>counts were maintained in his name, but clearly distinguished from his own personal funds.</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[229,457,1153,529]]]'>Appellant’s wife sent the tax notices to taxpayers, received and recorded the payments, deposited the monies received, and ultimately forwarded the monies to the authorities entitled to them. Appellant worked elsewhere, but when his wife fell ill all the duties he apparently neglected suddenly became his responsibility. Upon entering these duties he became aware of irregularities in the records. He discovered wrong deposits, dilatory record keeping, and borough and county tax receipts used to pay school tax obligations.</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[225,1006,1152,906]]]'>Upon making these discoveries, appellant contacted Robert L. Daub, a certified public accountant. Mr. Daub’s accounting firm was the borough and school district auditor. Appellant explained the problems he was encountering in attempting to reconcile the tax records kept by his wife. On several different occasions appellant sought advice from Mr. Daub informally in hopes of straightening out the records. Unfortunately, due to appellant’s extremely limited familiarity with the records, that was impossible. Following the completion of the school district audit Daub contacted the borough council president concerning these problems. A meeting was called with appellant, as a result of which all the tax records in appellant’s possession were removed from his home and placed in borough offices. Mr. Daub immediately commenced an audit of the borough and county records, and based on these results the Commonwealth elected to prosecute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

He explained the results of the audit that ensued following the removal of the tax records from appellant’s home. He testified that as of the date the records were removed, that being August 26, 1982, there was a discrepancy between the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>money available in the bank accounts and the money payable to the taxing authorities. Specifically he testified that:</p>

Consequently, when a payment was received from a taxpayer during the discount period — in which two percent (2%) less than the face value was due— she would delay remittance to the taxing authority and submit the payment at the higher penalty rate — approximately ten percent (10%) over face value.

In the context of the present case we must interpret the term “shortage” to decide whether the legislature intended to require evidence of an actual shortage between the funds received by the Van Nests and the funds paid to the taxing authorities; or whether mere evidence of a paper shortage, between the amount allegedly due at a given point in time and the amount on hand, is sufficient. We think the only reasonable conclusion, consistent with strict construction, is that the former definition was intended. Otherwise we would open the door to criminal prosecution for every tax collector who fails to timely remit taxes<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>, since when finally remitted more taxes would be due because of the penalties than were actually collected<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>.</p>

      <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>Therefore, since the prosecutor in this case failed to prove that the Van Nests actually collected more money than they eventually turned over to the taxing authorities, there was no “shortage” established within the meaning of Section 3927(b)(2). Hence it was error to permit the jury to consider the presumption. Without this presumption there was <em>no </em>evidence tending to show that appellant dealt with the property as his own. Consequently, the Commonwealth’s case was lacking evidence on this critical element and appellant’s sufficiency challenge must be sustained.</p>

One should not infer from this decision that we mean to condone the failure of appellant to faithfully discharge his responsibilities as the elected tax collector; nor do we wish to excuse negligent tax collectors in general. However, the General Assembly has provided a civil avenue that the taxing authorities may utilize to sanction such behavior. Section 5511.41 of the Local Tax Collection Law, 72 P.S. § 5511.41, provides a taxing body with the remedy of filing a judgment on liability against a tax collector or his sureties for any unpaid amounts. In fact in this case the record reveals that the taxing districts filed such a claim with the surety and eventually reached a settlement in excess of $78,000, exclusive of interest. In addition, Section 5731 of the same statute, 72 P.S. § 5731, prohibits the reappointment of a defaulting tax collector.</p>
