Bat Vending Company filed a motion seeking return of the machines, and the Commonwealth sought to have the machines forfeited as gambling devices. After an evidentiary hearing, the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas denied Bat Vending Company's motion and ordered that the seized property be forfeited to the Commonwealth. On <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>appeal, Superior Court, <a href="/citations/?q=356%20Pa.%20Super.%20592" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="356 Pa.

We hold that the evidence was insufficient to establish the requisite element of reward to sustain a finding that the machines were gambling devices per se and reverse.</p>

During the hearing before the trial court, a machine was produced for demonstration purposes. The parties stipulated that the model was representative of the machines that were seized, except that it allowed twenty-credits to be used at a time, rather than ten credits. It was stipulated also that the coin-operated machines have a bookkeeping capacity to determine the number of games played and the number of credits.</p>

The “U-17” chip can be removed and replaced with a chip that will enable the machine to knock off game credits if a jumper cable is inserted between the “cancel” and “stand” buttons on the machine. Removal and replacement of the chip can be accomplished in approximately 15 seconds. When the machines were seized, the circuitry had not been altered. There was no evidence that the machines had been used for gambling purposes.</p>

If each of the elements is displayed by the machine, it is a gambling device per se. It is not disputed that the first two elements are present in the confiscated machines. The issue is whether the potential to alter a machine's function to add a knock-down feature is sufficient to establish the element of reward.</p>

The Commonwealth contends that the ease and speed with which the machines could be altered to perform a knock-down function are sufficient to establish the reward element. It is the actual condition of the machine at the time it is confiscated which controls when no evidence of gambling activity is introduced. The <em>potential </em>for a reward does not satisfy the Commonwealth’s burden of proof. The mere possibility of using a device for gambling purposes is not what allows for its confiscation under § 5513(b), yet that would be the consequence of adopting the Commonwealth’s theory. We decline to do so and find that the electronic poker machines were not gambling devices per se.</p>
