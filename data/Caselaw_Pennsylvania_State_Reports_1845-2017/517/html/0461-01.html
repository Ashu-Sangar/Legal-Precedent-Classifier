The “Uninsured Motorist Act” requires, subject to limitations not here pertinent, that automobile insurance policies covering personal-injury liability also provide protection against uninsured motorists. However, the availability of this protection to employees of the owner of the insured vehicle implicates section 303(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 481(a), which states that the latter statute is the exclusive source of an employer’s liability to an employee for work-related injury.</p>

The third action was of the same nature, but included the injured employee’s own insurance carrier as a co-defendant. In all three cases the courts below concluded that section 303(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act immunized the employer from the employee’s claim for uninsured motorist benefits.

The petitioner specifically alleged that the accident had occurred “in the course and scope of his employment with the City of Philadelphia.” The City responded to the petition with preliminary objections, raising as an affirmative defense the exclusivity provision in section 303(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The trial court agreed with the City’s defense, sustained the preliminary objections, and entered an order dismissing Collins’ petition insofar as the City was concerned. In the court’s view, the City’s obligation to Thomas Collins was limited to workmen’s compensation. Thereafter, on June 11, 1985, the trial court issued another order: directing that Collins’ uninsured motorist claim proceed to arbitration against the other respondent, General.

Larson, <em>Workmen's Compensation Law, </em>§ 65.11 (1987 ed.). It is worth noting that, with the enactment of section 303(a), the exclusivity principle ceased to be stated in terms of a "surrender" arising from an agreement to be bound by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act. Under section 303(a), the exclusivity principle becomes applicable merely from the fact that a worker has suffered an injury <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>in the course and scope of his employment. The bar against bringing an action at law against the employer to recover for such an injury is no longer a consequence of agreeing to be bound by the workmen's compensation statute, but arises automatically if the injury is covered by the statute. The 1974 change in the statutory formulation of the exclusivity principle reflects another, even larger change which the legislature made that same year: a change from an elective system of workmen's compensation, as existed before, to one that is mandatory. Since, by the express language of section 303(a), the statutory compensation is <em>"in place of any and all other liability" </em>on the part of the employer for a worker's injury in the course of employment, the conclusion must follow that the section denies a worker any cause of action at law against his employer for such an injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> So strong is the principle of exclusivity we have held that it is a nonwaivable defense, even when not timely raised. <em>LeFlar v.

There is no disputing that in each case the claimant was strictly in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the injury, and thus was entitled to workmen's compensation. Consequently, to the extent that any of the lawsuits for uninsured motorist benefits was directed against the claimant's employer, section 303(a) of the Workmen's Compensation Act, if controlling, would be preclusive of the action. That is, if the claims here involved are within the compass of section 303(a), that provision, being more recent than the "Unin<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>sured Motorist Act," would prevail.

As support for this argument, the appellants point out that under the Workmen’s Compensation Act a claimant is restricted to payment for medical expenses and a sum based on lost wages, <em>i.e., </em>economic detriment, whereas under the “Uninsured Motorist Act” he could also recover for pain and suffering. In the appellants’ view, the legislature intended the two systems of compensation to be complementary where a worker is injured in the course of employment by an uninsured motorist. We must reject this assertion insofar as the employer’s liability is concerned, because the argument ignores the clear mandate of section 303(a) that benefits under the Workmen’s Compensation Act shall be <em>“in place of any and all liability” </em>on the employer’s part for a work injury. Furthermore, the worker’s loss of the right to recover pain-and-suffering damages from his employer was a major part of the consideration given to employers for being subjected to liability without fault under the workmen’s compensation statute.</p>

This argument is predicated on our decision in <em>Modesta v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, <a href="/pa/503/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="503 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1785933" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0437-01">supra.</a> </em>As noted, <em>Modesta </em>held that even though an entity is permitted <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>to be self-insured as to vehicle liability it still must provide the coverage mandated by the "Uninsured Motorist Act." Using that holding as its premise, the appellants go on to reason as follows: (1) if a vehicle owner had a written policy of liability insurance, the policy would have to contain a clause obligating the insurance carrier to pay benefits for injury caused to "an insured" by the negligence of an uninsured motorist; (2) under <em>Modesta </em>a selfinsured is to be treated as if it has a written liability policy with an uninsured-motorist provision in it; and thus, (3), the self-insured stands in the shoes of an insurance carrier. Based on that line of reasoning the appellants next conclude that a self-insured employer, such as we have in each of the instant cases, is not only an employer but also is the functional equivalent of an insurance carrier with respect to uninsured motorist benefits. Therefore, according to the above argument, to allow an employee to recover uninsured motorist benefits directly from his employer, even for a work-related injury, would not be liability arising from the latter's status as employer but from its status as insurance carrier.</p>

However, for us to adopt such an exception, by embracing the fiction that a self-insured employer was being subjected to liability in some capacity other than that of employer, would require us to ignore an inescapable truth: that the employer, in paying uninsured motorist benefits, would be paying a worker for an injury sustained strictly in the course of employment. That reality cannot be pretended away. As to such injuries, section 303(a) of The Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act provides that the compensation under that statute is the employer's exclusive liability, and that such liability is "in place of any and all other liability" on the employer's part.</p>

It is thus clear that the focus of the “dual capacity” exception is on the circumstances in which the worker’s injury occurs. But no such exception can exist where, as in the matters now before us, the employee’s compensable injury occurred while he was actually engaged in the performance of his job. The terms of section 303(a) do not leave room for the exception advocated by the instant appellants.

In this connection, the appellants point out that uninsured motorist benefits would not be withheld from a non-employee who was injured in the same accident as the worker. According to the appellants, such discrimination between employee and non-employee is an unreasonable classification, and thus violative of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the federal constitution and our state constitution. This assertion is devoid of merit. Neither the equal protection guarantee of the federal constitution nor the companion protection in our state constitution forbids the drawing of distinctions, so long as the distinctions have a rational basis and relate to a legitimate state purpose. <em>E.g., Plyler v.

The one statutory exception to this principle is contained in section 305 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 501 (Supp.1987). This section states that if an employer has failed to comply with the insurance requirements mandated by the statute, for the securing of compensation claims, an injured worker has the option of proceeding under the act or in suit for damages at law.</p>

The Workmen's Compensation Act provides a substitute for the common law tort liability of an employer who is negligent in failing to maintain a safe working environment. <em>See Poyser v. Newman &amp; Company, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/514/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="514 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1804606" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0032-01">514 Pa. 32</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="514 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1804606" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0032-01">522 A.2d 548</a> (1987) (Larsen, J., dissenting). The Uninsured Motorist Act is a substitute for common law tort liability and is designed to compensate victims of motor vehicle accidents involving uninsured drivers. An action for uninsured motorist benefits is based on contract and has nothing to do with the tort liability of an employer. <em>See Wagner v. National Indemnity Co., </em><a href="/pa/492/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="492 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1767201" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0154-01">492 Pa. 154</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="492 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1767201" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0154-01">422 A.2d 1061</a> (1980) (Larsen, J., dissenting; Kauffman, J., dissenting).</p>

The exclusive remedy provision of the Workmen’s Compensation Act is <em>not </em>automatically triggered by the fact that the parties are also employer and employee.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.6",545,[203,1594,1155,590]]]'>The employees herein are seeking uninsured motorist benefits from an insurer who <em>happens to be </em>an employer. Liability to pay uninsured motorist benefits is based on a party’s status as an insurer under the Uninsured Motorist Act. The employer-employee relationship is of no consequence under the Uninsured Motorist Act, and the employer as uninsured motorist insurer has absolutely nothing whatever to do with the rights and liabilities prescribed by the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Hence, the exclusivity provision of the Workmen’s Compensation Act should not apply herein.</p>
