Analytically, the two most obvious approaches to this question are either to construe the affidavit and the warrant together, or to construe only the warrant, without regard to the affidavit. In this case, if the two writings were construed together, the place would be described with sufficient particularity, since the affidavit plainly states that the phones suspected of being used to conduct a lottery were located in Apartment One, not elsewhere. If the documents are to be construed separately, however, the warrant would fail for lack of particularity since the box on the form, separate and apart from the affidavit, where the address is filled in does <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>not contain any reference to Apartment One, but instead appears to authorize a search of the entire building.</p>

This case does not concern probable cause, but it is related to the decisions in <em>Gray </em>and <em>Gates </em>in that those cases adopt the general view of warrants that they are to be interpreted in a common-sense fashion, not in a hypertechnical fashion. As the <em>Gates </em>Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[268,1082,1110,399]]]'>The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the “veracity” and “basis of knowledge” of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place....

    <p id="b110-10" data-blocks='[["BL_110.8",110,[224,1778,1151,617]],["BL_111.1",111,[229,341,1150,253]]]'>An argument against holding that the affidavit and the “Description of Premises” box on the warrant are to be construed together is the fear that the police officers who conduct the search will be different from those who wrote the affidavit and that the officers conducting the search will be unaware of what is in the affidavit. We believe this argument is without merit. Even if the police who conduct the search are different from the officers who got the warrant, it is inconceivable that those who conduct the search will not read the affidavit in order to learn as much as possible about the possible dangers within the premises they are about to search. And if police officers unfamiliar <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>with the investigation are likely to read the affidavit and thereby know where they are authorized to search, those familiar with the investigation, <em>a fortiori, </em>will know where the items to be searched for are thought to be located and where they are authorized to search.</p>
    <p id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[228,612,1151,719]]]'>Applying the “practical, common-sense” rule of <em>Gates </em>and <em>Gray </em>to this case, it is our view that the police officers conducting the search in this case would be aware of the exact location to be searched. They knew that a suspected lottery operation was being conducted at 9935 Frankstown Road by use of telephones which were located in Apartment One at that address. Common sense suggests that this information does not authorize a search of Apartments Two or Three, and, in fact, the only search conducted was a search of Apartment One. Had any location other than Apartment One been searched based on the affidavit in this case, any items seized from other locations would have been suppressed as having been seized outside the authority of the warrant.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[228,1361,1152,1041]],["BL_112.1",112,[254,334,1149,363]]]'>Of course, one of the concerns lurking beneath the surface of search and seizure cases is not merely whether the evidence seized will be suppressed, but also whether the search and seizure is a ruse, whether it is being used as an instrument of government oppression. Where a search and seizure is conducted in the absence of probable cause or in general, not specific locations, even if seized evidence is suppressed, the life and energies of ordinary people may be seriously disrupted by having to conduct a defense of charges filed against them based on such groundless and illegal searches. We are ever watchful to prevent this from happening, and we have no desire to establish precedent which will in the future permit such searches to be conducted. In short, we are aware of the possibility that the government may act in bad faith and use its enormous powers to intrude where it should not into the private lives of our people. However, having said that, we do not see such an abuse in this case. Rather, what appears to have happened is that the police officer applying for the warrant inadvertently omitted the apartment number from the box <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>on the form which called for it. Were there reason to believe that this omission was not inadvertent, or were there reason to believe that police officers conducting the search would not reasonably know where the search was to be conducted, our view of this case would be quite different. As it is, we believe that Superior Court was correct in upholding the validity of the warrant.</p>
