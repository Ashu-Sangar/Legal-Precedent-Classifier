The two corporations are the corporate general partners in two limited partnerships which were initially formed to finance, build, and operate, respectively, the Essex Square Apartments and the Green Hill-Lytle Apartments, both now constructed, and located in the City of Pittsburgh. The individual Appellants are the Administrators D.B.N., C.T.A. of the Estate of Charles Hall, who died on July 25, 1972. The Administrators now effectively control all of the stock in the two corporate general partners mentioned above. Charles Hall originally owned all of the stock in both corporations, and it passed to his estate at his death. Appellees are the two limited partnerships, Essex Square Partnership, Ltd., and Green Hill-Lytle Partnership, Ltd.; and the various limited partners therein, Herman Lipsitz, Morton and Carolyn Fiedler, Arizona Lipnob Estates, Inc., and Trading Corporations.

Claims were also asserted on account of the Essex Square general partner’s failure to pay interest on loans made to it by the limited partners during construction, and the Essex Square general partner’s failure to maintain a life insurance policy on the life of Charles Hall. All of these claims were allowed in an opinion and order entered by the Orphans’ Court Division of the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court (Ross, J.).

      <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>The underlying facts in this case, based on the findings of the trial court, are as follows. Charles Hall was an experienced and successful real estate developer. During 1970 and 1971, in order to raise the needed capital to build and develop the two apartment house projects involved in this case, Mr. Hall sought investors willing to put their money into such endeavors. He first approached claimant, Morton Fiedler, as to the Essex Square venture. Mr. Fiedler contacted claimant, Herman Lipsitz, an attorney as well as a prospective investor, and negotiations commenced. Preliminary estimates of the size, construction costs, capital investment needed, and projected cash flow were prepared by Mr. Hall and set forth in a <em>"pro forma</em>" for each project which was then presented to some of the claimants as an inducement to invest. The Green Hill-Lytle <em>pro forma </em>was introduced into evidence at trial. For each project, Mr. Hall formed a corporation of which he was the sole shareholder. These two corporations (Appellants, the Essex Square Corporation and the Green Hill-Lytle Corporation) were to become the general partners in the two real estate investment limited partnership agreements that were envisioned, while the various investors were to be the limited partners. The reasons for this somewhat complicated form of ownership structure include the following. In a limited partnership, the limited partners (the investors here) are ordinarily exposed to only limited liability should the venture fail, just like stockholders in a corporation. See, the Pennsylvania statutes on limited partnerships, now 59 Pa.C.S. § 501 <em>et seq., </em>and specifically 59 Pa.C.S. § 521, formerly 59 Pa.C.S. § 191. The general or managing partner in the limited partnership, on the other hand, is ordinarily exposed to unlimited personal liability for the debts of the partnership. See, <em>Northampton Valley Constructors, Inc. v. Horne-Lang Associates, </em><a href="/pa-super/310/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="310 Pa. Super. 559" data-case-ids="209833" data-case-paths="/pa-super/310/0559-01">310 Pa.Super. 559</a>, <a href="/pa-super/310/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="310 Pa. Super. 559" data-case-ids="209833" data-case-paths="/pa-super/310/0559-01">456 A.2d 1077</a> (1983). When, as here, the general partner is itself a corporation, this exposure to unlimited personal liability (here, Mr. Hall's) is avoided. Moreover, since the death of a general partner will ordinarily dissolve the partnership business, 59 Pa.C.S. § 534, formerly 59 Pa.C.S. § 204, and produce un<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>fortunate business and tax consequences, use of a corporate general partner avoids this problem as well since a corporation, for these purposes at least, does not "die." These advantages might also have been achieved by the simple forming of a corporation, but that form of ownership would typically not have produced the significant and perfectly legitimate tax shelter advantages available to a limited partnership under sections of the Internal Revenue Code applicable at the time the events relevant to this case occurred. See Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Sections 701, 702, 731 and 1372(e)(5).</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[247,901,1157,1202]],["BL_191.1",191,[229,306,1160,1523]]]'>Claimants began extensive negotiations with the Essex Square and Green Hill-Lytle Corporations through Charles Hall, their sole shareholder and agent, looking to the formation of the two limited partnerships that had been contemplated. The wording of each limited partnership agreement, along with supporting documents, was carefully scrutinized and the agreements were rewritten several times before becoming final. The agreements were prepared in Appellee-investor and attorney Herman Lipsitz’s law office. The Essex Square agreement was finalized first in 1970, and served as a model for the second, the Green Hill-Lytle agreement, finalized in 1971.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The essence of these two limited partnership agreements was that the corporate general partner would see to it that all of the necessary construction work was completed and that the properties would be maintained and managed properly, whereas the limited partners were only obligated to contribute specific fixed amounts of capital, that is, financing. In return for rendering the services described above, the partnership agreements clearly provided that each of the corporate general partners received a fifty (50%) percent share of the rental income (R. 608e-609a, 681a). Neither corporate general partner was required to make any cash contribution to <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>the initial capital of either partnership. It is clear, incidentally, given each corporate general partner’s fifty percent interest in what is now a successfully completed apartment project, that neither can properly be described as a shell corporation, or as a dummy corporation without assets. Through separate contemporaneous contracts, specifically the Essex Square corporate agreement and the Green HillLytle corporate agreement (each fully set forth in the record), the corporate general partners each contracted with Charles Hall individually for his personal supervision of construction. Through separate pledge of stock agreements (both also fully set forth in the record), Mr. Hall agreed to release to the limited partners all of the shares of stock owned by him in the two corporate general partners in the event that he failed, <em>during the construction period, </em>to perform the services required of him. (See, R. 672a, 707a). Such stock could then be sold and the proceeds used to obtain substitute services. A careful review of these documents clearly demonstrates that great care was taken to protect the limited partners during the construction period in order to make certain that they received the benefit of Mr. Hall’s expertise in the supervision of development and construction, or of comparable expertise should Mr. Hall falter for any reason. With respect to management of the projects <em>after </em>construction was completed, however, it is equally clear that scant attention was given in these documents to the problems that might develop during such later periods, particularly the problem of what would happen if Mr. Hall could not continue.</p>
    <p id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[226,1849,1154,518]],["BL_192.1",192,[245,305,1154,259]]]'>Construction was completed on the Green Hill-Lytle building first. Units were rented while Charles Hall was still alive and apparently no management fee was charged during his lifetime. Charles Hall died while construction on the Essex Square project was still on-going. All the stock in the two corporate general partners passed to Charles Hall’s estate at his death since he was sole shareholder in both corporations. His son, Barry Hall, who was also a beneficiary under Mr. Hall’s will, was named as Executor of the estate and, in that capacity, assumed effective control <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>of the two corporate general partners as a director-officer of each. Barry Hall ceased to act as Executor in 1980 and he was succeeded by Albert I. Raizman and Darryl Hall (another son of Charles Hall) acting as Administrators of the estate, D.B.N., C.T.A.</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[240,584,1159,1386]]]'>Shortly after the death of Charles Hall, each limited partnership was charged a management fee for the first time. Barry Hall, in control of each corporate general partner, effectuated a contract with his solely owned McQuarters Management Corporation which agreed to provide management services to the two apartment projects for a fee. McQuarters Management Corporation was later succeeded by McQuarters Realty Company, Inc., whose president and incorporator was Darryl Hall, and which entity currently manages the two properties. The trial court found that McQuarters Management made only small profits and sometimes lost money, but that Darryl Hall received a salary in 1980, and that Barry Hall received $25,260.00 in compensation in 1976. The limited partners were informed of the arrangement with McQuarters Management by letter dated December 16,1974. The initial management fee was five (5%) percent of the gross rentals. This was increased to six (6%) percent for each building on May 1, 1978. Claimant-limited partners regularly objected to the management fee. They specifically asked that the practice cease by letter dated August 23, 1976, but this was unsuccessful. In this litigation, Claimants asked for reimbursement for these management fees, and said claims were allowed by the trial court. As of 1980, these claims against the two corporate general partners exceeded $330,-000.00.</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[239,1997,1153,368]],["BL_193.1",193,[219,303,1160,1838]]]'>After construction loan commitments were made (during Mr. Hall’s lifetime), construction began on both projects. The construction lender, Concord Liberty Savings and Loan Association, allowed the borrower to “draw down” upon each loan account as construction progressed, rather than take the full amount of the loan in one lump sum. The lender required that interest due on the loan be pre-paid. If <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>this interest was deducted from the “draw” or the full face amount of the loan up front, it would have reduced the total cash flow available to the borrower and hence diminished the amount available to pay bills. To avoid this problem, and also to provide claimants, the limited partners, with substantial tax benefits, the limited partners lent (or at least contributed) funds to the two corporate general partners so that they could pre-pay the interest on the bank loans attributable to the construction period. The uncontroverted testimony of Mr. Lipsitz’s accountant established that these loans or advances were entirely voluntary on the part of the limited partners and were not mandated by either of the limited partnership agreements. The amount advanced by the limited partners to pre-pay interest on the Green Hill-Lytle construction loan was repaid to them in full and included repayment of both the principal amount advanced plus interest on that amount calculated at the prime rate of eight (8%) percent. An exhibit was offered into evidence which was asserted to be a calculation in the handwriting of Charles Hall showing that the amount of interest due on this advancement was eight (8%) percent as calculated over an eleven month period. The exhibit was at least in part written on the back side of a sheet of Mr. Lipsitz’s stationery. (See, R. 633a-636a). It was not signed. In any event, it is clear that these advances on the Green Hill-Lytle project were, in fact, paid back <em>with interest. </em>The limited partners in the Essex Square project made advances to cover the prepaid interest on the construction loan on that building in the total amount of $155,000.00. The principal amount of these advances was repaid but <em>no interest </em>was paid to the limited partners on this amount. The Essex Square limited partners asserted a claim for this unpaid interest. This claim was allowed by the trial court over the objection of Appellants. As of February, 1981, this interest amounted to over $38,000.00.</p>
    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[217,2160,1154,204]],["BL_194.1",194,[246,305,1155,310]]]'>Claimants also asserted that they were entitled to a credit on the Essex Square partnership account of $250,000.00 representing the proceeds of a life insurance policy on the life of Charles Hall which the Essex Square corporate <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>general partner had allowed to lapse for non-payment of premiums (obviously during the lifetime of Mr. Hall). The Essex Square partnership agreement at Article V, § 2(b) (R. 687a) expressly obligated the corporate general partner to secure such a policy. This claim was likewise allowed by the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[244,654,1156,922]]]'>The procedural history of this litigation includes the following. On April 17, 1980, two separate complaints in equity were filed in the Civil Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. (See R., 12a-54a, and 66a-73a). The two complaints separately raised claims with respect to the two partnerships. The plaintiffs in each case were essentially the Appellees herein, while defendants included Appellants, and in particular, the respective corporate general partners, along with the current administrators of the estate of Charles Hall. The complaint in the Essex Square matter was subsequently amended. (R. 74a-76a). Both complaints sought various forms of relief including appointment of a receiver to manage the properties, cancellation of the management contracts entered into by the corporate general partners, an accounting and auditing of the respective partnership records, and an award of compensation based thereon.</p>
    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[243,1607,1154,755]],["BL_195.1",195,[237,317,1151,95]]]'>The estate of Charles Hall was named as a party defendant in these two cases. The administrators of the estate were named presumably because they exercised control over all of the stock in the two corporate general partners in their capacity as administrators. Whether, and in what capacity, they served as officers or directors in the two corporations is unclear. The two limited partnership entities themselves were curiously named as party plaintiffs rather than as party defendants. Neither the complaint in the Essex Square matter, nor the amendment thereof, pleads facts that in any way assert the claim that the insurance policy on Mr. Hall’s life was allowed to lapse (or the claim that interest was not paid on the loan to the partnership). Paragraph 19 of the Green Hill-Lytle com<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>plaint (R. 17a), and paragraph 20 of the Essex Square complaint (R. 72a) each states that:</p>

The estate had been opened in 1973. During the course of the trial or “hearing” on these claims before Judge Ross, Appellants repeatedly argued that the Dead Man’s Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5930, barred testimony against Mr. Hall’s estate. As a consequence, claimants early on in the proceedings relinquished their claims against the estate itself (R. 177a-180a). Defendants’ motion to transfer the claims back to the Civil Division was denied, however. (R. 180a). Contrary to assumptions routinely made throughout this litigation as it has wended its way through the appellate process, it is absolutely clear from a reading of Judge Ross’s order of July 20, 1982 (fully set forth at pp. 16A-19A of Appellants’ brief), that her allowance of the claims described above (which are the subject of this appeal) were allowed <em>only </em>as to the respective corporate general partners and specifically denied as to all other parties (including the estate itself). See paragraphs (2), (4), (7) and (8) of the July 20, 1982 Order.

We agree with the Superior Court that decedent had no such interest here. Charles Hall was merely an agent of the two corporate general partners that entered into the limited partnership agreements with claimants. He was insulated from general and unlimited personal liability to either the limited partners or to any other "creditors" even though he was the sole shareholder in the two corporations. Mere stock ownership, even when the stock in the corporation in question is owned by only one shareholder, will not blur the distinction between individuals and corporate entities. <em>Barium Steel Corp. v.

We decline the invitation to do so. If anything in this litigation is clear, it is that these two corporate entities were and are not mere fictions. As explained above, the use of a corporate general partner in an overall limited partnership entity is essential in order to give the developer limited liability and to combine this benefit with the substantial tax shelter advantages available to real estate limited partnerships. Once these benefits and advantages are realized through use of such entities, the parties to such transactions will not be heard to assert that the entities were mere fictions. Moreover, each of the two limited partnership agreements involved in this case expressly gives the corporate general partner a 50% ownership interest in each of the completed buildings. (R. 609a, 681a). These buildings are obviously valuable pieces of commercial real estate and were such at the time trial in this case was held. A 50% ownership interest in each is a valuable asset owned by each corporate general partner independent of Mr. Hall’s estate. These corporations are not, therefore, shell or dummy corporations. As a consequence of the tax and other benefits realized here, these valuable assets are <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>owned by the separate corporate general partners that had to be set up, and they do not pass directly to the estate.

The assertion is at least not inconsistent with the <em>pro formas </em>prepared by Mr. Hall for both projects prior to the signing of the limited partnership agreements. Hence, it was contended that Barry Hall's later hiring of McQuarters Management Corporation (solely owned by him) to manage the two properties after construction was complete, and the assessment of fees of 5% (and later 6%) of gross rentals to pay the Management Corporation (later succeeded by McQuarters Realty Co., Inc.) constituted improper deductions from gross partnership earnings. No claims were made, incidentally, that actual out-of-pocket maintenance expenses were improperly charged. The trial court determined that since management and maintenance fees were not expressly dealt with in the written partnership agreements themselves, that extrinsic or parole evidence was admissible to show the true intentions of the parties on the matter. In response to the contention that admission of evidence of the alleged prior oral understanding violated the parole evidence rule,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> which generally prohibits the introduction of oral testimony to vary the terms of a written agreement, the trial court held that if the parties intended the written agreement as their final expression of assent, but that it was ambiguous or silent as to a matter, that parole evidence could be admitted to interpret the instrument and explain the ambiguity or the omitted matter. <em>Parker v.

Having thus disposed of the parole evidence problem, the trial court accepted the oral testimony and concluded that the management fees (but not maintenance fees) were improperly charged, thus allowing the claims against the <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>corporate general partners which claims exceeded $330,000.00 as of 1980.</p>
    <p id="b201-4" data-blocks='[["BL_201.5",201,[230,511,1157,1070]]]'>The Superior Court affirmed holding that when the terms of a written agreement are at issue, the parole evidence rule bars the admission of oral representations made before or contemporaneously with the subject contract, only if those representations concern a matter specifically dealt with in the contract itself.

However, when the written contract is ambiguous on any point or does not accurately reflect the intent of the parties, parole evidence is admissible to shed light on these short-comings. Noting that each limited partnership agreement provided that the corporate general partner would conduct partnership affairs, the agreements also recognized that no salary would be collected for so doing. However, there was no explicit mention of fees and costs related to daily operations. Accordingly, the Superior Court thought that extrinsic evidence could be properly admitted to clarify the matter.

In exchange for exposure to only limited liability, and the tax advantages available because of the use ofo the limited partnership entity (discussed above), the limited partners must abstain from participation in the conduct of the business. Discretion to conduct the business and to make routine and normal business judgments must, therefore, rest with the general partner, and that is precisely what these agreements provided. The decision by Barry Hall to employ his solely owned management company (while he operated the two corporate general partners on account of his position as executor) may or may not have constituted sharp dealing. Nonetheless, it was well within the sound discretion of each of the corporate general partners to make such a decision in the course of their control and conduct of the partnership business. There is absolutely no showing in this record that the 5% or 6% management fees were excessive or that they exceeded fees normally charged at the time for this <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>kind of service.

The limited partners were not obligated under the partnership agreement to advance these additional monies to the partnership, but they voluntarily did so anyway. <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>See, Article IV, § 2 and Article V, § 2 of that agreement (R. 684a, 686a). Hence, the parole evidence rule does not come into play with respect to this collateral or side agreement. It is clear that this was a loan and not a gift since the monies advanced were paid back to the limited partners. The rule in Pennsylvania for over one hundred years has been that money lent bears interest without any express agreement. <em>Nicolazzo's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/414/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="414 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1890423" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0186-01">414 Pa. 186</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20455" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="199 A.2d 455">199 A.2d 455</a> (1964); <em>Borough of Port Royal v.

In other words, an agreement to pay back the loan <em>with interest </em>is presumed. While it has been argued that the consideration for this loan was solely the interest deductions for tax purposes realized by the lenders, and this was obviously a benefit realized by them, we think that it must still be presumed that the loan was to be repaid with interest as that term is ordinarily understood. Interest means interest. A written note or agreement to the contrary could easily have been entered into here if that is what the parties had intended. But how is interest to be calculated? In <em>Nicolazzo's Estate, supra, </em>this Court held that interest was to be determined by resort to § 3-118(d) of the Uniform Commercial Code. <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20455" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="199 A.2d 455">199 A.2d at 456, fn. 1</a>. § 3-118(d), in its present codification, set forth at 13 P.S. § 3118(4), provides, as did the former section, as follows:</p>

The trial court determined that the appropriate interest rate was the prime rate of eight (8%) percent, and this was based on competent written evidence in the record with respect to the comparable Green Hill-Lytle loan. We think, therefore, that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support this conclusion, and we will not disturb it. Hence, the allowance of the claim for interest due on these loans must be, and the same is hereby, affirmed.</p>

This is correct. Article V of our Constitution abolished the Orphans’ Courts of the Commonwealth and transferred their jurisdiction to the Courts of Common Pleas to be exercised through an orphans’ court division. 20 Pa.C.S. § 712 confers upon the Orphans’ Court Division broad residual and discretionary jurisdiction over all matters that are subject to resolution by courts of common pleas generally. Moreover, it is now recognized that the divisions of the common pleas courts are established essentially for purposes of administrative convenience, and that each division is vested with the full jurisdiction of the whole court. 42 Pa.C.S. § 952. Appellants now argue that failure to transfer the matter back to the Civil Division was an abuse of discretion. There is no merit to this argument, since the administrators of this estate, who because of their status as administrators, were also directors and officers of the corporate general partners, were directly interested in the outcome of this litigation. Even if it would have been preferable to transfer this matter back to the Civil Division, this Court is simply not going to review, on the merits, every decision made at the trial level to transfer or not transfer a matter from one division of the Common Pleas Court to another once a trial or hearing has begun. That is one reason why each division now has been given full plenary jurisdiction. Moreover, it is clear that no point would be served whatsoever at this stage in re-trying this case in another division. There was no abuse of discretion in this ruling that we can detect.</p>

Absent proof of facts not in the record, Mr. Horowitz was not a witness whose interest was adverse to Mr. Hall's under the Dead Man's Act.

As explained above, the parties took great care to confine the power of each corporate general partner during the construction phase of each project. No such restrictions were imposed for the post-completion period however. Express limitations on management fees, or even an escalation clause to take inflationary increases in costs into account, could have been included in the written documents. None were. The courts are not generally available to rewrite agreements or make up special provisions for parties who fail to anticipate forseeable problems. Such parties are bound by the agreements they, in fact, make. It would be unreasonable for the parties to have assumed that Mr. Hall himself would live forever or that he would necessarily manage these properties himself ten or fifteen years later. It was also unreasonable to assume then (or claim now) that somewhere down the road Mr. Hall or his successor would not have to incur management fees or hire someone to manage the property. Not having anticipated these issues, and dealt with them, the parties are bound by the general delegation of management power expressly set forth in the partnership agreements. Claimants could, of course, have taken steps to dissolve the partnership when they found that the management fees were being charged, but they did not do so (presumably for tax reasons). Absent exercise of this escape hatch, Claimants were bound by the otherwise beneficial agreements they made. In <em>McWilliams v.
