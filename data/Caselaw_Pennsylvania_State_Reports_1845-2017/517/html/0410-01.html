The latter order dismissed appellant’s <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>exceptions to an order of the Orphans’ Court Division staying the sale of real estate to him and permitting the sale to a subsequent offeror.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[219,488,1152,370]]]'>The facts are these. Bernard R. Hughes died intestate on September 5, 1984. He was survived by four (4) children, who became his heirs-at-law: Nancy Hughes Solomon, Virginia A. Hughes, Bernard R. Hughes, Jr., and Richard W. Hughes. Letters of administration were issued to Nancy Hughes Solomon. The estate consisted of personalty of less than $10,000 and a house in Pittsburgh.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[218,891,1152,424]]]'>On December 21, 1984, Mrs. Solomon, acting in her capacity as administratrix, entered into a sales agreement with appellant for the sale of the house. The agreed purchase price was $42,000. Prior to accepting this offer she had obtained appraisals of $40,000 and $39,500. The agreement of sale provided that the sale was, “subject to approval of Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pa. of waiver or of posting of bond”.</p>

Her brothers appeared and petitioned the court to stay the proposed sale. They introduced a subsequent offer for the house, dated January 5, 1985, in the amount of $60,000. The offer was subject to a mortgage contingency of $54,-000, a broker’s fee of $4,200, and approval of the Orphans’ Court Division. On January 23, 1985, the court entered an order continuing the disposition of the administratrix’s original petition, and authorizing her to accept the subsequent higher offer by executing an agreement of sale for the estate property subject to the approval of the court. A sales agreement was executed with the subsequent offeror, John T. Haretos, on January 24, 1985, and the mortgage contingency was subsequently removed. Notice was then provided to appellant who filed exceptions to the order. The common pleas court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>issued an order sustaining in part appellant’s exceptions, but granted leave to the administratrix and/or her brother, Richard W. <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>Hughes, to file a petition in the Orphans’ Division requesting the restraint of the sale to appellant.</p>
