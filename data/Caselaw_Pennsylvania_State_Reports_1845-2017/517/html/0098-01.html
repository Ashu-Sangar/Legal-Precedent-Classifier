Appellee was employed as an apprentice machinist by Heppenstall Company, a Pittsburgh based steel manufacturer. On March 15, 1974, while attempting to loosen a tightly fastened machine bolt, appellee lost his footing, fell on the machine’s steel platform and struck his right knee. Appellee was taken to a local hospital for x-rays and released that same day. After the intervening weekend appellee attempted to resume work, but was forced to abandon the job because of pain to his knee. The following day appellee was seen by a physician and given a cortisone injection to relieve the pain. At the time of this treatment the diagnosis was arthritis.</p>

The facts in <em>Morgan </em>were that the claimant experienced severe back pain while unloading a truck. The issue was whether the claimant's description of pain was enough to establish an "injury." Significantly, the Court was not faced with the question of whether that injury was disabling. This distinction is critical to an understanding of the proper application of <em>Morgan. </em>For instance, in the context of this case appellee fell at work and struck his knee. At that time he experienced pain, and he was injured. The question, however, is not merely whether claimant was injured, but whether that injury caused him to be disabled; and where the causal connection between the injury and the <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>disability is not obvious, more is required than a claimant's subjective testimony.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[223,474,1157,961]]]'>There is a difference between an injury and its consequences, and tracing those consequences is often beyond the skill and experience of laymen since the answers can lay in complicated etiologies known only to experts. For example, if a man falls at work and cuts his arm he will not normally need medical testimony to prove that he was <em>injured </em>at work. But if a man claims that the injury to his arm rendered his hand worthless then medical testimony will generally be required to support such a claim since the relationship of the arm muscles to the function of the hand is not a subject about which lay witnesses can normally testify with expertise. To obviate the need for expert diagnosis regarding the consequence of an injury would be to make every man his own physician, a privilege that wise men do not exercise. Certainly no system can support the cost of what many men suppose or believe is a consequence of their injury. Neither should those suffering consequences be deprived upon inexpert lay beliefs.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[220,1455,1153,421]]]'>In the present case Mr. Cardyn’s claim went far beyond a mere claim that he was injured at work. He claimed that the injury was of such a degree that it required the surgery which ultimately led to his fused knee, thereby constituting a disability. The connection between Mr. Cardyn’s injury and his ultimate claim was certainly not obvious, especially in light of the extensive medical history concerning the subject knee. That medical history is summarized below.</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[218,1895,1154,367]],["BL_171.1",171,[213,340,1151,198]]]'>Approximately fifteen years prior to his fall appellee first experienced problems with his knees. In 1958, Herbert R. Tauberg, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, began treating appellee for an injury he sustained to his right knee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Over the years it was not uncommon for appellee to complain of pain in his knees. The pain reached such a degree that in September, 1970 Dr. Tauberg performed a patellectomy to <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>remove appellee’s right knee cap. At the time of this particular surgical procedure there was evidence of a moderate amount of deterioration in the knee attendant to the natural degenerative aging process.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[209,556,1156,821]]]'>Beginning in 1971, and up through 1973, Dr. Tauberg saw appellee anywhere from two to six times per year to administer cortisone treatments and anti-inflammatory medications to relieve some of the pain and inflammation due to the arthritic change that was present in the knee joint. It was during this period, in 1972, that Dr. Tauberg first recommended that appellee consent to the total knee replacement surgery for his right knee. Appellee resisted and continued to work. Again in 1973, appellee returned to Dr. Tauberg with further problems with the right knee and again the surgery was rejected by appellee. The next time Dr. Tauberg saw appellee was following the work-related incident of March 15, 1974, at which time appellee was told that there was little else that could be done for him outside of the knee operation. The surgery was finally performed on July 26, 1974.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[205,1400,1156,509]]]'>The facts here are undisputed that the surgery which Mr. Cardyn had after the work-related injury was that which had already been prescribed for him prior to the injury. This is not to say that Mr. Cardyn’s fall could not have caused the need for the surgery, only that the cause was not obvious. Thus this case is not similar to <em>Morgan, <a href="/pa/483/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="483 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1751227" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0421-01">supra,</a> </em>and the Commonwealth Court’s reliance on that case was misplaced.
