The Insurance Commissioner\u2019s suspension order of May 29, 1979, and the Commonwealth Court\u2019s dissolution and liquidation order of April 21, 1982, precluded the institution or further prosecution of actions against Safeguard Mutual Insurance Company. Common Pleas Court was therefore without jurisdiction to entertain this matter.",
