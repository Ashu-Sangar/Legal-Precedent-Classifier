We reject this argument because trial counsel was acting in an attempt to minimize evidence that would have sounded against Appellant. Appellant cites several different records of various mental infirmities in both his youth and adult life. Testimony from the PCRA hearing <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>indicates that these reports were the product of psychological examinations of Appellant as a result of criminal activity, such as pre-sentence reports prepared following Appellant’s earlier convictions.

Dr. Camile’s reports stated that Appellant did not appear “to be motivated to explore or examine his behavior in a therapeutic context.” N.T. 12/14/95, at 42. Thus it appears that trial counsel attempted, during the penalty phase, to present evidence in a manner that would not be more damaging than it was mitigating. Appellant’s mother and grandmother indicated that Appellant had a troubled childhood and history of anti-social behavior. Had Dr. O’Brien been presented to establish the same point, counsel would have risked portraying Appellant as a long-term, unrepentant, drug addicted, increasingly dangerous menace to society.</p>

To repeat, if you find one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance, your verdict will be death. If you find no aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances, the sentence will be life. If you find one aggravating and one mitigating, it will be life. If you find more aggravating circumstances than you find mitigating circumstances, then the penalty will be death.</blockquote>

The heightened standard he refers to arises from the <em>Buehl </em>plurality opinion’s differing treatment of ineffective assistance claims raised under the PCRA as against ineffective assistance claims raised on direct appeal. The authority he cites as finding the heightened standard improper is <em>Buehl v. Vaughn, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20752959" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="1996 WL 752959">1996 WL 752959</a> (E.D.Pa.1996).
