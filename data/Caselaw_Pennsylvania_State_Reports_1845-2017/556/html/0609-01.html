The character witnesses appearing on Respondent’s behalf included religious leaders, prominent attorneys, court reporters, clients, friends and neighbors. Their praise was extensive. The Hearing Committee found this testimony impressive and relied on it in recommending a twenty-four month suspension. Although the Disciplinary Board discounted the character testimony, finding that the witnesses had no perception of the extent of Respondent's criminal actions, we find it relevant. Our Court has held that we may be enlightened by the decisions of the triers of fact who had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses during their testimony. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

In <em>Holston, </em>the respondent forged a judge’s name on a fabricated divorce decree in an attempt to cover up his failure to competently represent his client in the divorce. When questioned about the divorce decree, the respondent lied to the judge, telling him that he did not know how he got the document. However, shortly thereafter, the respondent consulted with an attorney, realized the gravity of his misconduct, and informed the judge that he was responsible for forging his signature on the divorce decree. In mitigation, the respondent argued that he was under extreme personal and financial pressures, that once he realized his error he admitted his misconduct to the judge, that he had fully admitted his wrongdoings, and that he was active in his church and community. Given the egregious nature of Holstoris misconduct, however, the Court found that the only appropriate form of discipline that would protect both the integrity of the bar and the administration of justice was disbarment. In reaching this conclusion, the Court stated that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b737-4" data-blocks='[["BL_737.5",737,[266,1396,1112,365]]]'>Respondent acted dishonestly and has demonstrated his unfitness to continue practicing law.

Respondent’s lying to the court and dishonesty in forging a court order are the antithesis of these requirements. Accordingly, we deem disbarment to be the appropriate remedy in this case....</blockquote>

If anything, I believe that Respondent’s misconduct may be more egregious than the misconduct that resulted in Holston’s disbarment, because Respondent committed his misconduct over an extended period of time, <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>and because Respondent directed his own mother, as her attorney, to perjure herself and open herself to potential criminal liability. Although Respondent decided to correct his mother’s perjurious testimony soon after her appearance before the grand jury, and thereafter cooperated fully with the authorities’ investigation into his collusion with Dr. Moses, Respondent has nevertheless dealt a serious blow to both the standing and integrity of the bar and the administration of justice. Therefore, I cannot concur in the Majority’s conclusion that a five-year suspension is appropriate in the instant case. Instead, in accordance with the Report and Recommendation of the Disciplinary Board issued on August 28, 1998, I would disbar Respondent retroactive to the date of his temporary suspension on February 24,1995.</p>
