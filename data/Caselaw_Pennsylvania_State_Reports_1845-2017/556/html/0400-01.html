Furthermore, this particular indict<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>ment consistently made headline news in all <em>area </em>media until its dismissal, at which point Appellant was re-indicted, re-prosecuted and again the focus of a barrage of adverse media attention.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[266,555,1162,1099]]]'>A police officer is accountable for his actions in the line of duty and his actions are properly the subject of a formal investigation. However, the uncontradicted testimony of police officers testifying for Appellant and the City that the two separate indictments and the prosecution amount to abnormal working conditions satisfies the burden requirements as set forth in <em>Gulick. </em>Specifically, “actual extraordinary events which can be pinpointed in time” are clearly demonstrated by the indictments and prosecution, and “abnormal working conditions” are demonstrated through indictment, dismissal, re-indictment and ongoing adverse media coverage, over a longer period of time. <em>Gulick, </em><a href="/a2d/711/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="711 A.2d 585" data-case-ids="11824366" data-case-paths="/a2d/711/0585-01">711 A.2d at 587</a>. Furthermore, I cannot subscribe to the assertion that the foregoing events are merely “tangentially” related to Appellant’s employment as, but for his employment as a police officer and his participation in the “normal” events of June 1992, he would not have been a defendant in the subsequent indictments nor the object of media attention. In addition, his potential future employment as a police officer was inextricably entwined with the outcome of those year-long events.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[267,1696,1162,651]]]'>The Commonwealth Court erred in declining to find abnormal working conditions based on the determination that indictments and public outcry are not “outside the realm of possibility.” This is an incorrect statement of the standard for finding abnormal working conditions as articulated in <em>Blecker </em>and <em>Hart </em>and recently reiterated in <em>Gulick. </em>The measure of working conditions is whether they are “abnormal,” not whether they are within the “realm of possibility” for that job. Appellant has met his burden of showing, by substantial evidence, that abnormal working conditions gave rise to his mental disability and that he thereby qualifies for compensation under the mental/mental paradigm.</p>

      <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
