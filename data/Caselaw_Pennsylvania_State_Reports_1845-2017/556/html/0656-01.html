The court noted that a district attorney, as a county employee, participates in the county pension plan in accordance with the County Pension Law, see 16 P.S. § 11652(2), and that the legislature did not change the County Pension Law when it established the district attorney’s compensation at $1,000 lower than a judge’s compensation.

In June of 1890, however, the most recent federal census showed the county as having a population in excess of 150,000. The Act of March 31, 1876, established that “in counties containing over 150,000 inhabitants, all county officers shall be paid by salary” and Section 14 of that Act set the salary of the coroner in counties having between 150,000 and 250,000 inhabitants at $500.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In January of 1891, the county failed to pay Guldin fees of $267.50, and Guldin sued.</p>

Woodring was elected commissioner of Northampton County in November of 1919 and assumed office in January of 1920. The federal census completed in December of 1920 certified the population of the county as being 153,560, which figure was set forth in a gubernatorial proclamation in March of 1921. Previously, the county population had been less than 150,000. Woodring claimed that under the Acts of June 7, 1917, P.L. 570 and May 10, 1909, P.L. 500, he was entitled to the $4,000 salary set for a commissioner of a county having more than 150,000 inhabitants rather than the $2,500 salary set for smaller counties.</p>

Eakin states that although the district attorney was included in the list of county officers that the 1985 ordinance was made applicable to, the district attorney was not included at all in the 1989 ordinance, which provided annual salary increases for all other county officers. This action, he argues, was in violation of Section 2 of Act 82 of 1979, 16 P.S, § 11011-10.1, the legislation that gave county commissioners the power to fix the salaries of county officers.

Thus, whether or not he is <a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>entitled to a percentage increase is governed solely by Ordinance 89-1; Ordinance 85-2 has no application to the time period for which Eakin seeks said increases. Significantly, Ordinance 89-1 became effective on February 9, 1989 and specifically excluded the district attorney from the list of county officers to which it applied. On May 15, 1989, one month before Eakin was appointed full-time district attorney, the Cumberland County commissioners passed Ordinance 89-3, whereby they authorized the appointment of a full-time district attorney in accordance with their authority under Section 1401(g) of the County Code, 16 P.S. § 1401(g), and further set the full-time district attorney’s salary as $1,000 less than that of the common pleas court judges, also in accord with Section 1401(g) of the County Code.

Obviously, the district attorney was not included by the Commissioners in the list of officers entitled to a percentage increase since they separately set forth the salary of the district attorney in Ordinance 89-3. The commissioners, unquestionably, had the authority, by way of the County Code, to do so and Eakin fails to address the propriety of their action in this regard.
