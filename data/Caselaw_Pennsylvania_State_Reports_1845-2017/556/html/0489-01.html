    <p id="b613-9" data-blocks='[["BL_613.9",613,[228,939,1152,798]]]'>This is an appeal by Coldwell Banker Real Estate (Coldwell Banker) from an Order of the Superior Court, which affirmed the determination of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Chancellor). Coldwell Banker was held liable to the buyer of residential property for a misrepresentation made by its agent relating to a third party’s repairs of the on-site sewage disposal system (septic system) located on the property. Coldwell Banker raises the sole issue of whether the actions of its agent amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Superior Court and hold that a real estate broker cannot be liable for the misrepresentation of its agent, innocently made, under circumstances where the agent had no reason to know that her statement was false, and the agent had no duty to verify the accuracy of the third party report.</p>

Bortz (the Buyer) and his former wife entered into an Agreement of Sale with Patrick J. Noon and Virginia R. Noon (collectively Sellers), to buy the Sellers’ home on Woodland Road in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Coldwell Banker, through its agent, Renee Valent (the Agent), was the selling agent for the property. The Buyer had used the Agent as a selling agent for his previous home, and testified at the hearing of this matter that he considered the Agent as his representative for the Woodland Road transac<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>tion. For the purchase of the Woodland ■ Road home, the Agent referred the Buyer to' a lender, Coldwell Banker Residential Mortgage Services, Inc. (the Lender). There is no evidence to suggest that the Lender was affiliated with Cold-well Banker. For the Buyer to receive a mortgage commitment from the Lender, the septic system had to pass a dye test before closing, and the Agent informed the Buyer that the septic system needed to pass this test before the closing. The Agent referred the Buyer to a contractor to conduct the test. On August 14, 1986, the contractor performed the dye test, and the septic system failed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The contractor told the Agent that the septic system failed the dye test and the Agent- then informed the Buyer. The Agent did not give the Buyer a copy of this report, and apparently, the Buyer did not ask for one.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[251,1073,1157,682]]]'>Following the failed dye test, the Agent told the Buyer that the Sellers had the option of repairing the septic system, and they had chosen another contractor, J.J. Nolte (Nolte), to do the work. There is no evidence that the Agent had any dealings with Nolte nor played any part in the selection of Nolte as a contractor. The Agent informed the Buyer that settlement would be delayed until a dye test was successful. The Buyer argues that the Agent represented to him that the problem with the septic system would be repaired. During the period that Nolte was working on the septic system, the Buyer and his father-in-law went to the home, observed Nolte, and seemingly had the opportunity to ask questions about the repairs to the septic system.</p>

(the Titlé Company) told the Agent that “the dye test passed and now we can set closing.” (N.T. 7/7/94 at 51) The Agent conveyed this information to the Buyer, <em>(Id. </em>at 52) and then set a settlement closing date. Neither the Agent nor the Buyer reviewed a written Nolte report evidencing a satisfactory dye test. The closing on the house was on September 26, 1986, at the offices of the Title Company, but apparently, the proceedings were delayed for <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>ten to twenty minutes. The Agent believed that the closing was delayed because of “Mr. Nolte’s inspection—you know, everything was supposed to be fíne a week before the closing, so I assume they had this paperwork.” (N.T. at 56) In addition, the Agent testified that she believed that the County was inspecting Nolte’s work on the day of closing, and she in turn told the Buyer that the County would inspect the septic system. <em>(Id.)</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[229,744,1154,791]]]'>When the closing finally occurred, the settlement officer from the Title Company, Christopher Abernathy, told everyone present, including the Agent and the Buyer, that the dye test on the septic system had passed. Apparently, however, neither the Agent nor the Buyer was given any written materials to verify this statement, and neither asked to review the report. Following the closing, the Buyer and his former wife discovered that the septic tank had not actually passed a dye test. In fact, the former wife of the Buyer testified that she received a call from the Title Company and was advised that it had “forgotten to do the dye test.” (7/5/94 N.T. at 106) The Title Company then scheduled a new dye test for October 22, 1986. The septic system failed the test and the system could not be repaired. The only alternative was to connect into the public sewer system at a cost of more than $15,000.</p>

The Buyer claimed that all defendants made affirmative misstatements regarding repairs on the septic system and reported that the septic system was functioning properly. The Sellers joined Nolte. After a hearing in the matter, the Chancellor entered an order in favor of the Buyer and against Coldwell Banker, concluding that Coldwell Banker, “through [its agent], made material misrepresentations to [the Buyer] by failing to disclose the conflicting septic test results and making affirmative representations that the septic system was repaired and prop- ■ erly functioning.” (Chancellor’s opinion at 9) The Chancellor denied a recision of the sale, but entered a decree nisi in favor of the Buyer and against Coldwell Banker for $15,300 plus <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>pre-judgment interest. The Chancellor held that neither Nolte nor the Title Company owed a duty to the Buyer and thus could not be liable for misrepresentation. Coldwell Banker filed motions for post-trial relief, alleging that it could not be liable for misrepresentation, which the trial court denied. Coldwell Banker then filed an appeal to the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[254,685,1162,739]]]'>On the appeal of Coldwell Banker, the Superior Court affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the Chancellor. The Superior Court agreed with the conclusion of the Chancellor that Coldwell Banker was liable to the Buyer for misrepresentation because the Agent had a duty to ascertain whether the septic system had actually passed the dye test, and her failure to do so constituted a misrepresentation under the circumstances of this case. However, the Superior Court reversed the finding of the Chancellor regarding Nolte and the Title Company, and held that both could be liable to the Buyer for misrepresentation. Judge Johnson dissented. While Judge Johnson agreed that Nolte and the Title Company were liable to the Buyer for misrepresentation, he disagreed that Coldwell Banker was hable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Coldwell Banker further asserts that at most the Agent made a statement concerning a future event that the septic system <em>would be </em>repaired, a statement that can not support a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[224,601,1152,691]]]'>The Buyer counters that the Agent indeed misrepresented material facts when she misrepresented that the dye test was clear, <em>coupled with </em>a promise of a future event that the septic system would pass a dye test and function properly before closing. Moreover, she scheduled and attended the closing; failed to advise the Buyer that she was unaware of whether the original representation was actually true; and failed to ascertain whether the facts originally represented continued to be true. Thus, the Agent is liable for misrepresenting a material fact on which the Buyer relied in closing on the property. Therefore, she had a duty both to correct this misrepresentation and to disclose the report of Nolte to the Buyer.</p>

In particular, the Agent testified that in the days preceding the closing, she told the Buyer that the septic system had passed the dye test. (N.T. 7/7/94 at 50-51) This representation was not accurate, and was followed by conduct that reinforced the affirmative statement that the septic system had passed the dye test. The Agent set up the closing date, which strengthened the perception that the septic system was acceptable because the mortgage could not be approved without such a test. Additionally, at the closing, the proceedings were delayed on the assumption the dye test information was delivered to the closing. These acts, together with the affirmative statement of the Agent before the closing, support the determination of the Chancellor that the Agent made an affirmative misrepresentation.

In his Adjudication of the matter, the Chancellor discussed Section 323 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, apparently concluding that the Agent had assumed a <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>duty to the Buyer. (Chancellor’s Adjudication at 8). In denying post-trial motions, the Chancellor opined that the Agent “so positioned [herself] as to be liable to the Buyer in money damages” (Chancellor’s Opinion denying post-trial relief at 4) and “had the duty to be sure that when the closing of title occurred the circumstances conformed with the Buyer’s expectations or risk the consequences.” <em>(Id. </em>at 5.)

      <em>(Id. </em>at 6) The Superior Court essentially agreed with the Chancellor and determined that the Agent and Coldwell Banker were liable to the Buyer because the Agent had a duty to make an independent inquiry to determine whether the septic tank actually had passed the dye test, by reviewing either the report herself, or checking County records.</p>

First, there was no testimony or introduction of other evidence to establish that in 1986, the standard of care in the real estate brokerage business required an agent independently to verify or disclose test results that the broker had not ordered and were not part of the sales purchase agreement.

Third, there was no special relationship among the Buyer, the Agent, the Title Company and the Lender that would require the Agent to undertake such investigation, or that would place the Agent in a superior position to the Buyer in verifying the accuracy of the third party reports of the dye test. <em>See, e.g., Morena v.

However, we decline to extend these equitable principles to establish legal tort liability for an innocent misrepresentation of the Agent, where she had no duty to ascertain the accuracy of test results of a third party with whom she had no agency or other relationship. Such strict liability would place too high a burden on the real estate broker.</p>

Coldwell Banker represents that <em>the </em>courts below based liability on the notion that the Agent had misrepresented facts by sitting silently at the closing and that she was held liable under a "failure to disclose” theory of misrepresentation. While the Superior Court’s Opinion is unclear, the Chancellor’s adjudication clearly states that he found that the Agent had made <em>affirmative </em>misrepresentations.</p>

In footnote 3 of its brief, Coldwell Banker argues that the Buyer chose to proceed under a theory of fraudulent misrepresentation only. The Record does not support this assertion as the Complaint does not delineate the claim as one for intentional, negligent or innocent misrepresentation, and the legal conclusions of the Chancellor specifically reference and discuss negligent misrepresentation and the assumption of duty under Section 323 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Moreover, the Buyer submitted to the Chancellor findings of fact and conclusions of law, which clearly reference all three forms of misrepresentation. Accordingly, we will address all three.</p>

In <em>Renaut, </em>the Superior Court held that "where a broker employed to sell real estate misrepresents or conceals a material fact, he may be found liable to the purchaser in damages.” The issue in Renaut was whether the real estate broker was liable to the buyer of the property for misrepresenting the extent of termite damage in a home, and caused the buyer not to conduct an inspection of the premises. Also at issue was the existence of a carcinogen in the well. The Superior Court held that the broker could be liable for the failure to disclose termite damage, but not for the carcinogen. It appears from the facts presented in that opinion that the real estate broker was charged with knowing that the termite damage was actually more extensive than represented, and that the broker failed to disclose known damage. The broker could not have known about the carcinogen in the well, and was not liable for his failure to disclose it.</p>

I am unable, however, to subscribe to the majority’s broad holding that, absent' a contractual relationship, a real estate broker has no legal duty to verify factual representations made to a purchaser. In the typical residential real estate transaction, the selling broker, having a pecuniary interest in the consummation of a sale, frequently cultivates reliance by the purchaser upon its professional expertise, representing itself as an accurate source of vital information. <em>See generally </em>

It would seem unjust to permit brokers to profit from such arrangements, yet escape any accountability to the purchaser for negligent conduct for the sole reason that their relationship with the buyer is not based in contract. Indeed, as the majority acknowledges, many jurisdictions authorize a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation against a real estate broker without requiring a demonstration of privity. <em>See, e.g., Mahler v.
