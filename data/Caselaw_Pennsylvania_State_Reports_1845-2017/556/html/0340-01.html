J.K.’s caretaker also testified that J.K. had mentioned the assaults, without providing any detail. Finally, the two detectives who interviewed Appellant testified that Appellant admitted to “rubbing” J.K’s vagina and to lying on top of J.K. and “grinding.” According to the detectives, Appellant also indicated that his penis may have “got her,” but did not penetrate her.</p>
