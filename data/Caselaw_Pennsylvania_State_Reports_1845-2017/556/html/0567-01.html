Article III is preceded by Article II, which is entitled “The Legislature,” and which declares in Section 1 that “[t]he legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” Article III, entitled “Legislation,” specifies the procedures by which the General Assembly shall enact legislation. For example, Section 1 provides that “[n]o law shall be passed except by bill, and no bill shall be so altered or amended, on its passage through either House, as to change its original purpose.” Article III is thus “an authorization and limitation of the legislation <em>of the [C]ommonwealth.” Commonwealth v.

Section 11 was in pertinent part identical to its successor; and Section 13 provided, as Section 27 does now, that “[n]o law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments, after his election or appointment.” Appellants, a majority of the Commissioners of Allegheny County, argued that receipt of full retirement pay by employees who retired shortly before the Act went into effect, and who had necessarily made few payments into the retirement system, constituted an unconstitutional increase in compensation.

Nevertheless, when several of the assessments proved uncollectible, Samuel W. Harbold, a bondholder, sued the City in assumpsit, basing, his claim in part on the Act of May 26, 1943, P.L. 660. This “validating statute” provided that whenever, prior to January 1, 1942, a municipal corporation had issued bonds for the payment of the cost of a public improvement on the assumption that such bonds were not debts of the municipality, “such bonds and obligations are hereby ratified, confirmed and made valid and binding obligations and debts of <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>the municipality.” The trial court awarded judgment to the plaintiff.</p>

The purported authority for the Commissioners’ action was Section 605 of the Act of May 27, 1949, P.L.1955, which provided, in pertinent part, that “[a] township may, by ordinance, provide as compensation to employes [of a certain age and term of service] a proportion of the compensation last paid to them.... ” When the succeeding Board of Commissioners rescinded the ordinance, the retired employee filed a complaint in mandamus to compel the Township to fund his pension. The trial court sustained the Township’s preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint.</p>

This Court found it unnecessary to address that argument, noting that the Act authorized townships to provide retirement pay to a certain category of employees, not—as Ordinance No. 361 had done—to one employee. It was the challenged ordinance itself, the Court concluded, that was <em>ultra vires, </em>as it “offendfed] against” both the Act and Section 7 of Article IX of the state Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 79, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="92 A.2d 892">92 A.2d at 893</a>.
