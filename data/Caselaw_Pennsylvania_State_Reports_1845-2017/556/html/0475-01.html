The State Board of Dentistry is a professional licensing board within the Bureau responsible for the investigation and discipline of Pennsylvania’s dentists pursuant to The Dental Law, 63 P.S. § 121 et seq. In response to the issuance of the subpoena, the Bureau filed a Motion to Quash Subpoena and for Protective Order. The Bureau asserted that the information subpoenaed was privileged and not subject to discovery. The privileges asserted included governmental/executive privilege and privilege under the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. § 66.1 et seq. The Bureau also asserted that the subpoenaed information included medical records of persons who were not involved .in the lawsuit and purported to assert the doctor-patient privilege on behalf of those unidentified persons.

Thus, in <em>Frankenhauser v. Rizzo, </em><a href="/frd/59/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="59 F.R.D. 339" data-case-ids="6464124" data-case-paths="/frd/59/0339-01">59 F.R.D. 339</a> (E.D.Pa.1973), the federal court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania defined the “executive privilege” as “the government’s privilege to prevent disclosure of certain information whose disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.” This privilege, however, is not absolute but qualified; and when asserted, requires the court to balance the government’s interest in ensuring the secrecy of the documents whose discovery is sought against the need of the private litigant to obtain discovery of relevant materials in possession of the government.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[269,747,1114,1043]]]'>The fact that the legislature excluded certain documents from public inspection does not mean that the legislature intended to bar the use of such information in judicial proceedings. The purpose of the Right to Know Law was to make certain information available to members of the public. Whether information should be made available for use in court proceedings involves entirely different considerations ____We ... hold that the Right to Know Law does not bar a party in a civil action from discovering relevant information from the files of a government agency. To hold otherwise, would insulate from discovery all information possessed by governmental agencies, no matter how relevant the information might be, unless the same information were also available upon request to any and all citizens of the Commonwealth. Such a result clearly was not contemplated by the legislature when it enacted the Right to Know Law. Indeed, such a result would not only emasculate the discovery provisions of the rules of civil procedure, but would also represent an unsound departure from established law.</blockquote>

In the context of this litigation, the court concluded that the privacy interests of third parties were not offended by requiring the production of the subpoenaed documents. Furthermore, the court concluded that, if necessary, a means of ensuring confidentiality and protecting the dental patients’ anonymity could be implemented through in camera inspection or otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[225,871,1160,1014]]]'>The Bureau presents no compelling argument why a broad prohibition against discovery of materials is required to protect the privacy interest, if any, of dental patients where other less restrictive means are available. The Bureau merely asserts that the records and information relating to other dental patients are not related to the Bens’ cause of action. This argument questions only the relevancy of the requested information, and does not address the issues of whether a privacy interest in the nondisclosure of dental records should be recognized, and, if so, whether such privacy interest would be violated by disclosure of the information subpoenaed in this case. We are unpersuaded by the Bureau’s argument for an absolute prohibition against discovery of the investigative files on the basis of a right to privacy. Furthermore, it would be unwise to address the right to privacy claim in the absence of a fully developed record in this case, and in view of the settlement of the Bens’ claim against Dr. Schwartz after the common pleas court had issued its ruling on the Bureau’s motion to quash the subpoena.</p>
