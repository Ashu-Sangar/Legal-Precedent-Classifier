Mother and Husband remain married, and they oppose Appellant’s claim. The Superior Court concluded that in such circumstances the presumption does indeed bar Appellant from asserting such claim. We affirm.</p>

In the complaint, Appellant asserted that he <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>is Amanda’s father; that Mother had acknowledged his paternity, ensured that he enjoyed frequent visits with Amanda, and sometimes entrusted Amanda to his care; and that he, Mother, and Amanda had submitted to blood tests, the results of which disclosed a 99.99% probability that he was Amanda’s father. Appellant also alleged that since receiving the blood test results, Mother had interfered with his relationship with Amanda. In view of the bond that existed between him and Amanda, Appellant asserted, it would be in the child’s best interests if he were granted partial custody of her.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[229,888,1159,529]]]'>Mother filed preliminary objections in which she sought the dismissal of Appellant’s complaint on the basis of the presumption that Amanda was a child of the Stahrs’ marriage (also known as the presumption of legitimacy, or of Husband’s paternity). Husband filed a petition to intervene, which was granted. He then filed preliminary objections seeking, as had Mother, to have Appellant’s complaint dismissed based on the presumption of paternity. He also asserted that Appellant was equitably estopped from asserting paternity, as he had not financially or emotionally supported the child.</p>

Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that Mother, having held Amanda out to be Appellant’s child and having voluntarily submitted to blood testing for the purpose of determining paternity, was equitably estopped from contesting Amanda’s paternity. The court then decided to admit the blood test results over Husband’s objection and, on the basis of those results, concluded that the presumption of legitimacy had been overcome. Accordingly, the court directed that a hearing be held “on what is best for the child.”</p>

The Superior Court concluded that, in view of the fact that the Stahr family remained intact and Husband had assumed parental responsibility for Amanda, the presumption of paternity in Husband’s favor was irrebuttable. Therefore, the court reasoned, the blood test results should not have been admitted into evidence. The court reversed the trial court’s order and dismissed Appellant’s complaint with prejudice. We granted allocatur to consider whether the presumption of paternity applied in the present case.</p>

Moreover, for medical and other reasons, it may very well be in the best interests of Amanda to know the identity of her biological father. It is simply unreasonable, in my view, to preclude the trial court from considering the interests of those involved and the evidence of the blood tests solely on the basis of a presumption that is no longer reflective of today’s social reality.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[234,1128,1157,247]]]'>For these reasons, I believe the trial court properly admitted the blood test results into evidence and directed that a hearing be held on the issue of what is best for Amanda. Thus, I would reverse the Superior Court and affirm the order of the trial court.</p>

The couple has three children, all born during the marriage. The custody dispute that underlies this suit involves the youngest of these three children. The record indicates that April Stahr, at one time, acknowledged that Mr. Strauser, not her husband, was this child’s father and allowed Mr. Strauser frequent visits with the child. April, the child and Mr. Strauser even submitted to voluntary blood tests, which show a 99.9% probability that Mr. Strauser is the child’s father. Mr. Strauser filed a complaint against April <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>Stahr seeking partial custody of his daughter after April began to interfere with his visitation with the child. April’s husband, Steven, intervened in the action and requested that the complaint be dismissed because of the presumption that he was the child’s father. The trial court overruled Mr. Stahr’s objections, admitted the blood test evidence and ordered a hearing to determine what custody arrangement was in the best interests of the child. The Stahrs filed their appeal of this determination before the trial court could hold the custody hearing.</p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[224,884,1153,800]]]'>The core issues involved in this appeal are whether the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss Mr. Strauser’s complaint based on the “presumption of paternity” in favor of Mr. Stahr and whether the court erred in admitting genetic blood test evidence to rebut that presumption. In order to determine whether the presumption of paternity attaches to a particular case, we must first decide if the case properly advances the purpose of the presumption. <em>Brinkley v. King, </em><a href="/pa/549/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="549 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="17551" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0241-01">549 Pa. 241</a>, 260-61, <a href="/a2d/701/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="701 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="11891736,17551" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0176-01,/pa/549/0241-01">701 A.2d 176</a>, 185-86 (1997). Here, I agree that the presumption of paternity applies because the purpose of the presumption is indicated in the facts before us—specifically that the Stahrs’ marriage is currently, and at all relevant times has been, intact. <em><a href="/a2d/701/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="701 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="11891736,17551" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0176-01,/pa/549/0241-01">Id.,</a> </em>(Newman J. concurring and dissenting statement)(purpose of presumption is limited to preservation of the marriage).</p>
