After a flood on May 30, 1986 damaged the properties that secured the loans, the O’Donoghues were informed by Laurel officials that assistance in rebuilding efforts would be provided. The O’Donoghues subsequently applied to the Small Business Administration for a $500,000 disaster loan to finance repairs to the restaurant.</p>

Ott, Laurel’s vice-president, about how to bring payments on the mortgaged properties current. Mr. O’Donoghue indicated that he requested additional funding from Laurel for completion of renovations to the restaurant to get into full operation. Mr. O’Donoghue also spoke to Laurel officials, including Mr. Ott, about assistance in restructuring the loan <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>obligations to Laurel so that the O’Donoghues could obtain SBA financing.</p>
    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[266,419,1158,528]]]'>On February 9, 1988, Laurel advised the O’Donoghues that it would restructure the mortgages for the three earlier loans by,extending the maturities of the notes secured by those mortgages. Additional security was required and a cross default clause connecting all of the encumbered property was to be inserted in the new mortgages. The O’Donoghues agreed to the restructuring of the mortgages. Mr. O’Donoghue had several meetings with Mr. Ott in the months before the closing date of June 2, 1988 to sign papers in preparation for the restructuring.</p>

The notes were secured by mortgages on the restaurant property and other properties of the O’Donoghues. The O’Donoghues understood that the proceeds of the loans were to be used to pay off and satisfy the three earlier loans. The proceeds were in fact applied to pay off the obligations of the loans.</p>
    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.7",484,[266,1474,1156,528]]]'>In their amended complaint, the O’Donoghues asserted that it was further agreed that Laurel would satisfy the mortgages securing the earlier loans. Laurel disputes this allegation, arguing that neither Mr. O’Donoghue nor any representative on his behalf made any requests that the mortgages be satisfied prior to the written demand of the O’Donoghues’ attorney on November 17, 1992. Laurel argues that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the parties agreed that Laurel would satisfy the mortgages after closing on the restructured loans. I disagree.</p>

Mr. Ott’s testimony was that it was Laurel’s normal procedure to satisfy the prior mortgages in connection with refinancing loans.

The letter indicates that Mr. O’Donoghue had sought advice from the attorney after experiencing difficulty in obtaining credit. The attorney advised him to obtain a copy of a current credit report. The report indicated that the outstanding obligations to Laurel exceeded the amount believed to be owed. The attorney then determined that the earlier mortgages had never been satisfied by Laurel. A demand was made upon Laurel to immediately satisfy the mortgages and to explain the reasons why Laurel had not satisfied those mortgages for more than four years after receipt of payment in full of each.

It is for the factfinder to determine whether Mr. Ott’s explanation that his use of the phrase, satisfy the mortgage, was not intended to mean satisfaction as understood under 21 P.S. §§ 681-682, but instead was used to mean pay off the outstanding balance, is credible. Furthermore, it is for the factfinder to determine whether Mr. Ott communicated his intended meaning of the phrase to the O’Donoghues during the process of restructuring the loans. Because the letter of Mr. Prazer appears to indicate that Laurel’s failure to satisfy the mortgages was due to an error on Laurel’s part, rather than the absence of an agreement to satisfy the mortgages, I find that summary judgment in Laurel’s favor was improper.</p>

The majority cites Mr. O’Donoghue’s testimony that from the closing date of June 2, 1988 to July, 1992, Mr. O’Donoghue did not have any conversations with anyone at Laurel about satisfying the three mortgages. The O’Donoghues have asserted that they reached an understanding with Laurel that the mortgages would be marked satisfied during the course of restructuring their loans. Mr. O’Donoghue testified that the restructuring process took place over a number of months. His deposition testimony, which does not refer to the months before the closing date, does not contradict the O’Donoghues’ claim that an agreement to satisfy the mortgages was reached earlier. The O’Donoghues should be given the opportunity to prove their claim at trial. Based upon this record, it cannot be <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>determined as a matter of law that no agreement was made between the parties.
