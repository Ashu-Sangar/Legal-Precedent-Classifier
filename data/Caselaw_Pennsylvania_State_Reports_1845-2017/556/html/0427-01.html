Appellant requests that this Court find the lower court erred in dismissing his request for relief. Because we cannot agree with Appellant, we affirm the order dismissing his PCRA petition.</p>

Counsel was appointed to represent Appellant for the purpose of appeal to this Court. We affirmed the dismissal, <em>per curiam. </em>In our <em>per curiam </em>order, we stated that the issue raised by Appellant had been previously litigated on direct appeal and was, therefore, not eligible for relief under 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9543(3) and 9544(a)(2).

    <p id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[227,1090,1156,1004]]]'>In January of 1996, Appellant petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to have counsel appointed to prepare and file a federal habeas corpus petition. Counsel was appointed for that purpose. In January of 1997, Appellant filed a PCRA petition in the court of common pleas. Appellant then apparently moved to have the PCRA petition dismissed because the federal <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings were pending. On March 31, 1997, Judge Sabo granted this motion to dismiss. On April 9, 1997, Appellant filed a motion for rehearing of the recently dismissed PCRA petition based solely on “newly discovered evidence.” Appellant’s Brief at 4. This newly discovered evidence consisted of an alleged Batson<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> violation. Judge Sabo denied this motion on May 7,1997. Concurrently, Appellant filed another motion for rehearing or reconsideration. Judge Sabo denied this motion on August 28, 1997. In December of 1997, the federal <em>habeas corpus </em>petition was dismissed. That court found that Appellant was procedurally barred from any federal relief until all possible state remedies were exhausted.</p>

In his opinion dated May 7,1997, Judge Sabo stated that, “[t]he Petition was initially dismissed at the request of defense counsel as being premature due to on-going litigation in federal court.” Slip Opinion at 1.</p>

We cannot, therefore, rule that it was error to grant Appellant’s request for a dismissal. Nor can we rule that it was error to deny Appellant a rehearing on his own request.</p>
    <p id="b550-6" data-blocks='[["BL_550.6",550,[235,910,1160,411]]]'>Appellant’s brief also lists 23 other alleged errors. Due to Appellant’s requested dismissal, none of these issues were litigated, before the common pleas court and thus, no record has been developed for this Court to review. It is a general rule that, “[i]ssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.” Pa.R.A.P. 302.'
