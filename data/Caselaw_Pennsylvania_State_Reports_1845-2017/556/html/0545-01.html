The Governor originally signed a warrant for the execution of Bronshtein on July 16, 1997, but this Court stayed the execution so that Bronshtein could file a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the United States Supreme <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>Court. Bronshtein did file such a petition, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on October 20, 1997.

The PCRA Court held a hearing on May 4, 1998, during which Bronshtein agreed to undergo psychiatric examination. The Court appointed Robert Sadoff, M.D. to perform the examination, which took place on June 22, 1998. Dr. Sadoff submitted a report to the court on June 23, 1998, in which he stated as follows:</p>

I asked him why that was imposed upon him, and he said, because of the murder on January 11,1991 of Alexander Guttman [sic], a jeweler. He states, very carefully, “I accept the verdict.” He said he was found guilty, and would not go any further than that. I asked him if he would agree with the verdict, and he said he would not answer that question. Later, he said he accepts the sentence of death, but not necessarily the verdict. He said he knows he has been found guilty of killing Mr. Guttman [sic], and he has no choice other than to accept the finding of the jury----</blockquote>

He also knows that he has been given the death penalty on the basis of the conviction for murder of Alexander Guttman [sic]. He is vague, however, about accepting or agreeing with various verdicts of guilt and admitting that he was responsible for various behaviors, including one of the murders.</blockquote>

As <em>Dr. </em>Sadoff noted in his report, Bronshtein understands that the death penalty was imposed because of his conviction for the murder of Mr. Gutman, and he knows that the death penalty is final. It is apparent from the record that Bronshtein is aware of the fact that he has the right to pursue relief under the PCRA and that lawyers from CLEADA believe that there are issues that may have arguable legal merit. Our review of the fifty-three-page transcript from the January 26, 1999 hearing, which lasted one hour and fifteen minutes, indicates that counsel and the Court conducted an adequate waiver colloquy of Bronshtein. Accordingly, Bronshtein’s waiver of his rights under the PCRA is valid.</p>

The Supreme Court noted that with regard to federal habeas corpus actions, a next friend “must provide an adequate explanation—such as inaccessibility, mental incompetence or other disability—why the real party in interest cannot appear on his own behalf to prosecute the action.” <a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">495 U.S. at 163</a>, <a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">110 S.Ct. at 1727</a>, <a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">109 L.Ed.2d at 150</a>.

The Supreme Court held that because a state court had concluded that Simmons made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his appellate rights, that Whitmore could not establish that Simmons was unable to proceed on his own behalf, and therefore lacked standing as next friend. Accordingly, it dismissed the writ of certiorari for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

Here, the next friends are Bronshtein’s mother and sister; accordingly their interest in the matter goes beyond that of parties who are opposed to executions in general.

      <em>In re Heidnik </em>at 1021. Accordingly, it is appropriate for us to consider the reasons the next friends assert for Bronshtein’s incompetence, and whether they allege a change in circumstances. Appellants argue that Bronshtein should not be allowed to waive his rights and be executed until undergoing extensive observation and psychiatric evaluation. Attached as exhibits to their brief, they include affidavits of four mental health professionals. A psychologist, Gerald Cooke, Ph.D., states in his affidavit that he evaluated Bronshtein and testified at his trial that Bronshtein suffered from Paranoid Personality Disorder with Persecutory and Grandiose Features and Depressive Disorder with history of suicide attempts. He adds, “His paranoid disorder and depression shed light on the inability to trust and work with counsel which he is exhibiting, as well as on his apparent wish to be put to death.” Affidavit of Gerald Cooke, Ph.D., March 13,1999 at 6.</p>

While we do not minimize the importance of the information set forth in the affidavits, it is not responsive to this critical issue. When the PCRA Court issued its Order dismissing the PCRA Petition and vacating the stay of execution, it was aware of the trial court testimony of Drs. Cooke and Michals regarding Bronshtein’s mental health, as well as the opinion of Dr. Sadoff, who wrote in his report dated June 23, 1998, “I can state, within reasonable medical certainty, that Mr. Braunshtein [sic] appears to have an intellectual ability to understand that he is being put to death for a particular reason, i.e., the conviction for murder of Alexander Guttman [sic].” In light of the fact that Appellants have failed to show that Bronshtein does not understand the punishment and the reason for it, and have not demonstrated a change of circumstance since January 26, 1999, when the PCRA Court determined that Bronshtein was competent to waive his appellate rights, we deny the instant appeal.</p>
