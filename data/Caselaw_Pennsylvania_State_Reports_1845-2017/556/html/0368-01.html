Lee enlisted the Appellant to help him. Watson and Stewart had also worked in Walker’s drug business until they had a fight with Walker. After discontinuing the operation, Watson robbed a house where Walker stored and sold drugs in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. In July of 1992, Watson and Stewart stole Walker’s Saab automobile. Walker later ordered the murders of Stewart and Watson in retaliation for these robberies.</p>
    <p id="b496-8" data-blocks='[["BL_496.9",496,[239,1442,1158,744]]]'>At approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 18, 1992, Watson’s body was found on the pavement at the corner of 58th Street and Haverford Avenue in Philadelphia. He had died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head, chest, abdomen, and back. At approximately 10:00 p.m. on November 8, 1992, police discovered Stewart had been shot when they found him slumped in the front seat of a car at 34th Street and Powelton Avenue. Tia Seidle (Seidle), who was seated in the front passenger seat next to Stewart when he was killed, was standing outside the car when the police arrived. The car, which had collided into another vehicle, had many bullet holes and its windows were shattered. Stewart had been shot repeatedly in the torso, and was pronounced dead at the hospital from the gunshot wounds to his lungs and back.</p>

At the conclusion of the inter<a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>view, the Appellant told the police that he had information regarding Stewart’s murder and asked if he could expect favorable treatment in the Davis case if he cooperated with the police. The detective told the Appellant that he would make his information and cooperation known to the District Attorney’s Office, but he said he could promise no favorable treatment. Nonetheless, the Appellant gave a statement admitting his involvement in the murder of Stewart.</p>
    <p id="b497-4" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[227,755,1152,842]]]'>After waiving <em>Miranda </em>rights, the Appellant told police that, on November 8, 1992, Lee paged him and said he was coming by car to get him. Lee arrived in a blue Chevrolet Malibu and told the Appellant to drive toward the Philadelphia Zoo on 34th Street. While in the car, Lee removed a semiautomatic weapon from underneath the front seat, explained that Stewart was one of the men who had stolen Walker’s Saab, and said that he was going to shoot Stewart. The Appellant said that he parked the Malibu on Brandywine Street and, with his accomplice, waited for Stewart to appear. When Stewart entered a white Malibu with Seidle, his female companion, and drove off, the Appellant followed him. According to the Appellant’s statement, as he pulled up next to Stewart’s car, Lee opened fire, shooting six to eight bullets at Stewart. The Appellant then drove off with Lee and later that night Lee paid him $500.</p>
    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[225,1622,1154,618]]]'>Relying on this confession, the police arrested the Appellant for the murder of Stewart. Because police had information from other sources that Watson had stolen Walker’s car with Stewart, they then asked the Appellant if he knew anything about Watson’s murder. The Appellant told them he did, and agreed to give a statement. He again waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and explained that Watson was involved in the drug business with Walker until Watson robbed Walker’s German-town drug house, where Davis was murdered. The Appellant explained that after Watson had left threatening messages for Lee in Germantown, Walker “put a [$10,000] price on” Watson.</p>

Lee drove the car and “the plan was” that when they spotted Watson, the Appellant would kill him. A short time later, the Appellant then told police, he read a newspaper report of Watson’s murder. When he confronted Lee with this information, Lee supposedly told him that he had “t[aken] care of’- the problem they had with Watson. The Appellant denied knowing what kind of gun Lee had used to kill Watson.</p>

The next day Detective Walter Hoffer transported the Appellant from the prison to Homicide Headquarters for further questioning. After receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waiving his rights, the Appellant said that he wished to provide more information about the Watson murder. The Appellant said, “I want to cooperate and help myself’ (N.T. 4/10/95, 32-33, 55-62).</p>
    <p id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[229,1301,1160,786]]]'>The Appellant explained that in August 1992, he had been at a bar' with Lee when Walker paged Lee to inform him that Watson would soon be at a telephone booth at 58th Street and Haverford Avenue. The Appellant knew that Lee was going to kill Watson because there was a hit out on Watson, and Lee and Walker had a problem with him. According to the Appellant, Lee told him that “he would do the shooting and I would do the driving.” The Appellant said that when they spotted Watson, Lee got out of the car, approached Watson at the phone booth, and shot him six times with a silver revolver. The Appellant then drove to a bar at 54th and Ruby Streets where Lee left him to report the successful “hit” to Walker. Three days later, Walker paid the Appellant $500.00 for killing Watson. After Appellant gave this confession, the police arrested him and charged him with the murder of Watson.</p>

Little had seen the Appellant retrieve the gun from Lee’s car. Another witness, Robert David (David), who worked for Walker and Lee’s drug operation, confirmed the Appellant’s statement that Watson had robbed one of Walker’s drag houses, and that the murder victims, Watson and Stewart, had stolen Walker’s car.</p>

In exchange, the Appellant agreed to cooperate in the prosecutions of Walker and Lee. The Appellant entered his guilty pleas before the Honorable Robert A. Latrone in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia on that same day. The Appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw his pleas on January 24, 1994, 'without having provided the promised assistance in the prosecutions of Lee and Walker.

The Appellant’s confessions to these murders were the most probative evidence of his guilt, and David and Little’s testimony corroborated his confessions. David gave testimony about the facts leading up to these murders. He admitted his involvement in the drug operation and explained the relationships between the victims and Walker and Lee. Little testified that she saw the Appellant shoot Davis on July 19, 1992.

When considered in light of all of the evidence, including the Appellant’s confessions, we conclude that trial counsel’s failure to cross-examine these witnesses concerning bias stemming from an outstanding warrant, criminal charges, probations, or paroles, this would not so prejudice the Appellant that the result of this trial would have been different if counsel had pursued this line of questioning.
