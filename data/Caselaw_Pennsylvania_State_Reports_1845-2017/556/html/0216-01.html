The trial court record shows, based substantially on statements that Appellant gave to police, that on Saturday, December 7, 1996, the girlfriend of co-Defendant Bridges was robbed at gunpoint. The robbers indicated that they were looking for drugs and money. Although no drugs or money were found, the robbers took a camcorder and a Sony Playstation. News of this incident quickly made its way to Bridges. Bridges’ girlfriend told him that the robbers had <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>been wearing green masks and green “hoodies.” Bridges recalled seeing Gregory and Damon Banks wearing green hoodies earlier that day. Bridges and the Appellant went to the home of co-Defendant Morales. While there, Bridges grabbed a shotgun and mentioned that he wanted to go to the house of Gregory and Damon Banks and murder them. Bridges showed the Appellant and Morales a 9-mm Glock pistol that he had on him.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[263,740,1160,1264]]]'>On December 8, 1996, the three co-conspirators headed to a local K-mart to purchase shotgun shells. They traveled in a minivan and arrived at Gregory and Damon Banks’ house. While Bridges went to talk to them, the Appellant noticed a woman unloading groceries next door. Bridges came out of the house with Gregory and Damon Banks, and stated that he wanted them to take care of his drug-selling operations while he was away. Gregory and Damon Banks entered the minivan with Bridges, the Appellant, and Morales, and the group drove to a dirt road near a car lot and construction site. Bridges and Morales said that they were going to show Gregory and Damon Banks where the drugs were hidden, and asked Gregory and Damon Banks to accompany them. They refused, and Bridges and Morales returned to the van. Bridges then approached Appellant and told him that he would shoot Gregory and Damon Banks on the count of three. Bridges then walked around the front of the van, and shouted ‘What’s on station two and three?” At that point, Bridges started shooting. In statements given to police, Appellant claimed that Bridges also fired a shot at him, hitting him in the side of his torso. Appellant stated that the van then drove away, and Appellant walked two miles to the Queen City Restaurant, where he was subsequently picked up and taken to the hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound.</p>

The Commonwealth presented testimony from a forensic pathologist that one of the bullets recovered from the body of Damon Banks was a .38 caliber bullet. A .38 caliber handgun was recovered close to the murder scene and, according to the testimony of the Commonwealth’s ballistics expert, was the weapon used to fire that bullet. George Robles testified at trial that Appellant possessed a .38 caliber handgun like the one found at the murder scene. Robles testified that Appellant told him, while he was visiting Appellant at the hospital, that he had taken the .38 caliber handgun with him, had wiped it off with his shirt and threw it on the side of the road within a quarter mile of the murder scene.</p>

Robles denied that he was given any deal in return for his release from jail, and stated that “whether I’m on bail or in jail, I still got to cooperate any way I put it, so it doesn’t matter. Cooperating helps.” Notes of Testimony, 11/20/97, p. 524. Robles testified that he was released from jail because he met the conditions of his bail and posted the requisite bond. Appellant’s counsel also asked Robles whether he had ever received money from the Reading Police Department in exchange for his cooperation. Robles denied that he had been paid for his cooperation. The impeachment value of the February 1997 letter would be to suggest that Robles had made an agreement with the police to testify, and that he would fabricate testimony in order to fulfill any such agreement. When directly questioned about his cooperation, however, Robles denied that he had made any deal with the police. Although the letter may have been useful in undermining Robles’ credibility, we do not conclude that such an impeachment strategy would have created a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, particularly in light of Robles’ testimony that his cooperation was not pursuant to any agreement with the police. <em>See Green, supra.</em>

In refusing to grant Appellant’s request that the Commonwealth be precluded from introducing any evidence regarding the aggravating circumstance of Section 9711(d)(14), the trial court found that the Commonwealth had disclosed—several months before the trial—that it planned on calling Robles during the penalty phase. Further, the trial court noted that Appellant’s investigator had interviewed Robles on previous occasions and had the opportunity to question Robles about his knowledge of Appellant’s involvement in Bridges’ drug activities, if he chose to do so. The trial court granted Appellant some relief by granting him a half-hour continuance to prepare for cross examination of Robles on the basis of this police report, and found this adequate in light of the advanced notice that Appellant had of the subject matter of Robles’ testimony at the penalty phase. According to these circumstances, we find no abuse of the discretion of the trial court in refusing Appellant’s request for further relief.</p>

The testimony at the preliminary hearing supports the conclusion of the trial court that Appellant was lucid and capable of responding to the officers’ questions. Moreover, the result of this initial questioning was not a “confession” by Appellant of participation in the murders, but rather a false story designed to mislead police concerning the circumstances of Appellant’s shooting. While Appellant contends that he was incapable of voluntarily giving statements to the police due to his “delirium,” his presence of mind in fabricating a story about his shooting seriously undermines that claim.

Although the officers displayed their badges, they were not in uniform and conducted the interview with the hospital door open and while another patient was in the room with Appellant. There was no suggestion by Appellant that he wanted police questioning to cease, or that he objected to the questioning. Further, Appellant offered his confession early in the interrogation, and gave an extensive narration of his involvement in the murders of Gregory and Damon Banks without repeated prompting by Sgt.

Later that afternoon, the police learned that Appellant had checked himself out of the hospital against his physician’s advice. Suspecting that Appellant was staying at George Robles’ residence, Detective Vega of the Reading Police called Robles and asked him whether Appellant was with him. Robles confirmed that Appellant was with him, and Detective Vega spoke with Appellant. Detective Vega asked Appellant if he would go to the District Attorney’s office so that they could talk about the possibility of retaliation from Shawn Bridges, and about the murders of Gregory and Damon Banks. Appellant agreed to go the District Attorney’s office, but asked if friends could accompany him. The police transported Appellant and two of his friends to the District Attorney’s office, for the purpose of administering a polygraph examination that Appellant had agreed to undergo. At approximately 7:20 p.m., Detective Stajkowski gave Appellant <em>Miranda </em>warnings and conducted a pre-polygraph interview of Appellant. Due to Appellant’s physical condition, however, Detective Stajkowski did not administer the polygraph test.

The officers permitted Appellant to bring two of his friends with him, and these individuals were present at the District Attorney’s office during part of the questioning. Appellant was left unattended at various times, and was permitted to take breaks when needed. When Appellant requested that the interview stop, the police ceased questioning him and offered to take him to the hospital or, when Appellant refused to go the hospital, to return him to Robles’ house.

N.T., 1/20/97, p. 491. Robles testified that, according to conversations he had with Appellant, Gregory and Damon Banks’ murders occurred because “they tried to take Shawn’s drugs. That’s the consequence in that business.” Moreover, Appellant admitted in his statements to the police that the ruse employed by Bridges to get Gregory and Damon Banks to accompany them was that Bridges was leaving town for three to five days and that Bridges was showing the victims where his drugs were hidden so that Gregory and Damon Banks could “watch over his business” in Bridges’ absence.

The trial court held this hearing on February 26, 1998, pursuant to Appellant’s “Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing Regarding After-Discovered Evidence.” The Commonwealth objected to this hearing because the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to Appellant’s filing of a Notice of Appeal to this Court on December 22, 1997. Inexplicably, the record had not been transferred to this Court by the time of the trial court’s February 26, 1998 evidentiary hearing. The trial court noted the Commonwealth's jurisdictional objection, and later stated in its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) Opinion that it did not have jurisdiction to grant Appellant relief respecting the February, 1998 motion. However, the trial court wisely decided that it would be in the interests of "judicial economy” to create an evidentiary record to facilitate this Court's review of Appellant’s <em>Brady </em>issue.</p>

The trial court’s decision to create an evidentiary record notwithstanding the filing of the Notice of Appeal unquestionably aids our review of this issue, and accords with the trial court's limited authority following appeal. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(4) (following appeal, trial court may “[ajuthorize the taking of depositions or the preservation of testimony where required in the interests of justice”).</p>

The Commonwealth presented testimony that Damon Banks had taken a .32 caliber pistol with him when he left with Bridges, Morales, and Appellant. The Commonwealth sought to discredit Appellant's version that Bridges had shot him, and instead prove that one of the victims, Damon Banks, had shot him.</p>

In that case, the authorities sought a court order to compel a suspect to undergo surgery to remove a bullet that the government wished to use . as evidence. Because the surgery would "intrude substantially” on the defendant’s protected interests, and would not be undertaken absent the government's motion, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the government from compelling the operation. In Appellant’s case, by contrast, removal of the bullet occurred irrespective of the wishes of the police, because Appellant’s medical condition required it.</p>
