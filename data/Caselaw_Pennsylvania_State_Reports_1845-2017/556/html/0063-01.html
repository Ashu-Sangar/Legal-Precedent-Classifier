A petition for extended involuntary treatment pursuant to 50 P.S. § 7303, which provides for a twenty day commitment, was filed.

The trial court denied Appellee’s petition and rejected her claim that the warrant issued pursuant to section 7302 had been procedurally defective. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed. In assessing the validity of the section 7302 warrant, the Superior Court noted that the MHPA and case law provide minimal guidance regarding the standards to be used when evaluating the issuance of a warrant under section 7302. As a result, the Superior Court turned to the criminal procedural standards applicable to arrest warrants and determined that under those standards, the section 7302 warrant did not state sufficient grounds to determine that Appellee was in need of treatment. The Superior Court essentially found that because Mr. Morrison lacked the qualifications to make conclusions regarding Appellee’s mental health and because he had not independently verified the information and statements given to him by others,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the section 7302 warrant did not satisfy the standard of probable cause and was therefore, insufficient.

Thus, the plain language of the Act indicates that the legislature, unquestionably familiar with the standard of probable cause, meant to employ a different standard for the issuance of warrants for emergency mental health evaluations.

Here, the Superior Court essentially imposed a requirement that the mental health delegate seeking the warrant for emergency examination independently investigate and verify the information on which he is basing the application. Requiring mental health delegates for emergency services to investigate the veracity of each statement made to them prior to the filing of the application for a warrant, however, makes little sense. <em>See In the Matter of J.S., </em><a href="/pa-commw/142/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="142 Pa.

Such a requirement would only serve to frustrate the very purpose of the emergency evaluation and treatment sections of the MHPA, which is to render immediate assistance to those persons who are in need. When agencies are given information that someone is in need of immediate treatment, they must, within reason, be able to act on that information. In recognition of this necessity, the legislature has enacted section 7302, which states that agencies may act in such an emergency situation when they have “reasonable grounds” to do so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The probable cause inquiry required in the criminal warrant context is simply not appropriate in cases where a warrant for an emergency mental health evaluation has been obtained. At the same time, there is no blanket requirement, as indicated by the Superior Court, that information be verified by outside sources before a section 7302 warrant can properly be issued. Rather, as reflected by the explicit language of the MHPA, the standard for evaluating the validity of section 7302 warrants is whether reasonable grounds exist to believe that a person is severely mentally disabled and in need of immediate treatment.</p>

These concerns prompted the family members to inform Mr. Morrison that there was a gun inside Appellee’s home. After receiving this information, Mr. Morrison made an initial visit to Appellee’s home. During that first visit, Mr. Morrison observed that Appellee was guarded, disheveled and had a contusion on her eye which she declined to explain. He observed that Appellee refused to discuss the purpose of his visit and instead, closed the blinds and locked the door.

Appellee seems to argue, however, that the principles of due process require section 7302 warrants to be evaluated under the standards established for criminal warrants. While we fully agree that Appellee is entitled to due process protection, <em>see </em>50 P.S. § 7102, such protection does not require the application of criminal procedural standards to a warrant for an emergency mental health evaluation. Pennsylvania jurisprudence has consistently noted that the legislature intended the MHPA to create a treatment scheme under which a patient’s procedural protections expand progressively as the deprivation of liberty gradually <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>increases. <em>See, e.g., In re S.O., </em><a href="/pa-super/342/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="342 Pa.

In light of the emergency nature, therapeutic purpose and short duration of a section 7302 warrant, the criminal due process standards imposed by the Superior Court are more stringent than those necessary to meet the "minimal procedural safeguards” required when issuing a warrant pursuant to section 7302. <em>See id.; see also Parham v.

In addition to arguing that Mr. Morrison improperly failed to verify the information regarding Appellee's mental health, Appellee also complains that the statements relied upon by Mr. Morrison were hearsay. Appellee argues that hearsay statements cannot be used to support a finding of reasonable grounds for a section 7302 warrant. We disagree. Hearsay is admissible at the informal hearing required for an application for extended involuntary emergency treatment not to exceed twenty days. <em>See </em>50 P.S. § 7303(c); <em>In re Hutchinson, </em><a href="/pa/500/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="500 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="1781048" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0152-01">500 Pa. 152</a>, 159 n. 8, <a href="/pa/500/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="500 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="1781048" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0152-01">454 A.2d 1008</a>, 1011 n. 8 (1982) (legislature has determined that commitments for less than 20 days do not require same formalities as are necessary in commitments for longer periods óf time).

We also take issue with the Superior Court’s determination that Mr. Morrison lacked the qualifications to assess Appellee’s condition for purposes of whether an involuntary mental health examination was warranted under section 7302. Mr. Morrison is a crisis service unit worker and the Supervisor of the Emergency Service Unit of Chestnut Ridge Counseling Services, which the County Administrator had delegated to handle emergency services under the MHPA. As an authorized delegate of the County Administrator, Mr. Morrison testified that he is often called upon to investigate and evaluate information received from others regarding the mental health of a particular person. <em>See </em>N.T., 2/8/96, at 11. While Mr. Morrison is not a psychiatrist, the MHPA specifically allows physicians <em>or </em>other "responsible persons,” such as mental health delegates, to petition for section 7302 warrants.</p>

Clearly, threatening to shoot yourself and your son while holding a loaded gun is highly indicative of a person who is in immediate need of mental health treatment. However, citing criminal procedural requirements and Pa.R.Crim.P. 119(b), the Superior Court concluded that Mr. Morrison’s amendment to the warrant application, which reflected the threats and loaded gun incident but was added after the warrant had been issued, could not be considered in determining whether the application alleged sufficient grounds to believe that Appellee was mentally disabled and in need of treatment. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 119(b) (no evidence other than affidavits before issuing authority may be considered in determining whether arrest warrant was issued upon showing of probable cause). We have already determined that criminal proce<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>dural standards are inappropriate in the context of evaluating the validity of section 7302 warrants for emergency mental health evaluations.

However, we agree with Appellant that since Appellee failed to raise this issue either before the trial court or the Superior Court, the issue had been waived and was therefore, not preserved for appellate review. <em>See </em>Pa.
