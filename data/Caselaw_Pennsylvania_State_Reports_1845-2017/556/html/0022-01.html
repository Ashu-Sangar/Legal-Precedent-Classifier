We have thoroughly reexamined this dissenting opinion; with all due respect to the late Mr. Justice Manderino, we must again decline adopting the position he championed. Contrary to the dissent’s argument, the general exemption is not “strip[ped] ... of any rational meaning” by application of the <em>Ragnar Benson </em>rule since any construction materials which are affixed to the public utility site do escape the tax. Construction materials which would be “affixed” to the public utility site, and therefore are eligible for the exemption, are within common knowledge. For example, any cement or pipes which were used by Appellant in the construction of these water mains or sewers would be entitled to the exemption as they are “affixed” to real estate. Thus, we find the first argument presented by the dissent in <em>Ragnar Benson </em>to be unpersuasive.</p>

Yet, as we are not presently confronted with <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>a matter where a public utility is arguing that the tax does not apply, we need not.decide that issue at this juncture; rather, we will assume <em>arguendo </em>that the Commonwealth Court is correct in stating that a similarly situated public utility would indeed escape taxation. Even making such allowances for the Commonwealth Court’s position, we still must conclude that there is insufficient basis for us to overrule <em>Ragnar Benson. </em>As noted above, the legislature has clearly determined that a private contractor such as Johnston cannot avoid the use tax on machinery, materials, and supplies which are utilized in the construction of a public utility facility but are not ultimately affixed to real estate. The Commonwealth Court, in essence, asks us to reassess the fiscal and other policy determinations made by the legislature in the course of its drafting this statute.
