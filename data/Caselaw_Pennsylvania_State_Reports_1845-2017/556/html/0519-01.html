He then took her purse and the bags that contained the bar’s cash receipts for the day. He threw Ms. Martin’s body in his pick up truck and hid it in the woods near his grandparents’ house, where the police discovered the body the next day. At the time the body was discovered, it was nude except for a sock on her foot. The pathology reports indicated that Ms. Martin had been stabbed twenty times and her neck was slashed. She had defensive wounds on her hands and signs of blunt force trauma to her head.</p>

At about 12:30 a.m. all of the other patrons had left the bar except Breakiron. Ms. Martin came around the bar, <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>and sat on a barstool near him. They talked for awhile and then Breakiron went to a pinball machine at the back of the bar. Ms. Martin came over to him and he tried to put his arm around her. “The next thing” he recalls is “getting hit over the head with something heavy.” (N.T. at 1253) He fell to the floor and remembers nothing else. When he regained consciousness, Ms. Martin was on the floor of the bar with a knife in her back. Breakiron proceeded to pull the knife out of her back, hurry out of the bar, and get in his truck. (N.T. at 1255) He tried to get out of there because “everything was wrong.” <em>Id. </em>As he was driving, he felt that he was “part of it” and that “he had to correct it.” <em>Id. </em>He returned to the lounge, went to the body, felt that it was cold, picked her up, carried her outside and put her in the bed of the truck. At that time, he took bags of money, which contained the receipts of the bar for the evening and he took Ms. Martin’s purse.</p>

Breakiron asked for another drink, and the barmaid said it was closing time, and he had to leave. He then picked up an ashtray and started hitting Ms. Martin. When she would not “go to the floor,” he pulled out a knife. Then he dragged her to his truck and took her to his “Pap’s” house where he “finished her off.”</p>

The main thrust of the pro se petition was that trial counsel was ineffective in handling certain mental health issues. The Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County (PCRA court) appointed new counsel to represent Breakiron during the PCRA proceedings, and appointed the Attorney General’s office to handle the prosecution because of a conflict within the District Attorney’s office. PCRA counsel filed an amended PCRA petition, on which the PCRA court held hearings on July 17 and 18, 1997 and September 17 and 19, 1997. The PCRA court denied relief, holding that Breakiron’s claims were either waived, previously litigated or were without merit. This appeal followed.</p>

First, he argues that the PCRA court should have recused the Attorney General from prosecuting the PCRA issues because the Attorney General’s office improperly enlisted the aid of the Fayette County District Attorney’s office, which had previously been <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>recused from prosecuting the PCRA petition. Additionally, Breakiron raises two issues regarding both his conviction for first degree murder and the imposition of the death penalty.

We will then discuss the issues related to alleged error in the guilt and penalty phases of the trial.</p>

    <p id="b647-7" data-blocks='[["BL_647.7",647,[234,1012,1156,907]]]'>During the PCRA proceedings, Breakiron requested that the PCRA court appoint special counsel from the Attorney General’s office because in the interim from Breakiron’s trial to the PCRA filing, both of Breakiron’s trial and direct appeals counsel, Richard Bower and Jack Heneks of the Public Defender’s office, became Assistant District Attorneys. Consequently, the Fayette County District Attorney’s office had a conflict of interest in prosecuting the matter before the PCRA court. (The Fayette County' District Attorney’s office consisted of only five attorneys, including the two who had worked on <em>Breakiron I.) </em>The trial court granted the request to recuse the District Attorney. (Apparently, the District Attorney’s office agreed that a conflict existed and requested that the Attorney General’s office take over the matter.) Following this motion and Order of the PCRA court, Chief Deputy Attorney General Robert Graci assumed the prosecution of the PCRA claims pursuant to 71 P.S. § 732-205.</p>

The basis for the motion was that Attorney Graci allegedly created a conflict of interest because he asked trial counsel Bower to review a file that was still in the Public Defender’s office. In addition, Attorney Graci had also requested Attorney Bower to review PCRA filings before the pleadings were filed with the court. On <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>January 23, 1997, the PCRA court held a hearing regarding Breakiron’s motion for recusal of the Attorney General.

We must note initially that our decision should not be construed as our condonation or approval of the actions taken by Attorney Graci in soliciting Attorney Bower’s assistance, or Attorney Bower’s review of the file in the public defender’s office... Our research has revealed no case on point. Nevertheless, we find that the effect is de minimis at this early stage of the proceedings... Any alleged conflict is not so severe as to warrant the drastic measures of recusing the Attorney General and appointing a special prosecutor.</blockquote>

The PCRA court found counsel’s statements credible and denied the claim. We find no reason to reverse that decision.

Further, Breakiron asserts that prudent defense counsel should have investigated the timing of how long it took to drive back and forth from the lounge to the home, to show that Ms. Martin must have been dead at the lounge, as testified to by Breakiron, and not at the home, as the prosecution postulated.</p>

Although counsel presented evidence of Breakiron’s alcohol intake on the night of the murder, he did not present it in context to his long history of alcohol abuse and mental health problems and in context to the fact that Breakiron had an extended period of abstinence from alcohol and drugs (Breakiron had been incarcerated for some 11^ months and had been released from prison a few weeks before the murder, on March 12, 1987, for indecent assault.) According to this line of argument, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present the effect that drinking a large quantity of alcohol would have on Breakiron under these circumstances and in combination with his personality disorder.</p>

Counsel argued that this intoxication was such that Breakiron could not form a specific intent to kill. The jury also heard testimony that Breakiron drove, drank, and could function, even though he had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol. After hearing this evidence, the jury rejected Breakiroris defense of diminished capacity and sentenced him to death. There is not a reasonable likelihood that the evidence that Breakiron had refrained from alcohol for nearly a year before the incident would have changed the jury’s verdict in this matter, and the PCRA court appropriately denied relief.</p>

The facts relevant to this claim are as follows. On March 27, 1987, following the murder of Ms. Martin, Breakiron was in jail for public drunkenness and parole violations unrelated to Ms. Martin’s death. There was some concern that he was suicidal and Dr. Thomas Adamski of the Fayette County Department of Mental Health (Fayette County) performed a psychiatric examination. Dr. Adamski determined that Breakiron was not in need of psychiatric treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> On April 3, 1987, following Dr. Adamski’s initial examination, <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>Breakiron was formally charged with the murder of Ms. Martin. The record indicates that following the formal charge, on May 21, 1987, Breakiron’s first attorney with the Public Defender’s office, Attorney Kristobak, filed a Petition seeking that the “Court direct that defendant be transported for an evaluation and recommendation for a period of ninety (90) days and that said reports be furnished the Public Defender immediately upon completion.” On May 4, 1987, the court entered an order that the “Fayette County Mental Health is hereby directed to evaluate the defendant herein, to determine whether defendant is competent to stand trial and assist counsel with his defense, to determine if defendant was competent at the time of the incident, and to determine whether defendant is in need of treatment.”</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[225,1058,1153,1196]],["BL_660.1",660,[234,322,1159,250]]]'>Thereafter, Dr. Adamski, the same psychiatrist from Fayette County who had previously seen Breakiron, performed another interview. Dr. Adamski wrote a report, dated August 27, 1987, (August report) and made specific reference to his March report concerning Breakiron. In the August report, Dr. Adamski concluded that Breakiron was “competent to stand trial and assist counsel with his defense” and “competent at the time of the incident.” During the course of Dr. Adamski’s second interview in preparation for the August 1987 report, it appears that Dr. Adamski told Breakiron that any statements that he made at that time could be used at trial against Breakiron. As a result of these warnings, Breakiron claims that he did not fully cooperate with the evaluation. On February 26, 1988, Breakiron’s third public defender, Attorney Bower, petitioned for a second court-ordered psychiatric examination. Specifically, counsel asked that the “Court direct that defendant be transported for an evaluation and recommendation for a period of sixty (60) days and that said reports be furnished the Public Defender immediately upon completion.” The trial court then entered an Order for a second psychiatric evaluation with the Fayette County facility. During this second examination, Breakiron apparently was told again that his statements could be used at trial, he did not <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>cooperate, and the examination did not go forward. (Breakiron claims that counsel told him not to cooperate, counsel denies this assertion.) No counsel or independent psychiatrist was present. Trial counsel did not request a competency or sanity hearing before trial.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[235,595,1155,199]]]'>According to Breakiron, counsel was ineffective because he failed to follow the Mental Health Procedures Act (MHPA), 50 P.S. 7101 <em>et seq, </em>and because he faded to properly present his psychiatric history to the jury as a mitigating factor.</p>

Section 7402(c) provides that the prosecution, the defense, or a warden may present to the court an application for an order directing an evaluation for the competency of a criminal defendant. Following the examination, the court appoints a psychiatrist, who then prepares a report and submits it to “the court and to counsel.” Section 7402(e). The MHPA contains specific rules concerning the conduct of the mental health examination, and provides the parameters for when it is to be used in a court proceeding. <em><a href="/pa/520/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="520 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1815634" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0338-01">Id.</a> </em>In particular, the MHPA provides that the defendant is entitled to have counsel present and that “[njothing said or done by such person during the examination may be used as evidence against him in any criminal proceedings on any issue other than that of his mental condition.” Section 7402(e)(3). The MHPA also provides that the defendant, is entitled to the appointment of his own private psychiatrist to attend the examination, if the defendant has a “substantial objection” to the conclusions reached by the court-appointed psychiatrist. Section 7402(f).</p>

He then argues that, pursuant to the MHPA, he had some expectation of confidentiality, that he had a right to have trial counsel <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>present, and that he had a right to a defense expert psychiatrist following his objection to Dr. Adamski’s conduct. These errors, Breakiron asserts, prejudiced him because the effect was to deprive him of the opportunity to have a private psychiatrist testify as to his mental health and psychiatric history during both the guilt and sentencing phase of the trial.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[213,658,1154,624]]]'>In reviewing the record in this matter, it appears that trial counsel did mishandle the competency evaluation in a number of respects. No counsel was present and following objection to Dr. Adamski’s “Miranda” warnings, trial counsel did not request a private defense expert to be present at a second court ordered examination. Further, in reviewing the PCRA testimony of this matter, trial counsel was not able to articulate a reasonable basis for failing to comply with the MHPA. Thus, our determination in this matter hinges upon whether these errors were prejudicial to the defendant at either the guilt or the sentencing phase of the trial. We hold that they were not.</p>

Breakiron postulates that had an evaluation been performed in accordance with Section 7402, counsel may have chosen a different trial strategy. He surmises that trial counsel’s failure to follow the MHPA left the attorney without any psychiatric evidence to assist in Breakiron’s defense or to present mitigating evidence at trial. We find that Breakiron has not met his burden of establishing that counsel’s errors prejudiced him because he cannot establish that had an examination been done according to the MHPA, the defense strategy, or the outcome of either the guilty verdict or sentence of death, would have changed. Instead, the PCRA proceedings show that Breakiron was competent at the time of trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and there was no evidence that trial counsel could have presented an insanity defense. Therefore, the <em>only </em>defense available to trial counsel was of diminished capacity, which was presented and rejected by the <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>jury at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Thus, the alleged errors, had they been corrected, would not have led to a different result, and we cannot find that Breakiron was prejudiced in the guilt phase of the trial.</p>

The fact remains that the evaluation was ordered to assess Breakiron’s competency to stand trial, and there is no real dispute that Breakiron was competent. Indeed, at the PCRA hearing, both Dr. Adamski and Breakiron’s private psychiatrist testified, and neither opined that Breakiron was incompetent at the time of trial. We fail to see how trial counsel’s alleged errors, where Breakiron was clearly competent to stand trial, had any bearing on the penalty phase of the trial.</p>

Dr. Adamski’s report, dated March 27, 1987 (March report) indicates that Breakiron’s medical history is significant for heavy alcohol use "producing a deep alcoholic sleep,” and for problems with drugs. The March report notes that Breakiron "admits to having blackouts and tolerance with alcohol.” There was discussion of Breakiroris previous arrest history, with a notation that a “lot of his arrests stem from alcohol and intoxication, including demonstration of poor judgment, impulsivity and explosiveness.” Breakiron was noted to have a past psychiatric history significant for being seen by a psychiatrist when he was 13 years old, difficulty controlling his temper, and for attempted suicide when he was 8 or 9 years old. The report indicated that Breakiron had two prior psychiatric admissions for "detox" in 1985 and for "evaluation” in 1984. The March report diagnosed Breakiron <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>as alcohol dependent with “antisocial personality disorder.” However, he was not suicidal and did not need treatment at that time.</p>

Trial counsel argued that Breakiron could not form a specific intent to kill because of his diminished capacity due to alcohol and his lack of memory of the event. Trial counsel presented evidence at trial that Breakiron was drinking on the night of the murder and he did not remember the incident. Counsel argued that Breakiron had a diminished capacity due to this alcohol intake. The jury rejected this defense and a review of the trial transcript in this matter shows that the evidence of Breakiron’s guilt was overwhelming. Four witnesses, including Breakiron himself, testified that Appellant was the last person in the bar with Ms. Martin. Traces of blood matching her type were found on his truck and on his boots. Moreover, Breakiron testified at trial that he recalls Ms. Martin being "stabbed,” and that he pulled the knife from her back. He then admitted to dragging her body from the bar, and taking it to his grandparents to dispose of the body. Breakiron admits that he took the money from the bar. Breakiron’s testimony did not suggest that he was so intoxicated that he could hot walk, drive, and dispose of a body.</p>

Breakiron asserts that he was prejudiced and in support presented at the PCRA hearing the expert psychiatric testimony of Dr. Christine Martone. Dr. Martone testified that Breakiron suffered from mental health problems and had alcohol and drug problems. She testified that he was institutionalized on a number of occasions for alcohol and aggression against his mother and sister four years before the murder, and that he had a history of explosive violent behavior when drinking, and suffered black out spells. Specifically, she testified that he was highly intoxicated at time of the incident and blacked out. She discussed the effects of the alcohol with his particular mental health problems, and opined that Breakiron could have this black out and it would still be consistent with an ability to maintain motor control. She testified that Breakiron had a limited ability to control frustration and anger, and had personality disorders, which would cause him to fly into a rage, which drinking exacerbates.
