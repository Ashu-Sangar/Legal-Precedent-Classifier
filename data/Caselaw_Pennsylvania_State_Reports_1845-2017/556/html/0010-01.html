On May 22, 1995, the Commonwealth, at a pre-trial hearing in the Rizzo case, moved to schedule a hearing in order to determine whether Hyland and Reighard would refuse to testify at trial. At the May 22 hearing, the Commonwealth indicated that Hyland had stated to police that he would not testify against Rizzo, and that police conversations with Reighard’s counsel suggested that Reighard would also refuse to testify. The trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion for a pre-trial hearing on the matter of whether the witnesses intended to testify at trial, and on May 26, 1995 a hearing was conducted pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 9015, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>

In short, the Commonwealth, whose case against Rizzo depended on the testimony of Hyland and Reighard, anticipated that Hyland and Reighard would refuse to testify and wished to coerce their testimony. If the witnesses refused to testify and were found in contempt prior to trial, there would be no double jeopardy problem, for there would be no jury. On the other hand, if the refusals to testify did not occur until after a jury were sworn, and if Hyland and Reihard were then imprisoned pending their testimony, they might remain unwilling to testify, knowing <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>that the juiy had been sworn and that the court would retain the jury for only a limited duration.

Furthermore, as the comment to the rule indicates, the rule should be used only when it is anticipated that the witness will be unable to be present at the trial:</p>
    <blockquote id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[290,1066,1115,367]]]'>“May be unavailable,” as used in paragraph 1, is intended to include situations in which the court has reason to believe that the witness will be unable to be present or to testify at the trial or other proceeding, such as when the witness is dying, or will be out of the jurisdiction and therefore cannot be effectively served with a subpoena, or may become incompetent to testify for any legally sufficient reason.</blockquote>

In this case, one of the witnesses fears for his life, but the Commonwealth is not helpless in the face of a perceived threat to its witnesses: presumably it is able to protect its witnesses prior to trial.

Thus, under the rules of evidence, appellants’ refusals to testify would bring them within the definition of unavailable witnesses. I see no reason to employ one definition, of unavailability for purposes of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence and another, more restrictive definition for purposes of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, the trial court in the instant matter properly convened the hearing and sought to preserve appellants’ testimony under Rule 9015 on the ground that appellants would be unavailable for trial.</p>

The trial court found that a hearing was necessary because of appellants’ repeated declarations to refuse to testify despite the grants of immunity. If pre-trial testimony had not been scheduled and the court had waited until a jury in Rizzo’s case was seated before ascertaining with certainty that appellants would refuse to testify, double jeopardy would most likely have attached and the case against Rizzo may have been forever lost. Thus, the trial court properly found that a hearing was necessary in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.</p>

Pursuant to Rule 9015, the trial court was correct in realizing that a hearing was first necessaiy to make the preliminary determination concerning the availability of the witnesses. The fact that the court opted to try to preserve appellant’s testimony at the same proceeding in which it found the witnesses unavailable for trial is inconsequential, as nothing in the rule mandates that the court preserve the testimony in a separate proceeding. Thus, despite the majority’s conclusion to the contrary, the trial court had the authority to conduct the May 30, 1995 hearing.</p>
