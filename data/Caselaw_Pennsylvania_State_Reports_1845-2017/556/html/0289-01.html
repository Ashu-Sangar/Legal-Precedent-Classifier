In <em>Rojas, </em>the First Circuit upheld Rhode Island's exemption for religious employers from its mandatory unemployment compensation scheme, concluding that employees of religious organizations were included with other types of employees "whose employment patterns are irregular or whose wages are not easily accountable.” <em>Rojas, </em><a href="/f3d/127/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="127 F.3d 184" data-case-ids="1000515" data-case-paths="/f3d/127/0184-01">127 </a><a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a><a href="/f3d/127/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="127 F.3d 184" data-case-ids="1000515" data-case-paths="/f3d/127/0184-01">F.3d at 188</a>. The court determined that the overall secular purpose of this exemption was "reducing difficulties in administering an unemployment insurance program," and that "when a 'wide array' of groups are benefited by a provision that pursues a single, unifying, secular end, one of those groups may indeed be religious institutions.” <em><a href="/f3d/127/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="127 F.3d 184" data-case-ids="1000515" data-case-paths="/f3d/127/0184-01">Id.</a></em>

      <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.2",417,[261,1902,1121,466]]]'>We question whether categorically placing employees of religious institutions with casual employees ostensibly for the secular purpose of administrative convenience is too contrived. Surely not all employees of religious organizations work irregular hours for irregular pay, and it is conceivable that an exemption for casual employees that was based on part-time status or hourly wages would better serve the purpose of administrative convenience while remaining religion-neutral. The First Circuit did not address this problem, and it is precisely the sort of difficulty that Justice Scalia indicated in his dissent in <em>Texas </em>Monthly— that courts would have to inquire too deeply into whether religious organizations rationally fit within the broader class of nonreligious organizations who were exempt.</p>

We note that this section also provides exemptions for newspapers (72 P.S. § 7204(30)), textbooks (72 P.S. § 7204(33)), and magazines (72 P.S. § 7204(50)), but not for other kinds of books or publications generally, which are taxed. These exemptions do not rescue the instant exemption, however, because unlike the religious publications exemption, these exemptions are content-neutral, and we can discern no broader secular purpose that would fairly encompass all these exemptions in a single scheme.</p>
