Appellant has attached to his brief, by way of appendices, the affidavits of Dr. Robert Davis, the psychiatrist who originally evaluated Appellant at the request of trial counsel, Dr. Patricia Fleming, a clinical psychologist who, at the request of current counsel, conducted psychological examinations of Appellant, and Dr. Julie Kessel, a psychiatrist. In their affidavits, these medical professionals opine that Appellant suffers from mild mental retardation and that he has a variety of cognitive, social, intellectual, emotional and personality disorders as a result of his childhood and upbringing. They state in their affidavits that they would have been willing to testify at the penalty phase of Appellant’s trial if they had been asked to do so. Also provided are the affidavits of various family members, including Appellant’s mother, describing Appellant’s background and upbringing. They state that Appellant was brought up in a poor environment, that his mother had a drinking problem and that Appellant is not well adjusted. Appellant alleges that had this information been provided to the jurors at the penalty phase, their imposition of the death penalty might have been different. Appellant, accordingly, asserts that he was prejudiced by counsel’s failures in this regard and that he is entitled to a new penalty hearing, or, at a minimum, a remand for a hearing before the PCRA court. We disagree.</p>

Initially, Appellant put off counsel’s request that he submit to a psychiatric evaluation, claiming his sanity. Trial counsel was finally able to convince Appellant to submit to an exam and counsel had one performed. The psychiatrist, Dr. Davis, was provided with a police report detailing the alleged facts of the case. Following his examination of Appellant, Dr. Davis was of the opinion that Appellant did not suffer from any mental impairment that <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>would have negated his criminal responsibility. Dr. Davis informed counsel of his opinion in this regard. Dr. Davis did not recommend further psychological testing. Based on this information, trial counsel did not pursue further discussions with Dr. Davis, as he believed Dr. Davis was not helpful to Appellant’s case. N.T. May 29, 1997 at 30-31.</p>

Affidavit of Dr. Robert Davis, ¶ 6, 8, 10, 11. The record, however, fails to reveal that trial counsel was aware of the circumstances surrounding Appellant’s upbringing.
