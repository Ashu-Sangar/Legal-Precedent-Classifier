Chiropractic Practice Act, 63 P.S. § 625.304. The Chiropractic Practice Act defines the practice of “chiropractic” as including “the use of adjunctive procedures in treating misaligned or dislocated vertebrae or articulations and related conditions of the nervous system.... ” 63 P.S. § 625.102. “Adjunctive procedures” are defined as “[pjhysical measures such as mechanical stimulation, heat, cold, light, air, water, electricity, sound, massage and mobilization.” <em>Id. </em>Because adjunctive procedures are very similar to some of the procedures that physical therapists employ, appellants claim that they in fact perform physical therapy and that they should be permitted to place advertisements offering such therapy.</p>

    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[213,420,1151,366]]]'>63 P.S. § 1302. This definition sets forth the services that licensed “physical therapists” can perform. <em>Id. </em>Inasmuch as the adjunctive procedures of chiropractors and the procedures used by physical therapists both include the use of mechanical stimulation, heat, cold, light, air, water, electricity, sound, massage, and mobilization, it is argued by appellants that both professional groups are engaged in physical therapy.</p>
    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[214,817,1151,418]]]'>While there is indeed some overlap in the procedures used by chiropractors and those used by physical therapists, the differences between the two professional groups insofar as the services that they are licensed to perform are substantial. Chiropractors are not the equivalent of physical therapists. Likewise, physical therapists are not a substitute for chiropractors. Each professional group offers its own range of distinct, licensed services.</p>
    <p id="b393-6" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[206,1272,1159,1067]]]'>Chiropractors are only authorized to use “adjunctive” procedures when “treating misaligned or dislocated vertebrae or articulations and related conditions of the nervous system----” 63 P.S. § 625.102. Physical therapists are permitted to use their treatments in a much less restricted fashion, for, unlike chiropractors, their methods are not confined to treating such a limited set of anatomic problems. See 63 P.S. § 1302, supra (definition of “physical therapy” that licensed physical therapists can perform). Physical therapists can treat any area of the body and are not limited to misalignments and articulations of the nervous system. Further, the practice of physical therapy includes more than the direct use of physical treatment measures. Specifically, “physical therapy” includes the performance of evaluations to aid in the diagnosis and assessment of physical function, the use therapeutic exercises, and the use of rehabilitative procedures such as training in functional activities with or without the use of assistive devices. <em>Id. </em>In short, “adjunctive procedures” and “physical therapy” are substantially different in scope, with the former being far less encompassing than the latter.</p>
    <p id="b394-3" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[263,297,1161,1221]]]'>
      <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>The factor that makes restriction of the chiropractors’ advertisements of physical therapy not a violation of their constitutional freedom of expression is that their services do not amount to what is commonly understood to be the practice of physical therapy. Since the enactment of the PT Act in 1975, the practice of physical therapy has been a regulated and licensed profession. No longer is physical therapy understood to be merely a generic term for physical treatment. Rather, it consists of a statutorily defined set of activities. Because chiropractors are not licensed to perform the full range of those activities, it would mislead the public if chiropractors were permitted to advertise that they offer physical therapy, where, as occurred here, the advertisements did not indicate the very limited scope of therapy that they offer. When the public encounters an advertisement for physical therapy, its rightful expectation is that the therapy consists of services that physical therapists are licensed to perform, and that the services will in fact be performed in a lawful manner by one who is licensed to provide such services. The term “physical therapy,” therefore, connotes more than that physical measures may be applied to certain limited areas of one’s body, but rather that the measures employed can consist of the full range of those that physical therapists are licensed to perform.</p>

    <p id="b396-9" data-blocks='[["BL_396.11",396,[258,1590,1156,527]]]'>I respectfully dissent from the majority’s holding that the Physical Therapy Act, 63 P.S. § 1304(a), (b.l), prohibits chiropractors from advertising that they perform physical therapy. Commercial speech is entitled to greater protection than that accorded by the majority under both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See, 44 Liquormart, Inc. v.

Here, the governmental interest cited is ostensibly to protect the public from being misled that chiropractors and physical therapists render the same services. The fallacy inherent in this governmental interest is twofold: (1) chiropractors do, in fact, perform some of the same services as physical therapists; and (2) appellants clearly stated in their advertisements that they were chiropractors.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[223,864,1154,1164]]]'>Chiropractors can be certified under the Chiropractic Act, 63 P.S. § 625.102, to perform “adjunctive procedures” which include “[pjhysical measures such as mechanical stimulation, heat, cold, light, air, water, electricity, sound, massage and mobilization.” This list of procedures is in direct accord with the Physical Therapy Act’s definition of “physical therapy” as quoted by the majority. Notwithstanding that the definition of “adjunctive procedures” and “physical therapy” are substantially identical, the majority nevertheless concludes that while there is some overlap in procedures, chiropractors are not the equivalent of physical therapists. There is no question that the two professions are separate and distinct; however, the fact remains that the members of those distinct professions do provide some of the same services. Appellants are certified to perform “adjunctive procedures;” therefore, they perform some physical therapy. Thus, because appellants are certified to provide the services which they advertised, and because they did not hold themselves out as physical therapists, but rather clearly identified themselves as chiropractors, no substantial government interest exists to support the statutory ban on advertising by chiropractors providing physical therapy services.</p>

    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.7",398,[237,1143,1158,744]]]'>The Physical Therapy Act ban on advertising of physical therapy services by anyone other than a licensed physical therapist is precisely the type of ban contemplated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>44 Liquormart. </em>It effectively prevents chiropractors from advertising certain services that they are certified to provide simply because they are not licensed under the Physical Therapy Act. Because appellants’ are certified to perform the advertised services, it defies logic that their advertisements could be considered misleading. This is a clear violation of appellants’ free speech rights that is not justified by any governmental interest in the protection of consumers. Accordingly, the decision of the Commonwealth Court should be reversed and the dismissal of the charges against appellants reinstated.</p>
