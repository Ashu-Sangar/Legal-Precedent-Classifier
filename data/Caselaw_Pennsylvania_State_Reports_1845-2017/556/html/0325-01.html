Employer presented the expert deposition testimony of James P. Valeriano, M.D., a board-certified neurologist. Dr. Valeriano testified that he had examined claimant twice. When asked if the physical symptoms of which claimant complained were causally related to the injuries sustained in 1983, Dr. Valeriano responded, “I don’t think they physically could have caused the problems he had.” Instead, Dr. Valeriano testified that “the main component of claimant’s problem was a psychiatric problem,” and that he could not ascertain any physical cause for the pain of which claimant complained. When asked if the psychological component was itself related to the 1983 accident, Dr. Valeriano responded that “there is almost no way that I can say that because I didn’t know him before.”</p>

Accordingly, claimant’s subsequently alleged psychiatric injuries could have formed the predicate for compensation under the Act only if the Notice of Compensation Payable was first properly modified, in accordance with §§ 771 and 772, <em>supra, </em>to reflect the employer’s increased liability for these distinct injuries. Sections 771 and 772 establish that an employer’s liability, as set forth in the Notice of Compensation Payable, may be so modified only “if it be <em>proved </em>” that the original Notice “was in any material respect incorrect,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> or <em>“upon proof </em>that the disability of the injured employee has increased, decreased, [etc.],” pursuant to a “petition filed by either party with the department” (emphasis added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, the statute allows either party to file a petition with the department seeking a modification of the original Notice of Compensation Payable, and by clear implication requires the moving party to meet the burden of <em>proving </em>the grounds for the modification.</p>

Employer had no burden to disprove a causal relationship between the work-related injury and a subsequently alleged psychiatric injury where the Notice of Compensation Payable set forth liability only for the physical injuries suffered from the work-related accident. Consequently, since the terms of the original Notice of Compensation Payable are “valid and binding unless modified or set aside,” 77 P.S. § 731, <em>supra, </em>and since claimant did not attempt to modify the terms of the original Notice of Compensation Payable in accordance with §§ 771-772, the lower tribunals erred by failing to confine their analysis of employer’s termination petition to whether the injuries set forth in the original Notice of Compensation Payable had been resolved. Since the uncontested expert testimony of Dr. Valeriano, as credited by the WCJ, established that these physical injuries had indeed been resolved, the Petition to Terminate Benefits should have been granted.</p>

Regardless of whether the employer had notice of the purported psychiatric injury at the time that the Notice of Compensation Payable was executed, and regardless of how much time elapsed before the psychiatric injury arguably manifested itself, the employer would have to prove the absence of any causal relationship between the psychiatric injury and the work-related accident. We will not strain the humanitarian goals underlying the Workmen’s Compensation Act by holding that employees may remain perpetually eligible for compensation merely by alleging psychiatric injury at the eleventh hour and waiting to see <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>whether the employer can adduce the requisite expert testimony to disprove a causal nexus.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

However, the claimant subsequently developed pain and swelling in his left leg, attributable to "deep <em>venous </em>thrombosis” or a blood clot. This Court relied on <em>Beissel v.

It is important to emphasize that the injuries at issue in <em>Gumro </em>were of a very similar <em>physical </em>nature. However, in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the injury for which the employee sought benefits was an injury which plainly fell outside the scope of liability to which the employer had stipulated in the Notice of Compensation Payable because it was an entirely different type of injury, distinct in kind from the injury described in the Notice of Compensation Payable. In <em>Gumro, </em>the injury at issue was not distinct in kind, if indeed it was distinct at all, from the injury for which the employer had accepted liability in the Notice of Compensation Payable.</p>

The dissent would remand this matter for "a determination as to whether the original physical injury as described in the Notice of <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>Compensation Payable is still operative without reference to any psychological overlay....” However, as stated above (Op. at 903), this determination has already been made. Dr. Valeriano, in uncontradicted expert testimony, testified that he could not ascertain any physical cause for the pain of which claimant complained and that the main component of claimant's problem was psychiatric. Consequently, we believe that employer met its burden of demonstrating that claimant’s physical injuries subsided. Thus, after almost thirteen years of litigation over this termination petition, we determine that closure is both appropriate and necessary based on the facts of record.</p>

With regard to Claimant’s physical injury, Employer’s medical witness testified that Claimant suffers from “a fair amount of pain generated from [Claimant’s] accident” and the development of “a chronic pain syndrome.” Furthermore, Employer’s medical witness admitted to having only “inconsistent” objective diagnostic data from his physical examination of Claimant because of his severe bodily tremors.
