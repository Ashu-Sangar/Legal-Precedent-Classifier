This case raises an issue of first impression regarding the proper interpretation of a valid majority to elect a union representative under Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 287, as amended, Act No. Ill (Act 111). 43 P.S. §§ 217.1-217.10. For the following reasons, we reverse the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the finding of the PLRB that the number of votes cast in favor of the Teamsters constituted a proper majority to designate them the police force’s exclusive representative.</p>

Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, as amended, 43 P.S. §§ 217.1—217.10. The parties stipulated to the unit composition, the site of the election, the position on the ballots, the eligibility list and other election protocol. On October 20, 1995, an election by secret ballot was conducted pursuant to the Order and Notice of Election issued by the PLRB. Only <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>four of the twelve eligible officers voted, with all four votes cast in- favor of representation by the Teamsters. Thereafter, the PLRB issued a Nisi Order of Certification designating the Teamsters as the exclusive representative of the entire twelve-member police force. Whitaker filed exceptions, claiming that four out of twelve eligible votes do not constitute the required majority under Act 111. The PLRB denied Whitaker’s exceptions. The Commonwealth Court, in a split decision, reversed, finding that four votes did not constitute a majority of the Whitaker police force and was therefore insufficient to certify a union representative.</p>

While the phrase “majority of the employes in a unit ...” is not further defined or explained, this Court has recognized that the PLRA was designed to protect the rights of employees to organize and bargain collectively and must therefore be liberally construed to give effect to its remedial purpose. <em>See, e.g., Petition of Salvation Army, </em><a href="/pa/349/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="349 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="458654" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0105-01">349 Pa. 105</a>, 108, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20479" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="36 A.2d 479">36 A.2d 479</a>, 480 (1944). In seeking to effect such purpose, we further recognize that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) is a federal statute also enacted to protect employees’ right to organize and to bargain collectively, and that it was enacted, in part, to ensure the <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>consistent treatment of management-labor relations from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20151-169" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169">29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169</a>. Thus, where PLRA legislation is ambiguous, this Court has recognized the appropriateness of harmonizing the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation on collective bargaining with federal statutes intended to serve similar ends. <em>See Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v.
