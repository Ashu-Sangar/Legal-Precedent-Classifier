    <p id="b379-9" data-blocks='[["BL_379.10",379,[222,1037,1154,690]]]'>This case was initiated by the filing of a complaint alleging sexual harassment with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (the commission) against the First Judicial District Adult Probation Department (the appellee). The complainant, an employee of the appellee, alleged that she was sexually harassed by a co-worker, and that the perpetrator was suspended for thirty days and assigned to a different location. This did not resolve the matter to the complainant’s satisfaction, however, because, as she further alleged in her complaint, it was unclear whether the suspension and reassignment were related to the alleged sexual harassment and because the appellee failed to “clearly condemn” the actions alleged.</p>
    <p id="b379-10" data-blocks='[["BL_379.11",379,[217,1758,1159,357]]]'>The appellee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint before the commission for lack of jurisdiction under the separation of powers doctrine and recent caselaw. The complainant responded by stating that “what she [seeks] through policy changes is a system that would reprimand, discipline and/or mandate dismissal in cases of sexual harassment where it is warranted.” R.R. at 19.</p>
    <p id="b379-11" data-blocks='[["BL_379.12",379,[216,2153,1152,204]]]'>The commission issued an interlocutory order which ruled that it had jurisdiction over the judiciary in this case.

The Commonwealth Court noted that although it had earlier held in <em>County of Allegheny v.

The Commonwealth Court went on to observe that “when a complainant requests the Commission to direct the judiciary to institute a policy regarding a hostile work environment and addressing the discipline imposed for sexual harassment in the workplace, the remedy sought implicates the supervisory function of the judiciary.” <em><a href="/pa/507/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="488 A.2d 277" data-case-ids="1792348,627032" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0066-01,/pa-super/339/0001-01">Id.</a> </em>The Commonwealth Court held, therefore, that the commission was without jurisdiction to hear the merits of the complaint.</p>

In that case, the commission sought to assert jurisdiction over the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County in a complaint alleging that a court employee was fired because of his race. Although we held that the commission had no jurisdiction in such a case because of the separation of powers doctrine, we did not reject the rationale <em>County of Allegheny v. Wilcox, </em>76 Pa.Cmwlth. 584, <a href="/citations/?q=465%20A.2d%2047" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="465 A.2d 47">465 A.2d 47</a> (1983), wherein the Commonwealth Court had held that the commission may require a court to equalize pay in a gender discrimination suit under the Human Relations Act without violating the separation of powers doctrine. Thus, the state of the law concerning the commission’s jurisdiction following <em>Erie v. PHRC </em>could be summarized as allowing the commission’s involvement in some aspects of court personnel policies and practices, but not others. In order to discover whether a particular involvement was acceptable, the matter would have to be adjudicated to determine whether it was impermissibly invasive under the constitution. We now reject this view. Further, we hold that the commission has no jurisdiction, because of the separation <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>of powers doctrine, to adjudicate any complaints against the judicial branch.</p>
    <p id="b383-4" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[222,443,1157,861]]]'>This holding is only a logical extension of the holding in <em>Erie v.

Pa. Labor Relations Bd., </em><a href="/pa/479/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="479 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1742131" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0440-01">479 Pa. 440</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="479 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1742131" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0440-01">388 A.2d 736</a> (1978). It is self-evident that if the commission imposed methods of employee selection or supervision or discharge, or directed that certain working conditions rather than others must apply, judges would have lost the power to control these aspects of the operation of the courts. The fundamental error in <em>Wilcox </em>was not recognizing that a non-judicial agency’s involvement in running the courts can never survive constitutional scrutiny, for no matter how innocuous the involvement may seem, the fact remains that if an agency of the executive branch instructs a court on its employment policies, of necessity, the courts themselves are not supervising their operations.</p>
