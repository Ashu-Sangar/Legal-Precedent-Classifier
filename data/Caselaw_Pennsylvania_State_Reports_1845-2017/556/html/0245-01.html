The case went to trial and on December 12, 1995, a jury returned a verdict against the defendants in the amount of $9,000,000. On December 6, 1996, the trial court entered an order adding delay damages to the verdict under Rule of Civil Procedure 238 in the amount of $2,047,963.50 for a total award of $11,047,963.50.</p>

With respect to post-judgment interest, the court concluded that such interest does not impose additional liability over the statutory cap. Rather, like interest on other debts, the CAT Fund must pay post-judgment interest on its portion of the award that is not timely paid. However, the court held that the CAT Fund is not liable for delay damages under Rule of Civil Procedure 238.
