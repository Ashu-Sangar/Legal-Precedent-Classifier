    <p id="b632-6" data-blocks='[["BL_632.7",632,[258,663,1159,796]]]'>Shortly after midnight on May 22, 1987, Mikell arrived at the home of Anthony Rice (“Rice”) at 6024 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. At the time, Rice was sitting on the porch along with his younger brother, Joseph, Narvell Coleman (“Coleman”), and two men identified only as Rob and Alfred. The group remained on the porch throughout the early morning hours, talking and smoking marijuana. At one point, Mikell announced that he wanted to get some money to go to a show and produced a handgun. At approximately 5:00 a.m., LeRoy Shelly, the next-door neighbor of the Rices, was awakened by the noise from the group and went to his front door. Apparently, this prompted Mikell and the others to leave the porch, and Mikell, the Rice. brothers, and Coleman walked along Walnut Street. Eventually, Joseph Rice parted company with the others, who continued in the direction of Market Street.</p>
    <p id="b632-7" data-blocks='[["BL_632.8",632,[259,1485,1158,305]]]'>At about the same time, Mr. Johnston, having completed a twelve-hour shift for the United Cab Company, returned to the cab depot and was advised that another cab was available. At approximately 6:00 a.m., Mr. Johnston’s cab was observed parking along Sansom Street near the intersection of 60th Street.</p>

Shortly thereafter, the group happened upon Mr. Johnston’s cab on Sansom Street. Upon seeing the cab, Mikell ran toward it, opened the rear door, and climbed into the back seat, while Rice and Coleman acted as lookouts from the street corner. Mikell demanded money, he struggled with Mr. Johnston, and ultimately shot him. Mikell then took Mr. Johnston’s money and fled along 59th Street. Rice and Coleman also fled, running down 60th Street. Mr. Johnston was found dead later that same morning, the cause <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>of death being a close-range gunshot wound behind his left ear.</p>
    <p id="b633-4" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[203,422,1153,625]]]'>On the evening of May 22, Rice related to Mr. Shelly that Mikell had shot and killed a cab driver. The following day, Mr. Shelly questioned Rice to confirm the story and later reported the information to a friend who was a police officer. When the police interviewed Rice, he denied having any involvement in the crime, but he inculpated Mikell. Based upon Rice’s statement, Mikell was arrested for murder, robbery, and possession of an instrument of crime. A search warrant was also issued for the separate homes of Mikell’s father, mother, and paternal grandfather; however, no evidence connecting Mikell to the robbery or murder was found during those searches.</p>
    <p id="b633-5" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[198,1071,1156,935]]]'>On July 1, 1988, Mikell’s jury trial ended in a mistrial after the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict. On January 18, 1989, a second jury trial commenced, during which the Commonwealth presented testimony from, <em>inter alia, </em>the police officers who investigated the crime scene, Malverse Fleming, who observed Mr. Johnston’s cab on the morning of the crime, and an assistant medical examiner, who testified regarding the results of the autopsy. The only eyewitness testimony was from Rice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Prior to testifying, Rice admitted to the district attorney that he had lied about his role in the robbery and acknowledged that he knew about the incident and had acted as a lookout. As a consequence of his admission, Rice was granted immunity from the use of his testimony. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5947 (immunity of witnesses). The Commonwealth also sought to prove circumstantially that Mikell was living at the business operated by his paternal grandfather, Abdullahi Suleiman, which was located at 146 South 60th Street and was within a few blocks of the crime scene.</p>

The defense sought to establish, as mitigating circumstances, Mikell’s age (19 years), his lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions, his lack of capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, and the general or catchall mitigating circumstance. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1), (3), (4), and (8).

Mikell also filed various <em>pro se </em>motions, alleging, in significant part, that his counsel had been ineffective in failing to request an alibi instruction. Over the course of several years, Mikell was represented by a series of court-appointed attorneys and, during the disposition of post-verdict motions, by privately retained counsel. Although the trial court issued a draft opinion dated December 4, 1991, indicating its intention to deny post-verdict motions, an argument on those motions was not held on until February 14,1995. At the conclusion of the argument, the trial court formally denied the motions and re-imposed the death sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In addition, the <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>trial court imposed concurrent sentences of ten to twenty years’ imprisonment for the robbery conviction and one to two years’ imprisonment for possession of an instrument of crime.</p>

To establish murder in the first degree, the Commonwealth must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant specifically intended to kill, which fact is established by proof of premeditation and deliberation. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Such proof provided a more than adequate basis for the jury to conclude that Mikell committed the crime with the specific intent to kill. Mikell contends, however, that this evidence was only sufficient to establish murder in the second degree.

The fact that Rice’s credibility was placed before the jury does not excuse the failure to request an instruction as to the substantive defense presented. As noted, alibi evidence, even if not wholly believed, together with other evidence, may raise a reasonable doubt. <em>See Pounds, </em><a href="/pa/490/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="490 Pa. 621" data-case-ids="1763778" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0621-01">490 Pa. at 633</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="490 Pa. 621" data-case-ids="1763778" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0621-01">417 A.2d at 603</a>.

As a result, the Commonwealth argues, the strength or weakness of Mikell’s alibi did not enter into the jury’s decision. Similarly, the trial court reasoned that an alibi instruction was unnecessary, because the alibi defense was presented to the jury, which apparently chose to believe the witnesses for the Commonwealth, .as opposed to those for the defense. Both the Commonwealth’s argument and the trial court’s reasoning, however, fail to acknowledge that one of the purposes of an alibi instruction is to ensure that a jury does not interpret the failure to prove the defense as evidence of a defendant’s guilt. Furthermore, since the jury was never informed how to assess Mikell’s alibi evidence, he was effectively deprived of a substantive defense. Under the circumstances, counsel’s inexplicable failure to request an alibi instruction constituted constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel such as to entitle Mikell to a new trial. <em>See Commonwealth v.
