In one of those assaults, Keaton caused the strangulation death of his victim, Sherrill Ann Hall. As a consequence of this killing, a jury found Keaton guilty of first degree murder. A sentence of death was imposed and this direct appeal followed. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b569-9" data-blocks='[["BL_569.9",569,[218,1135,1156,789]]]'>The trial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, reveals that on the night of June 1,1992, Keaton was standing on a street corner in North Philadelphia when he saw Michelle B., whom he recognized as having been a classmate in junior high school more than fifteen years earlier. Keaton approached Michelle B., who was on her way to her aunt’s house, and asked why they had never “gotten together” in school. When Michelle B. responded that she did not know, Keaton said, “Well, we’re going to get together now.” At this point, Keaton produced a gun, pressed it into Michelle B.’s side, and forced her to proceed with him to an abandoned house several blocks away on Redner Street. Once inside the house, which was full of trash and debris, Keaton forced Michelle B. into a room with an old mattress, where he ordered her to disrobe and then raped her.</p>
    <p id="b569-10" data-blocks='[["BL_569.10",569,[213,1947,1155,414]],["BL_570.1",570,[263,308,1159,730]]]'>After the rape, Keaton gave his victim back her pants and shirt, but retained her bra and panties, which he placed in his jacket. He did not, however, allow her to leave. Seeing that she was still in Keaton’s power, Michelle B. suggested that they visit a nearby establishment known as the Motorcycle Club, where they would be more comfortable, and where, unbeknownst to Keaton, Michelle B.’s godfather was a member. Keaton at first agreed, but as they approached the club, <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>he became suspicious that Michelle B. was “playing games” with him. Keaton then slapped and punched Michelle B., and then picked her up and carried her through an empty lot to another abandoned house, this one on West Oxford Street, two blocks from the first house. Once inside this second house, which was also full of debris, Keaton again forced his victim to undress, and then tied her wrists and ankles together, and raped her anally. Keaton inserted a tree branch into Michelle B.’s vagina several times, and repeated this act with a wine bottle. After this, Keaton urinated into his victim’s mouth, and then severely beat her on her back and buttocks with a weightlifter’s belt. He then removed all the money from her pocketbook, gave her back her pants and shirt, and released her, leaving her bra and panties in the house.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[264,1061,1158,360]]]'>After wandering the streets for several hours, Michelle B. saw Officer Pat Repholz of the Philadelphia Police Department, whom she had known from the neighborhood for many years. When she recounted to Officer Repholz what had happened, the patrolman accompanied her back to the West Oxford Street house and collected evidence, including the bottle, the tree branch, the bra and the panties.</p>
    <p id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.6",570,[264,1446,1159,734]]]'>After Michelle B. was transported to the hospital, specimens were removed from her vaginal, vulva, cervical and anal areas. The vaginal, vulva and cervical swabs were all bloody and all tested positive for both spermatazoa and prostatic acid phosphatase, a substance in semen. Additionally, the anal swab tested positive for spermatazoa, but was inconclusive as to the presence of acid phosphatase. Subsequent testing by the Philadelphia Police Department’s criminalistics laboratory indicated that the wine bottle tested positive for both blood and spermatazoa; the tree branch tested negative for blood, but positive for spermatazoa; the panties and bra recovered from the West Oxford Street house were stained with blood, but tests for seminal stains were negative; and Michelle B.’s pants and shirt tested positive for both blood and spermatazoa.</p>

Nadine S. was walking from a friend’s house to the Motorcycle Club where Michelle B. had attempted to go after being raped. On seeing Nadine S., Keaton approached her and forcibly turned her around so her back was to him, placed his arm firmly around her neck, stated that he had a gun, and placed a bullet in her hand, telling her that the bullet was for her. He then forced her into a nearby abandoned house and blocked the door from the inside with a large stick. Keaton then retrieved a flashlight and forced his victim up a flight of stairs and into a room where there was a cot. After this, Keaton ordered her to undress. After Nadine S. complied, Keaton placed a rope that had been fashioned into a noose tightly around her neck and told her that the noose’s purpose was to “motivate” her. He then forced her to perform oral sex on him, following which he raped her anally. Ultimately, Keaton coerced his victim to perform additional oral sex, until she spit the semen onto the floor.</p>
    <p id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[222,1397,1153,632]]]'>Nadine S. then began to cry, and Keaton told her to “shut up,” and that if he killed her nobody would ever know. Keaton then explained that he was exacting revenge for a prior incident in which he had approached Nadine S. in a bar, and she had rebuffed him. Every time Nadine S. tried to say something, Keaton would pull the noose tighter and tell her he did not want to hear her talk. After this, Keaton raped Nadine S. vaginally, and then told her to put her clothes on and leave with him, because the house was about to explode due to a bomb he had planted. When they left the house, Keaton continued to terrorize Nadine S. by following her and telling her to keep running every time she looked back.</p>

Officers Paula Robinson and Jose Perez met Nadine S. at the garage and returned with her to the scene of the crime to gather evidence. The officers noticed that Nadine S. was very upset, her clothes were dirty, and her hair disheveled. According to Patrolman Perez, when they <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>arrived at the house, Nadine S. was trembling and frightened, and initially would not enter. Eventually, the officers persuaded her to show them where the attack had taken place. When they reached the room where the assault had occurred, Officer Perez noticed that a rope was tied to a part of the cot, and that there was what appeared to be a semen stain on the floor.</p>

The knot pressing into Ms. Hall’s throat was tied so tightly that the medical examiner was unable to untie it, but had to cut it with a razor blade. Additionally, she had a tan jacket on her arms, which were positioned high above her head, with the remainder of the jacket twisted around behind her, and then tied around her neck.</p>

A procedure which includes the opportunity for oral questioning by counsel of necessity entails a greater degree of flexibility in terms of the exact phraseology of questions than does a procedure which relies exclusively upon a written questionnaire. In the latter case, counsel will have greater opportunity to reflect and refine questions, and jurors' responses may be obtained without the benefit of interchange. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

Notably, in the present case, the trial court followed the common practice of allowing for the conduct of <em>voir dire </em>employing both written interrogatories and oral questioning by counsel. That defense counsel may have had the opportunity to include life qualification questions among the written interrogatories, however, does not validate the trial court's subsequent refusal to allow the oral life qualification of Mr. Sanginiti. Ráther, since the record does not reflect notice to counsel that such questions would be limited to the written form, it was error to foreclose counsel from probing the juror’s views concerning the imposition of a life sentence during the oral <em>voir dire.</em>
