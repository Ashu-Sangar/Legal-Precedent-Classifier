For the reasons that follow, we find that the Commission has the authority to enforce the Military Affairs Act at its own initiative, that the Commission correctly determined that the Housing Authority violated the Military Affairs Act by selecting a non-veteran candidate to fill its Executive Director position under these circumstances, and that the relevant provisions of the Military Affairs Act comport with the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.

Consequently, the Court determined that in order for the statute to operate in a rational and, hence, a constitutional manner, the authorities charged with appointing candidates to non-civil service positions must be able to assess a candidate’s “ability to perform” in determining whether the candidate is eligible for the position. However, we now find that in the' civil service context, a candidate’s “ability to perform” is to be measured exclusively by whether the candidate has successfully undergone civil service testing for purposes of determining eligibility for appointment. The appointing authority is not permitted to impose independent requirements to ensure that a specific candidate possesses the requisite qualifications for the job. Our conclusion in this regard derives support from an abundance of statutory sources, from our own precedent, and from • sound policy considerations.</p>

      <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>Thus, a clear line can be discerned in our jurisprudence between mandatory veterans’ preference in the context of appointment to a civil service position as opposed to the context of promotion to a civil service position from within the promoting agency or organization. The operation of the mandatory veterans’ preference provisions in the former context is constitutional; in the latter context it is not. The reason for this distinction is simple. In the promotions context, the competing candidates are seeking to move up from within the same organization. They will have had ample opportunity during their tenure in that agency or organization to hone the skills relative to the promotion which they seek. If, during the period in which they have had the opportunity to develop their skills in the exact same environment as the rival candidates, they have failed to progress to the same skill level as those rivals, then the fact that they had experience in the armed services is not probative and does not justify the candidate’s shortcomings. On the other hand, when candidates seek appointment to a position in an organization or agency in which none of them have any experience, the fact that one of the candidates has military experience may rationally be viewed as that which distinguishes him as the superior candidate for the position. <em>See Schmid, supra, </em><a href="/pa/333/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="333 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1187944" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0568-01">333 Pa. at 573</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20701" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="3 A.2d 701">3 A.2d at 703</a> (“As a basis for <em>appointment </em>it is not unreasonable to select war veterans from candidates for office and to give them a certain credit in recognition of the discipline, experience, and service represented by their military activity”) (emphasis added). In the appointments context, employers have not been able to compare the candidates’ performance in the same workplace as they have in the promotions context. Thus, in the appointments context, it is not unreasonable for the legislature to use military experience as the factor which distinguishes candidates from different backgrounds who are within the top three on the Eligible List. The fact that the position at issue here is a non-entry-level position as opposed to an entry-level position simply does not alter the reasonableness of the distinction under the principles of <em>Schmid.</em>

Our reasons are twofold. First, the dicta from <em>Hoffman </em>is not persuasive since it misconstrues the meaning of Article I, Section 17. Under the <em>Hoffman </em>dicta, a legislative enactment that afforded a categorical parking preference to the permanently handicapped would be unconstitutional, since one’s status as a permanently handicapped person is not subject to revocation. This would be absurd. Thus, all that Article I, Section 17 means is that the legislature may not attempt to prevent future legislatures from revoking any privilege that has been granted. <em>See Hoffman, supra, </em><a href="/pa/544/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="544 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="463524" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0499-01">544 Pa. at 506</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="677 A.2d 1200" data-case-ids="463524,7876278" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0499-01,/a2d/677/1200-01">677 A.2d at 1203</a> (Zappala and Castille, JJ., dissenting).

Here, the applicable legislation is the Civil Service Act. Nowhere in the Civil Service Act is the Commission granted the explicit authority to enforce the veterans’ preference provisions of the Military Affairs Act.</p>

As noted by the majority, “the crux of this matter is whether Management Directive 580.21 Amended, which essentially incorporates section 7104(b) of the Military Affairs Act, was validly enacted by the Commission.” Majority Opinion at 942. If so, the Commission has the authority to <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>enforce it <em>sua sponte.</em>
