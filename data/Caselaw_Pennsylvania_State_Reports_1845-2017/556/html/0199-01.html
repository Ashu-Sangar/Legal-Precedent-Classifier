Because we find that a utility company does not violate its statutory duties in such a situation, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.</p>

The policy allowed landlords to sign an agreement with West Penn which permitted West Penn to either disconnect service or put the service in the landlord’s name if the tenant notified West Penn that the tenant no longer desired electric service. This policy was instituted because West Penn was experiencing financial losses when tenants would vacate a residence and West Penn was forced to continue service <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>without having the ability to bill either the tenant who left the property or the landlord if the landlord refused to have service switched over to the landlord’s account. West Penn notified customers of this available option via a notice enclosed in a monthly bill. West Penn’s written internal procedures in effect during this time stated that West Penn would disconnect all service at the request of a tenant unless the landlord had entered into a “landlord/tenant agreement.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The policy was never made a part of West Penn’s tariff,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which was filed with the other appellant, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (“PUC”).

The tenant occupied appellees’ rental property from July 27, 1988 until October 31, 1989, when the tenant vacated the premises under the threat of eviction by appellees for non-payment of rent. During this entire period, the electric bills were in the tenant’s name.</p>

The West Penn representative then checked the company’s files to determine whether appellees had entered into a landlord/tenant agreement with West Penn. Since there was no agreement in its files, West Penn began processing a disconnection order for appellees’ rental property -without notifying appellees.</p>

Consequently, the heating system at the property was unable to function since it was dependent on electric service to operate. At the time of disconnection and for several days thereafter, temperatures in the area surrounding appellees’ rental property reached below freezing. As a result of the freezing temperatures and the inability of the heating system to operate, the pipes and radiators burst, causing water to spill throughout the house and damaging the floors, floor coverings, walls, ceilings, plumbing fixtures and electrical wiring. Appellees did not discover the damage until they visited the property on December 11, 1989. This date was also the first time that appellees discovered that West Penn had disconnected the electric service.</p>

The complaint alleged that West Penn’s disconnection of service without notification to them as owners of the property was negligent, unreasonable and a violation of PUC regulations. Thus, appellees demanded monetary damages from West Penn in order to compensate them for the damages that the house incurred as a result of the service disconnection.</p>

After conducting hearings, an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) ordered West Penn to cease strict enforcement of its landlord/tenant agreement policy until it obtained PUC approval of this policy as part of its tariff, pursuant to 52 Pa.Code § 53.25.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The ALJ also ordered West Penn to pay a monetary penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) because he found that West Penn’s discontinuance of service to appellees’ property in accordance with its landlord/tenant agreement policy, which was not a part of its tariff, constituted unreasonable and inadequate service under Section 1501.</p>

While the PUC believed that West Penn had exercised poor judgment in disconnecting service during a period of extreme temperatures, the PUC reversed the ALJ and dismissed appellees’ complaint on the basis that the Public Utility Code and related regulations did not obligate West Penn to notify non-ratepaying landlords such as appellees that service was being disconnected at their property. The PUC determined that West Penn had furnished reasonable and adequate service to its ratepayer, the tenant, when it discontinued service to the property at the tenant’s request.</p>

The dissenting member of the Commonwealth Court panel argued that the majority unnecessarily expanded the duties that a utility company owed to individuals not paying for the service and that the majority failed to give proper deference to the PUC’s interpretation of West Penn’s statutory duties.</p>

Regarding the “reasonableness” of the regulation at issue, we find that the regulation was neither arbitrary nor promulgated in bad faith, and thus that it is “reasonable” under' the established test. Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to require public utilities to continue to provide service to a non-ratepayer until notice could be properly effectuated, even where the non-ratepayer had an opportunity to enter into an agreement with the public utility to protect itself but chose not to do so. Such a result would be neither equitable nor reasonable. If non-ratepaying landlords desire notice of impending termination of service, they may either (1) pay for the electric service themselves in order to reap the protection of 66 Pa.C.S. §§ 1521 <em>et </em>seq(2) file the requisite agreement, such as that offered by West Penn, with the public utility or (3) incorporate into the lease agreement a requirement that the ratepaying tenant notify the landlord within a reasonable time of any planned discontinuation of service so that the' landlord has the option of continuing service once the tenant decides to terminate it. This Court will not rectify a landlord’s failure to protect himself contractually by creating a statutory duty out of whole cloth for public utilities to provide notice to non-ratepaying landlords.

The section states that when a ratepayer requests that one of his utilities be discontinued, but does not reside at the property at which the utility service is to be discontinued, the utility company must either obtain a signed written statement from the ratepayer verifying that the property is not occupied, or get oral or written consent from the occupants of the property who would be affected by the cessation of service before proceeding to discontinue the utility service there. 52 Pa.Code § 56.72(2)(i)(A), (B).</p>

Instead, West Penn simply discontinued its provision of electric service to Appellees’ property without providing advance notice to them, even though it knew that the heater at the property was dependent on electric service. As a result, when Appellees arrived at their property on December 11, 1989, just four days after West Penn disconnected the electric service, and just seven days after the tenant requested that the electric service be discontinued, they were greeted with a burst radiator and pipes, as well as extensive water damage to the floors, wall coverings, walls, ceilings, plumbing fixtures, and electrical wiring.</p>

Iceland Products, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/475/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="475 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1734141" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0610-01">475 Pa. 610</a>, 613 n. 4, <a href="/pa/475/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="475 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1734141" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0610-01">381 A.2d 441</a>, 443 n. 4 (1977). Appellees argued before the ALJ that the applicable notice regulation for West Penn to follow was not section 56.72(1), but section 56.72(2)(ii), because the tenant was no longer residing at the rental property when she requested that West Penn discontinue providing electric service there. (N.T., 3/9/93, at 89, 135.) Accordingly, the issue of the applicability of section 56.72(1) is apparent from the record, and is a proper basis upon which this Court can affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court. Finally, I would add that the Majority’s assertion that the Commonwealth Court’s "characterization” of the record somehow indicates that section 56.72(1) was both applicable to this matter and fully complied with by West Penn is not supported by the Commonwealth Court's published majority opinion at <a href="/a2d/663/0809-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="663 A.2d 809" data-case-ids="7876392" data-case-paths="/a2d/663/0809-01">663 A.2d 809</a> (Pa.Commw.1995).</p>

It is unclear from the record whether or not the tenant informed West Penn that she was no longer residing at Appellees’ rental property when <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>she called on December 4, 1989 and asked West Penn to discontinue providing electric service to the property. Assuming that the tenant did not so inform West Penn, the utility company nevertheless should have known that the tenant was not currently residing at Appellees' property, because it knew that the heating system at the property was dependent on electric service to operate, and the tenant was requesting that West Penn discontinue providing electric service at Appellees' property in the dead of winter.</p>
