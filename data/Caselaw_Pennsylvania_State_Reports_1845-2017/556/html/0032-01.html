Appellant said that Pablo had killed appellant’s brother and either Pablo or Carlos Tirado “had to go.” Gilberto Giraud Romero, who was also charged in connection with the murder of Pablo Ortiz, testified for the Commonwealth against appellant and his two co-defendants. Romero testified that on May 6, the day after Miquel Pirela’s death, at about 1:00 p.m., he went to his sister’s home. There both appellant and his brother, Heriberto Pirela, announced their intentions to kill Pablo Ortiz. Approximately 20 minutes later Ortiz joined the men. Both Pirela brothers inflicted a brutal beating upon Ortiz who was struck by fists and by a tire which was mounted on a rim. Ortiz was then pushed into the basement of the house where the beating continued. Eventually, Heriberto Pirela instructed Carlos Tirado to inject Ortiz with battery acid, or face death himself. While appellant and Pedro Torres held Ortiz’s hands, the injection was accomplished. Ortiz became unconscious.</blockquote>

The PCRA court stated that appellant must establish ineffective assistance of counsel and also, citing <em>verbatim </em>the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(h), that counsel’s ineffectiveness "so undermined the truth-determining process so that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.” Appellant argues a PCRA defendant only must satisfy the direct appeal standard of prejudice, i.e., that counsel’s ineffectiveness undermined confidence in the outcome or that the result might have been different. He claims that he need not demonstrate that counsel’s ineffectiveness also would have affected the trial’s outcome.</p>
