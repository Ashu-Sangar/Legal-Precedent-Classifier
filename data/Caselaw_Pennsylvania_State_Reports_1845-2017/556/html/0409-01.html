The officer positioned his police cruiser alongside Hock’s automobile and requested that she produce her driver’s license. Hock refused, stating that she had not been driving, but was merely engaged in paperwork. Hock then exited her vehicle and suggested to Officer Shank that she was a victim of frequent police harassment. Remaining in his cruiser, Officer Shank indicated that if his verification of Hock’s driving record revealed that her privileges were suspended, she would receive a citation by mail. As Hock walked away from the police vehicle, she uttered, “F_you, a_,” in a normal tone of voice audible to Officer Shank. Only Hock and the officer were present, and the officer was seated in his cruiser. He then exited his vehicle and advised Hock that she was under arrest for disorderly conduct.</p>

Officer Shank pursued her up one flight of stairs, physically restraining her as she attempted to enter her apartment. As the officer placed handcuffs on Hock, he repeated that she was being arrested for disorderly conduct. Hock pressed her arms tightly, to her body and curled into a ball on the floor, shouting protestations. She then kicked the patrolman several times, causing him to sustain a cut finger and jammed wrist. Hock was subsequently charged with resisting arrest, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5104, and disorderly conduct, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503(a).</p>

The trial court conducted a hearing, at which Officer Shank was the sole witness, and dismissed the charges. Central to the disposition were the trial court’s findings that no persons other than Hock and the officer had been involved in the incident; Hock had not raised her voice when making her remark to Patrolman Shank; and she neither intended to cause, nor recklessly created a risk of, public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.</p>
