It must find facts and not the evidence. If the finding in this respect be defective a venire facias de novo will be awarded: Kinsley v. Coyle, 8 P. F. Smith 461. It cannot be pretended that this well settled rule is at all affected by the Act of April 22d 1874, Pamph. L. 109, passed in pursuance of art. V. \u00a7 27 of the Constitution. Noth the Constitution and the Act require that the agreement shall be in writing and filed; and the Act directs that the court shall find the facts separately and distinctly, with answers to any points submitted, and the conclusions of law, which shall also be filed.\nJudgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.",

    "head_matter": "Union Savings Bank versus Fife.\n1. A case stated, being a substitute for and in the nature of a special verdict, must present facts, and not the evidence.\n2. At the close of the evidence, on the trial of a cause, the counsel for plaintiffs and defendants filed an agreement, in writing, \u201cthat the evidence, oral and record, and the entire records, shall be treated as a case stated, and judgment to be entered thereon by the court, according to its views of the law and facts, each party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error.\u201d The court thereupon withdrew a juror, and afterwards entered \u201cjudgment on the case stated \u201d for flip plaintiff: Held, that the agreement was bad, as a case stated-, and, further, that it could not be sustained as a submission of the case to the court under the Act of April 22d 1874, the provisions of said Act not having been complied with.\n8. Where a special verdict or case stated in the nature thereof is defective, in failing to find the facts, a venire facias de novo will be awarded.\nOctober 23d 1883.\nBefore Sharswood, C. J., Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey and Green, JJ. Sterrett, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas No. 1, of Allegheny county: Of October Term 1882, No. 116.\nDebt, by E. H. Fife, sheriff of Allegheny county, for use, &c. against the Union Savings and Deposit Bank and the South Side Savings and Deposit Bank.\nThe facts, as set forth in the affidavits of claim and defence filed, and appearing from the testimony on the trial, before Stowe, P. J., wore intricate, and being immaterial to the decision of this court, need not be reported. At the conclusion of the evidence a juror was withdrawn, and the agreement for a case stated, set forth below, in the opinion of this court, was filed. The court below subsequently entered \u201cjudgment on the foregoing case stated in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, for $42,853.25, with interest from March 11th 1876, and costs.\u201d\nThe defendants took this writ of error, assigning for error the above judgment for plaintiff, and that \u201cthe court erred in not entering judgment in favor of defendants.\u201d\nDalzell (with him Hampton, Geo. N. Monro, Muff & Alcorn, and John S. Ferguson), for the plaintiff's in error.\nJ. M. Stoner (with him Sutton & Plumer), for the defendant in error."
