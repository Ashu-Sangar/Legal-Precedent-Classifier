As it affirmatively appears by the Harr., that the insured died from natural causes within less than three months from the date of the policy, the plaintiff has no cause of action: Bauman <em>v. </em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 8 Ins. World 335. Under the ruling of the court below, if the insured should die one week after the taking out of the policy, the company, having received but 10 cents premium, would be liable to pay $150, thus making the risk three times greater during the first three months than during the second three months, although the premium was very much smaller. In this class of policy the Metropolitan Company imitates the Erudential Insurance Company of London, except that the latter stipulates that their policies must be in force six months before the assured is entitled to any benefit, while our company reduces their time to three months.</p>

Whatever the company may have intended, there can be no doubt that the insured understood -that the risk attached from the 'date of the policy.

Whatever doubt may exist as to <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>the sufficiency of the first count, the second, though somewhat informal, is substantially good, and supports the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[175,520,1164,728]]]'>The first count is on the contract of. insurance, as evidenced by the policy of which profert.is therein made. We are not prepared to say that it, also, does not disclose a good cause ’of action. The agreement of the company, as expressed in the policy, is to pay “ upon receipt of proofs, satisfactory to the company, of the death of the life insured,” the sum of money stipulated in the schedule, under the words “Amount of -insurance.” Turning to the printed schedule, which forms part of the. policy, we find $150, written in plain characters under the words above mentioned. This is evidently “the sum of money stipulated” to be paid in the event of death, and satisfactory proof thereof; but, underneath the figures, is printed the following, viz: “ one-third only of the above sum payable if death occur after three calendar months and within six calendar months from date; two-thirds only if death occur after six calendar months and within one year; and the full amount only if death occur after one year.”</p>
    <p id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[169,1249,1184,1199]]]'>In view of this limitation as to the amount payable in certain contingencies, it is contended that the company has not obligated itself to pay anything in the event of death within three months from date of the policy; and, inasmuch as it is averred in the first count that the insured died within that time, it discloses no cause of action, and is therefore bad. If the provision above quoted was designed to convey the meaning thus contended for, it is badly expressed and calculated to mislead. Three contingencies appear to be therein provided -for: 1st, death of. the insured during the fourth, fifth and sixth calendar months, in which event, “ one-third only ” of the. stipulated amount shall be paid: 2d, death within the seventh to twelfth month inclusive., in which event “two-thirds only” shall be paid; od, death after one year from date of policy,- in which event “ the full amount only ” shall be paid. It contains no express provision for the contingency of death within the first three months;, and no unnecessary implication or liberal construction should be resorted to for the purpose of relieving the company from the payment of the sum specifically mentioned in the policy. Construing it, as should be done, most strongly against the insurer, it is by no means clear that the language used by the company exempts it from all liability in the event of death within the first three months. Its general undertaking, as we have seen, is to pay $150, upon receiving satisfactory proof of death. If it was intended that no liability whatever should be incurred, unless the insured survived the first three months, it should have been expressed in language not calculated to mislead, or entrap the ignorant and unwary.</p>

It provided that if the party insured died within three calendar months no loss should be payable. If such language had been used in the policy before us, there could be no question as to the insufficiency of the first count. But, whether that count be considered good or bad, the second, as has already been observed, is sufficient, in form as well as substance, to sustain the judgment of the court below. In the contemplated assault on the first count the nature of the second appears to have been overlooked.</p>
