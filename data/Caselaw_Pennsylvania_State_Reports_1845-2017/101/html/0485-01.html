B. accepted the offer, by notice in writing, within the forty days. Prior to the expiration of the three months within which the first payment of purchase money was to be paid, the land was sold at sheriff’s sale, as the property of A., under a judgment, entered, prior to the agreement of sale, for a sum larger than the price named in the said agreement. It appeared that by reason of the commencement of new work on an abandoned railroad the land had greatly appreciated in value between the date of the said agreement and the sheriff’s sale. The balance of proceeds of the sheriff’s sale, in excess of the purchase money named in the agreement (which was applied to the satisfaction of judgments entered against A. prior to B.’s acceptance of the option), was claimed by A. and by B., each claiming as owner, and was awarded by the auditor and the court to B. On appeal by A., <em>Held, </em>that B. became the equitable owner of the land upon his acceptance of the offer, and he was therefore entitled to the fund in controversy; the decree was therefore affirmed.</p>

The result of this was an immediate appreciation in the market value of said coal, so that while the price at the higher-of the two rates fixed in the agreement of option amounted to $8,825, in two annual-payments, it sold at the forced sheriff’s sale on April 9th 1881, for $15,101 in cash.</p>

    <p id="b504-8" data-blocks='[["BL_504.11",504,[312,1549,1165,854]]]'>This contention arises in the distribution of a fund produced by a-sheriff’s sale of real estate. The correctness of the decree is determined by the extent of the appellee’s interest in the property sold. The facts necessary to understand the case are these: The appellant owned the land bound by the lion of judgments. On the 16th December 1880 a written agreement under seal was entered into between him and the appellee. The appellant, inter alia, thereby proposed to sell to the appellee, the offer to remain open for forty days thereafter, all the coal underlying certain lands therein described, at the rate of $23.75 an acre, if the purchase-money should all be paid down in one payment, but if in two different annual payments, then to be $25 per acre, the first, payment to be made within three months from the date of acceptance of the proposal; a deed with general warranty to be made when the last payment should be secured by judgment note or mortgage on the property. On the 22d January 1881 and again on the 24th the appellee gave to the appellant written notice that he accepted the proposition contained in the optional agreement and would comply with all of its requirements.</p>
    <p id="b504-9" data-blocks='[["BL_504.12",504,[380,2402,1096,45]],["BL_505.1",505,[161,424,1168,344]]]'>On the 9th April 1881, and before any payment became <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>due from the appellee, according to the agreement, the property was sold on a judgment recovered against the appellant prior to the 16th of December 1880. The sale produced a sum more than sufficient to pay all judgments against the appellant which were liens on the property and more than the whole sum which the appellee had agreed to pay therefor. That excess was claimed by each party to this appeal, but was ordered to be paid to the appellee. This appeal is from that decree.</p>
    <p id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[152,767,1185,1331]]]'>Tlie auditor found as a fact, and on sufficient evidence, that the appellee was not guilty of any fraud in procuring the agreement. The court confirmed the finding. The appellant entered into the agreement with sufficient opportunity to fairly understand all its terms and conditions. No undue means were practiced. The agreement contains nothing unlawful or inequitable. It gave the appellee forty days within which to accept the. proposition, fie accepted it, and gave to the appellant notice thereof, within the time specified. By this acceptance and notice the contract became binding on both parties thereto. Thenceforth there was no want of mutuality. It became a binding agreement for the sale and the purchase of the real estate. In equity the vendee became the owner thereof subject to the payment of the price stipulated. His right of property therein flows from the contract and exists before any payment of purchase-money may have been made: Siter et al. Appeal, 2 Casey 178. Hence a sheriff’s sale on a judgment entered against the vendor before his agreement to sell and convey cannot give him the proceeds of the equitable estate of his vendee. As against his vendor, the vendee is entitled to the sum produced by the sale in excess of the amount which lie agreed to pay. The vendor’s interest is limited by the amount of his unpaid purchase-money. When that is fully paid his claim on the property and on the proceeds thereof is discharged. He is no more entitled to the excess than if the equitable owner had sold his interest at private sale, for a sum equal to that excess, to one who took it charged with the payment of the amount due for the legal title. In either case it is the measure of the value of the vendee’s interest in the land: Kerr et al. <em>v. </em>Day, 2 Harris 112; Siter et al. Appeal, supra; Corson <em>v. </em>Mulvany, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%2088" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Wright 88">13 Wright 88</a>; Smith <em>&amp; </em>Fleek’s Appeal, 19 P.

The fact that after acceptance of the offer, and before the vendee was in any default, the coal advanced in value, does not enlarge the equities of the vendor, nor deprive the vendee of the benefit of his bargain. If it had depreciated in value he must have borne the loss. As it was enhanced he <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>is entitled to the gain. The contract was certain, fair, and just, between the parties. The learned judge committed no error in decreeing the fund to be paid to the appellee.</p>
