The legislative and judicial are co-ordinate departments of the government, of equal dignity ; each is alike supreme in the exercise of its proper functions and cannot directly or indirectly, while acting within the limits of its authority, be subjected to the control or supervision of the other without an unwarrantablé assumption by that other of power which by the constitution is not conferred upon it. The constitution apportions the powers of the government but it does not make any one of the three departments subordinate to another when exercising a trust committed to it. The courts may declare legislative enactments <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>unconstitutional and void in some cases, but not because the judicial power is supreme in degree or dignity to the legislative. Being required to declare what the law is, in the cases which come before them, they must enforce the constitution as a paramount law whenever a legislative enactment comes in conflict with it. But the courts sit not to review or revise legislative action but to enforce the legislative will; and it is only where they find that the legislature has failed to keep within its constitutional limits that they are at liberty to disregard its action; and in doing so they only do what every private citizen may do in respect to the mandates of the courts when judges assume to act and render judgments and decrees without jurisdiction. In exercising this high authority the judges claim no judicial supremacy; they are only the administrators of the public will. If an act of the legislature is held void, it is not because the judges have any control over the legislative power, but because the will of the people, which is therein declared, is paramount to that of their representatives expressed in any law.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[288,1181,1173,928]]]'>Again. “In declaring any law unconstitutional a court must necessarily cover the same ground which has already been covered by the legislative department in deciding upon the propriety of enacting a law, and they must indirectly overrule the decision of that co-ordinate department. The task is therefore a delicate one and only to be entered upon with reluctance and hesitation. It is a solemn act in any case to declare that the body of men to whom the people have committed the sovereign function of making the laws for the Commonwealth have deliberately disregarded the limitations imposed upon its delegated authority and usurped power which the people have been careful to withhold : and it is almost equally so when the act which is to be adjudged unconstitutional appears tobe chargeable father to careless and improvident action or error in judgment, than to intentional disregard of obligation. But the duty to do this in a proper case, though at one time doubted and by some persons persistently denied, it is now generally agreed that the courts cannot properly decline, and in its performance they seldom fail of proper support if they proceed with due caution and circumspection and under a proper sense as well of their own responsibility as of the respect due to the action and judgment of the law-makers.”</p>

The court, when impelled by duty to render such a judgment, would be unworthy of its station, could it be unmindful of the solemn obligation which that station imposes. But it is not on slight implication and vague conjecture that the Legislature is to be pronounced to have transcended its powers and its acts be considered void. The opposition between the Constitution and the law should be such that the judge feels a clear and strong conviction of theft’ incompatibility with each other.”</p>

This Act of Assembly was in operation in 1861, twelve years prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1873. Hence, in technical strictness, permission to a justice of the peace to try an offence before a jury of six in accordance with that Act of Assembly would leave trial by jury as heretofore: that is, prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1873. I do not think it necessary, however, to strain the point of construction that far. It is to be borne in mind that this jury of six can only be invoked when the defendant himself demands it.</p>

When he does so the justice will proceed in like manner as in other criminal cases wherein jurisdiction has been given to the justice for final jurisdiction at the request of the defendant.

A defendant may waive a constitutional provision in his favor. Section 10 of Art. I, of the Bill of Rights, says: “No person shall for the same offence be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” A defendant convicted of an offence who applies for a new trial and receives it, waives the privilege of section 10. The defendant has volunteered to put himself in jeopardy of life and limb. He is tried twice for the same offence and it is done with 1ns consent. Section 9 says: “In all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to’be heard by himself and his counsel,” and so on. If he pleads guilty to an indictment he waives that privilege, as also the privilege of a trial by jury according to the course of the eommof. law or any other law. And further, by section 9, “ he has a right <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>to meet the witnesses face to face” “ and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and in prosecutions by indictment or information a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the vicinage.” Very many times in the trial of a cause depositions are taken and the witnesses are not present in court so the testimony taken in a former trial is read against him upon a second trial. It is done by consent of the defendant, and so far it is a waiver by the defendants of the privileges of the Bill of Nights. “ The defendant is also entitled to a speedy public trial by a jury of the vicinage” and he applies for a-continuance — it may be for one, two or three terms — and does’ not. demand to have a speedy public trial. Does he not, then, waive a privilege of the Bill of Nights?</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b581-7" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[140,1385,1174,984]]]'>It is said that the defendant’s consent cannot give the court jurisdiction of an offence. That is very true; but it is not consent that gives jurisdiction in this case. It is the Act of Assembly that gives jurisdiction and the justice allows that Act of Assembly to operate in the defendant’s favor upon his own personal demand. The suggestion that consent cannot give the court jurisdiction is also to be taken with a grain of allowance. Courts do sometimes obtain jurisdiction by consent and make decrees that are enforced, and the jurisdiction of the court would be adhered to. For example, the Common Pleas and Orphans’ Court have each jurisdiction over the proof of contracts of decedents and partitions of decedents’ estates. In some, at least, of these cases, a party may and does choose his own forum, and hence jurisdiction or the right of making a decree is, to some extent at least, dependent upon choice or consent. So with the equity side and common law side of the court. A suitor proceeds on the equity side of the court where the common law side of the court has jurisdiction, and if no objection by the opposite prrty, or by the court itself is interposed, their decrees are legitimate and have full force. Hence, it cannot be exactly true in the broad acceptation of the term that consent cannot give jurisdiction. However, in the case before us it is not consent but the Act of Assembly which gives jurisdiction.</p>

But the case in hand is to be distinguished from that one for a variety of reasons and more particularly in view of this Act of Assembly, enacted for the benefit of an accused, and of which the defendant takes advantage himself, of his own free will and without compulsion. He "could not be called upon to accept its provisions, but when he does so he waives the constitutional right of having proceedings commenced against him by indictment found by the Grand Jury and to be passed upon by twelve jurors. He waives these rights just the same as when he pleads guilty he waives the right to have the witnesses appear in court, or when he applies for a new trial he waives the right of the ninth section of the Bill of Eights.</p>

The Act gives the justice on a trial by six jurors the same power to sentence to imprisonment as the Court of Quarter Sessions would have, on a trial by twelve jurors, — which is clearly illegal. The defendant here did not waive his rights, as he might have done had he pleaded not guilty. A man cannot by invoking an unconstitutional act give power to a tribunal which the legislature was not authorized to create, or prejudice his rights to a legal trial.
