J., the following facts appeared — In 1873, the plaintiff, Hall, being the owner of a certain vacant lot of ground in the city of Erie, contracted by articles of agreement, to sell the same to one George D. Mead, for a certain sum payable in installments. The articles contained a warrant of attorney to confess judgment against the v.endee for any due and unpaid installments. Mead took possession, made some payments on account of the purchase money, and erected on the lot a small one-and-a-half-story frame house, 16x20 feet, resting upon blocks. On June 15th 1875, Mead, being then in arrear for purchase money due Hall, sold the house to the defendant Weed for $100, of which the latter paid $30 in hand, and the balance a week or two afterwards. There was some testimony tending to show that Weed knew that Mead Avas in arrear for purchase money, and that his object in selling the house was to prevent Hall from obtaining it. Mead vacated the house on July 19th, and on the same day the defendant Hoffman, employed by Weed, moved it off the lot, and into the public street, en route for its intended destination.</p>

Mead, or the defendants below, who claim through and under Mead. This of itself would defeat this action of replevin, for while it is now settled law that replevin will lie by the owner of real estate for fixtures unlawfully severed from the freehold; none of the cases has gone <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>so far as to hold that the action can be sustained by one who has not at least theright of possession. Harlan <em>v. </em>Harlan, 3 Harris 507, was much relied upon to sustain the opposite view, but it is not authority for any such doctrine. The suit there was by the purchaser of a mill and its machinery at a sheriff’s sale. After the.sale the former owner detached some of the machinery, and it was held that the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale could maintain replevin for the articles so detached. Although not in possession at the time of the severance, he had-the right to the immediate possession and this will sustain replevin.</p>

Bnt the vendee of lands by articles of agreement is the owner, subject to a lien for the unpaid purchase money, and being in possession may do what he will with it. The removal of buildings or fences on the land may or may not be a ground of complaint on the part of the .vendor. If done to impair his lien for the purchase money, it would be a fraud, but if for the purpose of erecting better ones in the place of those removed or destroyed, the vendor would have no right to interfere. In such case he certainly could not maintain replevin for the old timber and rails.</p>
    <p id="b612-6" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[284,1471,1166,289]]]'>The plaintiff also claimed title through an alleged sheriff's sale. The court below ignored this part of his case, and declined to submit it to the jury, under the belief that his title was good without regard to such sale. This, we think was error. If the plaintiff cannot sustain his sheriff’s title he has no cause of action. It is therefore necessary for us to consider this branch of the case.</p>

    <p id="b612-8" data-blocks='[["BL_612.7",612,[287,1981,1162,472]]]'>It needs no argument to show that if the sale and removal of the house was intended by Mead to hinder and delay the plaintiff in the collection of the unpaid purchase money, and this object was known to, and participated in by Weed, the purchaser, it would be such a fraud as would avoid the transaction as to the plaintiff, and Weed would take no title. On the other hand, if the transaction was free from fraud, the sale from Mead to Weed would pass a good title, and the sheriff’s sale would drop out of the case. But if no title passed to Weed it is manifest the plaintiff had the right after severance to treat the house as personal property and seize and sell it under his fi. fa.</p>
