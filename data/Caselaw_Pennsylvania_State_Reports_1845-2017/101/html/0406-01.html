We decline to give you such instructions. We say to you that it is not necessarily fraudulent, and further that we see nothing in it indicating an intention to cheat creditors or prevent a fair sale of the property. It does not bind Mrs. Hunter and Enlow, or Strouss, to do anything illegal and improper. Evidently drawn by one not much accustomed to draw such papers, it is full on unimportant matters and indefinite on those more vital. Why Strouss agreed not to dispute the claims of Enlow and Mrs. Hunter, and for what purpose he gave up the receipts, is not .apparent, nor why they were to pay him $200. It is not to be simply inferred that these were fraudulent acts or for a fraudulent purpose. They seem rather to be in the nature of a compromise between the parties of some matter's in dispute. What receipts were to be given up? Against the judgments of Enlow and Mrs. Hunter or on former judgments ? And were they given up to enable Enlow and Mrs. Hunter to protect themselves from unjust claims of prior creditors, or to enable them to practice a fraud upon other creditors ? When an agreement may be construed for an honest purpose a jury should not guess that it was intended for a fraudulent one. What was the $200 to be paid for? To secure the co-operation of Strouss in any fraud, as a loan or gratuity to him, or to avoid a factious and exactions opposition to the collection of honest claims against him ? The inference should not be in favor of dishonesty but rather of honesty. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show an improper or fraudulent purpose in the agreement. It is only in the light of the surrounding circumstances that we can understand its real object, and for that reason we refuse to say it is prima facie fraudulent, but submit the question to you upon all the evidence in the case. The provision to re-sell the property, and after paying the defendants’ claims, place the surplus, if any, in the hands of such member of the Strouss family as he might designate, if honestly made for the benefit of his family, and not for the purpose of hindering or delaying creditors or interfering with a fair sheriff’s sale, was not fraud<a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>ulent, and would not render the defendant’s purchase at the sheriff’s sale void as to the other creditors.</p>

W. Enlow of his land in Allegheny county and Beaver county for the benefit of particular creditors, preferences which are void and prohibí ited by statute, and as the same was not recorded within the thirty days thereafter, void as to creditors. .</p>

The agreement contained nothing illegal. It was simply an engagement on the part of Mrs. Hunter, to either purchase the property herself or see that it brought a fair value; and in the event of purchasing herself, to allow Strouss’s family the profit of a resale. This could not defraud the other creditors but tended rather to secure a good price for the property. The charge that Mrs. Hunter desired to suppress the receipts for money paid on prior liens, is absurd, since it would have prejudiced her own later liens. She desired the receipts to ascertain just what was due each creditor.</p>

This presumption stands, unless overthrown by clear and satisfactory evidence of fraud or unfair means. The contention was one of fact. Much evidence Avas given bearing on the question, and some of it conflicting. The learned judge submitted the case to the jury in a clear and correct charge. He instructed them that if the sheriff’s sale was made with the intention of hindering, delaying or defeating creditors, and the purchaser had knowledge of such, it was null and void, although the full value of the property may have been paid; that a sheriff’s sale should be free, open and untainted by fraud ; that any trick or device of a purchaser which prevents a fair sale is a fraud on creditors, and if by means of it he gets the property at less than it otherwise would have sold for, he does not obtain a good title, and it may be defeated by a subsequent sale of the property on the judgment of another creditor. To work this result the purchaser must have been guilty of some falsehood or trick before or at the time of the sale which succeeded, and he must have obtained the property for less than it otherwise would have sold. All of these are essential elements to defeat the title of the purchaser. A mere fraudulent intent or effort if not successful is not sufficient, nor is the mere fact that the property was purchased at less than its value. We think the plaintiff has no reason to complain of this declaration of the law. No error is assigned thereto. Then, as to the application of the evidence tending to establish the fraud, the court affirmed a point of the plaintiff put in these words, <em>“ </em>under the plaintiff’s evidence tending to prove fraud on the part of the defendant, the jury will consider all the separate facts in evidence, whether each fact of itself would be sufficient or not to fasten fraud on her in the premises; and they may consider separate facts, if they are connected by the evidence and tend to prove that the [defendant entered into and carried out a scheme or plan, to purchase the land in dispute at an under value, and for the benefit of herself, and also for the benefit of James Strouss or his family.”</p>
