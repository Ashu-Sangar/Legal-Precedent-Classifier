That Act must be construed in harmony with section 23 of the Act of May 8th 1854 (P. L. 622), which gives school directors power “ to establish schools of different grades, and determine into which school each pupil shall be admitted.” The answer averred, — what is admitted by the demurrer, — that the child “ has not been denied the privileges of said common schools by said directors, but his father refuses to allow him to enter the school building and room" to which ho has been assigned.” Under art. 10, sec. 1 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, it is the duty of the school directors to maintain a “thorough and efficient” system, but if the ruling of the court below is affirmed, they will be powerless to prevent all children, white or colored, from electing into which school building they will enforce admission, and thus destroy the efficiency of the system.

On demurrer the court adjudged the answer insufficient and entered judgment in favor of the Commonwealth, and ordered a peremptory mandamus to issue, commanding the plaintiffs in error to admit the minor son of the relatolas a pupil into the public school under their control in the said main school building, and to proceed to determine into which grade or class of said school the said minor child shall so be admitted as a pupil.</p>

It is true the answer does declare other reasons why the boy was excluded from the one school and assigned to the other; but carefully fails to meet or deny the charge, that the controlling reason therefor is his color. Notliing less than plain and direct answers to all the material allegations in the- writ of mandamus, present distinct issues of fact. Skillful avoidance of a material allegation, or argumentative inferences are not sufficient: Commonwealth ex rel. Middleton <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Allegheny Co., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20237" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Wright 237">1 Wright 237</a>; 8 Casey 218.</p>

Undoubtedly they may. Their authority and discretion in that inspect is not questioned here. The objection is, that their action is not based on any consideration of his qualifications or attainments, but rests on his color alone. This is in direct conflict with the Act of Assembly cited. The law making power of the Commonwealth has declared that such action by “ any school director, superintendent or teacher shall be unlawful.” The 23d section of the Act of 8th May 1854; P. L. 622, declares “the directors and controllers of the respective districts shall have power to establish schools of different grades, and determine into which school each pupil shall be admitted.” This power, however, must be exercised in subordination to the later Act of 8th of June 1881, and not in conflict with any of its provisions. The cases cited in Ohio, Indiana, California, Louisiana and New York were not ruled on any statute similar to ours, and cannot therefore be authority in its construction. The question before us is not whether the action of the school directors is directly in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, but whether it is forbidden by the statute of Pennsylvania, which does not impinge on the Constitution of the United States nor on any law of Congress. The statute is in harmony with the spirit and object of the 14th Amendment, section 1, of the Constitution of the United States.</p>

Their duty being declared by statute the. courts are empowered to compel its performance.
