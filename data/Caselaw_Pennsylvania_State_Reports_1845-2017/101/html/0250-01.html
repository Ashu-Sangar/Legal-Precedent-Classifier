To this it is answered that in one case an actual levy had been made upon the real estate of plaintiff for the taxes, under the pressure of which the amount was paid under protest, and .in the other, that the city threatened to proceed and levy upon plaintiff’s real estate, and to save further annoyance and costs that amount was paid under protest.</p>

We assume that defendant had no right to recover the money from plaintiff, but it is clear that plaintiff knew all the facts in relation to the assessment of the taxes previous to this purchase, out of which it was claimed liability arose, and that the city was not guilty of any fraud or concealment in the premises. There seems to have been a mutual mistake as to the law only. The facts out of which the claim originated were well known to both parties. It is a well settled rule of law that a tax voluntarily paid, even though illegally assessed, when there is no misplaced confidence and no artifice or deception or fraudulent practice by the other, can not be recovered back.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b269-7" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[175,693,1173,1097]]]'>It is claimed, however, that even if the law is so, and plaintiff cannot recover in the case where no levy was made or execution issued, yet where there was an actual levy and advertisement of the property, as in the lien at No. 89, April Term 1878, the defendant had no other remedy to relieve his property from sale, and this constituted duress sufficient to make his payment under protest involuntary. This, however, is a mistake. The plaintiff was in no danger of having his property sold, because no title would have passed to the purchaser; neither his title nor his possession would have been affected by it in the least, and the sale would have amounted to nothing so far as he was concerned. It is said, however, that there are several decisions in Pennsylvania which indicate that where the tax is illegal or the party not under any legal obligation to pay, a payment under protest is sufficient to give him a right to recover back, even where there is no danger of immediate or present seizure of person or property. I do not so understand the cases, and answer in the language of C. J. Waite, in U. P. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 98 United States Rep. 541, which I deem specially applicable to our own cases : “ There are, no doubt, cases to be found in which the language of the court, if separated from the facts of the particular case under consideration, would seem to imply that a protest alone was, sufficient to show that the payment was not voluntary, but on examination it will be found that the protest was used to give effect to the other circumstances of the case.”</p>

Smith 371, it was held that one who voluntarily pays money with knowledge or means of knowledge of the facts, and without fraud on him, cannot recover it back, because he paid it in ignorance of the law. In Dillon on Municipal Cor. § 751, the requisites to maintain .an action ex contractu against a municipal corporation to recover back money paid to it for taxes are said to bo three: 1. The authority to levy the tax must be wholly wanting or the tax itself wholly unauthorized, so that the tax is absolutely void. 2. The money sued for must have been actually received by the defendant corporation for its own use. 3. The payment by the plaintiff must have been made upon compulsion to prevent the immediate seizure of, his goods or the arrest of the person and not voluntarily. “ Unless these conditions concur, payment under protest will not give a right of recovery.” No authority is found which holds <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>that money paid to prevent the sale of lands under a threat to sell the same on a judgment which is nob a lien thereon, can be recovered back by reason thereof.</p>
    <p id="b273-6" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[168,610,1174,1061]]]'>Then to refer to the facts in‘this- case we find no allegation that the taxes were illegally laid. No averment of irregularity in making the assessment or in laying the taxes. The city had undoubted jurisdiction and power, and all the forms of the law were complied with. The only alleged wrong consists- in the attempt to collect the taxes by proceedings against the land after it ceased to be liable for the payment thereof. At the time the taxes were paid each party was fully informed of all the facts bearing on the case. The plaintiff knew them then as well as now. They were all of record, and most of them in the direct line of its title. It knew when the mortgage was executed. It knew the time when it purchased the property at sheriff’s sale. The claims filed showed on their face that they were for taxes laid after the execution of the mortgage, and for years prior to the sheriff’s sale. The only question about which the parties could possibly differ was one of law. That was whether under the well known and undisputed facts the lien of the taxes was divested. The city proposed to test it in a regular legal form. They had been duly laid ; they had never been paid to the city ; the property did not sell for enough to pay them, if it had claimed and obtained the whole fund produced by the sale. They remained unsatisfied against Logan. There was nothing inequitable or unconscionable in the city’s acceptance of the taxes and in retaining them.</p>
    <p id="b273-7" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[175,1681,1177,728]]]'>It is said the plaintiff had not had its day in court. True, it had not. The taxes were not laid against it, nor its property. The company did not propose to attack the validity of the assessment. In several of the cases cited the party had had no day in court'. No hearing or opportunity of being heard ; yet he might have had it before making payment, by appropriate action. Failing to avail himself of it, be waived his rights. So .here by application to the equitable powers of the-court or by bill in equity execution might have been staid, and the claim removed from the record. No immediate and urgent necessity existed for the payment of the taxes to protect the property of the .plaintiffs. Its goods were not about to be seized. The execution could not take from it the possession of the land ; nor could a sale if made, have had such effect. It follows that all the facts in the ease are clearly insufficient to enable the plaintiff to maintain this action, and the learned judge was correct in so holding. Judgment affirmed.</p>
