No admission by heirs or personal representatives will| dispense with the necessity for suoli statutory action or proceeding.</p>

George Oliver was appointed administrator of his estate. On October 21st 1875, John A. Stone was appointed guardian of said minors, and from time to time up to August 10th 1880, George Oliver, administrator of William Oliver, deceased, paid various sums to tbe said Stone, guardian, on account of the said balance due to said minors. On November 4th 1880, George Oliver, administrator, filed an account of William Oliver, guardian, showing a balance due to the said William and Harvey Neel, which was increased by surcharges to tbe sum of $2,913.75, which amount the court ordered to be paid to the said William and Harvey Neel.

    <p class="summary" id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[265,1097,1167,809]]]'>Thereupon a supplemental petition was filed on behalf of the said William and Harvey Neel, alleging frequent demands upon George Oliver, administrator, within five years from the decedent’s death, for the balance due said minors, on which occasions generally a small portion of said indebtedness would be paid on account; that the said George Oliver, administrator, and Mrs. Oliver, widow of William Oliver deceased, always promised to pay said balance as soon as they could collect it from the assets of the estate, with interest at 8 per cent. ; and alleging further that certain allegations were from time to time made by said administrator and widow, with intent to gain time and for the purpose of delaying such payment until the expiration of five years from the death of said William Oliver, after which period they, for the first time, refused to recognize any liability, and set up the bar of the statute. To this supplemental petition a supplemental answer was filed by the administrator, widow, and all the heirs of William Oliver, deceased, denying the above recited allegations of the' supplemental petition, and re-asserting the bar of the statute.</p>

St. 527</a>. In that case the administrators of a deceased guardian filed an account of his trust more than five years after his death, showing a balance in his hands, and suit having been brought against his sureties on his bond, the statute of limitations was set up as bar to the plaintiff’s recovery. The court said: ‘ But, to say nothing of the decree, which is in the nature of a judgment, and therefore not within the Act, the case presents a direct and express trust, over which, in the first instance, the Orphans’ Court has <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>exclusive jurisdiction. The Act has no terms that can be made to embrace claims of this character. This has been so repeatedly settled that it is only necessary to refer, among the multitude of cases, to Thompson <em>v. </em>McGaw, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20161" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 W. 161">2 W. 161</a>; Doebler <em>v. </em>Snavely, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%20225" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 W. 225">5 <em>W. </em>225</a>; and Patterson <em>v. </em>Nichol, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%20379" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 W. 379">6 <em>W. </em>379</a>. It is obvious, this defence would not be open to the guardian wore he alive, nor is it more available to his personal representatives, for none of the statutes that have relation to remedies for the recovery of decedents’ debts are applicable here. It is obvious, then, that there is no such laches from mere running of time as could operate to bar the claim of the ward against her living guardian. Were he in existence, nothing that has been suggested in the progress of the investigation could shield him from the successful attacks of the plaintiffs: Vincent v. Watson, <a href="/pa/40/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="40 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="478757" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0306-01">40 Pa. St. 306</a>.

It was at his instance, and in consideration of a special agreement made with him to pay interest on the amount owing, that time was given. And it was clearly to the advantage of the deceased guardian's estate that time was given. The claim was large, and, had it been pushed, would, in all probability, have caused serious embarrassment in the settlement of the estate. There is no doubt about the validity of the claim. It was not disputed in the distribution of the personal estate of decedent, and received a distributive share from it. There is, therefore, neither law nor equity to the support of the objection made to the relief asked.</p>

That statute does not run in any case of a technical trust cognizable in equity, which that growing out of the relation of guardian and ward unquestionably is. This is all that the cases cited and relied upon in the opinion of the learned judge in the court below decided. But they do not touch the question in this case which is, whether the demand of the ward continues alien upon the land of a deceased guardian more than five years after his death. The words of the 21th section of the Act of February 21th 1831, Pamph. L. <em>77, </em>are: “No debts of a decedent, except they be secured by mortgage or judgment, shall remain a lien on the real estate of such decedent longer than five years after the decease of such debtor, unless action for the recovery thereof be commenced and duly prosecuted against his heirs, executors and administrators within the period of five years after his decease; or a copy or particular written statement of any bond, covenant, debt or demand, where the same is not payable within the said period of five years, shall be filed within the said period of five years, in the office of the prothonotary of the county where the real estate to be charged is situate, and then to be a lien only for the period of five years after said bond, covenant, debt or demand becomes due.” The great object of this Act was to quiet the title of heirs and devisees and purchasers from them to the lands derived from decedents. It <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>was only necessai’y for a purchaser or mortgagee to resort to a single office, the prothonotary of the county, to ascertain whether any action had been brought or copy or statement of any demand filed within the period of five years from the decedent’s death. If there was no mortgage or judgment at the time of his death, and the office of the prothonotary was clear of any action or statement of demand, he might rest perfectly secure that his title was unincumbered by any debts or demands against the real estate of the decedent, whatever the nature of the demand might be. It was decided in Kerper <em>v. </em>Hoch, <a href="/watts/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Watts 9" data-case-ids="1838073" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0009-01">1 Watts 9</a>, under a similar provision in the Act of 1797, that it applied for the protection not only of bona fide purchasers, but heirs and devisees, and those claiming under them. No distinction is made in the character of the debt or demand.</p>
    <p id="b319-6" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[163,1043,1180,1410]],["BL_320.1",320,[288,440,1171,249]]]'>By the death of the guardian the guardianship' ended, and the balance in his hands was without any doubt a debt of his estate, which, when ascertained by a decree of the Orphans’ Court, could be collected from his real estate by proceedings within five years, and from his personal estate at any period short of that which would raise the presumption of payment. It was said by this court in Brindley’s Appeal, 19 P. F. Smith 299, on the Act of 1834, that no admission, however solemn, will dispense with an action. “ The leaning of this court, through the whole current of the numerous decisions upon this subject, has evidently been to favor the heir and to require of the creditor the vigilant prosecution of his demand in the mode pointed out.” No exception has been recognized to the operation of the Act of 1834 other than those expressly named in it. The exceptions expressed necessarily exclude all others. It is a mistake to suppose that the cases of Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry, <a href="/watts/8/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Watts 504" data-case-ids="1848506" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0504-01">8 Watts 504</a>; and Baldy <em>v. </em>Brady, 3 Harris 111, have any bearing upon the subject. A testator may create a trust of all or a part of his real estate, and certainly, as to the lands comprised in such trust, the debes would not lose their right of payment by the running of five years or any other period other than such as would raise the presumption of payment. This was all. that was decided in Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry. A devise of lands to executors to be sold for the payment of debts and legacies vests the estate in those as a trust fund for that purpose, and if they neglect to execute the trust the creditors may sell the lands upon a judgment and execution, and the purchaser will take a good title, and in such case there is no limit to the lien of the debts short of a presumption of payment from lapse of time. “Underthe trust thus created by the testator,” said Mr. Justice Kennedy in that case, “ in the residuary clause of his will in favor of his creditors, wo are of the opinion that they ought to be considered as having such a lien upon the estate thereby set <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>apart for the payment of his debts as gave them the right at any subsequent period, however late, as long as the trust remained unexecuted in their favor, to proceed against it by execution.” We think, therefore, the decree of the court below directing the administrator to make application for an order to sell the lands was erroneous.</p>
