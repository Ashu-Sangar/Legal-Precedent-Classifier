In delivering the opinion Judge Kennedy says : “ Put it has been objected that according to the ordinary and common acceptation of the term mineral, chrome is not included within the exception, because, although properly a mineral, yet not being a metallic substance, it is not considered by the great mass of mankind as a mineral, and embraced within that term. This objection would certainly have great weight, and perhaps could not be overcome, were it not for the parol evidence and the facts established by it.” In that case the parol evidence showed very clearly that the term “ mineral ” was introduced into the exception for the express purpose of embracing the chrome, without which it would not be included in the common acceptation of the term; at least such appears to be the opinion of Judge Kennedy.</p>

It is classified as a mineral by mineralogists and geologists (see Hooker’s Mineralogy and Geology, liana’s Geology, and other standard works), and is said to be a mineral by this court in the case of Funk <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 3 P. F. Smith, page 229, Appeal of Stoughton <em>et al., </em>7th Norris, page 198, and other cases. There is nothing in the language of the contract and deed to indicate that the parties used the term in a restricted sense; on the contrary, the word used with the term is one of enlargement — “ all minerals ” making it as comprehensive as it can be made. The reason given by the learned judge for finding that the parties used the term in a restricted sense is that the term “ mineral,” in its most comprehensive sense, would include “ all the substances which form any part of the solid body of the land,” &amp;c. But that is not the form in which it is used. The parties to this contract and deed use the words “ all minerals ” in the plural, which includes the different species or classes of minerals — those minerals which are the subject of mining operations. If they had used the term “ mineral,” or “ all mineral ” there might possibly be some reason for saying they meant all mineral matter, including everything not organic. But when they use the words “all minerals” in the plural, they thus speak of the subject of the reservation in classes, and presumably mean all minerals which are classified as such and are the subject of mining operations. Petroleum is classed as a mineral, and is the subject of mining operations. In the reports of the Geological Survey of the state of Pennsylvania, the mineral products of the state are classified as follows: “ Petroleum, coal, natural gas, building stone, flagstone, building brick clay, fire clay, limestone, iron ore, mineral paint, and mineral water:" Book R, page 79. Petroleum is thus placed at the head of the mineral products of the state. On what principle of construction can it be said that the parties used these words “ all minerals ” in a restricted sense, that would not include one of the most prominent mineral products of the <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>state? If we say the parties used the term in a restricted sense, where shall the line be drawn ? To what shall we restrict the exception or reservation? Shall it be to metallic ores? That would be restricting the words “all.minerals ” to a very narrow limit, and would exclude all the most valuable mineral products of the state except one, to wit, iron ore. It is safe to presume that the parties had in view the minerals common to the locality where they live, and the one most prominent and valuable, which is petroleum. No other mineral of any importance is found in Warren county. Counsel for plaintiff, in the court below, conceded in his argument that the term minerals as used by the people in general would include coal. If it includes coal, then why not petroleum, which is of like origin, and much more extensive in that part of the state ? In nearly all the leases throughout the oil region we find the grant of the right to “ mine and excavate for petroleum or rock oil,” and we find it referred to as “petroleum, carbon or rock oil and other minerals.” We talk about “boring and mining for oil,” and refer to oil leases as “ mining leases.” And this court has declared oil to be a mineral: Appeal of Stoughton <em>et </em>al., 7 Norris 198. “ Oil, however, is a mineral, and being a mineral is part of the realty. In this it is like coal or any other natural product which <em>in situ </em>forms part of the land.”</p>

Yet in the popular sense none of these are included among “ minerals,” but only those mineral substances which are solid, permanent, and can be dug or mined for. Petroleum oil, though in one sense a part of the land, in another sense is not, for it is not fixed or located; it flows under the land from and to adjoining lands, and a well on one man’s land draws oil underlying his neighbors’ lauds as <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>well as under his own. The operations to produce it require the use or destruction of the surface of the land, by reason of the necessary derricks, tanks, engines, pipes, and by leakage; but when a grantor reserves mining rights he cannot so use and destroy the surface land unless he expressly stipulates therefor: Heart <em>v. </em>Gill, 7 L.

This contention can be sustained only under the hypothesis that the word “minerals” in the reservation includes petroleum. The court below refused to sustain the interpretation put upon the agreement by the defendants, and entered judgment, on the case stated, for the plaintiff. In this we think it was right. The whole argument used for the purpose of convincing us that this decision is not correct is based on the allegation that petroleum is a mineral.

But salt and other waters, impregnated or combined with mineral substances, are minerals; so are rocks, clays and sand; anything dug from mines or quarries; in fine, all inorganic substances are classed under the general name or minerals: Bon. L. Die.; Wor. Die.; Dana’s Geology; Grey’s Botany. But if the reservation embraces all these things, it is as extensive as the grant, and therefore, void. If, then, anything at all is to be retained for the vendor, we must, by some means, limit the meaning of the word “ minerals.” But the rule by which this may be done is well stated by Chief Justice Gibson in the case of the Schuylkill Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/whart/2/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Whart. 477" data-case-ids="1830573" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0477-01">2 Wh. 477</a>, as follows: “ The best construction is that which is made by viewing the subject of the contract as the mass of mankind would view it; for,” continues the learned chief justice, “ it may be safely assumed that such was the aspect in which the parties themselves viewed it.” So, Mr. Justice Kennedy, adopting this same rule, in the case of Gibson <em>v. </em>Tyson, <a href="/watts/5/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts 34" data-case-ids="1843962" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0034-01">5 Watts 34</a>, when construing an exception <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>in a deed “ of all mineral or magnesia of any kind,” says, that by the bulk of mankind nothing is considered as a mineral exceptt such things as be of a metallic nature, such as gold, silver, copper, lead &amp;c., and that in looking at the deed before him, under the general understanding, he would have hesitated about classing chromate of iron as a mineral, except that, from the parol testimony, it appeared the parties themselves regarded it as a metallic ore of some kind. But if a doubt was raised as to the popular classification of the chromate of iron, a well known mineral, what shall we say of oil, which is regarded, even by science and law, as a mineral oidy because of its inorganic character, oi, as in Stoughton’s Appeal, 7 Nor. 198, because of its forming part of the freehold from which it is taken? Certainly, in popular estimation petroleum is not regarded as a mineral substance any more than is animal or vegetable oil, and it can, indeed, only be so classified in the most general or scientific sense. IIow, then, did the parties to the contract under consideration, think and write? As scientists; or as business men, using the language and governed by the ideas of every-day life ?</p>

Moreover, we may bo very sure that when Wood &amp; Co. made their contract with Nirkpatrick, they did not intend to reserve the mineral oil that might afterward be found in the land, otherwise that intention would have been exjmessed in no doubtful terms. They were, doubtless, at that time unaware of the character of the property as oil territory. But if they did entertain such an idea, and expected to reserve oil under the general term “ mineral,” they were mistaken, and should have known that they were using that word in a manner not sanctioned by the common understanding of mankind, hence, in a manner that could not be approved by the courts of justice.</p>
