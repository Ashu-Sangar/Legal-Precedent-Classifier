    <p id="b218-8" data-blocks='[["BL_218.8",218,[273,1442,1172,846]]]'>It is admitted on the part of the Commonwealth that the alleged unlawful sale by the defendant was made in the township of Derry, and that the special prohibitory statute, except its penal provision, is still in force; and it is claimed that said provision is repealed and supplied by the general statute of April 12th 1875. The punishment prescribed for violation of the general Act materially differs from that for violation of the special. In strictness, a sale contrary to the provisions of the one, is not the same offence as a sale contrary to the provisions of the other. In the township of Derry no person can be licensed to sell intoxicating liquor for use as a beverage, and all sales for such use are prohibited. It is hardly correct to say of the offender that he sold without license, as such phrase implies that persons might be licensed to sell. But the general statute provides that licenses may be issued, and “ that any sale made of vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, contrary to the provisions of this law, shall be taken to be a misdemeanor.” The penalty is expressly denounced against those who violate this law, and the indictment may properly charge that the offender sold without license.</p>

Sometimes it has been held that a general affirmative statute will repeal a prior local one upon the same subject. This is not-the rule. To effect such result, the repugnancy must be strong, or the inconsistency irreconcilable. There is no repeal where the intendment of the general is not to supply the local. A general statute, without negative words, cannot repeal a previous statute which is particular, even though the provisions of one be different from the other. “ It is against reason to suppose that the legislature in framing a general system for the state, intended to repeal a special Act which the local circumstances of one. county had made necessary: ” Brown <em>v. </em>Commissioners, <a href="/pa/21/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="21 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="411527" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0037-01">21 Pa.

Accordingly, it was decided that the 6th section of the Act of 1872, P. L. 843, relating to the sale of intoxicating liquors in the county of Allegheny, was not repealed by the 3d section of the general Act of 1875, although said sections widely differ as to the amounts to be paid for licenses for hotels, inns and taverns, and the uses of the moneys received therefor: Kilgore <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/94/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="94 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="486584" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0495-01">94 Pa.
