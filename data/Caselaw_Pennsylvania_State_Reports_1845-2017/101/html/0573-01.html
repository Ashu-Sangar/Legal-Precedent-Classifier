By Act 13th <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>June, 1840 section 12, compensation shall be such as the county commissioners shall deem just and reasonable, computing their services as for making assessments.

    <p class="summary" id="b590-8" data-blocks='[["BL_590.7",590,[303,1160,1166,544]]]'>By Act of 30th January, 1874, section.22, the county commissioners are required to procure and furnish at the expense of the county, the necessary blanks for the use of the election officers of the respective districts; and shall pay all necessary expenses for lights, rents, fuel and stationery, on bills certified by the election officers; and by the 23d section of the same Act, elections for city, ward, borough and township officers are to be regulated and conducted in like manner as general elections; ana by the Act of 8th May, 1876, section 1, the commissioners are authorized and empowered to fix and settle the compensation for lights, rents, and.fuel for election purposes at least once every three years by resolutions to be duly entered upon the minutes of the commissioners.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b590-9" data-blocks='[["BL_590.8",590,[299,1712,1163,302]]]'>The Constitution provides that “ The general elections shall be held annually on the Tuesday next following the first Monday of November,” and that “ all elections for city, ward, borough and township officers for regular terms of service shall be held on the third Tuesday of February.” The Constitution also provides that “ All laws regulating the holding of elections by the citizens, shall be uniform throughout the state.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b590-10" data-blocks='[["BL_590.9",590,[295,2010,1162,343]]]'>In answer to the claim that all expenses for holding all city, ward, borough and township elections are to be paid by the county as provided in the hereinabove recited Acts of Assembly, there is interposed the second section of an Act of Assembly approved 9th April, 1844, which reads as follows: “ The expenses ot the borough and township elections of the county of Crawford, held in March, annually, shall be paid by the borough and townships respectively.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b590-12" data-blocks='[["BL_590.10",590,[296,2351,1159,89]],["BL_591.1",591,[150,423,1176,1202]]]'>Inasmuch, however, as the case stated does not show that any of the borough or township elections of the county of Craw<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>ford are “ held in March annually,” and in point of fact under our.present Constitution, all city, ward, borough and township elections are required to be held in February, and at no other time, it is manifest that this Act of 9th April, 1844, does not repeal the Acts of 1839 and of 1,840 above cited, nor does it modify or restrain any provisions therein contained, so far at least as the elections described in the case stated are concerned. Nor could said Act under any circumstances be held to apply to city and ward elections no matter when held. It will be noticed that the Act does not in terms pretend to provide for the payment by the townships and boroughs of the expenses of the elections when township officers arc to be elected, as provided by the various laws in force on the subject, but simply when borough and township elections are “ held in March annually.” Therefore if no elections are held or to be held in borough and townships “in March annually” there are no expenses to be paid by boroughs or townships. It follows, therefore, that all city, ward, borough and township elections which are now constitutionally fixed and established tobe held in February (whereas, prior to the year 1874, there was no constitutional provision on the subject of such elections) must be regulated, governed, and their expenses paid for according to the provisions of the general election laws, which includes all such city, ward, borough and township elections which were thereafter to be fixed by law or constitutional enactment. I am, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the Act of 9th April, 1844, section 2, does not apply to city, ward, borough and township elections in the county of Crawford as the same are now fixed and established by law.</p>

    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[319,516,1175,816]]]'>This Act has not been repealed. It was urged, however, that inasmuch as the time for holding the election has been changed from March to February the Act no longer applies. We cannot assent to this view. The only object of the Act of 1844 was to impose the costs of such elections upon the municipalities in which they were held. The reference in the Act to the time of holding the elections was descriptive merely, and might have been omitted without impairing its force. Nor do we see any merit in the further objection that the Act makes no reference to city elections. Meadville was not incorporated as a city when the Act of 1844 was passed, and the only municipal elections held in Crawford county at that time were borough and township elections. The Act so plainly contemplates all municipal elections, that we are constrained to hold that city elections are w’ithin its spirit. It would be a narrow construction of the Act of 1844 to say that while Meadville as a borough was liable to pay its election expenses, yet when incorporated as a city such expenses should be thrown upon the county.</p>
