(2) That at the date of making the mortgage Mrs. White “was a minor.

By its own decree the court determined that it had jurisdiction to act; and its decision must stand. There is no authority to go behind it: McClure <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20167" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="30 Smith &amp; H. 167">30 Smith 167</a>; Foster <em>v. </em><a href="/citations/?q=30%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20167" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="30 Smith &amp; H. 167">Id.,</a> 11 Casey 148.

The customary order was made by the court, and a bond with approved sureties executed and filed.</p>
    <p id="b430-10" data-blocks='[["BL_430.11",430,[262,2058,1162,246]]]'>On the 30th of June 1874, Mrs. Hamilton, as guardian aforesaid, and in her own right, together with Margaret Jane Hamilton (now Agnew) and Ann Eliza Hamilton (now White), executed the mortgage in controversy to Lewis McMullen, who afterwards, for a valuable consideration, assigned to the appellant.</p>

    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[141,602,1168,87]]]'>The court below, after reference to a Master and hearing of he parties, entered the following decree:</p>
    <blockquote id="b431-7" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[132,687,1175,386]]]'>“1st. That as to the one-fourth interest in said mortgage made by Margaret Jane Hamilton, now Margaret Jane Agnew, this bill be dismissed. 2d.

    <p id="b431-8" data-blocks='[["BL_431.6",431,[130,1071,1175,557]]]'>In the examination of the rectitude of this decree we may notice in the first place, that Mrs. Hamilton having died before the filing of this bill, and her estate, in the promises mortgaged, being but for life, she necessarily drops out of the case, and, as to her right, leaves nothing to be considered. Nor, as was properly observed by the Master, does her mental condition, at the time of the execution on the mortgage, present itself as a matter of material consideration, for if, in the execution of that instrument, she acted under and in pursuance of the decree of the Orphans’ Court,it matters little whether she was sane or insane. The order of the court having been properly carried out, the mental condition of the instrument by which it was executed can in no manner affect its validity.</p>
    <p id="b431-9" data-blocks='[["BL_431.7",431,[130,1627,1172,211]]]'>We observe, in the second place, that the Master having found that Mrs. White was not of age when she signed the mortgage, and that she did nothing after her majority which ought to be construed as a ratification thereof, we must of necessity approve the decree so far as she is concerned.</p>
    <p id="b431-10" data-blocks='[["BL_431.8",431,[126,1835,1175,294]]]'>Finally, as to how the interests of the two minors are to be affected, depends upon the validity of the decree of the Orphans’ Court directing the mortgage. The prima facie presumption is in favor of that decree, but the presumption is not one <em>juris et dejare. </em>It may be rebutted, and if it turns out that the court had no jurisdiction, its order was void: Torrance <em>v. </em>Torrance, 3 P. F. S. 505.</p>
    <p id="b431-11" data-blocks='[["BL_431.9",431,[125,2139,1174,300]],["BL_432.1",432,[304,441,1170,600]]]'>To rebut this prima facie presumption in favor of the decree of the Orphans’ Court, we have this positive and unqualified finding of the Master: “Rosanna Hamilton had not been appointed guardian of the said minors when she made the above stated application to the Orphans’ Court, nor when she made the mortgage, neither did she thereafter obtain such appointment.” And this finding he says is of one of several facts admitted, or <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>not disputed. But if Mrs. Hamilton was not the guardian of her minor children, how was it possible for the Orphans’ Court to empower her either to mortgage or sell their lands ? The power of this court to order a sale or mortgage is based on some preceding relation of the person applying for such order to the property which it is intended thus to dispose of, as that of executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, but if there is no such relation the action of the court comes to nothing; it is mere usurpation. The maxim <em>omnia prmsumuntMV, </em>when applied to judicial proceedings, is a valuable one, but it cannot clothe a court with a jurisdiction that the constitution and laws have put beyond its reach. It cannot validate a decree authorizing A. to sell B.’s lands unless there is some precedent legal relation warranting it.</p>
