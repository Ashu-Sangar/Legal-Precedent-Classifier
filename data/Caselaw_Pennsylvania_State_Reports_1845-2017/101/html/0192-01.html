I say it is not necessary to determine that question, because the road, as it is admitted by counsel here was not included within the original limits of Monongahela city, but was afterwards taken in by the charter of 1873.

The Act of 1849 <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>gives no express jurisdiction. The question is suggested but not decided in Danville R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 23 P. F. S. 29. By the Act of March 24th 1873, the city was empowered to accept the highway as a city street, and they did so adopt it. It was then no longer a county road, but a street subject to city control to which the Act of 1849 does not apply: City <em>v. </em>McCalmont, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Phila.%20543" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Phila. 543">6 Phila. 543</a>. The mere survey of the railroad in 1871 did not bring the Act of 1849 into operation. It is only when the construction is begun that a new road must be provided. This is evident from the wording of the Act itself and is certainly reasonable. When the construction of the railroad commenced in 1879, the former road had been six years a city street. If, during those six years, valuable city improvements and handsome buildings had been erected upon it, the railroad surely could not claim that their location upon it in 1871 would justify them in vacating the street and destroying the improvements. But if the company is bound under the Act of 1849 to build a new street, then it can close the one now in use, and the property owners who bought since 1871 have no redress, Turnpike Road <em>v. </em>Brosi, 10 Harris 32; Neal <em>v. </em>P. <em>&amp; </em>C.

Dig. 1221. It declares: “If any such railroad company shall find it necessary to change the site of any portion of any turnpike or public road, they shall eause the same tp be reconstructed forthwith, at their own proper expense, on the most favorable location and in as perfect a manner as the original road.</p>

The language of the statute is, “ any turnpike or public road.” When the railroad was surveyed and located, it was unquestionably on a public road. The road was not within the city. Some two years thereafter the city was incorporated, and took within its limits, the whole of that portion of the highway on which the railroad was located. The construction thereof was be'gun six years afterwards and finished the following year. It is contended that by the extension of the jurisdiction of the city over the road it ceased to be of the class of highways named by the statute. This view does not give due weight to the effect of the location of a railroad. The location of a railroad is the taking and appropriating of the land. The right of <em>the </em>landowner to proceed and have his damages assessed is complete. He may recover not only for the damages caused by the location, but also for the subsequent construction. The damages cannot be severed. They must, all be ascertained in the one proceeding: Neal <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad Co., <a href="/grant/2/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Grant 137" data-case-ids="227748" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0137-01">2 Grant 137</a>; Wadhams <em>v. </em>Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20303" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 Wright 303">6 Wright 303</a>; Beale <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., <em>5 </em>Norris 509.

Inasmuch then as the location of the railroad on the public road was an appropriation of the latter the subsequent extension of the city so as to include this road did not so change its character as to withdraw it from the operation of the Act. The city took the road charged with its burden. It still retained the attributes of a public highway. The necessity of furnishing a substitute as soon as it was occupied by the railroad was in no wise lessened.</p>

In accepting its charter, the corporation acquires all the rights and privileges thereby given; but it assumes all the duties and obligations thereby imposed. Having taken the benefits, it cannot repudiate the burdens; it cannot be tolerated that the corporation may claim to enjoy everything beneficial to itself, and wholly omit to perform an Act in which the public is so largely interested. The rights granted are in consideration of duties assumed, among which is the duty of reconstructing the public highway from which it has excluded the public. Having accepted all the provisions of the Act, this duty arises not only from the imperative command thereof, but also from an implied agreement apd by tenure. The duty then being undoubted, will an indictment lie against the corporation for a willful disregard of it ?</p>

In Northern Central Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 9 Norris 300, it was held an indictment would lie against the corporation for so grading its crossing on a public highway, as to constitute a serious inconvenience and dangerous obstruction to travel.

The remaining specification is to the form of the sentence.</p>
    <p id="b215-6" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[146,1190,1165,461]]]'>The offence of which the company is convicted is not for taking possession of the public highway.in the construction of its railroad; but for the disregard of its duty to forthwith reconstruct, so as to provide a suitable highway in lieu of the one taken. It cannot, therefore, be compelled, by sentence in this case, to either remove the obstruction from the old road, nor to construct a new one. The sentence can go no further than to punish for the offence committed. That offence is the neglect to reconstruct within a reasonable time. The performance of that duty cannot be specifically enforced by sentence on this conviction.</p>
    <p id="b215-7" data-blocks='[["BL_215.6",215,[147,1661,1163,329]]]'>. The fine imposed is merely nominal. We suppose the company defended against this prosecution to test its liability to reconstruct; that being now established, we assume the company will proceed without any delay to, discharge its full duty. The sentence is therefore amended by striking therefrom, all except the fine of five dollars to the Commonwealth and the costs of prosecution; and thus amended the judgment is affirmed.</p>
