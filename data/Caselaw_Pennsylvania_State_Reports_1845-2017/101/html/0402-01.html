Counsel for the defendant in error asks us to reverse our uniform rulings for several years past on this point, and he has presented the casq in a 'light new to us, and has argued his case ingeniously and ably. It is argued, that both under the Act of 16th March 1872, local to Allegheny county, and under the general Act of <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>May 8th 1876, under which this suit was begun by attachment, the defendant is deprived of his ordinary exemption, 1st. Because the proceeding authorized is an attachment of the wages in the beginning, and 2d. Prom the wording of the Act, that the wages (so attached) “ shall not be paid to the defendant until the judgment, so had far such amount as may be due on such attachment, shall be satisfied.” Neither of these Acts, in terms, repeals the Act of 1819, pro tanto. Are they inconsistent with the provisions of that Act? The Act of 1819 provides for the exemption of property “from levy and sale on execution, issued upon any judgment obtained upon contract.” The suit for boarding is necessarily on a contract, express or implied, and the form of the suit, or manner in which it is instituted, makes no difference. The judgment against garnishee is a judgment that the wages be taken in execution. In Waugh <em>v. </em>Burket, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Grant%20319" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Grant 319">8 Grant 319</a>, it is held, that in a suit begun by attachment under the Act of 1812, the defendant is entitled to the exemption given by the Act of 1849.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[301,1210,1167,554]]]'>The provision that the wages shall not be paid to the defendant until the judgment shall be satisfied, is good; but it applies only where the defendant does not claim the benefit of the exemption law in proper time, or where the wages attached exceed $300. In either case judgment would be obtained as a matter of course, and the wages cannot then be paid to defendant until the judgment against him be satisfied. It may be that the Act of Assembly was intended to repeal the exemption Act pro tanto, and that it is a great hardship on boarding-house keepers that worthless men are so enabled to cheat them out of their dues, but we cannot find evidence of the intent to repeal in the Act, nor can we legislate for the relief of those so defrauded. Judgment is reversed.</p>

To meet the mischief and to give to the whole state the benefit designed by the prior local Act, the Act of May 8th 1876 (Pur. Dig. 2016) was passed as follows:</p>

Nothing but payment will satisfy; and the words of the Act are therefore most peremptory to the effect that he shall not get his wages till the judgment for his board be paid. The language used in this Act of 1876, notably wherein it differs from the Act of 1872, excludes all pleas, contrivances, devices, in or out of law as it now stands, from being effectual to give the debtor his wages till his debt so established be paid. If simply handing to the magistrate the written or printed notice that defendant claims the benefit of the exemption Act will nullify the proceeding, the law stands idle on the statute book. In no case does any debtor of the character to make such plea have due him the amount of $300 of wages. The right to claim such exemption is inconsistent with' the plain meaning and reasonable construction of the Acts.</p>

But even under that Act we contend that the decision of the court below is correct. Had it been the intention of the legislature in either the Act of 1872 or that of 1876 to repeal the exemption Act it would have used language similar to that in the attachment Act of May 8th <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>1874, (Purd.
