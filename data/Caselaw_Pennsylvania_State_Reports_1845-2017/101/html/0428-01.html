Riddle testified upon this point as follows : <em>"</em>After Mr. Stoughton gave the mortgage from which this fund has arisen to Mr. McCandless, he (Stoughton) came to me and told me what he had done ; that he had first refused to put in the mortgage the property he had secured me with, but on Mr. McCandless agreeing to assign to me a similar amount of the mortgage he consented to it; I then called upon Mr. McCandless and asked him about this security of mine and he said that was the arrangement; and made to me an assignment of $2,000 of this mortgage on the train between this and Pittsburgh, when he was on his way to New Mexico; this assignment was made by Mr. McCandless, with the consent of Mr. Stoughton; Mr. McCandless prior to this, and before the giving of the mortgage, transferred to me $3,000 of his stock in the Harmony National Bank, which was applied as a payment on the Stoughton note.....My present recollection of the transaction is that this arrangement was importunately insisted upon by Mr. Stoughton; at the time, I regarded it as so much loss to myself; the securities he had given me I did not regard as near equal to my indorsement for it; the properties in the mortgage, in my <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>opinion, were estimated by Stoughton clear beyond their value ; if that had been the arrangement at the time the paper was executed to Stoughton, I suppose it would have been put in it.”</p>

The Auditor understands, further, from this authority, that neither surety nor creditor has a right in esse until the debtor fails to pay the secured debt, but pending the failure to pay, each have an inchoate right that upon a certain contingency may become complete and. absolute, and during the pendency the mortgagee is quasi trustee for both debtor and creditor, and a mortgagee’s assignment of the security before his rights were complete would pass no title, because of the cited authority he would have no title to assign. His assignment after his right had vested, with notice of the equities of creditors, would be void as against them because, by the same authority, their rights vested contemporaneously with his. “ A mortgage distinct from the debt has no value in itself, and if assigned, the assignee holds it in trust for the .holder of the note or debt.” Ibid. 838. And the Auditor is of opinion that the assignee accepting the assignment, with notice of the creditors’ equities, would take for their use, and would stand in the same fiduciary relation towards them as did his assignor. The question might have been asked: Why cannot a surety holding a mortgage as indemnity, assign it before the equity of a creditor arises, if he might under same circumstances surrender it? By the authority cited, section 387: “Even after <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>insolvency of the parties primarily holders for the debt, the mortgagee may surrender the security, if he does it in good faith, and before any claim is made upon him for it.’ There is undoubtedly wide enough difference between an assignment and a surrender, but the authority stated leaves the reason of the rule cited a matter of conjecture. Perhaps the reason might bo sought from what follows, in same paragraph: <em>‘ </em>But after the principal debtor has become insolvent, the security cannot make a valid agreement with the holder or any party interested in one of the notes on which he is indemnified by the mortgage, that the security shall be first applied to such note; the holders of all such notes are entitled in equity to share the property in proportion to their respective claims. When a mortgage is given to indemnify an indorser the creditor has an equitable claim to the security, and after the liability is fixed is entitled to have the mortgage assigned to him. This is the rule not only where the condition is that the mortgagor shall pay the debt, but also where it merely stipulates that he shall indemnify the surety.’ These principles seem to establish that the mortgagee has no power, in any manner, to divert the condition of the instrument to any other channel than originally provided for. To do so might give one creditor an undue advantage over another and fraud might be perpetrated with impunity and with every semblance of legality by assignment of the security to a confederate for a nominal consideration, and thereby defeating the rights of <em>bona fide </em>creditors. In other .words, an insolvent debtor, by collusion with his indemnified surety and a third person, might place all his mortgaged property out of the reach of his creditors, to be used for his own future benefit. And further, an assignment by the mortgagee before forfeiture of the indemnity, if held valid, would presuppose an absolute right in him by the mortgage from date of execution, instead.of from date of forfeiture. But the effect of surrender of the surety is entirely different. No injury could ensue in consequence thereof and all the debtor’s creditors would be left as before— upon an equal footing.</p>

The distinction made in-Brandt on Surety-ship seems to be this, that where the liability is contingent, as in cases of official bonds where no breach has occurred, the contingency must come or the injury be sustained before the right of indemnity enures to the creditor. But not so where, as in this case, the liability of the surety is fixed and wlierdthe contract is made not only for the personal benefit of the surety but <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>with the idea of a pledge for the debt or providing means for its payment.

    <p id="b452-9" data-blocks='[["BL_452.10",452,[316,1259,1180,300]]]'>Erom the Auditor’s report, and the papers of this ease, we gather the following facts : On the 14th of February 1878, W. G. Stoughton executed a mortgage, in the sum of $4,850 to Charles McCandless, on four several tracts of land situated in the county of Butler, among which was the one undivided third part of a tract of one hundred and twenty acres in tire township of Oakland.</p>
    <p id="b452-10" data-blocks='[["BL_452.11",452,[316,1557,1170,468]]]'>On the same day, and as part of the same transaction, McCandless executed and delivered to Stoughton a paper in which was set forth, among other things, that the mortgage was given to secure him (McCandless) against any loss he might sustain by reason of his endorsements of certain notes of Stoughton, in the Parker Savings Bank, the Butler Savings Bank, the First National Bank of Butler, the German National Bank of Millerstown, and the Third National Bank of Pittsburgh, and if the notes were paid by Stoughton, or, if McCandless was otherwise released from their payment, then, and in that case, the mortgage was to be satisfied.</p>
    <p id="b452-11" data-blocks='[["BL_452.12",452,[317,2023,1168,302]]]'>Previously to this time, however, W. II. II. Riddle, had become endorser for Stoughton, on a note of some five thousand dollars which was discounted by the Harmony National Bank, and as part security for this endorsement, Stoughton had executed a deed to Riddle for the one-third part of the one hundred and twenty acre tract of land in Oakland Township, afterwards included in the mortgage above mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b452-12" data-blocks='[["BL_452.13",452,[316,2321,1170,88]],["BL_453.1",453,[110,421,1175,1414]]]'>This deed was not recorded, but deposited for safe-keeping in the bank last named. We need hardly stop to say that this <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>deed, given, as it was, as security for Biddle’s endorsements, was equitably a mortgage, the defeasance resting in parol, though the auditor seemed to think that the fee was thereby vested in the grantee. This was a mistake ; a mistake which, perhaps, led to the erroneous disposition of this case. Then, when Stoughton came to execute his mortgage to McCandless, he refused to put into it the land thus deeded, unless McCandless would first agree to assign to Biddle two thousand dollars thereof, a sum deemed equivalent to the value of the land. This, McCandless agreed to do, and this agreement was consummated by the assignment of the 26th or 27th of May 1878, and which Biddle, in turn, assigned to the appellant. It will thus be seen that so far from there being no consideration passing from Biddle to Stoughton and McCandless for the assignment, as the Master assumed, there was a full and adequate one, for Biddle’s acceptance thereof operated to release his prior lien upon the land ; a lien, of which, though not of record, McCandless had notice, hence binding as to him. Now, McCandless and Stoughton both being insolvent, there is no doubt or dispute about the position assumed by the learned auditor, that equitably the payees of the unpaid notes were subrogated to the rights of the endorser in the mortgage which was given to secure him. But they cannot bo subrogated to any other right than that which he had. They but stand in his place; they cannot deprive Biddle of a right which was contemporary with that of McCandless. The mortgage was executed as well for the use and security of the latter as of the former, hence the creditors of the one cannot interfere with that which in equity and good faith belongs to the other. It follows, that there should have been a pro rata distribution between the appellant, as assignee of Biddle, and the creditors of Stoughton and McCandless, in the proportion that two thousand bears to twenty-eight hundred and fifty.</p>
    <p id="b453-6" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[112,1834,1172,506]]]'>We may say further, that we do not concur in the position assumed by the counsel for the appellant, that Biddle’s assignment, because of his superior equity, was first entitled to payment even to the exhaustion of the fund. Riddle’s equity was not superior to that of McCandless. It is true his lien upon the premises was the earlier of the two, but the very foundation of his right in and to the subsequent mortgage, and in the fund now in court, rests upon the fact that he voluntarily relinquished that lien in consideration of the interest which he obtained in that mortgage. Such being the case, it is obvious, that he cannot now go back to that which he, for a valuable consideration, abandoned.</p>
