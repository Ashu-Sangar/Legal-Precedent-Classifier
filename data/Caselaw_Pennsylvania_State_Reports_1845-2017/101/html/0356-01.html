The court subsequently dissolved the attachment, and B. then brought assumpsit against A. for the same debt. On the trial, A. offered in evidence, byway of set-off, the bond, to be followed by proof of the amount of damages which he had sustained, by reason of his factory being closed for a month under the attachment. <em>Held, </em>that this offer of evidence was improperly rejected by the court below. <em>Held further, </em>that the damages sustained by A. arose ex contractu and were such as could be liquidated; and, therefore, that they could be set off by A. in this action.</p>

In the proceeding by attachment <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>the plaintiff was obliged to, and did, give a bond conditioned for the payment to the defendant of all legal costs and damages which he might sustain by reason of the attachment, if the plaintiff failed to prosecute the attachment with effect. After the giving of the bond in the attachment proceeding, the seizure of the defendant’s goods was not a tort, but a perfectly lawful act. If any damages resulted therefrom to the defendant, the plaintiff was bound by his contract, to wit, the bond, to pay the amount thereof to the defendant. The defendant in order to recover those damages would necessarily be obliged to bring an action on the bond for that purpose, if the plaintiff refused to pay them voluntarily. This being so, it is perfectly clear that his right of action against the plaintiff is not fox-damages for a trespass, but damages for breach of the condition of the bond.</p>

While it is true.the damages are unliquidated, they are capable of liquidation by proof, and therefore, the right to set them off in this action comes clearly within the adjudicated cases. The whole subject of the right of set-off in such cases was exhaustively reviewed by the present Chief Justice in the case of Hunt <em>v. </em>Gilmore, 9 P. F. S. 450, in which it was held that unliquidated damages arising ex conti-actu from any bax-gain, may be set-off tinder the Pennsylvania Defalcation Act, whenever they are capable of liquidation by any known legal standai-d. The same doctx-ine was x-epeated and applied in the cases of Halfpenny <em>v. </em>Bell, 1 Norr. 128, and The Domestic Sewing Machine Co. <em>v. </em>Saylor, 5 Norr. 287.
