Sunning along the plaintiff’s land was a road leading from otie public road to another, long open and used by everybody. This road became impassable from snow-drifts, and was in that condition for several weeks. The plaintiff and <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>Abraham Bife had tried to open the road to travel, working with horses towards each other from the one end and the other but could not open it. It was dangerous to horses to attempt to force them through the snow-drifts at that part of the road. Persons accustomed to use this road were compelled to leave it. and enter the field of Henry O. Bife, pass thence by bars into the plaintiff’s field, traverse it in a line parallel with the road and some 12 or 15 feet distant from it, and emerge through bars into a lane which conducted again into the public road.

I should be. sorry to think it is not. Eor one ought to be able to walk in the country on a summer morning and cross a grass field without subjecting himself to costs amounting to many dollars where the damages were not a cent. It was to prevent such trivial and vexatious suits that the statute was passed. It was reported to be in force by the judges, of course on the ground that that part of the law of England was suitable to our condition in the province and had been adopted by the people. Prom that time on it has been assumed to be the law — whilst there is not one express decision that it is the law here. But the cases all through our books go upon that supposition: Hinds <em>v. </em>Knox, 4 S. &amp; R. 417; Guffey <em>v. </em>Free, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20H.%20384" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 H. 384">7 H. 384</a>; Simonds <em>v. </em>Barton, 26 P.

In Chapman <em>v. </em>Calder, there is a remark by Coulter, Justice, that in view of the Act of 1814, It would seem that the legislature did not consider the statute of Challes as extended to this country : <a href="/citations/?q=2%20H.%20357" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 H. 357">2 H. 357</a>. The reason, because it does not apply where the suit originated before a justice. In such case, if the plaintiff recovers over one dollar, he is allowed costs. And why should the rule be different as to cases originally brought in the same forum? But the argument cuts both ways; for if the statute of Charles II. be not extended, the plaintiff will have full costs in suits begun iu the Common Pleas, though the damages found bo less than one dollar — whereas if the same suit came up from a magistrate’s court, the plaintiff would lose his costs. And the legislature has, in the Act of 1814, distinctly approved the principle of the English statute in refusing costs for trivial trespasses.</p>

      <em>“ </em>From the beginning, the statute has been confined to trespass q. c. f., and for assault and battery, because in no other case could there be given a certificate, and consequently in all those cases, however meritorious, the plaintiff would iose his costs. And not only so, but the operation of the statute was further narrowed, upon the same reason, so as not to include those cases of trespass q. c. f. where the declaration embraced some other distinct injury to person or personal property, and general damages were given. For where (for instance) the declaration charges an asportavit of personal property as well as an injury to the freehold, that so far as the trespass to the personal property is concerned, the freehold could not come in question, no certificate could be given under the statute, and so that case is not within the statute. And the rule was announced that where the case is such that the judge at the trial cannot in any view of the case grant a certificate within the Act, it is considered to bo a case out of the statute. This rule, when applied to the declaration, seems to me to be founded in reason, and to leave the statute intact and operative so far as the lawmakers intended.
