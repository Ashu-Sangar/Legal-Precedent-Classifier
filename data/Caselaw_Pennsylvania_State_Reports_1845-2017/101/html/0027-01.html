There could be neither a consent nor acquiescence, that would at all affect the case, by the adjacent land owners of forty years ago to the opening of a street laid out by the authority of the state some forty-five years before that time, and when the commonwealth was the sole proprietor of the property in controversy. If, indeed, it is intended to assert by this point that the owners of the land, on either or both sides of the street, gained anything by the occupancy of any part of it for the period of forty <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>years, it was a mistake, for the public right could not be barred by the mere lapse of time. As was said by Mr. Chief Justice Gibson, in the case of Barter <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/pen-w/3/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 253" data-case-ids="1827558" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0253-01">3 P. &amp; W. 253</a>, the title of a municipal corporation do the soil of its streets, for those purposes that concern the public enjoyment and convenience, is paramount and exclusive; and no private occupancy, for whatever time, whether adverse or permissive, can vest a title inconsistent with it. A recognition of the same doctrine may be found in the cases of The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Alberger, <a href="/whart/1/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Whart. 469" data-case-ids="1829068" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0469-01">1 Wh. 469</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McDonald, 16 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 395; and the Penny Pot Landing Case, 4 Har. 79,</p>

If the public right was not compromised by the adoption, by the borough council, of a line other than the original line of the street, as was the case in The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Miltenberger, <a href="/watts/7/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Watts 450" data-case-ids="1846883" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0450-01">7 Watts 450</a>, that right could not be defeated by the fact that Kopf, and those under whom he claimed, had for more than twenty-one years been allowed to fence in some three feet of the public street. Neither can we understand how the repairing of this street from time to time, or the ordering of sidewalks, can be taken as .a recognition, by the borough officers, of the line claimed by the plaintiff, and that in the face of the fact that the council had never authorized any alteration of the line of 1795 ; on the other hand, certainly intending by the survey of 1867, to discover and adopt it.</p>
    <p id="b47-6" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[129,1534,1175,472]]]'>The road master would naturally repair the street as he found it, without regard to the original lines, and the lot owner would grade and pave his sidewalks from and to what he considered his line; hence, in neither case would the borough council be consulted. In fact, as we have already said, the only question properly in this case was that involving the original lines of East Street; nevertheless, the court instructed the jury, that if the borough authorities did any thing.to induce the plaintiff, or those under whom he held, to build up to the line claimed by him, the borough, after twenty-one years, would be estopped from afterwards disputing it.</p>
    <p id="b47-7" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[128,2004,1175,212]]]'>In this instruction the plaintiff certainly got all, and perhaps, more than he was entitled to.
