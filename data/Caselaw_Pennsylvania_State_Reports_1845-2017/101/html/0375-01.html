The particular offices named are all of that character. First. All offices to which the governor has the original power of appointment. Second. Such elective offices as are specially named, viz: auditor general, state treasurer, secretary of internal affairs, superintendent of public instruction, and a judicial office. And on a close analysis of the section this view is rather confirmed. Yet it may possibly bear a wider construction and may embrace offices, where neither the constitution nor the statute may require a confirmation by the senate. For example, I see nothing in the constitution in the way of the legislature empowering the governor to fill vacancies until the next general election, in county offices. Whether this section would require all such appointments to be confirmed by the senate, if the statute did not so provide, may be doubted. But doubtless, in all such cases the latter part of the section, which designates the time for filling the office by a new election, would apply; for all such officers are elected at the general election in November. The section may well apply to all state and county offices. But does it apply to city, ward, borough or township offices?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b394-4" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[288,1207,1166,758]]]'>“ Throughout the constitution where the expression “ general election” occurs, it means the November election. “The members of the General Assembly shall be chosen at the general election, every second yearArticle II, section 2. The governor “ shall be chosen on the day of the general electionArticle IV, section 2. County officers shall be elected at the general elections;” Article XIV, section 2. “The general eleetidn shall be held annually on the Tuesday next following the first Monday of November:” Article VIII, section 2. And the 3rd section of Article VIII, provides, that “ All elections for city, ward, borough and township officers, for regular terms of service, shall be held on the third Tuesday of February.” Then section 11 of Article V, provides, that “ justices of the peace and aldermen shall be elected at the time of the election of constables.” If this section applies to the office of alderman, and if the election to fill a vacancy in that office shall be held at the general election, then it is in conflict with section 2 of Article V.</p>

But that would be given a totally different meaning to the term “general election” in this section, from all other places where it is used in the constitution. That is not to be presumed. A constitution is generally prepared with great deliberation, and the words carefully selected. Instead of giving that forced construction to this section, it is much more fair and reasonable to suppose it was not intended to apply to any officers of an <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>elective character, except those who are elected at the general election.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[179,502,1168,463]]]'>“ This view of the section is confirmed when we consider the difference in the offices to be filled at the two elections. All state and county officers are elected at the general election in November. There is great reason why, in the case of a sudden vacancy, as by death, the election should not take place until the electors have had ample time to learn of the vacancy and select a suitable successor. Three months’ time in such cases is perhaps short enough. But in city, ward, borough or township offices that length of time is not necessary. The twenty days prescribed in the statute for the constable’s notice of the election is sufficient.</p>

We must, however, consider it as belonging to the class of ward, borough or township offices, because it is placed in that class by the constitution. And it is the only office of that class where, under existing laws, the governor has power to appoint, in case of vacancy.</p>

From the whole tenor of the section, it seems to me, it was not intended to apply to any offices which are to be filled at the February election.</p>
