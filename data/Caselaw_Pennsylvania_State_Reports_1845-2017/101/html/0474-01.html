A. died, leaving real and personal estate, which he devised and bequeathed to his wife for life. He also appointed her his executrix with power to sell his real and personal estate, and directed his debts to be paid. The widow engaged in business, and three years after the death of her husband (having filed no account as executrix), assigned all her real and personal estate to an assignee for the benefit of creditors. The assignee sold the same, and the purchaser of the real estate bought it, each under the mistaken belief that the entire fee-simple passed, and the purchaser paid full value therefor. The latter, discovering his mistake, within five years from the husband’s death, procured a conveyance from the widow, as executrix with power of sale, the nominal consideration recited in the deed being the sum ho had previously paid to her assignee for creditors. The assignee filed his account, which was confirmed without exception, and the balance was paid into the court of Common Pleas, and referred to an auditor for distribution. The fund was claimed on the one hand by the wife’s creditors, and on the other, by the creditors of the deceased husband, and the court, on exceptions to the auditor’s report, awarded the entire fund to the creditors of the <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>deceased husband: <em>Held, </em>to be error.

Her assignee sold the personal estate, and also, on July 19th 1879, sold the real estate, at public sale (without an order of court), collected the book debts and filed his account February 3d 1880, showing a balance in his hands of $2,544.33, of which $1,710 was the proceeds of the real estate. This account was confirmed, without exception, and, by leave of court, the assignee paid said balance into court, and an auditor was appointed to distribute the same.

The latter class of creditors based their claim on the following facts, which were proved before the auditor, viz: The said Henry Frederick died March 2d, 1875, heavily indebted, seised and possessed of real and personal estate, leaving a will, whereby, after directing his just debts to be paid as soon as possible, he gave and bequeathed to his wife Dorothea Frederick, all his estate for her life or during widowhood, and at her death the same to pass to his children in equal shares.

She was a German of limited education, and it appeared that she believed and so asserted generally that she owned absolutely as sole devisee and legatee all the property real and personal of her late husband. It further appeared that her assignee and the purchaser of the real estate from him also acted upon this assumption. None of the creditors of Henry Frederick, deceased, had, prior to the present proceedings, pressed their claims, or demanded that the executrix should file an account or sell the real estate for the payment of debts.</p>

But they can have no claim to the proceeds of sale of Mrs. Frederick’s property or title. They cannot claim adversely to the assignment under which the fund for distribution arises. The facts that Mrs. Frederick executed a deed, as executrix of Henry Frederick, to the purchaser at the assignee’s sale, and that she filed an account in the Orphans’ Court charging herself with the consideration money, are ineffectual to change the character of the fund, which had previously been accounted for and paid into court by Mrs. Frederick’s assignee for creditors, and as to which the rights of Mrs. Frederick’s creditors were vested.</p>

No act of hers could affect the trust character of the property. As<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>signees under voluntary assignments for creditors are volunteers, and the creditors are affected by the trusts with which the assignor was affected. Neither the assignor nor the assignee can alter the course of distribution. Where trust property is wrongfully converted, and its identity can be traced, it is in its new form still subject to the trust. There is no question here that the fund for distribution is the proceeds of sale of the trust property. It is frivolous to argue that Mrs. Frederick did not assign and her assignee did not sell and convert the trust property. But even if that were so, Mrs. Frederick as executrix with power of sale for payment of debts conveyed by deed, within five years from the testator’s death, the real estate of her testator, and in her account filed as executrix, charged herself with the proceeds in the hands of her assignee, who paid the same into the Common Pleas. The lien of testator’s debts was thereby undoubtedly discharged from the real estate in the hands of the purchaser and transferred to the fund. While it would have been more regular for the Common Pleas to have referred the fund to the Orphans’ Court for distribution, the reason why that course was not followed is fully stated in the postscript to the opinion of the court below on the auditor’s first report (supra). The objection is the merest technicality, and to allow it to prevail would be to consummate a legal fraud. The jurisdiction of the Common Pleas over accounts of assignees and trustees is a general equitable one, and will not be so perverted as to sanction the taking of one man’s property to pay the debts of another. The appellees were without the advice of counsel until after the filing and confirmation of the assignee’s account, and counsel, as soon as they were retained, asked leave to file exceptions nunc pro tunc to the assignee’s account, and have the fund transferred to the Orphans’ Court for distribution, but the court refused our application on the understanding that the appellee would not be prejudiced by the irregularity. Our position is supported by Thompson’s Appeal, 10 Harris 16.</p>

The learned court below erred in assuming that the fund belonged to the estate of Henry Frederick, the deceased husband of the assignor, and awarding it to his creditors. The result led to the anomaly of distributing a deceased man’s estate in the Common Pleas. If, as was assumed, any portion of the fund belongs to the estate of Henry Frederick, deceased, it can only be distributed through proper <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>proceedings in the Orphans’ Court.

    <p id="b496-4" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[272,588,1178,1023]]]'>The assignment was of the estate of Dorothea Frederick. It purported to convey nothing else. The assignee could make title to nothing else. It appears tire real estate, which is the principal matter of contention, belonged to the estate of the deceased husband of the assignor. The latter, however, had an interest in it, capable of passing by an assignment. The deed from the assignee to the purchaser conveyed her interest only, leaving the property liable to the statutory lien of the debts of Henry Frederick, if any such existed: Knowles <em>v. </em>Lord, <a href="/whart/4/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Whart. 500" data-case-ids="1835017" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0500-01">4 Wharton 500</a>; Ludwig <em>v. </em>Highley, 5 Barr 133. The purchaser may, and possibly did believe he obtained a good title. If application had been made at the proper time, and in a proper way for relief, it would probably have been granted. No such effort was made, and the assignee has brought the fund into court as the property of Dorothea Frederick. As the record stands it must he distributed to her creditors. If the assignee has made a mistake and brought the money of some one else into court he may, as we said in a recent case not yet reported, be responsible for his blunder to the parties injured. But so long as he does not ask to have his account reformed, wo are unable to see how the creditors of Henry Frederick, deceased, can come in and claim a fund, which the assignee brings in as a part of the assigned estate. Such a practice would lead to confusion and uncertainty.</p>

That is a matter for her to settle in the Orphans’ Court. She has filed her account in that court wherein she has charged herself with the whole of the purchase money, notwithstanding the fact as alleged that she did not receive it. Whether that court will relieve her of this charge is a matter about which we express no opinion. The whole business appears to have been a mass of blunders from the beginning. The law will correct many errors when presented at the proper time and in an orderly way, but there is a limit beyond which it cannot go.</p>
