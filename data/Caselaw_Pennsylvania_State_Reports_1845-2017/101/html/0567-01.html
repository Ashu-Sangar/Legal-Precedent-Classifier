Before the sale C. , a subsequent judgment creditor, offered $13,000 for the farm, and on this being refused said he would attend the sale and buy it there. A., in B.’s presence offered O. $100 to stay away from the sale, and said that B. would also give him $100 worth of corn, which they did. C. stayed away, and A. bought the farm at the sale for $4,000, allowing B. to remain on it for a year and a half, when, B. having failed to sell it or to pay A.’s claim, A. notified him to leave the premises; which B. did, and afterwards brought ejectment against A., alleging fraud on his part in offering O. $100 to stay away from the sale, and in buying the farm for $4000.

About January 1st of the same year, Phillips, who held or represented judgments against Hull to the amount of $11,000, at the latter’s request, went to see him in order to arrange for securing this indebtedness, there being also other small judgments against Hull. At this interview it was agreed that the property should be sold at sheriff’s sale, and that Phillips should buy it, taking the deed in his own name, so that it might be sold afterwards in small parcels, or to the best advantage possible, and that Hull could retain anything left after paying the judgments.</p>

The Mullens did therefore stay away from the sale, and Phillips bought the farm for $4,000, and when Hull remonstrated with him for bidding it in so low, he said it would make no difference in their arrangement but would save sheriff’s percentage; and finally that Phillips soon began to exercise control over the farm denying any right thereto to Hull, to whom he gave formal notice to leave about a year after the sale, and took possession of the farm himself, soon after-wards reviving his judgment and claiming that Hull was still indebted to him. Hull therefore brought this action against Phillips alleging fraud by the latter in offering the Mullens $100 to stay away from the sale, and in purchasing the farm for only $4,000.</p>

Phillips further alleged that he allowed Hull to remain on the farm for one year, without finding a purchaser, and then continued the time for six months longer, when, upon Hull’s failure either to fine a purchaser in a year and a half, or to pay anything on the judgment, Phillips notified him to leave the farm; but that he was ready and willing, at anytime, to reconvey the same to Hull, or some one designated by him, upon payment of the sum due on the judgments.</p>

Phillips did not get the farm by ’ artifice or trick, but because Hull wished him to do so, and although Phillips induced others, in Hull's presence, not to bid, this was in furtherance of their common purpose. Even if the sale were a fraud upon Hull, he subsequently ratified it also, by saying that he was “ perfectly satisfied,” with Phillip’s explanation of the matter; and he accepted and retained benefits under the <em>original </em>contract, after discovering the alleged fraud, by unduly delaying to claim the laud: Pearsoll <em>v. </em>Chapin, 8 Wr. 9; Negley <em>v. </em>Lindsay, 17 P. F. S. 217; Seylar <em>v. </em>Carson, 19 P. F. S. 81. The transaction between Phillips and Mullen in Hull’s presence was not a fraud upon Hull, and there is nothing, therefore, left but a parol agreement by one to buy land for another, which comes within the statute of frauds.

Bennett <em>v. </em>Savings Bank, 6 Norris 382, and the other cases cited by plaintiff in error are cases of parol agreements and nothing more; in none of them were bidders dissuaded from bidding by the representation that the property was to be bought for the defendant; in none of them was money paid by the purchaser to buy off a bidder. These “ devices ” and “ deceits ” are what the law condemns. It was not necessary to tender to Phillips the amount of his bid before bringing suit: Gilbert <em>v. </em>Hoffman, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%2067" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts 67">2 Watts 67</a>; Smull <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20138" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 138">1 W. &amp; S. 138</a>. But the plaintiff in error says that he ought not to be held responsible for his fraudulent conduct because Hull knew that he had the arrangement with Mullen, and that he was to buy in the farm. If, however, Phillips falsely and fraudulently represented to Hull that he would sell the farm at sheriff’s sale, on his judgment, for the purpose of putting the title in a more convenient shape to sell in pieces, and that he would bid it in and then they would sell it to pay the balance of the debts and that the remainder of the land should be his, and that he would do this for the purpose of saving him a home, and by such fraudulent representations obtained the consent of Hull to the buying in of the farm, and thereby was enabled to get .it for one-fourth of its value, the consent of Hull, so obtained, would not give validity to the title.</p>

The plaintiff owned and was interested in judgments against the defendant in error aggregating about $11,000. The latter seeks to recover on a parol agreement made with the plaintiff in error by which ho was to sell the land at sheriff’s sale, buy it, and hold it until a private sale thereof could be made, and after the amount due to him was paid, the defendant in error was to have the residue. The latter was to advance nothing, to pay nothing. Without his assent the plaintiff could have sold. The defendant made no agreement that he would afterwards purchase the land at any price. If this were the whole ease it is very clear the defendant in error could not recover. As the purchase was made, and the money paid by the same person, a refusal to fulfill the agreement is no more than the violation of a parol agreement, and equity will not decree the purchaser to be a trustee: Kisler <em>v. </em>Kisler, <a href="/watts/2/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Watts 323" data-case-ids="1840089" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0323-01">2 Watts 323</a>; Sidle <em>v. </em>Walters, 5 <a href="/watts/2/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Watts 323" data-case-ids="1840089" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0323-01">Id. 391</a>; Robertson <em>v. </em>Robertson, 9 Id. 32; Fox <em>v. </em>Heffner, 1 W. <em>&amp; </em>Serg. 372; Jackman <em>v. </em>Ringland, 4 Id. 149; Barnet <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 8 Casey 371; Kellum <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Id. 158; Bennett <em>v. </em>Dollar Savings Bank, 6 Norris 382.</p>

It may be conceded that a trick or artifice unknown to the defendant in error which operated to his prejudice would have that effect. If however he had full knowledge of the alleged fraudulent act and participated in it, or if the act now complained of did not operate to enlarge or affect the title which would otherwise have passed by the sheriff’s sale, then the equitable rule does not aid the defendant in this case.</p>
    <p id="b587-7" data-blocks='[["BL_587.5",587,[149,1703,1166,512]]]'>The first complaint is that the plaintiff in error induced the Mullens, who were later judgment creditors, to stay away from the sheriff’s sale and not bid against him, by representing that if he bought it the defendant was to have the privilege of selling the land at private sale for his benefit. All this conversation with the Mullens was in the presence and hearing of the defendant and his wife. They participated in it. At the same time an agreement was made as to the payment of the Mullen judgment. The defendant in error and his wife each testified that plaintiff said he would give $100 on it, and that they would pay $100 in com, and that he would guarantee the payment of the residue of the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b587-8" data-blocks='[["BL_587.6",587,[150,2214,1165,215]],["BL_588.1",588,[287,424,1166,172]]]'>The Mullens are not here complaining. They are not parties to this suit, nor interested in the judgment. No question arises with any creditor of the defendant. This is purely a question between the parties and between them alone. Whatever was said and done to prevent the Mullens from bidding at <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>the sale, was with the knowledge and assent of the defendant. In contemplation of law it was as much his act as the act of the plaintiff. If it was wrong he was a party to that wrong. He cannot now set it up to affect the sheriff’s sale.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[283,595,1169,469]]]'>The other complaint is that the plaintiff bid only $4000, instead of about $11,000, as he should have done. If however, in all respects, he recognizes his duty and obligation to be the same as if ho had bid the larger sum, we do not see how the defendant is prejudiced by the smaller bid. The latter testified that a few days after the sheriffs sale the plaintiff informed him that he had bought the farm for $4,000. At this he complained; but on being told that it was better for him as it saved sheriff’s percentage, and should not make any difference in their bargain, he was satisfied. This subsequent assent was a ratification as effective, as if the bid had been previously authorized.</p>
    <p id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[282,1064,1169,640]]]'>The defendant testifies that his liberty to make a private sale was not limited to any specific time. The plaintiff swears it was to be within one year. Three other witnesses, Beeman, McCracken and Webb, each testify to the admission of the defendant, indicating he was to have one year only in which to effect a sale. If, however, no time was specified, and he was under no legal obligation to sell, he could not claim his option to continue for an unreasonable time. In fact the plaintiff did extend the time for six months beyond the year. In the mean time an offer of $13,000 was made to the defendant for the land, but he refused it. All this time he was in possession of the property and at most paying no more than the-interest o:i the indebtedness. On demand of possession by the plaintiff he gave it up, without being ejected by legal process, and after-wards brought this suit.</p>

The defendant in error seeks to recover possession of the land and hold adversely without making payment. His claim is one in equity only. He must first do equity. He must cither pay or tender payment. He has not done either. His own testimony shows no such artifice or fraud on the part of the plaintiff as to relieve him from this obligation.
