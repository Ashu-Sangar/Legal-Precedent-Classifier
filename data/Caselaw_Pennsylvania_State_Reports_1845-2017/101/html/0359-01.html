In an action against ii corporation, the sheriff returned the summons, “ served by delivering a true and attested copy of the within writ to A., secretary of [the corporation, defendant,] and by making known to him the contents thereof.” The plaintiff filed with his affidavit of claim an agreement in writing between plaintiff and defendant, wherein the defendant corporation, was styled “ of Wheeling, W. Va.” The secretary of the corporation, upon affidavit that the defendant was a foreign corporation. not engaged in business and having no office in Pennsylvania, obtained a rule to show cause why the service should not be set aside and the writ quashed: <em>Meld, </em>that the sheriff’s return showed a valid service on the corporation, under the provisions of the Act of March 31st 1849 (P.

On the face of the record, therefore, it appears that there was no legal service on the corporation, for it is well settled that service of process upon any officer of a corporation, while merely casually present in the jurisdiction of another state does not constitute personal service on the corporation itself. Any citizen of the United States may freely traverse the territory of any state in the union, and his official functions as, an officer of a corporation in his own state do not accompany him, so as to constitute a service of process upon him a service upon the corporation: Bank of Virginia <em>v. </em>Adams, 1 Pars.

Dig. 287), which provides that in a suit against a foreign corporation process may be served upon any officer of such corporation either personally or by copy or by leaving a certified copy at the office, depot, or usual place of business of said corporation.” The- words “ or by leaving a certified copy at the office, depot or usual place of business of said corporation ” are the key to the interpretation of this Act. Evidently it means only to provide for the mode of service on a foreign corporation which has, in Pennsylvania, an office, depot or place of business, else, why provide, in- the alternative, for the service on the agent or at his usual place of business. All statutes are construed in reference to the territorial limits of the power'passing the Act, and when a statute would provide for the service on a foreign corporation it must receive the construction in accordance with the common law jurisdiction of the legislative and judicial branch of the government: Farnum <em>v. </em>Blackstone Canal Co., 1 Sumner Reports 26; Lehigh Valley Ins.
