    <p id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[144,1107,1173,1239]]]'>The act of February 16th 1867, P.

Both sections refer to an existing or past state of things, to lands which are assessed and returned, or heretofore sold, and contain no direction for future returns or sales, except the sale of lands wdfich are returned upon the said oath of the collector. If returned without said oath they are not within the Act of 1867; and prior, the return was not required to be under oath. The direction for sale, though contained in more verbiage, means no more than the Act of 1844, which directs that <em>“ </em>the said lands shall be sold as unseated lands are-now sold.” No provision is made by the Act of 1867 for the redemption of lands sold after its passage; hence, there is no change upon this point. If it was the design to do away with the distinction between seated and unseated lands it is likely that the right of redemption would have been placed upon the same footing.</p>

Though it may be <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>called remedial, it is exceptional, and deprives the citizens of a few counties of rights enjoyed by citizens of other parts of-the state. Its words, taken in their usual sense, have no relation to future assessments and returns; they relate only to those already made. It seems akin to legislation which validates acknowledgments of deeds, or defective judicial sales, the object being to vest in the purchasers of all seated lands in said counties, heretofore sold, after the lapse of two years, a valid title, notwithstanding the purchasers under the Act of 1844 would have no title at all. The pith is the provision that the return upon the oath of the collector that no personal property could be found upon the land out of which said taxes could be made, shall be conclusive of that fact; and the sting upon the unwary owner who has had no notice, as prescribed by the Act of 1844, is, that after two years from the date of the act, the title to his land will be vested in another person. As respects sales not made, but which may be made on then existing returns, the owner would be entitled to actual notice from the treasurer, and the danger to his 'rights would not be so great, although he would have to redeem, because he could not prove «the truth against the false return.</p>
    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[271,1307,1171,980]]]'>No question now arises whether the legislature had power to enact that after two years a bad title should be good, or to legalize future sales upon false returns where, upon the real facts at the date of such returns, the lands were not subject to sale. But the real question is, whether the Act of 1867 is prospective as to assessments and returns. We see nothing in the general statute or the local which calls for departure from the ordinary meaning of the language of the local statute in order to give it a prospective intendment. The words u are assessed ” and “ are returned ” are consistent with the supposition of the law being always speaking, and if there were nothing else to consider would denote a continuing present. But the Act of 1867 must be construed with the Act of 1844. As already noted, this act does not require the collector to make the return upon oath, and consequently the prior act is not supplied as to future returns. Possibly some returns had been made upon oath; but if not, the second section would be quite as effective. The provisions relating to then existing returns and sales are clearly expressed. Only in the attempt to give the act prospective application does it-become defective and obscure. We are of opinion that it. does not operate to repeal the prior statute, except in those things which are plainly conflicting, and that the court below was right in all rulings resting upon the Act of 1844.</p>
