Both parties were dealers in oil. - On the following day, Johnston went to the bank defendant (where he kept a deposit), and handed in the check of Allen, but was told, there were no funds there to Allen’s credit. He accordingly left his check and his book there, so that he should receive credit for the amount of the check, as soon as funds came in to Allen’s credit: his testi<a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>mony (and lie was the only witness on hi? behalf) was that the teller or cashier promised that they would hold the check and pay it so soon as funds came in to Allen’s credit, not otherwise specifically appropriated.

And the plaintiff avers that after the delivery of said check to the bank, said Allen had unappropriated money in the bank to the amount of said check, and in violation of said agreement the said bank refused to charge the amount of said check to Allen and place the .same to the plaintiff’s credit.</p>

I had none during the year 1876 but In 1877 I had.’? Whether the offer that was actually made, was in chief or rebuttal, it was rightly rejected.</p>
    <p id="b617-7" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[148,858,1175,944]]]'>The plaintiff requested the court to instruct-the jury; “that if they find from the evidence that the plaintiff presented the check in suit on the 2d day of November, 1876, for payment, and that either the teller of cashier of the bank agreed to hold the check and pay it out of the first funds deposited by R. B. Allen, and not otherwise , specially, appropriated, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover under the evidence in this case.” Answer, “we affirm that point if yon believe the evidence of D. C. Johnston.” This is assigned for error. The plaintiff claimed upon a contract by which .the bank became his agent to secure payment out of funds of the drawee, if such should be deposited, and in default, itself to be liable for the amount. His claim is for neglect to secure an unaccepted check, payment of which had been refused for want of funds of the drawer, and the evidence of the alleged broken contract rested in the plaintiff’s memory alone. That the judge told the jury, that the. plaintiff could recover if they believed him, was no error of which he can complain. That he repeatedly told the jury that if they believed the testimony of the plaintiff he was entitled to the verdict for his claim, in such way as to induce them to carefully consider his credibility, did no wrong to him.</p>
