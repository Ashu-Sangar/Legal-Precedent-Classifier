The grantees were to hold in undivided one-eighth parts, B., O. and D. having each two-eighths, and E. and F. each one-eighth. Subsequently B., C. and D. conveyed each one-half his interest in said tract, in ail three-eighths, unto <em>G. </em>and ten others in equal proportions; the deed containing a clause whereby the undivided interests so granted were to be. subject as to control and management and as to time, place and manner of operating to the majority of the interest in said tract. Afterwards G. conveyed all his interest to one H. A majority of those interested in the tract subsequently leased the same to B. and C., the grantees, to sink a well of a fixed depth and to be entitled to one-half of all the oil produced. II. did not sign said lease nor did she assent thereto. Subsequently, the well being sunk and the amount of oil produced being very great, tanks were erected, and a certain proportion of the oil delivered to each of the parties interested. Subsequently H. filed a bill in equity against B. and C., alleging that she was not bound by the terms of the lease and was entitled to one-eleventh part of three-eighths part of three-fourths part of the oil, which amount she prayed defendants might account to her for. The defendants contended that she was bound by the lease and was not entitled to more than one-eleventh part of three-eighths part of one-fourth part of the oil. They further denied her right to an account.</p>

The enormous and unprecedented production of the well made such mode of delivery an impossibility, and it became necessary to adopt other arrangements. Meetings of the parties in interest were held and a plan adopted and carried into execution by which tanks for holding the oil were erected, at the common expense, and proper persons employed by the parties in interest who kept account of the oil and made deliveries of it on orders from those interested. This plan was adopted before the compromise or arrangement with Thompson and was assented to by him. All oil 'was drawn by orders on the book-keeper and the defendants had nothing to do with its delivery. They drew their oil like the rest. The books kept showed the amount of oil drawn by each owner and the share of the total amount drawn, each party was entitled to, but not the amount in tank. The books were always open for inspection and monthly statements were made, which any interested party could get on application.

He was of opinion, therefore, that the lease to Noble and Delemater was fully authorized by said last named instrument, and being concurred in by a majority of those in interest was binding on complainant, although she had not assented thereto.

He determines that the plaintiff is entitled to the one-eleventh of three-eighths of three-fourths of all the oil produced from the Noble well, and bases his decree for an account on that conclusion. But he does not inform us whether or not she had any substantial claim for such account, should his theory fail and she be entitled to but one-eleventh of three-eighths of one-fourth of the oil thus produced. Under such circumstances we might well infer that the dispute was limited to the pro<a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>duct over and above the amount last stated, and that, assuming this amount to be the true one, she, or what is the same thing, her husband for her, had received all to which she was entitled, hence had no right to call upon the defendants to account.</p>
    <p id="b247-6" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[150,621,1168,941]]]'>For although he mentions the fact that she claimed, that, under any circumstances, she had not received the full amount of oil due her, yet he does not so find, but rather the contrary. The facts, however, necessary for the definitive disposition of this case are found in the master’s supplemental report on the defendants’ additional exceptions. In those exceptions it is alleged, that after the production had become so great that a delivery at the well in barrels, as originally contemplated, became impossible, by arrangement of the parties interested, tanks were erected, and proper persons appointed to make delivery of the oil on the orders of the owners ; that Thompson for himself and wife assented to this arrangement, and, from time to time, drew their shares of the product of the well with the others; that all these orders were drawn on the bookkeeper, and that the defendants had nothing whatever to do with the delivery of the oil, since, by the arrangement above referred to, they were relieved from that responsibility. That the books were open to the inspection of all parties concerned ; tliat full monthly statements were made of the produce of the well, whiclr were received by, or known to, Thompson, and, finally that no dissatisfaction was expressed by the Thompsons until the year 1868.</p>
    <p id="b247-7" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[149,1564,1164,257]]]'>The master answers this statement of facts as follows:— “ We say that although these are undisputed facts, clearly established by the evidence, they have no bearing upon the question before us; the right of the plaintiff to compel an account on part of the defendants. They are immaterial and irrelevant, and cannot affect the rights of the plaintiff.”</p>
    <p id="b247-8" data-blocks='[["BL_247.6",247,[146,1820,1167,459]]]'>Thus whilst the master treats the facts, above stated, as undeniable, yet he thinks they come to nothing in the determination of this case. We think differently, for it is thus made certain that if the sublease to Noble and Delemater, on the 14th of April 1863, was binding upon Mrs. Thompson, she has nothing whatever upon which to found a claim for an account against the present defendants, and this for the reason that they have received nothing belonging to her, or if so, certainly not in the capacity of her bailiffs or receivers. The question then is, why was she not bound by the terms and conditions of the sublease ?</p>
    <p id="b247-9" data-blocks='[["BL_247.7",247,[149,2290,1162,129]],["BL_248.1",248,[295,426,1171,299]]]'>She has no other title than that found in the agreement of Noble and others to N. Wood and others. Wood’s assignment could give her nothing but what he afterwards got by that <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>agreement, for the previous parol arrangement had, in and of itself, no force whatever. But that conveyance reserved to the vendors the right to make just such a lease as they did make on the 14th of April 1863, by which Noble and Delemater were to receive one-half of any and all the oil they might find in the premises. It, therefore, signifies nothing that Mrs. Thompson did not assent to this sublease, for she had no power to dissent.</p>
    <p id="b248-6" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[289,724,1172,512]]]'>The Master falls into the error of supposing that under the Wood agreement she took an estate in fee in the realty. He says: “ On the 14th of April 1863, the defendants, Noble and Delemater, took a lease or sale to themselves forever of this property on which was located the Noble well. They were by the terms of the conveyance, to give the grantors a certain portion of the oil. From the time of the execution of this conveyance they were the ownei’s of the oil in fee while the signers of the sublease had only an interest in the personalty. As the plaintiff did not sign this sublease, her interest remained an interest in the realty, and its character could not be affected by anything done by the defendants.”</p>
    <p id="b248-7" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[282,1233,1173,1196]],["BL_249.1",249,[148,418,1174,388]]]'>We scarcely need say, that the merest glance at the papers will show that this conclusion is all wrong. The instrument referred to neither did nor could convey a fee to any part of the realty ; and this for the reason that Farrell’s agreement of the 28th of March, with Noble and his associates, vested nothing in them but the right to work the land for oil; by it they acquired no estate either in land or minerals. If they found oil they were to have three-fourths of that which they brought to .the surface, but as to any property to the oil in situ they had none: Funk <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 3 P. F. S. 229. In this incorporeal right to prospect for and take the oil found in the land the parties may have had a fee, if such a term applies at all to a mere license, which I very much doubt, the case cited to the contrary notwithstanding. But if a fee, it was sub conditione, and base in its character. But this right, by whatever name designated, was but accessory to the main design, the getting of oil to the surface, for until that was done the parties had no interest in any tangible thing. These parties were engaged in an adventure of business, whether as partners or tenants in common can make no difference, and the right acquired from Farrell was but one of the means or appliances used in carrying on that business. Now, what we have to do with is this business and the product produced by it which was clearly a chattel. The Master’s argument, therefore, based as it is, on a false premise, necessarily falls, and it follows, than when the original purchasers made their gift of three-eighths of their interest to their eleven friends, they had a right to impose upon that gift what conditions they pleased, and it was proper, reasonable and lawful for them to <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>retain to themselves the management and control of the business in which they proposed to embark. Under these circumstances it matters nothing whether the plaintiff did or did not consent to the sublease, for the power to make it remained in the parties who had the major and older interest, and they having made it in good faith it was binding on their donees. Whilst, therefore, we do not altogether agree with the learned judge in the reasoning on which he based his decree dismissing the bill, yet we do agree with him in the result thus reached.</p>
