    <p class="summary" id="b48-12" data-blocks='[["BL_48.14",48,[309,1533,1163,642]]]'>On the note were endorsed certain payments of interest. On the trial, before Junkin, P. J., it appeared that said interest was never paid in gold, but in National currency or legal tender notes, to an amount treated by the parties as equivalent in value to gold — gold being at a premium during the period in question. The defendant sought to set off in this suit the excess paid above 6 per cent, in legal tender currency. It further appeared that the note in suit was a renewal note, the original note in the transaction having been given in 1865, for $10,000, and there was some controversy both as to the true amount of the principal of the debt, and also whether the original note included interest for the year following its date. The weight of the evidence indicated that the principal debt in 1865 was either $9,000 or $8,970, and that one year’s interest at 10 per cent, was added thereto, and the note given for $10,000.</p>

[We are of opinion that although by the very terms of this note the defendant was to pay the interest in gold, or in <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>currency which would be equal to gold, still the effect is to give the plaintiff more than six per cent, per annum, and is thus in siibstance an agreement to pay more than statutory interest, which the statute declares shall not be enforced.] Had the defendant paid in gold as interest, although it might be worth ten or fifty per cent, premium, this would have been legal, and the premiums could not have been recouped against the principal debt, for the reason that gold coin, at whatever premium, is just what it purports to be, so much money, and is never worth more than one hundred cents to the dollar, and remains at that, while currency falls below one lumdred cents in the dollar. But [the National currency is made a legal tender, and one dollar of- this will pay as much debt as the gold dollar, and the creditor must accept it; and when he receives it in payment of interest, and takes more than six per cent., he has taken more than the law allows, no matter under what form it is received, nor what it is made equal to.] The statute declares, that contracts for the payment of more than six per cent, shall not be enforced ; and further, that if paid in fact, the debtor may insist upon applying the excess to the principal itself. No device by which more is, received can be tolerated: Rheem v. Bosler, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Smith%20%26%20H.%2054" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 Smith &amp; H. 54">22 Smith 54</a>. The spirit of the statute of 1858 is, that the borrower cannot be compelled to pay more than six per cent, for the loan or use of money; and were any device whatever sustained by which he may be coe.rced into paying money under another form or name than interest, the law will soon become a dead letter.</p>

We think not. That <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>was the precise alternative of the contract. It was to be paid in “ gold or its equivalent.” If the contract was not usurious, which is conceded, surely the fulfillment of the contract according to its terms cannot be usurious. There is no substantial difference between paying in gold, and paying the value of the gold in notes. Commercially the one is the exact equivalent of the other. That the payments upon some occasions were a little more or a little less than the rates of gold on the precise days makes no difference. There were times when the price of gold varied almost daily. Nothing was then more common than for parties paying and receiving gold to agree upon the rate, always of course approximating the market value. Where done in good faith, I never heard the taint of usury applied to such a transaction.</p>

The court evidently intended to enter a judgment for the smaller sum, but by some mistake a judgment appears to have been entered for each amount. We can best correct this by reversing the judgment below and entering the proper judgment here.</p>
