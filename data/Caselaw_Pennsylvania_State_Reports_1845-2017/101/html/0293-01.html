      <em>Answer. </em>This would be directing you to find a verdict for the defendant, simply because the plaintiffs failed to sustain one ground of action. We are compelled to refuse it as a whole, but that the defendant may have the benefit of it, we refuse it as to damage done by the grade but affirm it as to damage arising from the water. It is correct in so far as the damage alleged to have been done by water is <em>concerned.</em>

Although this Act of Assembly gives a full and specific remedy for such an injury, yet it does not appear to have been called to the attention of the court below, nor was it cited on the argument before us. Indeed, the learned judge assumed the legislature had not made any provision to carry into effect that clause of the Constitution, nor provided any specific mode for assessing the damages, therefore he sustained this action of trespass.</p>
