A mutual aid society, tho purpose of which, was by its charter stated to be the mutual protection and relief of its members, issued a certificate of membership to a certain party whereby it undertook to assure her life in a certain sum, and to pay said sum to her or any person designated by her will or her heirS if no other person.was designated by.the will on proof of her death. The certificate contained the following clause’: “ This certificate may be assigned and transferred only by and with (ho consent of the association endorsed thereon.” A few days after the issue of the certificate, A. endorsed and assigned the same to B., but without any approval by the company. A. having subsequently, died, B. presented proofs of death, and claimed the amount of the certificate. This claim being resisted by the Mutual Aid Society; and suit being brought thereon against them by <em>B., </em>— Held, that the clause prohibiting assignment without the written consent of the society was a valid one, and was an essential feature of the contract; that the association had the right to insist on the benefit of the protection it was intended to- afford,- and that therefore the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>

The clause referred to is: “ This certificate may be assigned and. transferred only by and with the consent of the-association endorsed thereon.” And the defendant says it has not been assigned; that there is no endorsement on the certificates; that the assignment goes for nothing; and that therefore the plaintiff cannot recover. As to that assignment, in matter of fact, there <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>is some little evidence of ratification. There have been given in evidence two receipts, dated April 12th 18S1, from the association to Isaac Lupoid, for assessments on these policies, for other deaths. Those persons had died, and Isaac Lupoid being the holder of these certificates, they assessed him just as they did the other members; which would seem to show that the association knew the fact, and recognized the fact, that Isaac Lupoid was the holder and owner and the beneficiary in these certificates. The receipts are: “Columbus, O., 12th April, 1881. Received of Isaac Lupoid assessments 48, 49, 50, and 51; credit 5,280.” Which is one of these certificates. The other, of the same date, credits one dollar to certificate 433, which is the other certificate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[288,985,1163,256]]]'>There is further, in the by-laws, a provision that may possibly have some bearing on this point. At the end of page 4, in the charter and by-laws, there is a provision that “ if the member dies within the period named in the certificate, the amount shall then be payable to his legal heirs, or any person designated in the certificate, or by his will.”</p>

The defendant argues that they are not assignable, because this is a mutual benefit association; but we know of no law, or rule of law, which renders them unassignable for that reason. If this provision had been that unless notice were given to the company, and endorsed on the certificate, that the certificate should be void, then this objection would be fatal; but there is no penalty annexed to the failure to notify the company and have the endorsement upon it; and therefore it is, we think, analogous to the provision that is contained in almost all certificates on shares, of stock in corporations: “This certificate assignable only upon the books of the company,” or something of that kind. That is contained on almost all of them. Notwithstanding that clause, the courts always have held that the title to the stock passed by assignment, even if the company was not notified, or the transfer was not made-upon the books of the company. There are certain legal consequences that may depend upon whether that has been done or not; but so far as the title to the shares go, represented by the certificate, the title passes without being transferred upon the books of the company. It is called by lawyers “an equitable interest,” and the title passes, which in this state is just as good ownership or title, as between the parties, as the legal title. We therefore instruct you on this point that these certificates were transferable — assignable—and notwithstanding the fact that the association was not notified. <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>if they were not, and notwithstanding the fact that no endorsement of consent was entered upon the certificates, nevertheless the transfer was valid between the parties, and this failure to notify and endorse does not stand in the way of maintaining this action. .

We refused to allow this death proof to go in evidence generally to the jury," on the part of the plaintiff, their purpose being simply to show that he was in a position to sue, by having performed the preliminary duty of notifying of the death. It was open, however, for the defendant, if he chose, to give these death proofs in evidence; and he did offer them in evidence; and over the objection of the plaintiff, they were admitted in evidence; and therefore -what they state must be taken as evidence of the declarations of the plaintiff— as evidence against him where it makes against him; and evidence for him, if it makes for him — being offered by the other side.</p>

Snyder’s life, as it is called in law, at the time that the assignment was made to him, that therefore he had no right to take the policy; that it-is against the law, and against the policy of the law ; and that therefore he could acquire no interest in the policy. No evidence was given on the part of the plaintiff that Lupoid had any such interest; neither was any evidence given on the part of the defendant that he had not, unless such evidence be found in this claim of loss.</p>

It is a denial on the part of the plaintiff, and is given in evidence by the defendant, that he took this assignment for speculative purposes; and even, apart from that, in the absence of any evidence on the other side — in the absence of any evidence on thS part of the defendant that he had no interest, and that he did take this as a speculative or wager policy — we instruct yon that the presumption must be that the transaction was legal.

The personal character of each holder of a certificate, and the interest he has in the life of the person thereby insured, are essential elements in the contract of mutual indemnity. The obvious tendency of an unrestricted right of transfer would be to create interests directly hostile to those of the regular membership. It is therefore clear that the condition is an essential feature of the contract, and the association has a right to insist on the benefit of the protection it was intended to afford.</p>

Snyder, were issued to her in November 1880, and four months thereafter she died testate, devising and bequeathing all her property, real, personal, and mixed, to her friend Sarah Rassler. The undertaking of the association, as expressed in the certificates, was to assure the life of Miss Snyder in a specified sum, and to pay the same, in accordance with its rules and regulations, to “ herself or any person designated by her will,” coupled with the express condition that the certificates, and of course any rights accruing thereunder, should not be assigned or transferred without the written consent. of the association. The plaintiff below, claiming the certificates by virtue of an assignment dated a few days after they were issued, furnished proofs of death, etc., and,.upon the refusal of the association to recognize his claim, brought suit in his own name. The question raised by the second point of the defendant below was whether, in view of the condition above recited, the action could be maintained. It is not pretended that written consent to the assignment was ever given, but it was contended there was evidence tending to show that the association had waived literal compliance with the condition, and recognized the plaintiff below as the owner of the certificates by receiving from him assessments after the death of Miss Snyder. Receipts for payment of assessments were produced, and upon that testimony the learned judge submitted the question to the jury. In this we think there was error. The assessments due the association might be paid by any one, and the fact that they were received <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>from a volunteer or any one else did not affect the contract. In short, there was nothing before the jury to-warrant them in finding that the condition in question had been waived or that the plaintiff below had been recognized as assignee of the certificates, and they should have been so instructed. It is claimed, however, that the suit was rightly brought under the Act of March 14th 1873, Purd. 1799, pl. 28, authorizing assignees of life, fire and marine insurance companies to sue in their own name. This would undoubtedly be so ,if the association had assented to the transfer; but when it is made an express condition of the contract itself that the certificates shall not be otherwise assigned or transferred, the act referred to does not apply.</p>
