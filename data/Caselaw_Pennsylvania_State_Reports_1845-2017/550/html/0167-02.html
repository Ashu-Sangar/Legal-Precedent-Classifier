On May 5, 1995, the OHA hearing examiner once again recommended that Morton’s appeal be denied. In making this recommendation, the OHA hearing examiner treated Northampton and Praxis as separate subsidiaries of Morton (the parent corporation) and applied DPW regulations (which are known as the Medical Assistance Manual in the Pennsylvania Code) that a subsidiary’s interest expense should be offset by a <em>pro rata </em>share of the parent corporation’s interest income. After applying the offset, the OHA hearing examiner concluded that there was no interest on capital indebtedness which could be subject to reimbursement. On June 7, 1995, OHA adopted the OHA hearing examiner’s recommendation in its entirety. On June 27,1995, the Secretary of DPW granted Morton’s request for reconsideration of the June 7,1995 order.

On the merits, the Commonwealth Court concluded that Morton was the sole legal entity and that Northampton and Praxis were nothing more than fictitious names used by Morton to render different services. Thus, the Commonwealth Court concluded that Morton’s interest on capital indebtedness should have been an allowable expense subject to reimbursement. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court ordered DPW to reimburse Morton for interest on capital indebtedness in the amount of $93,093 for the fiscal period ending June 30, 1988 and $36,193 for the fiscal period ending December 7,1988. In addition, the Commonwealth Court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered DPW to pay interest at the rate of 6% per annum starting on the last day of each respective fiscal period. This Court granted DPWs petition for allowance of appeal in order to determine if the Commonwealth Court erred in ordering DPW to pay Morton interest at the rate of 6% per annum for failing to reimburse for allowable costs of nursing home services.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Because the Medical Assistance Program appeal process is separate and distinct from the federal appeal process, this Court found that the state Medical Assistance Manual, which does not provide for interest on underpayments of reimbursement, controlled what remedies were available on appeal. In applying the state Medical Assistance Manual, this Court found that interest payments on additional monies paid to a Medical Assistance Program provider as a result of a successful legal appeal were not necessary and reasonable costs to the proper care of Medical Assistance Program patients and therefore, such interest payments were not allowable costs subject to reimbursement.
