Jordan had previously sustained a work-related injury to his back in 1986 which required surgery in 1987.</p>

Several hearings were held where both parties introduced expert medical testimony. Consolidated presented the testimony of three medical experts. Thomas B. Benz, M.D., testified that Jordan complained of testicular pain, but that this pain was unrelated to his work-related back injury. Brian Emstoff, M.D., testified that he examined Jordan on four occasions and found no objective evidence of ongoing impairments. He further stated that Jordan was able to return to work without any restrictions. Physical therapist Leanne Darling testified that although Jordan complained of mild back discomfort during his work hardening program, the pain did not interfere with his ability to perform tasks.</p>

The court noted that a finding that Jordan could return to work without restrictions was not synonymous with a finding that his disability had ceased. Because Jordan’s time-of-injury position was no longer available, the court found that a suspension of benefits was not appropriate. The court therefore reversed the termination order and remanded the case solely for the determination of costs.</p>

In the absence of objective medical testimony, the WCJ is neither required to accept the claimant’s assertions, nor prohibited from doing so. Testimony by the employer’s medical expert as to the existence of the claimant’s <em>complaints </em>of pain does not require the WCJ to find for the claimant. A contrary conclusion would lead to the absurd result that a claimant could forever preclude the termination of benefits by merely complaining of continuing pain. What is relevant in deciding whether the termination of benefits is warranted is whether the claimant suffers from pain as a result of the work-related injury.</blockquote>

    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[240,702,1163,574]]]'>In <em>Udvari, </em>this court was faced with the situation where the employer’s medical expert merely recognized that the claimant complained of pain. This court determined that in that instance, an employer satisfies its burden of proof in a termination proceeding if the expert unequivocally testifies that it is his opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the claimant is fully recovered, can return to work without restrictions and that there are no objective medical findings which either substantiate the claims of pain or connect them to the work injury. <em>Udvari, </em><a href="/pa/550/0319-02" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="550 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="281296" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0319-02">550 Pa. at 322</a>, 705 A.2d at 1291.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[237,1324,1165,742]]]'>The majority was careful to distinguish the situation in <em>Udvari </em>from those cases in which an employer’s expert acknowledges, attests to or supports the existence of a claimant’s ongoing or continuous pain. The majority in <em>Udvari </em>recognized that when an employer’s medical expert acknowledges that the claimant suffers from pain, then it is incumbent upon the expert to opine that the pain was not work related for the employer to be successful in its attempt to terminate benefits. Thus, if pain exists, and no proof establishes that it is unrelated to the work injury, the employer fails to meet its burden. This standard derives from, and is required by, the employer’s burden to prove that all work-related disability has ceased. <em>Pieper v.

The failure or inability of Consolidated’s expert to testify that Mr. Jordan’s pain was not work-related, coupled with a finding that Mr. Jordan could return to work without restriction, merely changed the focus of the matter from the propriety of a termination of benefits to the propriety of a suspension of benefits. Because Mr. Jordan’s time-of-injury position was no longer available, the Commonwealth Court correctly found that a suspension of benefits was not appropriate, thus, the court reversed the termination order and remanded solely for determining costs.</p>
