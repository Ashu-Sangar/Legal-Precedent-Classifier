In the academic years 1992-93 and 1991-92, at least 23% of W &amp; J’s operating budget was paid from endowment funds. By using these funds to finance educational programs rather than raising tuition prices to reflect true operating costs, W &amp; J effectively subsidizes each and every student for a portion of the cost of his or her education. Further, W &amp; J incurred operating losses in 1993-94, 1992-93, and 1991-92, respectively, in the amounts of $1,071,959 (projected), $470,631, and $939,848.

This element is plainly met inasmuch as W &amp; J, like other independent colleges and universities, relieves the load placed on the state-owned system of colleges and universities. So large is the role of private colleges and universities that they account for nearly 40% of Pennsylvania’s undergraduate enrollment. Inasmuch as the Commonwealth has taken on the responsibility of providing higher education for its residents, it is clear that were it not for the existence of independent colleges and universities the demands placed on the state’s institutions would be vastly expanded. The legislature has expressly recognized the role of private institutions in this regard by providing them with institutional assistance grants that cover a small percentage of their costs. State assistance received by W &amp; J, for example, averages $391 per student on an annual basis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The legislature has declared that independent colleges and universities “make a significant contribution to higher education in the Commonwealth,” 24 P.S. § 5182(a), and that if such institutions were inhibited in their ability to provide such education it would <em>“increase the burden on public institutions,” </em>24 P.S. § 5182(b) (emphasis added).</p>

The college traces its roots to the eighteenth century when ministers of the Presbyterian Church, who sought not personal profit but rather a means of providing education for youths, created two colleges that were later combined to form W &amp; J. W &amp; J has long been incorporated as a non-profit corporation. Its trustees serve without receiving any salary for their services. No dividends or profits are distributed to any individuals. If W &amp; J were to generate an operating surplus, the surplus would be reinvested in the college. See <em>West Allegheny Hospital v.
