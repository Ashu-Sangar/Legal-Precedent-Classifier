Implicit in each is that a public utility provides essential services to the public at large, responding to any reasonable request for service without discrimination, and that it conducts its business under the watchful eye of government, which ensures that its rates will be reasonable and its provision of service responsible. No such requirements are made of non-regulated business activity.</p>

With respect to Article III, Section 10, which allows uses not specifically permitted or denied which are not incompatible with the general scheme of the ordinance, Crown’s application was also properly denied, for Section 10 must be understood to operate within the specific requirements of Article IX, Section 29(c).
