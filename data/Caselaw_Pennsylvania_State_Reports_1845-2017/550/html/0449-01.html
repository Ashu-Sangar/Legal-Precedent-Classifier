Following extensive hearings, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) required major modifications to the plan, which Bell accepted. Parties opposed to Bell’s petition and plan appealed, and the Commonwealth Court, <a href="/a2d/669/1029-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="669 A.2d 1029" data-case-ids="11338526" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/1029-01">669 A.2d 1029</a>, vacated in part, reversed in part, and affirmed in part.

    <p id="b718-4" data-blocks='[["BL_718.4",718,[247,1036,1164,1094]]]'>In July 1993, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted chapter 30 of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. §§ 3001-3009, titled “Alternative form of regulation of telecommunications services.” Its purpose was to encourage the accelerated deployment of a state-of-the-art broadband<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> communications network which would be affordable and universally available. To induce local phone companies to commit to the considerable investment necessary to achieve such extensive modernization in the telecommunications infrastructure, the law permits the PUC to approve an alternative form of regulation other than the traditional rate base-rate of return regulation. A company may apply for an alternative form of regulation by filing a proposed network modernization implementation plan, wherein the company must commit to converting 100% of its interoffice and distribution network to broadband capability by the end of the year 2015. An implementation plan must also guarantee a reasonable deployment between rural, urban, and suburban areas, and must provide for deployment along public rights-of-way abutting public schools, industrial parks, and health care facilities. 66 Pa.C.S. § 3003(b).</p>

      <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>Among the criteria which must be met by a petition for alternative regulation is an assurance that rates for noncompetitive services will be just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory. The statute allows this criterion to be accomplished through the use of a “price stability mechanism.” The law states that, subject to PUC approval, a price stability mechanism which allows total annual revenues from noncompetitive services to increase or decrease from the previous year’s totals by the rate of inflation minus 2.25% “may meet the requirements of this section.” 66 Pa.C.S. § 3004(d)(2).</p>
    <p id="b719-4" data-blocks='[["BL_719.4",719,[202,883,1156,582]]]'>The statute also allows local telephone companies, in conjunction with a petition for an alternative regulatory framework, to seek a PUC determination that any of its services is a “competitive service.” Rates, tolls, charges, rate structures, rate base, rate of return, and earnings of competitive services may be completely deregulated. 66 Pa.C.S. § 3009(f). Notwithstanding deregulation, however, the PUC must establish regulations to prevent unfair competition and to require local telephone companies to offer their competitors reasonable nondiscriminatory access to all services and facilities necessary to provide competing service. 66 Pa.C.S. § 3005(b).</p>
    <p id="b719-5" data-blocks='[["BL_719.5",719,[205,1492,1153,258]]]'>In October 1993, Bell filed a petition for an alternative regulatory framework, accompanied by a network modernization implementation plan and a proposal that certain services be deemed competitive. Three administrative law judges held evidentiary hearings and public input hearings.</p>
    <p id="b719-6" data-blocks='[["BL_719.6",719,[202,1777,1155,475]]]'>The ALJs recommended that Bell’s petition and plan be denied. They concluded that the price stability mechanism did not ensure that rates for noncompetitive services were just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory; the modernization plan was not sufficiently detailed and did not adequately balance deployment between rural, urban, and suburban areas; and the services sought to be deregulated did not meet the definition of competitive services and the proposal did not provide adequate competitive safeguards.</p>

First, in relation to Bell’s proposal of a price stability mechanism of inflation minus 2.25%, the PUC set the formula at inflation minus 2.93% for ten years. Second, the PUC froze rates on protected services until the end of 1999, rather than the end of 1996 as proposed by Bell. Third, the PUC required the modernization plan to be modified to speed up deployment in suburban and rural areas. Finally, the PUC held that the six services proposed by Bell for deregulation were competitive. As to the competitive services, the PUC initiated proceedings to establish rules guaranteeing the competitive safeguards required by 66 Pa.C.S. § 3005(b). Pursuant to its options in 66 Pa.C.S. § 3004(b), Bell advised the PUC within thirty days that it would accept the modifications.</p>

The Commonwealth Court vacated the part of the PUC’s order which had set the inflation offset figure at 2.93%. The court remanded, ordering the PUC to calculate and include an “input price differential.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> With regard to the PUC’s classification of six services as competitive, the court held that the PUC failed to make required findings before deciding that the services were competitive and erred in determining that the services were competitive without first finding that the statutory competitive safeguards had been met. The court therefore reversed the PUC as to four of the services, concluding that the competitive safeguards were inadequate. As to the other two services, the court vacated and remanded for further proceedings to determine the adequacy of the competitive safeguards. In all other respects, the Commonwealth Court affirmed.</p>

While the PUC found merit to the theory of using an input price differential factor and incorporating such an estimate in the overall inflation offset value of a price stability mechanism formula, the PUC effectively assigned a value of zero to this factor under the record evidence in this case.</p>

R. at 1282a-83a. The Commonwealth Court disagreed and vacated or reversed the PUC’s designation of six services as competitive prior to determining the adequacy of competitive safeguards. The court’s reasoning focused on certain purposes of the statute set forth in 66 Pa.C.S. § 3001, viz., to ensure that customers pay only reasonable charges for local services and to ensure that rates for noncompetitive services do not subsidize competitive services. <em>Popowsky v.

It quoted the requirement in 66 Pa.C.S. § 3004(d)(4) that the PUC must ensure that the granting of a petition for alternative form of regulation will not “unduly or unreasonably prejudice or disadvantage a customer class or providers of competitive services.” These purposes and requirements would be contravened if the competitive safeguards were not in place prior to the designation of services as being competitive; a local telecommunications company could engage in unfair competition prior to establishment of competitive safeguards. The court agreed with the PUC that such unfair competition might be remedied in subsequent proceedings, but did not agree that such a remedy was sufficient because, in the court’s view, a local telecommunications company could gain an unfair advantage over its competitors by engaging in unfair competition prior to the establishment of competitive safeguards. <em><a href="/a2d/669/1029-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="669 A.2d 1029" data-case-ids="11338526" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/1029-01">Id.</a></em>

The PUC applied sections 3005(a), (e), and (g) in classifying the six services as competitive. It reasoned that if competitive safeguards were to be a prerequisite to competitive classification, then section 3005(a) would have included the necessary language among the factors to be considered before a service could be classified as competitive. The legislature, however, did not explicitly require preexisting competitive safeguards. Instead, the legislature included specific lan<a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>guage requiring competitive safeguards in subsections (e) and (g) of the statute but excluded the concept from subsection (a) which sets forth the factors to be considered before the PUC classifies a service as competitive. Yet when “the legislature includes specific language in one section of a statute and excludes it from another, it should not be implied where excluded.” <em>Cherry v.

The PUC’s interpretation of the statute also advances one of the most important ends of the statute, that is, <em>accelerated </em>deployment of a state-of-the-art telecommunications network. Many sections of the statute reveal the legislature’s concern for expeditious implementation of modernized telecommunications technology. The PUC’s procedure of classifying services prior to establishing competitive safeguards eliminated years of delay, which clearly furthered the legislature’s policy of accelerated implementation of a network. We agree, therefore, that the establishment of competitive safeguards under 66 Pa.C.S. § 3005(e) and (g) is not a prerequisite to classification of a service as competitive under 66 Pa.C.S. § 3005(a).</p>

When the record <em>as a whole </em>contains substantial evidence which supports the commission’s decision, the Commonwealth Court should affirm. <em>See Peak v.
