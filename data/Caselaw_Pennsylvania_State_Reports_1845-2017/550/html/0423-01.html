The statute was amended in 1994 to clarify the language "shall become ineffective for all purposes,” by substituting "and shall be construed as if such former spouse had predeceased him unless it appears from the wording of the designation, a court order or a written contract between the person and such former spouse” for "unless it appears from the wording of the designation or from either a court order or a written contract between the person and his spouse.”</p>
      <blockquote id="AWiz" data-blocks='[["BL_691.10",691,[254,2019,1085,312]]]'>This amendment ... is made to provide further guidance to insurance companies so as to ensure that when a divorce has rendered a life insurance beneficiary designation ineffective for all purposes, an insurance company treats the former spouse as having predeceased the spouse making the designation for purposes of making payment to any secondary beneficiary under the policy. This amendment is made only to reinforce the result intended by the language “ineffective for all purposes” within the context of this section.</blockquote>
