    <p id="b315-7" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[193,752,1156,584]]]'>Viewed with these standards in mind, the evidence clearly was sufficient to support Collins’ convictions for first degree murder. The events in this case revolve around a second floor apartment at 643 North 60th Street in West Philadelphia, where drugs were regularly sold and consumed. Marc Sisco maintained the apartment and managed the drug trade that occurred on the premises. Marc’s brother, David Sisco, also lived in the apartment. Collins was a regular visitor to the apartment and often sold cocaine from that location. Collins’ associates, Shawn Wilson and Dawn Anderson, also frequented the apartment.</p>
    <p id="b315-8" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[194,1378,1153,691]]]'>Early in the morning of March 28, 1992, Collins and Marc Sisco were in the apartment and began arguing. Collins pointed a gun at Marc Sisco and shot him five times. When police arrived at the apartment, they found Marc Sisco lying on the bathroom floor. Medical personnel transported him to a hospital where he recovered from his wounds. Police recovered one bullet from the bathroom floor in the apartment and two bullets from Marc Sisco’s body at the hospital. Two bullets remain inside him. After the shooting, David Sisco assisted the police in their investigation. He discussed the incident with a detective at the police station and accompanied the detective to the apartment, where he described how the shooting occurred.</p>
    <p id="b315-9" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[194,2111,1156,256]]]'>A few days after the shooting, Collins was at the nearby residence of Annie “Mom” Holloman talking to a group of people when he threatened to shoot anyone who spoke to the police about the incident. He specifically mentioned David Sisco as a potential target.</p>

Tyler denied the accusation and informed Collins that Dawn Anderson had stolen the drug money. Anderson had recently been spending large amounts of money, which was unusual. Despite Tyler’s professed innocence, Collins fired a gun at her. The bullet tore a hole in her coat but did not strike her body.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[259,759,1162,519]]]'>At approximately 8:00 p.m. on April 5, 1992, Anderson was at Holloman’s house with Holloman and Tyler. She told Holloman that she was going to work “around the corner”, which Tyler understood to mean that Anderson was going to assist with drug sales at Marc Sisco’s apartment. Before Anderson left, she told Holloman that she would bring some drugs back “if they don’t loll me.” She also told Holloman that “they shot her in the elbow one time and they said they were going to shoot her in the head.” Holloman understood Anderson’s reference to “they” to mean Collins and Wilson.</p>

After talking and drinking beer for a short time in the apartment, Oliver, Collins and Wilson decided to go to a hotel. Oliver left the apartment to make a call from a telephone booth before going to the hotel. While at the phone booth, Oliver heard approximately five gun shots come from the apartment. Collins then ran out of the apartment, called to Oliver, and haüed a cab. Wilson exited the apartment a few moments later and joined Collins and Oliver in the cab.</p>

Wilson responded that Collins had given them what they deserved, and the two men exchanged a “high-five”. Collins then asked Wilson if he had seen “the blood squirting out” and showed blood stains on his shirt sleeve to Wilson. The trio stopped at a delicatessen to purchase beer and then went to the house of a man named Lonnie Boo. When they arrived at Lonnie Boo’s house, Collins told Lonnie Boo that “we just had some drama”. Collins then <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>gave his gun to Lonnie Boo for safekeeping.

He had been shot approximately seven times and died at a hospital a few hours later. In another room, police found Dawn Anderson unconscious and covered with blood on a bed. She had been shot once in the head and died the following day. Police recovered two bullets from David Sisco’s body, one bullet from Anderson’s head and several bullets from the apartment.</p>

The other bullet recovered from Marc Sisco’s body may have come from the same gun, but positive identification was not possible because the bullet became deformed after it was fired.</p>

In each case, the victim’s intent to meet the defendant was relevant to the case because it permitted the jury to conclude that the defendant had the opportunity to commit the crime in question. Additionally, the victim’s intent to confront the defendant about a financial matter in <em>Lowenberg </em>and the victim’s intent to disclose her affair in <em>Marshall </em>were relevant to supply the jury with a potential motive for the killing in those cases.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[258,1583,1162,566]]]'>In the present case, Anderson expressed an intent to meet with Collins shortly before her death and was concerned that Collins would harm her if she hindered his drug trade. These out-of-court statements appear to have been made in a natural manner during casual conversation. Further, the statements permitted the jury to conclude that Anderson met with Collins, giving him the opportunity to kill her. <em>Lowenberg; Riggins; Marshall. </em>They also supplied the jury with a motive for Collins to kill Anderson. <em>Lowenberg; Marshall. </em>Thus, the trial court properly admitted the statements under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
