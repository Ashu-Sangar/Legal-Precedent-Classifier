    <p id="b861-9" data-blocks='[["BL_861.9",861,[154,1224,1157,638]]]'>In September of 1987, the two parents separated and Charles M. was awarded custody of the two children. In 1988, April D. and Charles M. were divorced. Two years later, on May 5, 1990, Charles M. married Jean M. The two children have lived continuously with their father since the separation. On August 28, 1990, Charles M. moved with the two children and his wife from Pittsburgh to Erie, Pennsylvania because Jean M. is from Erie. They subsequently built a new house with “a combination of [Jean M.] and [his] money.” Notes of testimony (N.T.), May 31, 1995 at 31. Subsequently, April D. moved to Maryland and then to Rhode Island. April D. has not seen the children since they moved to Erie.</p>

She then retained an attorney who wrote a letter to Charles M.’s attorney on March 3, 1995, requesting summer visitation with the children. On March 31, 1995, Charles M. filed a petition to terminate April D.’s parental rights pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511. A hearing <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>was held in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Orphans’ Court) on May 31,1995.</p>

N.T. at 40-41.</p>

He testified that he raised his voice and became emotional when April D. telephoned. Additionally, he stated that he hung up on April D. several times and that she spoke to Ashley twice and Charles II once. Jean M., his wife, confirmed his testimony concerning the number of phone calls and that she too would hang up on April D. Both Jean and Charles M. testified that April D. had not visited the children since August 28, 1990.</p>

She testified that after the children moved to Erie with Charles and Jean M., she called at least every three to four months, and each time Charles M. would be “irate” and “accusatory.” N.T. at 96-97. April D. also stated that she never received a response to any of her phone calls to Charles M.’s attorney. When asked why she never went to Erie to see the children, April D. testified that in 1993, Charles M. threatened to call the police if she ever came to Erie. N.T at 99. She explained as follows: “My husband has set me up on many occasions to be arrested, bringing criminal charges, everything under the sun. I was not coming to Erie to be arrested and land in jail and be stuck up here in his world ...” N.T. at 100.</p>
