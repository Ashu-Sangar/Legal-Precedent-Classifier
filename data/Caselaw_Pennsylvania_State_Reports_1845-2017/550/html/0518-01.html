Bernice Ervin, the DHS social worker assigned to investigate the allegations, contacted Belinda Wilson and arranged to meet with her and Natalie at their home on March 26, 1993. Ervin examined Natalie and her sister, Nicole, in the presence of their mother. She observed marks of physical abuse on the children’s bodies. Ervin requested that the children be taken to the hospital for a physical examination. The next day the children were examined at the hospital by Dr. Sarah Badran, a pediatric resident. Dr. Badran observed numerous loop-shaped scars on their bodies.</p>

Officer Valerie Thorn was present during the interviews, but did not question the girls. In the course of the interviews, Officer Ulloa would leave the room so that Officer Thorn could examine the children’s scars. One week later, Belinda Wilson was arrested.</p>

The second witness denied having told an assistant district attorney and a detective that he had seen the defendant during the earlier shooting incident. The Commonwealth then cross-examined the witness as to his inconsistent statements contained in a memorandum prepared by the detective following an interview with the witness.

The grandson told the trooper that the allegations were true and that the defendant had told him to stand guard so that they would not be discovered. The grandson stated also that the defendant had performed oral sex on him on two different occasions when he was younger.

This limitation, however, relates to the credibility and weight to be afforded to the statements, not their admissibility. For a statement to be admissible, it must be an accurate, reliable reflection of the declarant’s words. <em>Brady </em>(requiring sufficient indicia of reliability). Although I concur that these audio and video recordings will prove to be trustworthy, I respectfully disagree that they are the only means of ensuring accuracy in recorded statements.

One of the functions of the fact finder is to assess the reliability of the evidence before it. Where a witness has made a prior inconsistent statement that was accurately recorded, the fact finder should be permitted to hear that statement to assist in its duty of determining the facts of the case. This evaluation necessarily includes credibility assessments. Credibility determinations become especially critical in child abuse cases where a child initially makes allegations of abuse, but then denies them at trial. Admitting prior inconsistent statements provides a mechanism for the fact finder to judge the veracity of the child’s testimony in court by comparing it to the prior statement. The child is required to explain the inconsistencies and explain why they made the allegations of abuse, but are now recanting them. The child also has the opportunity to deny ever asserting the allegations.</p>

However, as time passes and the wounds heal, memories fade. Additionally, the abuser is often an authority figure to the child who may convince the child to recant his story. That person may also persuade the child that if he or she has mistreated the child in the past, it will never happen again. On the other hand, there may be threats of more severe abuse if the child again tells the truth. However, without the opportunity to present the prior statements, to hear the witness’s explanation for the inconsistencies, and to observe the witness’s demeanor during these explanations, the fact finder will have less evidence before it to make an accurate assessment of the facts of the case.</p>

However, when they were called to testify at trial, and were required to face their mother with these allegations, both recanted their stories. Thus, after unsuccessfully attempting to refresh their recollections with the prior statements to the police, the Commonwealth introduced Officer Ulloa’s verbatim, handwritten transcription of the interview as substantive evidence. Since both girls testified in court at the trial, they were subject to cross-examination to explain the inconsistencies in their stories and the trial court was able to observe their demeanor. Furthermore, both Officer Ulloa, the transcribing officer, and Officer Valerie Thorn, who was also present during the interviews, <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>testified at trial. Defense counsel was able to question them concerning the accuracy, or lack of accuracy, of the transcription. The trial court also redacted those portions of the statements that were not verbatim but reflected the officer’s summarization of the girls’ comments. These factors combine to provide sufficient assurance that the statements are an accurate reflection of the declarations made by the girls to the officers.

Dr. Badran testified that when she spoke to Appellant, she told the doctor that she had problems with her children in the past and had abused them by hitting them with ropes. However, she claimed that this was all behind them now. When Dr. Badran examined the girls, they each had loop-shaped marks on their bodies which appeared to be several months old. When asked <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>how they got the marks, Dr. Badran testified that each girl told her that Appellant had caused them.

As part of this investigation, it was important for Dr. Badran to discover how they received the marks on their bodies. Both the girls and their mother were forthcoming that Appellant had hit them in the past. The girls claimed, however, that the new marks were inflicted on each other with jump ropes during a fight. Because these comments were made during the course of and in furtherance of medical diagnosis, they qualified as admissible hearsay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Thus, defense counsel was not ineffec<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>tive for failing to object to this testimony.

Although Nicole refused to talk to Ms. Stewart, Natalie told her that the last time her mother had beat her was in November of 1992, approximately four months <em>before the </em>interview. The trial court found, and the Superior Court agreed, that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay. Because it does not fall within any hearsay exception, I am constrained to agree that it was inadmissible hearsay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Thus, Appellant has met the threshold requirement for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by demonstrating a claim of arguable merit.</p>

In addition, there was physical evidence that some of the marks observed on the girls were several months old or older. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for trial counsel not to object to the hearsay testimony because there was explanatory or counterbalancing evidence that would negate any prejudice to Appellant’s position. I would hold that Ms. Stewart’s testimony alone did not prejudice Appellant’s claim of innocence, hence, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to its admission.</p>

Because I do not find that the dangers related to admitting out-of-court declarations are present when the witness is available to testify at trial, and the accuracy and reliability of the statements can be tested in court by questioning both the declarant and the transcriber, I would admit prior inconsistent statements that are written, contemporaneous and verbatim.</p>
