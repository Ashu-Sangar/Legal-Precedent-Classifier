The WCJ, however, denied appellant’s penalty petition because he found that Employer made a good faith challenge in seeking to suspend appellant’s benefits since the General Assembly was less than clear on how the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act was to be applied to a situation like that faced by appellant.</p>

In doing so, the Board noted that it viewed the purpose of the language of the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act as clarifying the intent of the Act as it existed before the passage of Section 306(a)(2) as to an individual’s inability to receive compensation benefits while incarcerated. The Board also interpreted the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act as affecting only those claimants who commenced a jail sentence on or after September 1, 1993 regardless of whether the injuries occurred prior to the effective date of the 1993 amendments (August 31, 1993). Thus, since appellant was imprisoned on September 1, 1993, the Board concluded that appellant’s workers’ compensation benefits should be suspended pursuant to the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act. The Board also affirmed the WCJ’s conclusion that appellant’s penalty petition should be denied.</p>

The Commonwealth Court, in a two-to-one decision, affirmed the Board’s order suspending appellant’s benefits and denying appellant’s penalty petition. In arriving at this decision, the Commonwealth Court majority reasoned that the date crucial to determining the applicability of the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act for payment of benefits to incarcerated claimants was the date a person began serving his prison sentence rather than the date when he began receiving benefits. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court held that the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act applied to any claimant who was incarcerated on or after August 31, 1993. The dissenting member of the Commonwealth Court panel disagreed with the majority because he believed that the date of incarceration was irrelevant. Instead, since the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act expressly applied only to injuries which occurred on or after August 31, 1993, the dissent believed the date when the work-related injury occurred was the dispositive fact. Since appellant’s injuries occurred before the effective date of the amend<a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>ment, the dissent reasoned that the majority was impermissibly applying the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act retroactively to appellant.</p>

To hold otherwise would result in courts promoting form over substance.</p>

      <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>Here, Employer was not seeking to suspend appellant’s benefits because of a change in his medical condition. Rather, Employer sought to suspend appellant’s benefits because his incarceration, rather than any change in his work-related injury, was the cause of appellant’s loss of earning power. As noted above, disability under the Act has long been synonymous with a loss of earning power. Thus, the Act never would have mandated Employer to prove the first prong of <em>KachinsM </em>requiring the production of medical evidence showing a change in condition. Also, Employer was not required to present evidence of available jobs being referred to appellant while he was in prison. Similar to voluntary retirement cases, to require Employer to show available work would be an exercise in futility since appellant’s incarceration would have prevented appellant from ever applying for any of the referred positions. Thus, Employer, under the Act as it existed prior to the amendment to Section 306(a)(2), would have been relieved from the second prong of <em>Kachinski </em>requiring it to make a showing that jobs were available within appellant’s medical clearance and that these jobs were referred to appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

It is also clear that the <em>Kachinski </em>test does not apply when an employer seeks to suspend benefits because of incarceration since the employer is not required to demonstrate that the claimant has recovered some ability or that available jobs were referred to the claimant. To interpret the Act in any other way would result in a incarcerated felon receiving a windfall since they would be receiving compensation for a loss of earning power not caused by his work-related injury. Thus, appellant’s attempt to characterize this case as a misapplication of the amendment to Section 806(a)(2) of the Act is mistaken since the Act was never intended to provide benefits to a claimant who is incarcerated. Instead, we view the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act in a manner similar to the Board’s view: as nothing more than a clarification that a claimant cannot receive benefits while he was incarcerated and we need not reach the retroactivity issue raised by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[257,1412,1162,481]]]'>Applying the above to this case, appellant was incarcerated on September 1, 1993. Thus, the Act, even as it existed prior to the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) of the Act, mandated that appellant’s benefits be suspended during his incarceration since it was appellant’s own conduct, rather than his work-related injury, which caused his loss of earning power.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Accordingly, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s suspension of appellant’s benefits for the time appellant was incarcerated because of his 1993 federal conviction.</p>

We note that case law on the effect incarceration had on the suspension or receipt of benefits before the amendment to Section 306(a)(2) lay solely within the Commonwealth Court. In those cases, the employer presented evidence that available jobs were referred to the claimant, thereby, relieving the Commonwealth Court from examining the issue of whether incarceration alone was sufficient to terminate or suspend benefits under the terms of the Workers’ Compensation Act. <em>See Brown v.
