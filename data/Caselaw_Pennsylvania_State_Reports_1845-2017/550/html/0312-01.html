When she returned home, he shot her with a small caliber handgun then drove off in her car. Their twenty month old daughter was in the back seat of the car at the time. Later that evening Everett arrived at the state police barracks in Binghamton, New York, approximately 150 miles from Quakertown, and stated that he wanted to leave the child there. While in an interview room with one of the troopers, Everett removed a revolver from his waistband. Following a brief struggle, he was restrained and the gun was taken from him. He was returned to Pennsylvania after the police learned that he was wanted for the shooting.</p>

The Commonwealth filed a notice of its intention to proceed under the mandatory sentencing provision of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712. On July 13, 1994, Everett entered a guilty plea to all the charges. The court sentenced him to eight to twenty years imprisonment. Everett then sought reconsideration of the sentence, arguing that for sentencing purposes aggravated assault should have merged with attempted murder, resulting in a maximum sentence of five to ten years. The court denied reconsideration, but on appeal Superior Court entered a per curiam order reversing and remanding for resentencing “consistently with <em>Commonwealth v.

Since simple assault and battery was a necessary included element of resisting arrest, resisting arrest was the greater offense for which the defendant should have been sentenced.
