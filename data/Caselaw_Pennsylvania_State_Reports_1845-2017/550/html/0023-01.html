The trial court’s June 29,1989 Order, states in relevant part, “Other stipulations presented to the Court are incorporated by reference, as well as all terms <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>of [the] Settlement Agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Pursuant to the revised Order, Husband was to continue making payments through the Domestic Relations Office. Shortly afterwards, Husband lost his job and accepted new employment at a significantly reduced income. In August of 1989, Husband filed a Petition to Modify Support downward based on his decreased income. At a hearing on December 7,1989, the trial court held that the June 29, 1989 agreement was binding on Husband, and accordingly he was denied relief. Husband filed an appeal to the Superior Court, which he later discontinued.</p>

On January 28, 1992, Husband filed a Petition to Modify Support and Vacate Arrearages. The trial court scheduled a hearing for November 5, 1992. Instead of allowing the parties to testify, it held argument on the limited issue of the modifiability of the support Order. Following the proceeding, the trial court refused to modify the level of support, and ordered payment of $100.00 per month on arrearages.</p>

It is Husband’s position that allowing any modification of an agreement indicates that courts are not employing a pure contract analysis because under contract law, no modification, either upward or downward is permissible. Therefore, he asserts that the courts cannot rely on the “sanctity” of contracts to prevent a party from seeking modification of a child support agreement.</p>

He maintains that not permitting downward modification has the untoward effect of locking the parties into an agreement based on the unrealistic premise that the payor’s situation will not change during the period in which support is required. Additionally, we agree with Husband regarding his position that when courts look outside the four corners of an agreement and increase support based on the best interest of the children, they do not act according to strict principles of contract interpretation. They are instead acting according to a well-reasoned public policy. As this Court stated in <em>Knorr:</em>

Accordingly, in order to protect the best interests of the children, our courts permit upward modification of support agreements.

In contrast, parties who executed agreements on or after February 12,1988, knew that both downward and upward modification would be a possibility, and therefore they could negotiate their agreements relying on this proposition. Accordingly, based on fairness to the parties and their children, we hold that downward modification of incorporated and unmerged agreements executed before February 12,1988 is prohibited.</p>

Furthermore, under such an interpretation of <em>Knorr, </em>support orders that exist independently of agreements are of limited value if by enforc<a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>ing them, payees forever abandon their right to enforce their private contracts. We are especially concerned that by giving preclusive effect to a support order, and preventing the payee from bringing an action on the contract, Husband’s reading of <em>Knorr </em>fails to give due attention to the financial needs of the children whose interests the parties intended to protect through the support agreement. Accordingly, we clarify <em>Knorr, </em>and hold that when, as here, a payee seeks redress in the family court based on a support order, he or she cannot assert the existence of a separate agreement as a reason for the court not to modify its order downward. Because failure to comply with a support order can lead to incarceration, the court must be able to reduce the amount if the payor establishes an inability to pay. Moreover, we clarify that the existence of a proceeding on the support order in the family court does not preclude a payee from initiating a <em>separate </em>civil action based on a support agreement either for compensatory damages or for specific performance. In an action at law, the payee may recover breach of contract damages, which in this case would be the unpaid amount of support plus interest. The payee may also choose to seek relief in equity through an order of specific performance directing the payor to comply with his or her future support obligations under the agreement. In addition, the court of equity may order other relief as it deems just. The payee who is successful in his or her civil action has available the enforcement remedies set forth in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. As an example, consider a payor who is obligated to pay child support of $1000.00 per week. If the family court determines that he is only able to pay $100.00 per week, and reduces the support order accordingly, in the event he is rehabilitated after three years and obtains additional sums of money, the payee could initiate a civil action and receive a judgment of $140,400.00 ($900.00 x 156 weeks) plus interest and costs.</p>

Bringing an action on the support order does not preclude the payee from bringing a separate action on the contract.

However, if there is a separate support order based on a support agreement that is incorporated into but not merged with a divorce decree before February 12, 1988, the support order may be increased in the best interests of the children or modified downward upon a showing of changed circumstances, which demonstrate the inability to pay the present order. The trial court’s power to modify the support order downward is not affected by the existence of the agreement upon which the support order is based. The court is modifying its own order, and not the parties’ agreement. However, the support agreement remains a viable contract not subject to downward modification, and the payee may seek relief in law or in equity. In that case, all payments made <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>pursuant to the support order shall be deducted from the award on the support agreement, thus precluding a double recovery for the payee.</p>
