In his concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Cappy suggests that we have created two legal standards: one applicable where an employer's expert "recognizes” the claimant's complaints of pain and one applicable where an employer’s expert "attests to” or "supports” the claimant’s complaints of pain. He emphasizes that when an employer’s medical expert acknowledges, attests to, or supports the existence of a claimant’s ongoing pain, the expert must also opine that the pain is unrelated to the work injury for the employer to be successful in a termination proceeding. While we do not necessarily disagree with this particular proposition as applied in some circumstances, the statement needs clarification.</p>

Termination is only precluded when this testimony is credited by the WCJ. If the contrary were true, the physician would in effect become the factfinder. Credibility determinations are made solely by the WCJ, who has the authority to accept the testimony of a witness in whole or in part. <em>Hartner v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board, </em>146 Pa.Cmwlth. 167, <a href="/pa-commw/146/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="604 A.2d 1204" data-case-ids="1428655" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/146/0167-01">604 A.2d 1204</a> (1992), alloc. denied, <a href="/citations/?q=531%20Pa.%20662" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="531 Pa. 662">531 Pa. 662</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%201210" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="613 A.2d 1210">613 A.2d 1210</a> (1992). The WCJ always has the option in any termination case to find that the testimony in support of continuing pain is incredible. If there is substantial evidence to support the WCJ's findings of fact that a particular claimant has fully recovered, can return to work without restrictions, and that there are no objective medical findings which either substantiate the claims of pain or connect them to the work injury, the termination of benefits is proper <em>regardless of any evidence presented to the contrary.</em>
