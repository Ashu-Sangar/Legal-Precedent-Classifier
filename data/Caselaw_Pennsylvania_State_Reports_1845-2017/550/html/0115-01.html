Fites (Fites), Caterpillar’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, had warned that workers on strike in Caterpillar’s Midwestern plants would be permanently replaced if they did not return to work. The following day, Ken Myers (Myers), an employee at Caterpillar’s York, Pennsylvania plant, wore a T-shirt to work bearing the phrase “PERMANENTLY REPLACE FITES”. Caterpillar immediately discharged Myers because it determined that the slogan contravened its policy against personal, attacks on fellow employees.

A panel of the NLRB held that Caterpillar "violated Section 8(a)(1) [of the Act] by prohibiting its employees from displaying various slogans including 'Permanently Replace Fites’ and any derivative thereof, and that [Caterpillar] violated Section 8(a)(3) [of the Act] by enforcing this rule.” <em>Caterpillar, Inc., </em><a href="/citations/?q=321%20N.L.R.B.%201178" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="321 N.L.R.B. 1178">321 N.L.R.B. at 1178</a>. The NLRB further found that displaying this slogan was protected union activity. It instructed Caterpillar to cease and desist from applying the rule to prohibit any insignia bearing the words “Permanently Replace Fites” or any variation of it, and further instructed Caterpillar to fully compensate those employees whom they suspended for any loss of earnings they suffered.

We likewise reject Caterpillar's argument that its prohibition against personalized attacks on fellow employees fell within its authority to regulate the dress code of its employees.

Although this regulation may be reasonably related to the company’s policy of avoiding confrontations and inharmonious working conditions if it is applied to prohibit, for example, inflammatory, insulting, or obscene language, the statement contained on these particular shirts was not inciting nor likely to promote confrontations.

    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[249,750,1163,786]]]'>Here, Caterpillar had a work rule which prohibited both union and non-union employees from wearing T-shirts that “attack or insult individual persons, whether they are hourly employees, supervisors, managers, local Union leaders, the president of the UAW or even the chairman of Caterpillar.” As the majority acknowledges, there is no dispute that Claimants were fully aware of this work rule, especially since Caterpillar reiterated the work rule and its intention to enforce the rule less than two months before the incident which resulted in Claimants being suspended. The purpose for having this work rule was to avoid in-plant confrontations between employees since both Caterpillar and union officials were concerned over violence on the shop floor. The majority also acknowledges that this constitutes a reasonable purpose for having such a work rule, a conclusion that I join.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[248,1561,1164,467]]]'>Despite recognizing that Claimants were aware of the work rule and that there was a reasonable basis for having the work rule, the majority still finds that the work rule, as applied to the specific facts of this case, was not reasonable. In particular, the majority finds that the language of the T-shirts worn by Claimants was not offensive, that the work rule was not specific enough as to what actually constituted a violation of the work rule, and that the work rule interfered with Claimants’ right to support a union position. I cannot agree.</p>
    <p id="b392-6" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[246,2051,1161,311]],["BL_393.1",393,[181,315,1156,311]]]'>Here, the T-shirts in question contained in bold print the slogan “PERMANENTLY REPLACE FITES,” indicating the chairman- and CEO of Caterpillar.

Since the plain language of the work rule prohibited the wearing of a T-shirt insulting or attacking a Caterpillar employee, the Claimants clearly violated the work rule in dispute.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[184,649,1154,684]]]'>Also, I cannot agree with the position that the Caterpillar work rule failed to clearly delineate that the T-shirts worn by Claimants would be considered a violation of the work rule. Here, the record reveals that Caterpillar supervisors informed Claimants that their T-shirts violated the work rule <em>before </em>any suspensions were imposed. The supervisors also warned Claimants that they would be suspended unless they removed the T-shirt, covered up the offending statement or wore the T-shirt inside out. Under these circumstances, I must conclude that Claimants were given reasonable notice that Caterpillar deemed their T-shirts to be violative of the work rule and had a reasonable opportunity to comply with the work rule before Claimants were suspended for violating the rule.</p>

One of the Claimants, who was a union official, testified that he was aware that the Claimants could have complied with the options presented by Caterpillar and subsequently filed a grievance protesting Caterpillar’s action. Since such recourse was available, I believe that Caterpillar’s actions did not unreasonably interfere with Claimants’ ability to support a union position. Moreover, an employee’s conduct which violates recognized company policy, which is otherwise reasonable and lawful, fails to automatically become protected because the employee alleges it was done to further union activity. <em>See Flores v.

Nevertheless, Claimants freely chose to deliberately violate the work rule without just cause by continuing to wear the T-shirts.
