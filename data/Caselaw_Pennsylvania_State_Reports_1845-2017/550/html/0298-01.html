When her body was discovered, Elvira Hayes’ two year old son, L.P., was sleeping on top of her on the floor. Appellant was a boyfriend of Elvira Hayes and while questioned after the murder, he was not arrested. Elvira Hayes’ sister and her husband adopted L.P. after the murder. He underwent counselling and psychiatric care at several institutions in the following years.</p>

L.P. said that he remembered seeing Appellant lying on top of his mother where her body was found. Appellant was charged with the murder and the court appointed the Public Defender Association to represent him. In preparing for trial, Appellant’s counsel sought discovery of L.P.’s mental health records. Because L.P. did not disclose his memory of the murder for over a decade, counsel maintained that they needed the records to prepare a defense.</p>
    <p id="b564-7" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[232,1772,1163,579]]]'>At a hearing, defense counsel told the court that it needed a court order to get the psychiatric records because of their confidentiality. The trial court decided that the proper course was to order that the records be produced to the court for review to determine their relevance and whether they should be released to counsel. The court then ordered the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute (EPPI) to produce in court its records related to L.P. EPPI’s records, however, were hand delivered to defense counsel and counsel read them. These documents contained records from other institutions where L.P. was treated.</p>

Counsel gave them to the court which reviewed them as originally intended for discoverable material. While the court initially found no relevant documents, it undertook another review at the request of defense counsel who believed there were relevant documents based upon their review. The court then found relevant documents and gave them to both parties.</p>

He also petitioned to obtain all of the medical records. The trial court realized at this time that defense counsel had digested all of the records and decided that the only way to proceed fairly was to give all of the records to both sides.</p>

It then asked the court to appoint a child advocate to protect L.P. The court did so and the advocate maintained that L.P.’s records were absolutely privileged and suggested that the best recourse was to remove defense counsel. The Commonwealth agreed that the removal of defense counsel would protect L.P.’s rights and ensure that Appellant received a fair trial.</p>
    <p id="b565-6" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[178,1589,1153,691]]]'>The trial court removed the Public Defender Association and appointed new counsel for Appellant. It based its decision upon defense counsel’s disregard of the court’s instructions that it would review L.P.’s records, and its order directing EPPI to produce the records to the court. The court decided that counsel would be unable to forget the information in the records and that the harm to the witness, L.P., could not be otherwise remedied. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. It ruled that the court’s order is immediately appealable and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate Appellant’s constitutional rights by removing counsel under the circumstances. We granted Appellant’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal.</p>

Majority Opinion at 834. According to the majority, the <em>Cassidy </em>court’s concerns “have nothing to do with whether the right to counsel of choice is lost if not reviewed before judgment.” <em>Id. </em>at 834. To the contrary, I find that the court’s concerns are very relevant to the issue of whether the right to counsel of choice will be irreparably lost, since those concerns reflect the benefits of the right itself. As previously noted, if the benefits of a defendant’s right to his chosen counsel are lost, then in both a logical and practical respect the right itself is lost.</p>

For example, the defendant’s chosen counsel may not be available for a second trial due to illness, relocation, or other work that prevents him or her from representing the defendant in a new trial. If this is the case, then the defendant’s right will have been irreparably lost. There is also the possibility that a defendant may not have the financial resources to obtain the originally chosen attorney a second time.
