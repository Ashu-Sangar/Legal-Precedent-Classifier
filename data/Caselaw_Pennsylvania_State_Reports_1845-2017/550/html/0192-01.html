That presumption is a heavy one which is not easily overcome. In <em>Lassiter, </em>the Court acknowledged that the private interest at stake— the potential termination of parental rights—was “extremely important,” that the state shared that interest and had a <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>relatively weak pecuniary interest, and that complexity of the termination proceedings could make the risk of an erroneous deprivation “insupportably high.” Still the Court declined to find a right to court-appointed counsel unless “the parents’ interests were at their strongest, the state’s interests were at their weakest, and the risks of error were at their peak.” <a href="/us/452/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="452 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="1313768" data-case-paths="/us/452/0018-01">452 U.S. at 31</a>, <a href="/us/452/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="452 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="1313768" data-case-paths="/us/452/0018-01">101 S.Ct. at 2162</a>.</p>
