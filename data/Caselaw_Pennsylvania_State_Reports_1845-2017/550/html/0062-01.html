The apartment belonged to Agnes McClinchey (McClinchey), who had given Gribble and O’Donnell permission to stay in the apartment while she traveled to western Pennsylvania. James Mathews (Mathews), an elderly friend of McClinchey who drank heavily, also resided in the apartment.</p>

O’Donnell offered to pawn a leather jacket to Eleftheriou in exchange for ten dollars. An employee of the pizza shop observed Eleftheriou remove a “whole lot of money” in a roll from his pocket to pay O’Donnell for the jacket. O’Donnell and Eleftheriou then made arrangements to meet later that evening. After closing the pizza shop at 1:00 a.m. <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>on November 12, 1992, Eleftheriou left in his car to meet O’Donnell.

Mathews was asleep in a back room. According to Gribble, Eleftheriou “was feeling all over” O’Donnell. Gribble then “freaked.” He hit Eleftheriou once with his fist, grabbed a hammer that was resting on a television, and beat Eleftheriou approximately ten or fifteen times with the hammer until Gribble “knew [Eleftheriou] was dead.” Gribble claimed that O’Donnell left the apartment at some point during the attack on Eleftheriou. Next, Gribble dragged Eleftheriou’s body behind the house, covered him with a piece of plywood, and returned to the house to decide what to do. A short time later, Gribble uncovered Eleftheriou’s body, dropped him through an access hole into the basement, and began to dismember the body. While Gribble was carving apart the body, O’Donnell returned to the apartment and said she was sick. O’Donnell telephoned police, who dispatched a rescue squad to the apartment. After the rescue squad arrived and transported O’Donnell to the hospital, Gribble said he returned to the basement and finished dismembering Eleftheriou. Gribble also admitted that he cut off Eleftheriou’s penis “for spite.” He then bagged the body parts and cleaned the basement. O’Donnell came back from the hospital a few hours later and she and Gribble went to sleep.</p>

Gribble said he then took the remainder of the bags back to the apartment and he and O’Donnell went to sleep. Gribble also admitted that he took money and a credit card from Eleftheriou’s wallet, and later that evening, he and O’Donnell drove to a children’s clothing store in Philadelphia, <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>where O’Donnell used Eleftheriou’s credit card to purchase clothing for Gribble’s children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

In a smaller bag there was a blood-covered head, with the left eye missing. A short distance away, police found a right arm inside another bag.

When Gribble returned from this task, O’Donnell said to him “[tjhank God, you didn’t get caught.” That same evening, police received a report of a car fire on D Street. When police and fire fighters arrived on the <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>scene, they found a car in flames.

The evidence adduced at trial showed that O’Donnell went to the pizza shop to pawn a leather jacket and noticed that Eleftheriou was carrying a large amount of cash. She arranged to meet him after work and brought him back to McClinchey’s apartment where she and Gribble had been staying. Although Gribble claims to have interrupted Eleftheriou’s assault on O’Donnell and grabbed a hammer from on top of the television set, McClinchey testified that her tool box was usually kept in the basement, thus supporting the Commonwealth’s theory that the hammer was brought from the basement in anticipation of the attack on Eleftheriou. Additionally, the assistant medical examiner testified that it would have taken two people to dismember Eleftheriou’s body in the estimated fifteen minutes before he bled to death. Moreover, on the day of the killing, Gribble took Eleftheriou’s cash and credit card, and then he and O’Donnell drove Eleftheriou’s car to a store to buy clothing for Gribble’s children with the credit card. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, this evidence is sufficient to support the inference that Gribble and O’Donnell formed a premeditated plan to lure Eleftheriou to the apartment with the intention to kill him and rob him of the money that O’Donnell had seen him carrying earlier. <em>Commonwealth v.

Detective Gross explained the reason for the cross-out as follows: “When [Gribble] was reading the statement, he at the end, he got up to that, and he read that and he said that doesn’t sound too good, does it? Can I change that? I said, yeah, go ahead and change it.

O'Donnell’s version of the murder, however, differs significantly from Gribble’s statement. O’Donnell claims that she was motivated to kill Eleftheriou because he had sexually assaulted her in the pizza shop on a prior occasion. O'Donnell said that she brought Eleftheriou back to the apartment, and while he was looking out a window, she struck him in the head with a hammer. After Eleftheriou fell to the floor, O’Donnell alleges that she continued to beat him with the hammer and then took his body into the yard and left it unattended. Later, O'Donnell claims to have taken the body to the basement, "sawed him up with a hacksaw,” and put the body parts in trash bags. She also admitted that she cut off Eleftheriou’s penis and placed it in a pencil case with the intention of sending the penis to her father to annoy him. She further contends that Gribble did not take part in beating and dismembering Eleftheriou, but she admits that he did assist her in disposing of the body parts along Delaware Avenue.</p>

      <p id="b354-7" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[289,1890,1130,468]]]'>Although proportionality review is located in a section labeled "Sentencing procedure for murder of the first degree”, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, Act 28's repeal of proportionality review is undoubtedly substantive. Act 28 alters the set of facts that entitles a capital defendant to relief, i.e., a sentence of death that is "excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases” no longer affords a statutory basis for relief. <em>See </em>Act 28. Thus, while Act 28 may appear merely procedural on its face, it affects a substantive right and is therefore subject to the legislature's restriction against retroactive application. <em>See Bell v.
