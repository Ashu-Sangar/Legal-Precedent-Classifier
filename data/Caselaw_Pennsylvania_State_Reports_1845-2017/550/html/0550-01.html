The first issue is whether a claimant who is involved in a work-related automobile accident and later suffers a psychological injury which is allegedly triggered by learning that she is being sued by the driver of the other vehicle in the accident should have her claim analyzed under the “physical/mental” or “mental/mental” burden of proof for purposes of determining eligibility to receive a reinstatement of workers’ compensation benefits. The second issue is if such a claim should be analyzed under the physical/mental burden of proof, what standard of proof should be applied in “physical/mental” cases. Because we find that the claimant’s psychological injury should have been analyzed under the “mental/mental” burden of proof, and since the claimant has failed to produce evidence that abnormal working conditions caused her psychological injury, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court reinstating the claimant’s workers’ compensation benefits.</p>

However, Dr. Sobel was unable to opine with any degree of medical certainty the cause of Claimant’s mental disorders. The other medical expert, Robert Toborowsky, M.D., a board certified psychiatrist, testified that Claimant first became upset when she learned that she was being sued by the other driver.

The WCJ rejected the testimony of appellant’s medical expert to the extent that it conflicted with that presented by Claimant. Based on these determinations, the WCJ granted Claimant’s petition to amend the Notice of Compensation Payable to reflect that Claimant had sustained a psychological injury in the nature of depression from the February 27, 1990 work-related automobile accident. The WCJ also found that Claimant sustained a recurrence of this depression for the period from February 3, 1992 (the date Claimant stopped working) through February 2, 1993 (the date Claimant returned to work). Thus, the WCJ granted Claimant’s petition for reinstatement of benefits. Moreover, the WCJ denied Claimant’s penalty petition on the basis that appellant’s contest of Claimant’s two petitions was reasonable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The Board, without taking further evidence, reversed the decision of the WCJ. In particular, the Board found that the evidence did not support the WCJ’s findings that Claimant’s psychological injury was caused by the physical injuries of her work-related automobile accident. Instead, the Board found that the evidence showed that Claimant’s psychological injury was caused by the psychological stimulus of learning that she was being sued by the other driver involved in the work-related accident. The Board also found that Claimant’s psychological injury was not related to her employment and that there was only a tenuous causal relationship between the psychological injury and the accident. Thus, the Board concluded that Claimant actually suffered a psychic injury classified as a “mental/mental” injury. Since “mental/mental” workers’ compensation claims require evidence of abnormal working conditions, and Claimant failed to produce such evidence, the Board determined that Claimant was not entitled to amend her Notice of Compensation Payable and denied her petition for reinstatement of benefits.</p>

In his testimony, Dr. Toborowsky stated that he believed that it was Claimant’s learning of the fact that she was being sued which triggered her psychological problems. Dr. Toborowsky also testified that he believed that the notification of the lawsuit and the injuries suffered by the other driver were factors which would lead to the increase in the likelihood of developing post-traumatic stress disorder and, in fact, led to Claimant thinking about the work-related accident.</p>

While Dr. Toborowsky did make a statement that he believed some causal relationship existed between the accident and the psychological injury, his testimony clearly established that he believed it was Claimant’s learning of being sued which triggered or stimulated Claimant’s psychological injury. As stated by Dr. Toborowsky on cross-examination, although a car accident is usually not an extraordinary event, what made Claimant’s accident extraordinary is the byproduct of the accident. In this case the byproduct, or the triggering event, of Claimant’s psychological injury, was the lawsuit, not the accident itself. The accident itself was only indirectly causally related to Claimant’s psychological injury since, without the accident, there would not have been the lawsuit to trigger or stimulate the psychological injury.

Thus, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court and the WCJ erred as a matter of law in concluding that the evidence presented demonstrated the existence of a physical/mental injury for purposes of determining eligibility for reinstatement of workers’ compensation benefits. We decline to find that learning of the filing of a lawsuit is a physical stimulus which could be the basis of a mental injury. Instead, we believe that, as a matter of law, the facts demonstrate that it was the psychological stimulus of learning that she was being sued as a result of the work-related accident, rather than the physical stimulus in the form of the injuries Claimant suffered from the work-related accident, which caused Claimant’s psychological injury.

Instead, Claimant’s injury should have been examined under the mental/mental burden of proof. When examining the evidence of record, it is evident that Claimant failed to sustain the mental/mental burden of proof. Thus, the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that the WCJ correctly ordered that Claimant’s Notice of Compensation Payable be amended to reflect a physical/mental injury and that Claimant’s workers’ compensation benefits be reinstated.

This mental disability may not surface until some time has passed and claimant inadvertently “revisits” the original physical trauma in her mind.

Simply because the mental problem is “triggered” by a mental stimulus does not mean that it is not in fact caused by the physical injury. These examples represent classic patterns of emotional harm brought about by physical trauma (“physical/mental”) and reflect the mind’s ability not only to attempt to block a person’s more horrible experiences, but to then flood with vivid memory on the slightest provocation. Both paradigms can produce debilitating psychological harm and are properly characterized as physical/mental injuries.</p>
