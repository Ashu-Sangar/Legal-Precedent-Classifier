When interpreting this provision narrowly, I believe that the plain meaning of this provision is that the waiver of governmental immunity will be triggered only if the plaintiffs injuries were caused by a negligent act explicitly listed as an exception in Section 8542(b). 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) (court must give effect to plain meaning of statute when words of statute are clear and free of all ambiguity). Here, it is not disputed that the parties stipulated that the vehicle was moving when the accident occurred. It is also not disputed that the City and appellee stipulated that the cause of appellee’s injuries <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>was the negligent maintenance and repair of the vehicle by the City. Thus, if the majority had properly adhered to the holding of <em>Love </em>requiring that exceptions to immunity provisions be narrowly construed, it would have determined that appellee could only have been entitled to a waiver of immunity if the negligent maintenance of the fire rescue vehicle could be viewed as the negligent “operation” of that vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b811-4" data-blocks='[["BL_811.4",811,[183,722,1157,250]]]'>As noted above, Love defined “operation” for purposes of the motor vehicle exception as involving the movement of the vehicle. The word “maintenance,” however, is not defined by statute. Black’s Law Dictionary defines the word “maintain” as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b811-5" data-blocks='[["BL_811.5",811,[229,993,1110,365]]]'>The term is variously defined as acts of repairs and other acts to prevent a decline, lapse or cessation from existing state or condition; ... hold or preserve in any particular state or condition; keep from change; keep from falling, declining, or ceasing; keep in existence or continuance; keep in force; keep in good order; keep in proper condition; keep in repair.</blockquote>
    <p id="b811-6" data-blocks='[["BL_811.6",811,[186,1376,1153,576]]]'>Black’s Law Dictionary, p. 953 (6th Ed.). A similar definition is found in Webster’s New World Dictionary where maintenance is defined as “a maintaining or being maintained; upkeep, support, defense, etc.; specif., the work of keeping a building, machinery, etc. in a state of good repair.” W,ebster’s New World Dictionary, p. 854 (2nd Ed.). From these common definitions, it is evident that the maintenance of a vehicle does not constitute the “operation” of a vehicle as set forth by this Court in <em>Love. </em>Thus, an injury caused by the negligent maintenance of a vehicle does not fall within the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity.</p>
    <p id="b811-7" data-blocks='[["BL_811.7",811,[187,1970,1151,409]]]'>Therefore, since the negligent act which caused appellee’s injury was the negligent maintenance of the vehicle, I believe that appellee’s claim does not fall within the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity. Thus, unlike the majority, I believe that the law, as provided by this Court in <em>Love, </em>mandated that summary judgment should have been entered in favor of the City since the City should have been found to be immune from suit in this case.</p>

      <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>I also dissent because I cannot help but believe that the majority’s decision eroding the concept of governmental immunity is driven by the need to provide an injured plaintiff with a remedy for his injuries. Like the majority, I believe that it is tragic that appellee in this case suffered an injury caused by the negligent maintenance, not negligent operation, of a City fire rescue vehicle. However, as Justice McDermott so eloquently stated in <em>Love:</em>

    <blockquote id="b812-4" data-blocks='[["BL_812.4",812,[287,789,1124,1004]]]'>In summary, we wish to emphasize that the issue here is not whether one may be tortiously injured entering or alighting from a stopped vehicle. Rather, the issue is the confining question of whether a political subdivision is immunized from suit when one is so injured, notwithstanding what may be the actual tort of their employees. The legislature, for reasons of policy, reasons of policy we are not entitled to dilute for sympathy or even outrage at specific instances of blatant tort, has decided that such an immunity does exist, and we must abide, sometimes leaving dreadful injuries, negligently inflicted, uncompensated. The judicial concept that where there is a wrong there must be a right often depends on the wisdom and large responsibility of the legislature. What rights for what wrongs are generally their prerogative and apportioned in the exercise of their many responsibilities and competing needs. Their task, like ours, is never easy. However, it is our duty to respect and enforce their judgment, even with heavy hearts in particular instances.</blockquote>
