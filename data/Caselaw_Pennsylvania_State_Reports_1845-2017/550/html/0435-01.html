Upon careful consideration this court finds that application of the closely related crime exception must be determined on a case-by-case basis. For the reasons as more fully set forth herein, the decision of the Superior Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>
    <p id="b703-8" data-blocks='[["BL_703.7",703,[157,988,1158,1070]]]'>The essential facts underlying this matter are as follows. In the late afternoon hours of March 26, 1994, Officer Burkhardt of the New Britain Township Police Department responded to a radio call of a motorcycle accident. Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Burkhardt observed a motorcycle facing in the southbound direction lying half on the street and half in the yard of a property on the northbound side of the roadway. Upon investigation it was apparent that the operator of the motorcycle had been traveling southbound, crossed the center line, and struck a mailbox and telephone pole on the northbound side of the road. Officer Burkhardt observed that the motorcycle was dented and leaking gasoline from a punctured tank. The mailbox of the residence was knocked from its post to the ground and the telephone pole was damaged. The operator of the motorcycle was not on the scene. After speaking to witnesses at the scene, Officer Burkhardt arrived at appellant’s home where he spoke to appellant and appellant’s father. In response to the officer’s questions, appellant stated that while driving the motorcycle to a bar, he “dumped” it.</p>

Officer Burkhardt asked appellant if he had anything to drink after the accident to which appellant responded negatively. The <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>officer then asked appellant to perform field sobriety coordination tests, a request appellant declined. Appellant was then arrested and transported to a local hospital, where upon being informed of the implied consent law and asked to submit to a blood test, he refused. Appellant was then transferred to police headquarters where he became uncooperative, irrational and threatening to the officer. Appellant was, upon his request, granted a meeting with a crisis intervention worker as he was threatening suicide. After the crisis intervention, worker interviewed appellant, appellant was again released into the custody of Officer Burkhardt.</p>

At appellant’s trial his counsel objected to the admission of appellant’s statement that he had been operating the motorcycle on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to establish, the corpus delicti for DUI independent of appellant’s statement. The trial court overruled the objection. Appellant was ultimately found guilty and appealed his conviction to the Superior Court.</p>

The Superior Court heard the appeal en banc, rendering a decision which generated four separate opinions. Judge Beck, writing for the majority, found that all statements of a defendant material to the prosecution’s case are subject to the corpus delicti rule. In this case, although the Commonwealth had failed to independently establish the corpus delicti for DUI, appellant’s statement was admissible under the closely related crime exception to the corpus delicti rule. Judge Cirillo wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion wherein he agreed that all material statements of an accused are subject to the corpus delicti rule, however, he opined that the closely related crime exception could never apply to a situation where <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>one of the crimes charged was a summary offense and the other was a misdemeanor offense. Judge Cavanaugh filed a concurring statement, wherein he agreed with the conclusion of the majority, but he found the decision to be too broad in its application of the corpus delicti rule to all material statements of an accused. Judge Del Sole also filed a concurring statement in which he opined that the defendant’s statement that he had been operating the motorcycle was not an admission which would invoke the corpus delicti rule. Allocatur was granted by this court to review the parameters of the closely related crime exception to the corpus delicti rule.</p>

The defendant made a statement to the police that the drugs were his, not those of his wife, and that he intended to deliver the drugs to others. The defendant then argued that the Commonwealth failed to establish the corpus delicti on the intent to deliver charge, absent his statement.

A majority of the Superior Court held that all statements of an accused that are material to the prosecution’s case are subject to the corpus delicti rule. Statements material to the prosecution’s case are any statements which bear upon a matter at issue in the case. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b710-5" data-blocks='[["BL_710.4",710,[255,522,1160,413]]]'>Appellant argues however, that it was error to permit his statement that he had been operating the vehicle at the time of the accident to be admitted as to the charge of DUI. Appellant correctly points out that the corpus delicti for DUI was not established.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Therefore, the admission of this statement can only be sustained if the closely related crime exception to the corpus delicti rule applies to leaving the scene of an accident and DUI.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Appellant argues that in finding the exception applicable to a summary and misdemeanor offense the Superior Court has radically departed from its own precedents in this area of law. In support of his position appellant lists a series of cases the Superior Court has reviewed, none of which apply the exception to an analogous situation. However, the absence of precedent applying the closely related crime exception to a summary and misdemean- or offense means no more than the fact that the issue had not <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>yet presented itself to the appellate court. As appellant’s argument reveals, there is also no precedent holding that the closely related crime exception cannot apply where one offense is graded a misdemeanor and another a summary. Given that this is an issue of first impression, the absence of precedent is to be expected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b711-5" data-blocks='[["BL_711.4",711,[173,658,1153,640]]]'>The primary concern in applying this exception is to ensure that the purpose of the corpus delicti rule is not violated. The purpose of the rule is to guard against a conviction based upon a hasty or unguarded confession before the Commonwealth establishes that a crime in fact has occurred. <em>Commonwealth v. Turza, </em><a href="/pa/340/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="340 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="1203392" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0128-01">340 Pa. 128</a>, 134, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%20401" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="16 A.2d 401">16 A.2d 401</a>, 404 (1940). The fact that one of the crimes at issue is of a different grade in contrast to the other crime sought to be linked to the accused is of no moment when looking at the general purpose for which the corpus delicti rule was created. Thus, we see no logical reason why the closely related crime exception would not apply to offenses of different grades.</p>
    <p id="b711-6" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[175,1332,1152,638]]]'>Next we turn to appellant’s argument that the crimes are not sufficiently closely related. Appellant argues that the crimes are not closely related because the legislative purpose in enacting the summary offense was to protect the economic rights of property owners where the legislative purpose in enacting the DUI statute was to protect the public from the danger of intoxicated drivers. Even assuming appellant is correct in his statement as to the underlying policy reasons for the enactments at issue, the purpose for which the legislation was promulgated is not a relevant concern in deciding the admissibility of an inculpatory statement of the accused under the closely related crime exception.</p>

Obviously in this instance we have a temporal relationship between <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>the crimes charged as the DUI arose from the same incident as did the offense of leaving the scene of the accident. The elements necessary to establish the DUI charge at issue are 1) someone was operating, or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, and 2) the operator of the motor vehicle was under the influence of alcohol at the time, rendering him incapable of safe driving.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The DUI charge shares the common element of operation of a motor vehicle with the charge of leaving the scene of an accident. Given the commonality of elements between the two offenses and the fact that they arose from the same incident, we find that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting appellant’s statement under the closely related crime exception to the corpus delicti rule.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

The issue in that case was whether extrajudicial statements of the defendant, which were in fact exculpatory, yet could be said to establish an element of the crime charged, i.e., material statements, would be admissible without independent corrobo<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>ration establishing the trustworthiness of the statements. <em>Id. </em>at 92, <a href="/us/348/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="348 U.S. 84" data-case-ids="6930785" data-case-paths="/us/348/0084-01">75 S.Ct. at 164</a>. (when presented with the criminal charges the defendant had made the statements as an alibi). The <em>Opper </em>Court held that independent corroboration was necessary even though the statements were exculpatory. However, the Court also held that the quantum of independent corroboration needed to meet the corpus delicti rule was not required prior to admission of these statements, because the statements were not <em>inculpatory. </em>Thus, although the <em>Opper </em>decision speaks to material statements, it does not hold that all material statements of the accused are subject to the corpus delicti rule.</p>
