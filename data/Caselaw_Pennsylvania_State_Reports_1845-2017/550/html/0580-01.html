At issue is the proper standard of review to be used by a trial court when reviewing a prosecutor’s disapproval of a private criminal complaint. For the reasons presented herein, we would affirm.</p>
    <p id="b846-12" data-blocks='[["BL_846.12",846,[247,1595,1161,414]]]'>In September 1989, police in Warren County, Pennsylvania were investigating the kidnapping, rape, and murder of Kathy Wilson, a resident of Chautauqua County, New York.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">1</a> Hoping to further the investigation, the New York and Pennsylvania State Police offered a $26,000 reward for information leading to discovery and conviction of the killer. Appellee Brown, a sixteen-year-old New York resident, contacted the authorities and claimed to have information about the case.</p>

When he arrived at the State Police barracks in Warren County, however, he <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>was immediately arrested and charged in the Wilson killing. In response, Brown identified Jay William Buckley as the killer. Buckley was then arrested and charged with kidnapping, rape, and murder. In return for his testimony against Buckley, Brown was permitted to plead guilty to the lesser charges of indecent assault, felonious restraint, and hindering apprehension.</p>
    <p id="b847-4" data-blocks='[["BL_847.4",847,[181,733,1154,596]]]'>At Buckley’s trial, Brown testified that he had been with Buckley and had witnessed him kidnap, rape, and kill Ms. Wilson. However, during cross-examination, defense counsel pointed out numerous inconsistencies between Brown’s testimony and his previous statements to police. As a result, Brown eventually admitted that he had repeatedly lied both in his statements to police and at Buckley’s preliminary hearing. In all, Brown admitted to over 700 instances of falsification or perjury in connection with the abduction and murder of Ms. Wilson. After a four-week trial, Buckley was acquitted on all charges on June 6,1991.</p>
    <p id="b847-5" data-blocks='[["BL_847.5",847,[183,1368,1156,809]]]'>Brown, however, had pled guilty to lesser charges. After being sentenced to seven to fourteen years in prison, he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and for reconsideration of sentence. A hearing was held, at which Brown stated that he had lied at Buckley’s trial and that he was never an eyewitness to any of the crimes in the Wilson case. He claimed that Buckley had simply told him about having committed the crime. Brown stated that he had initially told the police that he was an eyewitness in order to receive the reward money offered. He then claimed that, once arrested, he was coached and prompted by police and the district attorney to repeatedly change his story so that it coincided with the physical evidence in the case. He stated that he altered his accounts in order to satisfy the authorities’ desire for an eyewitness and because he was threatened with the withdrawal of his plea agreement.</p>

The Attorney General declined to prosecute Brown on the first eight charges of the complaint for three reasons: 1) because the inconsistencies in Brown’s story were “patently obvious to everyone” and actually worked to Buckley’s advantage by “substantially contributing] to his acquittal,” 2) because a trial would “consume substantially more court time and resources,” and 3) because Brown had already been incarcerated for two years as a result of his guilty pleas in the Wilson case.

If Brown’s “time served” is relevant at all, it would be at sentencing, not at the complaint stage. Moreover, as the trial court pointed out, an individual who commits a crime while incarcerated is charged and tried for those crimes like any other defendant. Accordingly, this alleged policy argu<a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>ment fails to support the Attorney General’s disapproval decision.</p>
    <p id="b853-4" data-blocks='[["BL_853.4",853,[159,447,1154,685]]]'>Next, the Attorney General claimed that the trial that would result from an approval of Buckley’s complaint would be too costly in terms of both time and money. While the expenditure of judicial and prosecutorial resources is a valid factor to consider, we simply find no merit to the Attorney General’s assertion that in this case a trial of Brown would be too time-consuming and costly. Brown is an admitted perjurer. Indeed, his admissions form part of the notes of testimony of Buckley’s trial. Given the overwhelming evidence of Brown’s guilt, we agree with both lower courts that the cost of prosecuting him would not be excessive. We also note that the Commonwealth routinely expends substantial sums prosecuting less serious offenses.</p>

We find this argument completely meritless, as did both lower courts. As the Attorney General admits, Brown’s falsehoods were apparent to all. The Attorney General cannot claim that those falsehoods and inconsistencies were not likewise apparent <em>to the prosecution prior </em>to Buckley’s trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">6</a> However, despite its knowledge of <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>the blatant inconsistencies in Brown’s story and its consequent awareness of how lacking in credibility Brown actually was, the Warren County District Attorney’s office nonetheless proceeded to subject Buckley to a prosecution for kidnapping, rape, and murder, with Brown as the star witness. To now claim that Brown should not be tried for his admitted perjuries because they helped acquit Buckley is simply unacceptable given the prosecution’s prior knowledge of Brown’s falsehoods. In short, to the extent that Brown’s patently inconsistent statements resulted in the prosecution of Buckley, the argument can be made that Buckley should not have been tried in the first place and therefore should never have been in need of an acquittal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Given this, we cannot accept the Attorney General’s argument that Brown’s perjury should be excused because it helped Buckley secure that acquittal.</p>

Term “bad faith” is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but rather it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity; it is different from the negative idea of negligence in that it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will.</blockquote>
