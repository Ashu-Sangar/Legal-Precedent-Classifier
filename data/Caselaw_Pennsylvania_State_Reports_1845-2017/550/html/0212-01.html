Linwood Bennett was employed as a teacher by the Central Montgomery County Area Vocational Technical School. During the 1989-90 school year, Bennett was a full-time auto body instructor at the school. In June of 1990, Bennett was advised that he would be demoted from his full-time position to a halftime position because of declining enrollment in the auto body program and in the school.</p>
    <p id="b478-11" data-blocks='[["BL_478.11",478,[248,1545,1161,527]]]'>Bennett was an auto body instructor on a half-time basis during the 1990-91 school year. Samuel Stearly, who was employed by the school as a full-time industrial production and maintenance instructor, went on sabbatical leave during that school year. Stearly’s position was then filled by Nicholas Sucic, who had taught carpentry during the previous school year. Sucic was certified as both a carpentry instructor and an industrial production and maintenance instructor. The void created by Sucic’s change in teaching responsibilities was filled by the hiring of Arthur Mahan as a long-term substitute.</p>

A decision was later made by the school’s Joint Operating Committee to offer the program on a full-time basis beginning with the 1991-92 school year.

Sucic continued to be assigned to the industrial production and maintenance program. Bennett remained as the half-time auto body instructor. Since there were no instructors on the suspension or demotion list certified to fill the carpentry position, Mahan (the substitute instructor for 1990-91) was hired as the full-time carpentry instructor.</p>

The common pleas court dismissed Bennett’s petition for review. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed, finding that the common pleas court had erred in holding that Section 1125.1(d)(2) of the Public School Code did not apply to the newly created in-school suspension position. The matter was remanded to the Joint Operating Committee for reinstatement of Bennett and for the payment of back pay.

We agree that § 1125.1(d)(2) does not require a school entity to reinstate an available suspended or demoted professional employee in a new position that does not require a certification. The statutory provision requires that no new appointments be made while there is “a suspended or demoted professional employe available <em>who is properly certificated to fill such vacancy.” </em>Had the legislature intended to require a school to fill positions by seniority regardless of whether certification is required, the underlined language of § 1125.1(d)(2) would have been unnecessary. To give meaning to the entire provision, we must interpret § 1125(d)(2) as requiring a school entity to fill only vacant positions that require certification with a suspended or demoted professional employee who is properly certified to fill such position.</p>

John Walls, a certificated health and physical education teacher, had been suspended in 1984 due to declining enrollment. In 1991, a health and physical education teacher for the school district retired. The school district did <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>not recall Walls, however. Lee Andrews, a special education teacher who was also certificated in health and physical education, was chosen to fill the vacancy although he had less seniority than Walls.

    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[257,590,1165,852]]]'>The issue presented was whether, under § 1125.1(d)(2) of the Public School Code, a school district had the authority to assign a presently employed teacher with less seniority than a suspended teacher, who was properly certificated, to a vacant position. The school district argued that § 1125.1(d)(2) protects suspended employees only when a vacancy arises, not when assignments or transfers of active teachers occur. The Commonwealth Court held that “regardless of a professional employee’s active or suspended status, a District must provide a more-senior, properly certificated professional employee the opportunity to fill a vacant position prior to assigning a less-senior teacher to that position.” 165 Pa.Cmwlth. at 8, <a href="/pa-commw/165/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="644 A.2d 211" data-case-ids="1463117,7864188" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/165/0001-01,/a2d/644/0211-01">644 A.2d at 214</a>. This case is distinguishable from <em>Colonial </em>because the position with the in-school suspension program did not require a certification, while the vacant position in <em>Colonial </em>required a certification in health and physical education.</p>

While this provision promotes the interests of senior suspended or demoted teachers, it does not offer complete protection based upon seniority.

Without the language “who is properly certificated to fill such a vacancy,” § 11—1125.1(d)(2) would mandate that the most senior suspended or demoted professional employee would be allowed to fill <em>any </em>vacancy. Such a mandate would compel the placement of a school secretary or dental hygienist, who are “professional employes” pursuant to 24 P.S. § 11-1101, in a vacant teaching position merely because that secretary or hygienist was the most senior professional employee. To me it is obvious that the legislature in formulating this statute intended to accord favorable status based upon seniority, but did not intend to so hallow this preference for seniority that it would adversely impact the quality of education that the children of this Commonwealth receive. I thus find the majority’s position on this point to be unpersuasive.</p>

Throughout <em>Dallap </em>we clearly adhered to the legislature’s dictate that seniority was the primary concern. At one point, we even stated that “[i]t is simply incorrect to say that [we] recognized that a school board’s assessment of educational practicality could override the legislative requirement that teachers be retained on the basis of seniority.” <em>Dallap, </em><a href="/pa/524/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="524 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1822845" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0260-01">524 Pa. at 265-66</a>, <a href="/pa/524/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="524 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1822845" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0260-01">571 A.2d at 370</a>.
