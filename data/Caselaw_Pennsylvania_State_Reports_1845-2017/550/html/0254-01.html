The first issue is whether the coordinate jurisdiction rule barred a judge involved in the post-trial motion phase of the litigation <em>sub judice </em>from reversing the ruling of another judge of a coordinate court in the same matter. The second issue is, if the coordinate jurisdiction rule does not act as a bar, whether the term “spine”, as used in the exclusion provision of the medical insurance policy issued by appellee to appellant, included the intervertebral disc injury suffered by appellant. While we find that the coordinate jurisdiction rule under the facts of this matter does not bar the post-trial judge from reversing the ruling of another judge of the same court in the same case, we agree with the Superior Court that the term “spine”, which was contained in the exclusion provision of the medical insurance policy in <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>question, encompassed the intervertebral disc injury suffered by appellant.</p>

In the medical history section of his insurance application concerning the back/spine, appellant averred that neither he nor his two daughters had been treated or diagnosed over the last ten years with any type of back pain, curvature or disc problems. However, appellant’s insurance application did indicate that he had visited Ellwood City Hospital’s emergency room in June of 1986 complaining of stomach pains after eating at a fast-food restaurant.</p>

On November 20, 1990, appellee issued a medical insurance policy to appellant which was retroactive to the application date of October 16, 1990.

On June 15, 1995, the trial judge recused himself from the case because scheduling conflicts made him unavailable to dispose of appellant’s post-trial motions. In accordance with Rule 227.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of the Rules of Civil Procedure,2 appellant’s post-trial motions were reassigned to another judge of the same Common Pleas Court (“post-trial judge”).

Because the post-trial judge concluded that the spinal column did not include intervertebral discs, the post-trial judge held that the medical insurance policy exclusion did not apply. Therefore, the post-trial judge granted appellant’s post-trial motion and awarded appellant a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[249,786,1164,959]]]'>On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the post-trial judge’s ruling. The Superior Court first found that the coordinate jurisdiction rule barred the post-trial judge from overruling the trial judge’s previous ruling on the definition of the word “spine.” Moreover, the Superior Court found that the trial judge applied a correct definition of the word “spine” in concluding that appellee had no duty to provide coverage on appellant’s claim because of the policy exclusion for spinal injuries. Accordingly, the Superior Court reversed the post-trial judge’s award of a new trial and remanded the matter to the post-trial judge to consider the merits of the other issues raised in appellant’s post-trial motions that the post-trial judge had yet to consider. This Court granted allocatur in order to determine if the Superior Court erred in it application of the coordinate jurisdiction rule to this matter, and, if so, whether the term “spine” in the medical insurance policy exclusion included the disc problems appellant suffered from his October 18,1990 injury.</p>

The post-trial judge, however, made his ruling that the trial judge erred as a matter of law in defining the word spine during the post-trial motion process. Under the post-trial motion process, the judge considering the post-<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>trial motions can order a new trial pursuant to Rule 227.1(a)(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure if he concludes that a factual or legal mistake was made at the trial level and that on consideration of the particular circumstances of the case, the mistake (or mistakes) formed a sufficient basis to order a new trial. <em>Morrison v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, </em><a href="/citations/?q=588%20Pa.%20122" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="588 Pa. 122">588 Pa. 122</a>, 133, <a href="/a2d/646/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="646 A.2d 565" data-case-ids="12046928,475532" data-case-paths="/a2d/646/0565-01,/pa/538/0122-01">646 A.2d 565</a>, 571 (1994). Also, the fact that the trial in this case was a non-jury trial has no effect upon a party’s right to seek post-trial relief in the form of a new trial since the Note to Rule 227.1 provides that a motion for post-trial relief can be filed following a trial by a judge without a jury. <em>See </em>Pa. R. Civ. P. 129(e) (a note to a rale may be used in construing the rale). Moreover, the fact that a different judge considered the post-trial motions in this case does not affect a party’s ability to seek post-trial relief since as noted above, Rule 227.2 allows for the substitution of a judge on behalf of an unavailable trial judge, thereby placing the substituted judge in the same position as the trial judge. Based on these factors, we find that the post-trial motion process is a clearly distinct procedural posture from that of the trial judge rendering a verdict at the conclusion of a non-jury trial. Therefore, because the post-trial motion process is distinct procedurally from that of rendering a verdict following a non-jury trial and because the considerations of the judge are different at each procedural stage (rendering a verdict at the conclusion of trial versus correcting mistakes made during the earlier trial process), we hold that the coordinate jurisdiction rule does not apply to bar a substituted judge hearing post-trial motions from correcting a mistake made by the trial judge during the trial process. To hold otherwise and not allow a judge deciding post-trial motions to overrule legal errors made during the trial process (whether made by the reviewing judge or another judge who presided over the trial) would render the post-trial motion rales meaningless and the post-trial motion process would become nothing more than an exercise in futility. Accordingly, we hold that the Superior Court erred in ruling that the coordinate jurisdiction rule barred the post-trial judge from considering appellant’s post-trial motions and reversing the trial judge.</p>

The word spine is defined by Webster’s New World Dictionary (2nd Ed.) as “the spinal column; backbone.” A “backbone” is defined by Webster’s as “the column of bones along the center of the back of man and many animals made up of separate bones (vertebrae) connected by muscles and tendons.” The “vertebrae” is defined by Webster’s as “any of the single bones or segments of the spinal column, articulating in the higher vertebrates with those adjacent to it by means of elastic fibrous disks.” Based on these common definitions, we conclude that the natural, plain and ordinary meaning of the word “spine” in the exclusion provision of the medical insurance policy included appellant’s intervertebral discs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>The conclusion that the word “spine” in the exclusion provision of the medical insurance policy was intended to include appellant’s intervertebral discs is further supported by the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the policy. The spine exclusion was written into the policy based on appellant’s medical records which were examined by appellee before writing the policy. The x-ray report that appellee received concerning appellant showed that appellant had a disc problem on the date of his insurance application which appellant’s physician described as a “lumbar spine herniated disc.” Moreover, the insurance application which appellant signed and submitted to appellee, and on which the medical insurance policy states formed the basis of issuing the policy, expressly defined the “back/spine” to included “disc problems.”</p>
    <p id="AYs" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[188,1077,1154,580]]]'>Therefore, based on the natural, plain and ordinary meaning of the word spine, and the facts that indicate the policy exclusion in question was added because appellant’s medical records showed the existence of a disc problem, we find that the clear and unambiguous intent of the medical insurance policy was to exclude coverage for injuries that appellant may suffer to his intervertebral discs. Thus, we conclude that the Superior Court correctly reversed the order of a new trial because the post-trial judge erred as a matter of law in ruling that the trial judge made a mistake in interpreting the medical insurance policy at issue.</p>

However, because the Superior Court correctly determined that the post-trial judge erred as a matter of law in ruling that the trial judge made a mistake in concluding that the word “spine” contained in the exclusion provision of the insurance policy encompassed the intervertebral disc injury suffered by appellant, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>

This Court recognizes that Dorland's Medical Dictionary (23rd Ed.) defines the word "spine” as the "slender, thomlike process of bone." However, Dorland's is a specialized medical dictionary which should not apply to this interpretation of the medical insurance policy since a court’s duly in interpreting words - of a contract is to give the words a natural, plain and ordinary meaning. Moreover, other publications of a more technical nature support the view that the spine includes a person’s discs. As noted by the trial judge, The Attorney’s Textbook of Medicine states that: "[Ujnderstanding the normal surd pathologic <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>anatomy and physiology of the intervertebral disc requires an appreciation of the relationship between the disc and other structures and its role as part of the functional unit of the vertebral column.” IB Attorney’s Textbook of Medicine at 15-7. Moreover, The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide describes the spinal column as follows: "The spinal column or backbone, stretches from the base of the skull to the bottom of the buttocks. It consists of more than 30 separate bones called vertebrae. The vertebrae are linked by strong ligaments and flexible flattened discs.” American Medical Association Family Medical Guide at 557.</p>
