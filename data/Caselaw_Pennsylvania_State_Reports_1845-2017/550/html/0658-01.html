The claimants were employed by a manufacturer of lead-lined batteries which required daily exposure to the risks of lead handling.

We thus reasoned that the aggravation of the claimant’s pre-existing asthmatic condition was a compensable “injury”.</p>

      <em>Pawlosky </em>is unquestionably on point -with this matter: both the claimant in that matter and in the matter <em>sub judice </em>suffered from a pre-existing condition that was exacerbated by exposure to elements in the work place. This court in <em>Pawlosky </em>held that such exacerbation of the claimant’s pre-existing asthmatic condition was an “injury” within the meaning of the Act. So, too, should this court find that the exacerbation of Joseph Baxter’s pre-existing asthmatic condition is also an “injury”.</p>

Rather than grappling with that case which is on point with this matter, the majority, as the main support of its opinion, relies upon <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em><a href="/pa/537/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="537 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="775537" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0032-01">537 Pa. 32</a>, 36, <a href="/pa/537/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="640 A.2d 1266" data-case-ids="775537,7872209" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0032-01,/a2d/640/1266-01">640 A.2d 1266</a>, 1268 (1994). I find the reliance on <em>Republic Steel </em>to be questionable as that case was not concerned with the issue of whether the claimant had sustained an “injury” as defined by the Act—the issue which is presented in the matter <em>sub judice. </em>Rather, the crux of that case was a wholly different issue: whether the claimant’s loss of earnings was due to the injury he sustained. Since <em>Republic Steel </em>presented no rationale on the issue of what constitutes an injury, I believe that it does not advance the analysis of the matter presently before the court.</p>
