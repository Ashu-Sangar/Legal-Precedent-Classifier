Joyce’s physician eventually released him to light duty work subject to certain restrictions. A vocational counselor engaged by his employer notified him <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>of three suitable jobs. As to one of these, a dispatcher position at Trap Rock Concrete Company, the referral indicated that Joyce was to contact Mr. Bob Root. According to Joyce, he called Trap Rock three days after receiving the notification from the vocational counselor and asked to speak to Root. He was told that Root was not available, and that the job had been filled several weeks before and no applications were being taken. Joyce did nothing further with respect to this referral.</p>

The answer is yes. In fact, Joyce conceded the content of the inadmissible hearsay. He testified that he did not apply for the Trap Rock job after the person he spoke to on the phone told him that the job had been filled. Accordingly, the point of contention is not whether Joyce applied for the job (he acknowledged that he did not) but whether he made a good faith effort even though he did not apply for it.</p>

After eliciting Joyce’s testimony that he had done no more than make the phone call to Trap Rock and had simply submitted applications at the other two locations, without making any follow-up contacts, the employer’s counsel asked Joyce whether he thought he would have to do more in order to get a job.

The referee found the claimant’s testimony to be less than completely credible, and, thus, that the claimant did not act in good faith. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court determined that because the referee made no specific <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>findings on whether the claimant followed through on the job referrals at issue, the court was unable to effectuate its appellate review to determine whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence and correct as a matter of law. Thus, because essential findings of fact were never made by the referee, the court vacated the order of the board and remanded for the making of additional findings on the good faith issue.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[261,763,1160,204]]]'>The reasoning and conclusion reached in <em>McCray </em>is equally applicable to the matter <em>sub judice. </em>It is clear to me that the appropriate disposition of this matter is to remand for specific findings regarding the issue of good faith.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[257,994,1165,635]]]'>The majority, itself obviously unconvinced that the finding regarding Mr. Joyce’s “admission” serves as a proper basis for a determination of a lack of good faith, turns to arguments made by the employer at each level of appeal in search of further support for the referee’s decision. First, the majority offers the employer’s argument that Mr. Joyce waited an unreasonable amount of time after receiving notice of the referrals, three days, to contact the prospective employers; and second, that Mr. Joyce made no effort to speak with Mr. Bob Root, the individual whom he was instructed to contact regarding a dispatcher position at Trap Rock Concrete Company.</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[255,1656,1163,367]]]'>Again, I must emphasize that these arguments relied upon by the majority are purely speculative as the referee never embodied either of these employer bases in his decision. The referee never found that waiting a mere three days before contacting an employer was unreasonable and never found that Mr. Joyce failed to exercise good faith in his pursuit of the Trap Rock position.</p>

Seeking a position within a mere three days constitutes reasonable promptness in seeking employment. <em>Vinglas v. W.C.A.B.

    <p id="b517-4" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[185,423,1152,477]]]'>Likewise, with respect to the Trap Rock position, the claimant clearly made a good faith effort to secure employment. The referral for the Trap Rock position indicated that Mr. Joyce was to contact a Mr. Bob Root. Mr. Joyce testified that he telephoned Trap Rock after receiving the notification of the position and asked to speak to Mr. Root. Mr. Joyce stated that he was told by an individual named “Tony” that Mr. Root was not available, that the position had been filled several weeks earlier, and that no applications were being taken.</p>
    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[186,926,1153,587]]]'>While the employer argued that Mr. Joyce made no effort to speak with Mr. Root, or more accurately, made no second attempt to communicate with Mr. Root, and the majority embraces this argument, it is beyond me what more the claimant should have, or could have, done. Should the claimant have insisted on speaking with Mr. Root after being told that he was unavailable? Should he have gone to the work site and demanded to speak with Mr. Root? Should he have submitted a written application even after being told by a company representative that there were no open positions and that applications were not being accepted?</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.6",517,[185,1539,1155,581]]]'>Obviously, the answer to each question is in the negative. This is not a case where the employer’s representative was vague or lacking in knowledge about a position, and, thus, a case in which further inquiry by the claimant would have been necessary to fulfill the requirement of making a good faith attempt to secure the position. Rather, Mr. Joyce testified that he received a specific response that his employer contact was unavailable, that the position was filled and that no applications were being accepted. On these facts, I believe that the claimant had done all that can be reasonably required to establish a good faith attempt to secure employment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

If the referee had rejected the claimant’s testimony that he had telephoned Trap Rock as incredible, then affirming the modification would be the correct resolution of this matter. However, no such credibility determination was made in this case; the referee did not reject Mr. Joyce’s testimony <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>regarding the Trap Rock position. Arguably, by relying on "claimant’s own admission ...,” the referee actually credited Mr. Joyce’s testimony. Thus, the referee’s failure to make specific findings, and mere speculation by the majority as to what the referee could have relied upon, precludes a conclusion that the substantial evidence supports a finding of a lack of good faith. The majority’s efforts to affirm such a finding stretches the confines of our appellate review to the breaking point.</p>
