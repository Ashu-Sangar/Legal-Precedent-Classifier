    <p id="b622-7" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[265,590,1162,780]]]'>Henry claims that he did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing from the PCRA court. Specifically, he claims that the PCRA court erred in denying his request to call Dr. Dennis Asen and Dr. Isidore Mihalakis as defense witnesses. At trial, Dr. Asen testified as a bite-mark expert for the Commonwealth and Dr. Mihalakis testified as an expert pathologist for the Commonwealth. Henry attempted to call these witnesses at the PCRA hearing to demonstrate that their testimony at trial was “false, baseless and misleading,” and should have been “excluded or devastatingly impeached at trial----” Brief of Appellant at 16. Thus, Henry called these witnesses for the purpose of challenging the admissibility and credibility of their trial testimony. He asks our Court to remand this case to the PCRA court so his counsel can examine Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis. We decline to do so.</p>

Therefore, Henry’s challenges to the admissibility of the trial testimony of Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis are not cognizable under the PCRA because they were previously litigated. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3); 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(2). Additionally, to the extent that Henry sought to examine Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis to demonstrate that trial counsel’s cross-examination of these witnesses was ineffective, the PCRA court did not err in precluding the testimony. The admissibility of evidence is vested in the sound discretion of the hearing court and an appellate court may reverse only where there is an abuse of that discretion. <em>Commonwealth v. Claypool, </em><a href="/pa/508/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="508 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1794061" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0198-01">508 Pa. 198</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="508 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1794061" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0198-01">495 A.2d 176</a> (1985). The PCRA court heard four days of testimony and permitted Henry to present many witnesses, including Dr. Norman Sperber, who rebutted the trial testimony of Dr. Asen, and Dr. Jonathan Arden, who rebutted the trial testimony of Dr. Mihalakis. The testimony of Dr. Sperber and Dr. Arden provided the PCRA court with sufficient information to evaluate Henry’s claim of ineffectiveness, and we find no abuse of discretion in the PCRA court’s decision to preclude the examinations of Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis. <em>Claypool.</em>

The PCRA court also rejected counsel’s claim that inclement weather prohibited Dr. Whyte’s attendance, noting that numerous other witnesses from out-of-state could attend the hearing. Moreover, it does not appear that Dr. Whyte’s testimony would have been significantly different from Dr. Crown’s testimony. Henry’s own counsel characterized Dr. Whyte’s conclusions as “similar to those of Doctor Crown”, and stated that Dr. Whyte “may be deemed by the court to be redundant.” Notes of Testimony, January 18, 1996 at 185, 191.

However, in an affidavit attached to Henry’s PCRA petition, Brunson recanted his trial testimony.

First, we note that the delay in obtaining an expert willing to support Henry’s insanity defense was not due to counsel’s indolence. To the contrary, counsel timely consulted two well-recognized experts, neither of whom found Henry insane. We cannot fault counsel simply because the experts he retained did not reach the conclusions his client wanted. Even though counsel obtained Dr. O’Brien’s services after the court’s discovery deadline, Henry suffered no prejudice from the discovery violation because the trial court permitted Dr. O’Brien to testify. Moreover, though counsel did not have the benefit of expert reports from Dr. Kool and Mr. Levitt to aid his presentation of Dr. O’Brien’s testimony concerning Henry’s ability to form a specific intent to kill, counsel was able to cross-examine both of these witnesses effectively. Considering the difficulty counsel faced in obtaining an expert to testify favorably for his client, we conclude that counsel provided effective assistance under the circumstances here.</p>
