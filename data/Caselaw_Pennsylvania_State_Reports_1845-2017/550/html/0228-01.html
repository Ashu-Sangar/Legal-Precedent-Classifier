    <p id="b493-7" data-blocks='[["BL_493.7",493,[184,709,1154,469]]]'>Subsequent to our having noted probable jurisdiction in this case to review the Commonwealth Court’s denial of a request for a preliminary injunction, the Commonwealth Court sustained appellees’ preliminary objections with the result that subject matter jurisdiction was held to be lacking and the case was transferred to the court of common pleas. The request by appellants that we nevertheless proceed with review by exercising discretionary jurisdiction is denied. Appeal dismissed.</p>
