        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (PennDOT) appeals from an Order of the Commonwealth Court that affirmed an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court) sustaining David J. Sullivan\u2019s (Sullivan) statutory appeal of a one-year license suspension imposed pursuant to Section 1532(b)(8) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(b)(3). We granted allocatur to decide the issue of whether, at the time of Sullivan\u2019s license suspension, Penn-DOT had the authority to suspend a driver\u2019s license based on an out-of-state conviction pursuant to the Driver License Compact of 1961 (Compact). Because we conclude that, at the relevant time, the Commonwealth had not enacted the Compact into law, we affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe Compact is a contractual agreement among states intended to promote compliance with each party state\u2019s driving laws and regulations. Besides Pennsylvania, the Compact has thirty-nine party jurisdictions (thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia), each of which has enacted the Compact into law by statute.\nArticle III of the Compact provides that, \u201c[t]he licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction [for an offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle] of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee.\u201d Pursuant to Article IV(1) of the Compact:\nThe licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation, or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state, in the case of convictions for:\n(a) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle;\n(b) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or a narcotic to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;\n(c) Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle was used; or\n(d) Failure to stop and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another.\nOn March 28, 1995, Sullivan, a resident and licensed driver of Pennsylvania, was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in Nebraska, which is a party to the Compact. Pursuant to the Compact, Nebraska reported Sullivan\u2019s conviction to PennDOT. By notice dated May 25,1995, PennDOT informed Sullivan that his conviction for DUI in Nebraska was equivalent to a violation of Section 3731 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731, and, accordingly, PennDOT was suspending his license for one year pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(b)(3). The notice, however, made no reference to the Compact.\nSullivan appealed to the trial court, arguing, inter alia, that he had not been convicted of a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731, and that PennDOT had no authority to suspend his license based on an out-of-state conviction. At the hearing on September 20, 1995, PennDOT for the first time cited the Compact as authority for its suspension of Sullivan\u2019s license. PennDOT\u2019s attorney mistakenly identified the Compact as the \u201cInterstate Compact Act\u201d, and cited to Pennsylvania Bulletin Volume 24, Number 45 (November 5, 1994). He argued that:\nunder Article 4 of that compact, the effect of a conviction of DUI reported to the department, the licensing authority in the home state, that is Pennsylvania, shall give such effect to the conduct as provided by the laws in the home state. Under the laws of Pennsylvania, under Section 1582(b), when a person is convicted of Section 3731 of the Motor Vehicle Code, it is a one year suspension.\nR.R. at 9a-10a. Although Sullivan\u2019s counsel did not address the issue of whether the Compact was effective as to the Commonwealth, he did argue that PennDOT improperly failed to notify Sullivan that the suspension of his license was based on the Compact. The trial court sustained Sullivan\u2019s appeal, and PennDOT appealed to the Commonwealth Court.\nThe Commonwealth Court considered Article VIII of the Compact, which provides as follows:\n(1) This compact shall enter into force and become effective as to any state when it has enacted the same into law.\n(2) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same____\nThe court concluded that the Commonwealth had not \u201cenacted [the Compact] into law\u201d as required by Article VIII(l), and, therefore, PennDOT lacked the authority to suspend Sullivan\u2019s license based on his conviction in Nebraska.\nDISCUSSION\nOn appeal to this Court, PennDOT first argues that the Commonwealth Court should not have addressed the issue of whether the Commonwealth enacted the Compact into law, because Sullivan did not raise it in the trial court. In the first instance, PennDOT overlooks the fact that, until the September 20, 1995 hearing, it had not notified Sullivan that it was relying on the Compact for authority to suspend his license. Moreover, the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be raised on appeal applies only to appellants, not to appellees. See Commonwealth v. Katze, 540 Pa. 416, 658 A.2d 345 (1995) (plurality opinion); Sherwood v. Elgart, 383 Pa. 110, 117 A.2d 899 (1955). As an appellee, Sullivan was not precluded from raising in the Commonwealth Court the issue of whether the Compact had been enacted into law.\nPennDOT next argues that the Commonwealth did enact the Compact into law pursuant to Section 6146 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6146, which provides as follows:\nThe secretary may enter into agreements relating to the enforcement of this title, including, but not limited to:\n(1) the Driver License Compact and any other agreements to notify any state of violations incurred by residents of that state....\nAccording to PennDOT, the Secretary\u2019s exercising the authority conferred upon him by 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6146(1) is sufficient to constitute enactment of the Compact into law. We regretfully disagree.\nThe Compact is a contract between states. Accordingly, we are bound to interpret its terms according to their plain meaning. See, e.g., Steuart v. McChesney, 498 Pa. 45, 444 A.2d 659 (1982). Furthermore, this Court will not rewrite the terms of a contract, nor give them a meaning that conflicts with that of the language used. Id., at 50-51, 444 A.2d at 662 (quoting Robert F. Felte, Inc. v. White, 451 Pa. 137, 144, 302 A.2d 347, 351 (1973) (quoting Hagarty v. William Akers, Jr. Co., Inc., 342 Pa. 236, 239, 20 A.2d 317, 319 (1941))). Pursuant to Article VIII(l) of the Compact, its provisions \u201center into force and become effective as to any state when it has enacted the [Compact] into law.\u201d In the context of law making, the plain meaning of the term \u201cenactment\u201d is \u201c[t]he method or process by which a bill in the Legislature becomes a law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 526 (6th ed. 1990).\nThe language of Article VIII(2) of the Compact supports this interpretation. It provides that, \u201c[a]ny party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same----\u201d If the passage of a statute were not also required for entry into the Compact, the withdrawal provision of Article VIII(2) would be incongruously burdensome. We cannot conclude that the Compact\u2019s drafters intended such a disparity between entry into and withdrawal from the Compact, nor are we empowered to give the terms of the contract a meaning inconsistent with the drafters\u2019 clear intent. See, e.g., Steuart, 498 Pa. at 48-49, 444 A.2d at 661; Felte, 451 Pa. at 143-44, 302 A.2d at 351. Thus, we hold that the Compact becomes effective as to the Commonwealth only when the Legislature passes a statute adopting it. Any other construction would impermissibly strain the language of the contract beyond its plain meaning.\nNotwithstanding the Compact\u2019s express language, PennDOT argues that, in passing Section 6146 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6146, the Legislature properly delegated to the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) the authority to enter into the Compact. Overall, the Legislature may delegate policy making authority to an administrative agency, so long as the Legislature makes the \u201cbasic policy choices\u201d and establishes \u201cadequate standards which will guide and restrain the exercise of the delegated administrative functions.\u201d Gilligan v. Pennsylvania Horse Racing Commission, 492 Pa. 92, 96, 422 A.2d 487, 489 (1980) (citing William Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269 (1975); Chartiers Valley Joint Schools v. County Board of School Directors of Allegheny County, 418 Pa. 520, 211 A.2d 487 (1965); Belovsky v. Redevelopment Authority of the City of Philadelphia, 357 Pa. 329, 54 A.2d 277 (1947)). Here, PennDOT asserts that Section 6141 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6141, evinces the Legislature\u2019s basic policy choice to participate in interstate agreements regarding the regulation of drivers, and that Section 6146 adequately limits the Secretary\u2019s discretion in entering into such agreements, e.g., by specifically referring to the Compact. Thus, PennDOT concludes, by delegating to the Secretary the authority to enter into the Compact, the Legislature obviated the need to pass a statute enacting the Compact into law.\nPennDOT\u2019s argument is unavailing, however, because it conflicts with the separation of powers mandated by the Pennsylvania Constitution. Article II, Section 1 provides that, \u201c[t]he legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives;\u201d and Article III, Section 1 provides that, \u201c[n]o law shall be passed except by bill----\u201d In light of these constitutional provisions, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot constitutionally delegate the power to make law to any other branch of government or to any other body or authority.\u201d Gilligan, 492 Pa. at 95, 422 A.2d at 489 (citing State Board of Chiropractic Examiners v. Life Fellowship of Pennsylvania, 441 Pa. 293, 272 A.2d 478 (1971)).\nIn Ruch v. Wilhelm, 352 Pa. 586, 43 A.2d 894 (1945), this Court held that the power of \u201csubstantive enactment\u201d is vested in the Legislature alone. Thus, the Court determined that, \u201c[a]uthority may be given to a government official or an administrative agency to make rules and regulations to cover mere matters of detail for the implementation of a statute, but where the statute itself is lacking in essential substantive provisions the law does not permit a transfer of the power to supply them, for the legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law.\u201d Id., at 592-93, 43 A.2d at 897.\nIn this case, we view 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6146(1) merely as a delegation of authority to implement the mechanics of the Compact in the Commonwealth. Pursuant to the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, however, the Legislature could not. delegate to the Secretary the power to enact the Compact into law as required by its terms. Thus, while not unconstitutional, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6146(1) is insufficient to render the Compact effective as to the Commonwealth.\nIndeed, the Legislature seemed to concede as much in passing Act No. 1996-149 (Act). Although the Secretary had purported to enter into the Compact effective January 1, 1995, on December 10, 1996, the Legislature passed the Act, which, inter alia, added Section 1581 to the Vehicle Code. That section sets forth the full text of the Compact and provides that, \u201c[t]he Driver\u2019s License Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein----\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581 (emphasis added). Had the Compact been enacted into law previously, the addition of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581 would have been unnecessary. Thus, in enacting 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581, the Legislature anticipated our holding that the delegation of authority to the Secretary pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6146 was insufficient to effectuate the Commonwealth\u2019s entry into the Compact, and that a statute enacting the Compact into law would be necessary.\nIn this case, however, PennDOT suspended Sullivan\u2019s license more than a year before the Legislature enacted the Compact into law pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581. Consequently, PennDOT lacked the authority to suspend Sullivan\u2019s license based on his out-of-state DUI conviction. The Order of the Commonwealth Court is therefore affirmed.\n. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(b)(3) provides in part that:\n[PennDOT] shall suspend the operating privilege of any driver for 12 months upon receiving a certified record of the driver's conviction of section 3731 (relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance) or 3733 (relating to fleeing or attempting to elude police officer) or an adjudication of delinquency based on section 3731 or 3733....\n.

In its brief, PennDOT makes reference to Pa.R.A.P. 1551, which governs the scope of review of quasijudicial orders. Rule 1551 provides, in part, that, \"[n]o question shall be heard or considered by the court which was not raised before the government unit except: (1) Questions involving the validity of a statute....\u201d Although the question of whether the Commonwealth enacted the Compact into law involves the effect of Section 6146 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6146, that statute\u2019s validity is not at issue. Accordingly, Rule 1551(a)(1) is inapplicable.\n. Pursuant to Section 6152 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6152, agreements entered into by the Secretary must be published in compliance with Part II of Title 45. In the Commonwealth Court, Sullivan argued that PennDOT's published notice failed to comply with those requirements, in that the notice contained only a synopsis of the Compact and not the full text. However, because we conclude that enactment of the Compact into law requires the passage of a statute by the Legislature, we do not address the adequacy of the published notice.\n. Section 6141 of the Vehicle Code, entitled \"Declaration of policy\u201d, provides that:\nIt is the policy of this Commonwealth to promote and encourage the fullest possible use of its highway system by authorizing the making and execution of reciprocal agreements, arrangements and declarations with other states, provinces, territories and countries with respect to drivers licensed and vehicles registered in this and other states, provinces, territories and countries, thus contributing to the economic and social development and growth of this Commonwealth.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6141.\n. Note that the language of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581 comports with other Pennsylvania statutes pursuant to which various interstate compacts and agreements have been enacted into law. See, e.g., 3 P.S. \u00a7 214-41 (enacting Pest Control Compact); 24 P.S. \u00a7 2401.1 (enacting Interstate Agreement on Qualifications of Educational Personnel); 24 P.S. \u00a7 5401 (enacting Compact for Education); 32 P.S. \u00a7 816.1 (enacting Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Compact); 32 P.S. \u00a7 817.1 (enacting Great Lakes Basin Compact); 35 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7111 (enacting Interstate Civil Defense and Disaster Compact); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9101 (enacting Agreement on Detainers); 61 P.S. \u00a7 1062 (enacting Interstate Corrections Compact).",
