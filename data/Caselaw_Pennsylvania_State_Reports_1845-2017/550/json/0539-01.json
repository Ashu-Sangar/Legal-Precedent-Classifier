        "text": "OPINION\nNIGRO, Justice.\nAppellee Fred Mickle was injured while a passenger in a City of Philadelphia vehicle. Mickle sued the City of Philadelphia for damages. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment as to whether the City is immune from liability. The lower courts found that the City is not immune from suit because Mickle\u2019s claims fall within the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity. The Commonwealth Court thus affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Mickle. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nOn February 14, 1990, Mickle experienced chest pains and went to a City of Philadelphia fire station for help. A firefighter decided to drive Mickle to the hospital in a City fire rescue van. On the way to the hospital, the van\u2019s left rear wheels came off. Mickle sustained serious injuries.\nMickle sued the City of Philadelphia alleging that its negligence caused the accident. Mickle averred that the City, among other things, failed to maintain and inspect the van, allowed its motor vehicle to be driven in a defective and dangerous condition, operated its motor vehicle without properly installed wheels, and drove it in a negligent manner. Complaint, paragraph 9.\nAfter discovery, the parties stipulated to the following facts:\n5. There was nothing negligent about the manner in which the firefighter actually drove/operated the fire rescue vehicle in which plaintiff was a passenger on February 14, 1990.\n6. The City of Philadelphia was responsible for the maintenance and repair of the fire rescue vehicle in which the plaintiff was a passenger on February 14,1990.\n7. On February 14, 1990, while the plaintiff was a passenger in a fire rescue vehicle which was in operation and being driven by the agent of defendant, the City of Philadelphia, the left rear dual wheels of said vehicle came off, causing injuries to the plaintiff.\n8. The cause of the rear wheels coming off the fire rescue vehicle was negligent maintenance and repair of said vehicle by the City of Philadelphia.\n9. The value of plaintiffs pain and suffering is $80,-000.00....\n11. The maximum amount of personal injury protection for which the City of Philadelphia, a self-insured entity, may be liable to plaintiff is $10,000.00.\nSee Trial Ct. Opinion, Appendix A (Stipulation of Facts).\nThe City moved for summary judgment asserting immunity from suit under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8541. Mickle filed a cross-motion for summary judgment asserting that the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity applies.\nSummary judgment is warranted where there is no genuine issue of any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Pa. R. Civ. P. 1035, Finding the facts undisputed, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Mickle and held that the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity applies. While acknowledging that the firefighter did not drive in a negligent manner, the court found that Mickle\u2019s injuries are causally related to the movement or operation of the City vehicle and as such, fall under the exception. The Commonwealth Court affirmed.\nLocal agencies are immune from tort liability except as otherwise provided in the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act. 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8541. The Act provides:\n(a) Liability imposed.\u2014A local agency shall be liable for damages on account of an injury to a person or property ... if both of the following conditions are satisfied and the injury occurs as a result of one of the acts set forth in subsection (b):\n(1) The damage would be recoverable under common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person not having an available defense under section 8541 (relating to government immunity generally) ... and\n(2) The injury was caused by the negligent acts of the local agency or an employee thereof acting within the scope of his office or duties with respect to one of the categories listed in subsection (b)____\n(b) Acts which may impose liability.\u2014The following acts by a local agency or any of its employees may result in the imposition of liability on a local agency:\n(1) Vehicle liability.\u2014The operation of any motor vehicle in the possession or control of the local agency____\n42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8542(a),(b)(l)(emphasis added). The issue raised here is whether Mickle\u2019s claims fall within the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, or in other words, was Mickle\u2019s injury caused by the City\u2019s negligent acts with respect to the operation of a motor vehicle.\nThe parties stipulated that a City vehicle was in operation and being driven by a City agent when Mickle was injured. Stipulation of Fact No. 7. Thus, the lower courts\u2019 conclusion that the exception applies is consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in Love v. City of Philadelphia, 518 Pa. 370, 375, 543 A.2d 531, 533 (1988), which held that \u201coperation,\u201d for purposes of the motor vehicle exception, means putting a vehicle in motion.\nSince there is no dispute that the van was in operation at the time of the accident as required by Love, we must determine whether Mickle\u2019s injury was caused by the City\u2019s negligent acts with respect to the van\u2019s operation. The City argues that there was no such negligent act because it is undisputed that the firefighter did not drive the van in a negligent manner..\nNegligence related to the operation of a vehicle encompasses not only how a person drives but also whether he should be driving a particular vehicle in the first place. The motor vehicle exception does not say that liability may be imposed only where the operator\u2019s manner of driving is negligent. Rather, it requires that the injury is caused by a negligent act with respect to the operation of a motor vehicle. 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8542(a),(b)(1).\nThe parties stipulated that Mickle\u2019s injuries were caused by the wheels falling off the fire van while it was in operation. Stipulation of Fact No. 7. They further stipulated that the cause of the rear wheels coming off was the City\u2019s negligent maintenance and repair of the vehicle. Stipulation of Fact No. 8. Under these facts, we find that the City engaged in acts of negligence with respect to the operation of a motor vehicle and that the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity applies. Thus, the decision of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nCASTILLE, J., files a dissenting opinion in which FLAHERTY, C.J., joins.\n. Effective July 1, 1996, Rule 1035 was replaced by Rules of Civil Procedure 1035.1 through 1035.5. The new rules do not apply to this case.\n. In Love, the plaintiff required help boarding and exiting a City-owned van that transported her to an adult center run by the City. The driver typically parked the van, placed a portable step at its door, and assisted the plaintiff in and out. The plaintiff fell one afternoon when exiting the van. The Court held that the City was immune from suit because the van was not in motion and thus not in operation when the plaintiff was injured. Id.\n. Similarly, the government is not immune if a plaintiff can establish that an injury was caused by a negligent act \"with respect to\" other enumerated exceptions. For example, under 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8542(b)(4), the government may be liable for a negligent act with respect to a dangerous condition of trees, traffic controls and street lighting. Suits under this section have often involved negligent maintenance. See, e.g., Dep\u2019t of Transportation v. Patton, 546 Pa. 562, 686 A.2d 1302 (1997) (plaintiff allegedly injured by limb of tree that fell on her car due to decay). In addition, we find that dicta in Love, 518 Pa. at 375, 543 A.2d at 533, recognizing the legislature's use of the word \"operation\u201d under the Act as compared to the words \"maintenance and use\u201d used under a now-repealed section of the No-Fault Act, does not require a contrary result.",

        "text": "CASTILLE, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe majority holds that the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity applies and allows a plaintiff to recover damages from a political subdivision like the City of Philadelphia (the \u201cCity\u201d) even though the parties stipulated that it was the City\u2019s negligent maintenance and repair of a vehicle rather than the negligent operation of the vehicle which caused the accident that resulted in the plaintiffs injuries. Because I believe that the majority has ignored the tenets established by this Court for determining whether an exception to governmental immunity applies, I must dissent.\nGenerally, since local agencies are performing a public service, they are immune from tort liability. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8541. As noted by the majority, an injured party can recover from a political subdivision despite the doctrine of governmental immunity if he can demonstrate that: (1) the damages claimed would have been recoverable under common law; (2) the injury was caused by the negligent acts of the local agency or an employee thereof acting within the scope of his official duties; and (3) his injuries occurred as a result of one of the specific acts listed in Section 8542(b) of the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b). The specific act listed in Section 8542(b) that appellee contends waives immunity in this case is known as the motor vehicle exception, which provides that liability may result from \u201c[t]he operation of any motor vehicle in the possession or control of the local agency.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(1) (Vehicle liability).\nThe determination of whether the negligent maintenance of a vehicle constitutes the \u201coperation\u201d of the vehicle under the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity is one of statutory interpretation since the word \u201coperation\u201d is neither defined in this provision nor in the general definition section of the consolidated statutes. In reviewing whether an exception to governmental immunity applies, this Court is constrained to narrowly construe the term \u201coperation\u201d since the legislature has expressed a clear intent to insulate political subdivisions from tort liability. Love v. City of Philadelphia, 518 Pa. 370, 374, 543 A.2d 531, 532 (1988).\nIn Love, this Court examined the meaning of the word \u201coperation\u201d as it is used in the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(1). In that case, this Court rejected the argument that the \u201coperation\u201d of a motor vehicle under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act was the same as the \u201cmaintenance and use of a motor vehicle\u201d as used in the Pennsylvania No-Fault Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103. In doing so, this Court noted that:\nThe General Assembly recognized a distinction between the term \u201coperation\u201d and the phrase \u201cmaintenance and use\u201d since it carefully chose one term in one context but not in the other ... Thus, the term \u201coperates\u201d must have been intended to mean something other that the \u201cmaintenance and use.\u201d\nLove, 518 Pa. at 375, 543 A.2d at 533. Instead, this Court, after perusing various dictionaries for guidance on the meaning of the word \u201coperation,\u201d held that:\n[T]o operate something means to actually put in it motion. Merely preparing to operate a vehicle, or acts taken at the cessation of operating a vehicle are not the same as actually operating that vehicle. Thus, according to the common and approved usage of the word \u201coperation,\u201d the van was not in operation at the time of Mrs. Love\u2019s accident. Getting into or alighting from a vehicle are merely acts ancillary to the actual operation of that vehicle.\nLove, 518 Pa. at 375, 543 A.2d at 533.\nThe majority, purporting to follow Love, holds that the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity applies because the showing of negligence required by Section 8542(a)(2) requires only that a plaintiffs injuries occurred while the vehicle was in motion, even though the movement of the vehicle was not the direct cause of the accident. Because I believe that Love requires a more narrow reading of the immunity exception as it relates to the facts of this case, I disagree.\nIn order to be entitled to one of the specific exceptions listed in Section 8542(b) of the Political Subdivision Tort \u2022Claims Act, Section 8542(a) requires that the injured party demonstrate that \u201c[t]he injury was caused by the negligent acts of the local agency or an employee thereof acting within the scope of his office or duties with respect to one of the categories listed in subsection (b)\u201d (i.e., Section 8542(b)). When interpreting this provision narrowly, I believe that the plain meaning of this provision is that the waiver of governmental immunity will be triggered only if the plaintiffs injuries were caused by a negligent act explicitly listed as an exception in Section 8542(b). 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) (court must give effect to plain meaning of statute when words of statute are clear and free of all ambiguity). Here, it is not disputed that the parties stipulated that the vehicle was moving when the accident occurred. It is also not disputed that the City and appellee stipulated that the cause of appellee\u2019s injuries was the negligent maintenance and repair of the vehicle by the City. Thus, if the majority had properly adhered to the holding of Love requiring that exceptions to immunity provisions be narrowly construed, it would have determined that appellee could only have been entitled to a waiver of immunity if the negligent maintenance of the fire rescue vehicle could be viewed as the negligent \u201coperation\u201d of that vehicle.\nAs noted above, Love defined \u201coperation\u201d for purposes of the motor vehicle exception as involving the movement of the vehicle. The word \u201cmaintenance,\u201d however, is not defined by statute. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the word \u201cmaintain\u201d as follows:\nThe term is variously defined as acts of repairs and other acts to prevent a decline, lapse or cessation from existing state or condition; ... hold or preserve in any particular state or condition; keep from change; keep from falling, declining, or ceasing; keep in existence or continuance; keep in force; keep in good order; keep in proper condition; keep in repair.\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary, p. 953 (6th Ed.). A similar definition is found in Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary where maintenance is defined as \u201ca maintaining or being maintained; upkeep, support, defense, etc.; specif., the work of keeping a building, machinery, etc. in a state of good repair.\u201d W,ebster\u2019s New World Dictionary, p. 854 (2nd Ed.). From these common definitions, it is evident that the maintenance of a vehicle does not constitute the \u201coperation\u201d of a vehicle as set forth by this Court in Love. Thus, an injury caused by the negligent maintenance of a vehicle does not fall within the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity.\nTherefore, since the negligent act which caused appellee\u2019s injury was the negligent maintenance of the vehicle, I believe that appellee\u2019s claim does not fall within the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity. Thus, unlike the majority, I believe that the law, as provided by this Court in Love, mandated that summary judgment should have been entered in favor of the City since the City should have been found to be immune from suit in this case.\nI also dissent because I cannot help but believe that the majority\u2019s decision eroding the concept of governmental immunity is driven by the need to provide an injured plaintiff with a remedy for his injuries. Like the majority, I believe that it is tragic that appellee in this case suffered an injury caused by the negligent maintenance, not negligent operation, of a City fire rescue vehicle. However, as Justice McDermott so eloquently stated in Love:\nIn summary, we wish to emphasize that the issue here is not whether one may be tortiously injured entering or alighting from a stopped vehicle. Rather, the issue is the confining question of whether a political subdivision is immunized from suit when one is so injured, notwithstanding what may be the actual tort of their employees. The legislature, for reasons of policy, reasons of policy we are not entitled to dilute for sympathy or even outrage at specific instances of blatant tort, has decided that such an immunity does exist, and we must abide, sometimes leaving dreadful injuries, negligently inflicted, uncompensated. The judicial concept that where there is a wrong there must be a right often depends on the wisdom and large responsibility of the legislature. What rights for what wrongs are generally their prerogative and apportioned in the exercise of their many responsibilities and competing needs. Their task, like ours, is never easy. However, it is our duty to respect and enforce their judgment, even with heavy hearts in particular instances.\nLove, 518 Pa. at 375-76, 543 A.2d at 533.\nAccordingly, for the reasons expressed above, I dissent.\nFLAHERTY, C.J., joins this dissenting opinion.\n. Section 8541 provides that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no local agency shall be liable for any damages on account of any injury to a person or property caused by any act of the local agency or any employee thereof or any other persons.\u201d\n. The Pennsylvania No-Fault Act was repealed by the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law of February 12, 1984, P.L. 26, effective October 1, 1984.\n. Courts often use dictionaries as source material when determining the common and approved usage of a word not defined by statute in order to effectuate the tenet of statutory construction that words and phrase not otherwise defined in the statute must be construed in accordance with the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903.",
