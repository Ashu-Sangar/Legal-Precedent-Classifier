        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the order of the Superior Court reversing the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of third-party defendant United States Healthcare Systems of Pennsylvania, Inc. (\u201cU.S. Healthcare\u201d). The issue on which this court granted allocatur is whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. 1001, et seq., preempts the state tort law claims brought against U.S. Healthcare. For reasons which differ from those relied upon by the Superior Court, we find that ERISA does not preempt these claims. We therefore affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nAt 11:00 a.m. on May 21, 1991, Basile Pappas (\u201cPappas\u201d) was admitted to Haverford Community Hospital (\u201cHaverford\u201d) through its emergency room complaining of paralysis and numbness in his extremities. At the time of his admission, Pappas was an insured of HMO-PA, a health maintenance organization operated by U.S. Healthcare.\nDr. Stephen Dickter, the emergency room physician, concluded that Pappas was suffering from an epidural abscess which was pressing on Pappas\u2019 spinal column. Dr. Dickter consulted with a neurologist and a neurosurgeon; the physicians concurred that Pappas\u2019 condition constituted a neurological emergency. Given the circumstances, Dr. Dickter felt that it was in Pappas\u2019 best interests to receive treatment at a university hospital.\nDr. Dickter made arrangements to transfer Pappas to Jefferson University Hospital (\u201cJefferson\u201d) for further treatment. At approximately 12:40 p.m. when the ambulance arrived, Dr. Dickter was alerted to the fact that U.S. Healthcare was denying authorization for treatment at Jefferson. Ten minutes later, Dr. Dickter contacted U.S. Healthcare to obtain authorization for the transfer to Jefferson. At 1:15 p.m., U.S. Healthcare responded to Dr. Dickter\u2019s inquiry and advised him that authorization for treatment at Jefferson was still being denied, but that Pappas could be transferred to either Hahnemann University (\u201cHahnemann\u201d), Temple University or Medical College of Pennsylvania (\u201cMCP\u201d).\nDr. Dickter immediately contacted Hahnemann. That facility advised Haverford at approximately 2:20 p.m. that it would not have information on its ability to receive Pappas for at least another half hour. MCP was then reached and within minutes it agreed to accept Pappas; Pappas was ultimately transported there at 3:30 p.m. Pappas now suffers from permanent quadriplegia resulting from compression of his spine by the abscess.\nPappas and his wife filed suit against Dr. David Asbel, his primary care physician, and Haverford. They claimed that Dr. Asbel had committed medical malpractice and that Haverford was negligent in causing an inordinate delay in transferring him to a facility equipped and immediately available to handle his neurological emergency.\nHaverford then filed a third party complaint against U.S. Healthcare, joining it as a party defendant for its refusal to authorize the transfer of Pappas to a hospital selected by the Haverford physicians. Dr. Asbel also filed a cross-claim against U.S. Healthcare seeking contribution and indemnity.\nU.S. Healthcare filed a motion for summary judgment on all of the third party claims, alleging that the third party claims are preempted by \u00a7 1144(a) of ERISA. The trial court granted the motion. The Superior Court on appeal, however, determined that ERISA did not preempt the state law claims. This court subsequently granted U.S. Healthcare\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal in order to determine whether these third party claims fall within the scope of those state actions which are preempted by ERISA.\nIn reviewing whether a trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment was appropriate, we view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party. Pennsylvania State University v. County of Centre, 532 Pa. 142, 144-145, 615 A.2d 303, 304 (1992). Only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and it is clear that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law will summary judgment be entered. Skipworth v. Lead Industries Assoc., Inc., 547 Pa. 224, 230, 690 A.2d 169, 171 (1997). As the issue presented in this case is one of law, our scope of review is plenary. See Phillips v. A-BEST Products Co., 542 Pa. 124, 130, 665 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1995).\nOur analysis begins with a review of the basic principles of preemption law. The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that the laws of the federal government \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land; ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. It is this clause which gives to the United States Congress power to preempt state law.\nIn deterniining whether state law is preempted by a federal law, a reviewing court is cautioned that such a review \u201cstart[s] with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by ... Federal Act unless it [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d Cipollone v. Liggett Group, 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407, 422 (1992) (citations omitted). Thus, Congress\u2019 intent is the \u201cultimate touchstone\u201d in this analysis. Id.\nA state law can be preempted in one of three ways. The first is where the United States Congress enacts a provision expressly preempting state law. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983). Even where there is no explicit preemption provision, preemption will still be found where Congress has legislated the field so comprehensively that it has implicitly communicated the intent to occupy a given field to the exclusion of state law. Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293, 299-300, 108 S.Ct. 1145, 1150-51, 99 L.Ed.2d 316, 325 (1988). Finally, a state law will be preempted where a state law actually conflicts with federal law. Id. See also Cellucci v. General Motors Corp., 550 Pa. 407, 706 A.2d 806, (1998).\nIt is this first method of preemption which is at issue in this matter. The express preemption provision in question states that \u201cthe provisions of this subchapter ... shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.... \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).\nNone of the parties in this matter dispute that the United States Supreme Court has yet to speak directly to the issue of whether negligence claims against a health maintenance organization \u201crelate to\u201d an ERISA plan. U.S. Healthcare, however, cites to several United States Supreme Court cases from the 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s as support for its contention that these claims should be preempted by ERISA.\nU.S. Healthcare is indeed accurate in its claim that the Supreme Court had given the ERISA preemption provision an almost breathtaking scope in the 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s. The Court stated that the preemption provisions were \u201cdeliberately expansive\u201d. Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 46, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1552, 95 L.Ed.2d 39, 49 (1987). The Court at that time held the opinion that \u201c[t]he breadth of [\u00a7 1144(a)\u2019s] preemptive reach is apparent from that section\u2019s language.\u201d Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2899-2900, 77 L.Ed.2d 490, 501 (1983). It declared that the words of the preemption provision were to be given their \u201cbroad common-sense meaning, such that a state law \u2018relate[s] to\u2019 a benefit plan in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 724, 739, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2388, 85 L.Ed.2d 728, 740 (1985) (citations omitted). In the vast majority of cases concerning ERISA preemption addressed by the Court during this period, it was found that the state laws being reviewed had some \u201cconnection with\u201d or \u201creference to\u201d the ERISA plan. Although the Court did concede that the ERISA preemption provision \u201cperhaps [is] not the model of legislative drafting\u201d that the Court would hope for, Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 46, 107 S.Ct. at 1552, 95 L.Ed.2d at 47, the Court in the 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s did not admit to any possibility that the plain meaning of the words of the preemption provision could not be given effect.\nThe Court noticeably changed tack in New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995). In Travelers, the unanimous Court determined that a New York statute which required hospitals to collect surcharges from patients covered by all commercial insurers other than Blue Cross/Blue Shield was not preempted by ERISA. After years of striving to make sense of the plain language of the preemption provision, the Court frankly admitted that the text is \u201cunhelpful\u201d. Id. at 656, 115 S.Ct. at 1677, 131 L.Ed.2d at 705. The Court recognized that \u201c[i]f \u2018relate to\u2019 were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course, for \u2018[r]eally, universally, relations stop nowhere.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 655, 115 S.Ct. at 1677, 131 L.Ed.2d at 705 (citations omitted). The Court reasoned that the language of the preemption provision is so extensive that if the Court were to look merely to the bare language of the provision, the provision would for all intents and purposes be without limit\u2014an intent which the Court would not ascribe to Congress. Id. The Court concluded that \u201cwe have to recognize that our prior attempt to construe the phrase \u2018relate to\u2019 does not give us much help in drawing the line here,\u201d and that it \u201cmust go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.\u201d Id. at 656, 115 S.Ct. at 1677, 131 L.Ed.2d at 705.\nThe Court determined that the \u201cbasic thrust of the preemption provision ... was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\u201d Id. at 657, 115 S.Ct. at 1677-1678, 131 L.Ed.2d at 706. It recognized fairly significant bounds on the preemption provision when it stated that \u201c[p]re-emption does not occur ... if the state law has only a tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection with covered plans, as in the cases with many laws of general applicability. \u201d Id. at 661, 115 S.Ct. at 1680, 131 L.Ed.2d at 708-709 (citation omitted). The Court also cautioned that \u201cnothing in the language of [ERISA] or in the context of its passage indicates that Congress chose to displace general health care regulation, which historically has been a matter of local concern.\u201d Id. at 661, 115 S.Ct. at 1680, 131 L.Ed.2d at 709 (citations omitted).\nThe cases following Travelers have continued this trend. In California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Construction, NA, Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 117 S.Ct. 832, 136 L.Ed.2d 791 (1997), the majority relied upon Travelers to find that a California prevailing wage law was not preempted by ERISA. It is in the concurring opinion authored by Mr. Justice Scalia, however, that we find the most cogent recognition that the law of ERISA preemption had, in effect, been changed by Travelers. Mr. Justice Scalia opined that the cases from the 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s, which were premised upon the now rejected notion that the plain language of the ERISA preemption provision could be given effect, were superannuated. He reproached the Court for not forthrightly acknowledging that the holdings of these older cases \u201chave in effect been abandoned.\u201d Id. at 335, 117 S.Ct. at 843, 136 L.Ed. at 806 (Scalia, J., concurring). He believed that since Travelers recognized that literal interpretation of the provision \u201crelate to\u201d was unworkable, then earlier cases which concluded that the plain language of the preemption provision justified findings that the provision had \u201cbroad scope\u201d and was \u201cconspicuous for its breadth\u201d were simply no longer good law. Id.\nThis new position on ERISA preemption was reiterated in De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 117 S.Ct. 1747, 138 L.Ed.2d 21 (1997). The question presented in De Buono was whether a New York gross receipts tax could be applied to hospitals operated by ERISA plans.. The Court again stated that the language \u201crelates to\u201d was unhelpful and that it must instead explore Congress\u2019 intent in enacting ERISA in order to determine if a state law would indeed fall within ERISA\u2019s preemptive scope. Id. at 812, 117 S.Ct. at 1751, 138 L.Ed.2d at 29. The Court determined that the gross receipts tax was not preempted by ERISA because it was \u201cone of myriad state laws of general applicability that impose (sic) some burdens on the administration of ERISA plans but nevertheless do not \u2018relate to\u2019 them within the meaning of the governing statute.... Any state tax, or other law, that increases the cost of providing benefits to covered employees will have some effect on the administration of ERISA plans, but that simply cannot mean that every state law with such an effect is pre-empted by the federal statute.\u201d Id. at 815-816, 117 S.Ct. at 1752-1753, 138 L.Ed.2d at 30-31 (citations omitted).\nThus, although U.S. Healthcare is correct when it states that U.S. Supreme Court decisions from the 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s support its position that the preemption provision is to be read broadly, Travelers and its progeny have thrown the expansive holdings of those earlier cases into question. We thus believe that it would be improper to adopt U.S. Healthcare\u2019s position that we must reflexively interpret the preemption provision in the broadest possible manner. Instead, we believe that the proper course of action is to follow the reasoning contained within the Travelers line of cases, even though we recognize that the Court\u2019s earlier cases have not been expressly overruled.\nBased upon our interpretation of the Travelers line of cases, we conclude that negligence claims against a health maintenance organization do not \u201crelate to\u201d an ERISA plan. As noted by Travelers, Congress did not intend to preempt state laws which govern the provision of safe medical care. Travelers, 514 U.S. at 661, 115 S.Ct. at 1680, 131 L.Ed.2d at 709. Claims that an HMO was negligent when it provided contractually-guaranteed medical benefits in such a dilatory fashion that the patient was injured indisputably are intertwined with the provision of safe medical care. We believe that it would be highly questionable for us to find that these claims were preempted when the United States Supreme Court has stated that there was no intent on the part of Congress to preempt state laws concerning the regulation of the provision of safe medical care.\nFurthermore, we believe that negligence laws have \u201conly a tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection with [ERISA] covered plans, as in the cases with many laws of general applicability,\u201d Travelers, 514 U.S. at 661, 115 S.Ct. at 1680, 131 L.Ed.2d at 708-709, and therefore are not preempted. We acknowledge that by allowing negligence claims, there will be a financial impact on HMOs. Yet, that is not enough to countermand the conclusion that these claims are not preempted. As noted by the De Buono Court, an incidental increase in the costs imposed on an ERISA plan -will not mandate a finding of preemption. De Buono, 520 U.S. at 815-816, 117 S.Ct. at 1752-1753, 138 L.Ed.2d at 30-31.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that ERISA does not preempt the claims in question. The order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nJustice NIGRO files a concurring opinion.\n. It is uncontested that U.S Healthcare is an \"employee benefits plan\u201d pursuant to ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1), and that ERISA therefore applies to this matter.\n. Approximately one year after the trial court granted summary judgment in U.S. Healthcare\u2019s favor, Dr. Asbel and Haverford settled the actions brought against them. They have been substituted in this appeal by their insurers, Pennsylvania Hospital Insurance Co. (\"PHI-CO\u201d) and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Medical Professional Liability Catastrophic Loss Fund (\"CAT Fund\u201d).\n. \"State law\u201d was defined by Congress as including \"all laws, decisions, rule, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(c)(1). It is uncontested that a decision handed down by a state court, which would enter the common law of that state, is a \"State law\u201d as defined by ERISA.\n. We note that another case concerning ERISA preemption was decided the same day De Buono was handed down. Boggs v. Boggs, 521 U.S. 1138, 118 S.Ct. 9, 138 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1997). Boggs, however, does not lend anything to the analysis of the matter sub judice. In Boggs, the Court determined that Louisiana common law was preempted as it was in direct conflict with \u00a7\u00a7 1055 and 1056 of ERISA, substantive provisions which limit the alienability of pension plan benefits from a surviving spouse. In this matter, it is not asserted that a claim of negligence lodged against an HMO is in conflict with any substantive provision of ERISA.\n. U.S. Healthcare also cites to a number of circuit court decisions which have held that claims against HMOs are preempted by ERISA. Corcoran v. United Healthcare, Inc., 965 F.2d 1321 (5th Cir.1992); Tolton v. American Biodyne, Inc., 48 F.3d 937 (6th Cir.1995); Kuhl v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Health Plan of Kansas City, Inc., 999 F.2d 298 (8th. Cir.1993); Spain v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 129 (9th Cir.1993); Cannon v. Group Health Service of Oklahoma, Inc., 77 F.3d 1270 (10th Cir.1996). Yet, the bulk of these cases were handed down prior to Travelers. The only one of these cases which was decided subsequent to Travelers\u2014Cannon\u2014fails even to mention Travelers. Since we find the recent trend of the Supreme Court to be so compelling, it would be inappropriate for us to utilize the reasoning of these courts of appeal cases as they fail to discuss the Travelers line of decisions.\n. The Superior Court below, in reasoning that ERISA does not preempt negligence claims lodged against HMOs, stated that \u201c[cjonsiderations of cost containment of the type which drive the decision making process in HMO's did not exist for employee welfare plans when ERISA was enacted.\u201d Pappas v. Asbel, 450 Pa.Super. 162, 171, 675 A.2d 711, 716 (1996). The Superior Court concluded that Congress could not have intended to preempt that which it did not know would come into existence.\nWe find that we are unable to adopt this reasoning that the modem day HMO was unforeseen by Congress when it drafted ERISA. Just one year preceding the enactment of ERISA, Congress enacted the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300e et seq. The HMOs described in that act are too similar to a contemporary HMO for us to conclude that Congress, when crafting ERISA, was ignorant of the cost containment procedures utilized by HMOs.\n. We also note that U.S. Healthcare puts great effort into arguing that it is not the negligent party here, and that Haverford and the physicians involved are solely responsible for the Pappas' injuries. U.S. Healthcare may ultimately be vindicated on these claims, but this is not the proper stage for these arguments. The issue with which we are concerned in this case is whether the claims against U.S. Healthcare are preempted; we have determined that they are not. It is now left for the fact-finder to determine if U.S. Healthcare\u2019s defenses to the negligence claims are valid.",

        "text": "NIGRO, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI concur in the result reached by the Majority. I agree that the Traveler\u2019s line of cases in the United States Supreme Court supports the proposition that issues raising ERISA preemption are to be narrowly construed. I write separately, however, to explain why the present negligence claim against U.S. Healthcare falls outside that narrow construction and is therefore not preempted. Here, the defendant physician and hospital brought U.S. Healthcare into the action claiming that it was U.S. Healthcare\u2019s refusal to authorize a medically necessary transfer which caused plaintiffs ultimate injury. Based upon the facts set forth in the Majority Opinion, I find that U.S. Healthcare\u2019s actions constituted, in effect, an individual medical decision or judgment as opposed to a decision affecting the administration of an employee benefit plan. Here, the parties are merely attempting to assert their already existing rights under the generally applicable state law of agency and tort. See Dukes v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 57 F.3d 350, 358 (3d Cir.1995), cert. denied., 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S.Ct. 564 (1995).\nThe federal courts have addressed issues similar to the present matter. Independence HMO, Inc. v. Smith, 733 F.Supp. 983 (E.D.Pa.1990), presented an analogous situation as the injured party sued her HMO after receiving negligent medical treatment from a physician on its approved list. The Smith court, in finding the plaintiffs action was not preempted, stated that such a state tort action did not \u201c \u2018impact upon\u2019 an employee benefit plan or \u2018affect the Congressional scheme contained in [ERISA]\u2019.\u201d Id. at 988.\nMoreover, as the Third Circuit recently explained, \u201cpatients enjoy the right to be free from medical malpractice regardless of whether or not their medical care is provided through an ERISA plan.\u201d Dukes, 57 F.3d at 358. Dukes explains that ERISA is principally concerned with the various mechanisms and institutions involved in the funding and payment of plan benefits and was intended to provide each participant with a remedy in the event that promises made by the plan were not kept. Id. at 357. Dukes distinguishes between claims that the \u201cquantum\u201d of benefits promised were not provided, which is controlled by ERISA, and the \u201cquality\u201d of the benefits actually received, which is not controlled by ERISA. Id. Dukes concluded that \u201c[q]uality control of benefits, such as the health care benefits provided here, is a field traditionally occupied by state regulation and we interpret the silence of Congress as reflecting an intent that it remain such.\u201d Id. I would adopt the rationale of the Smith and Dukes decisions and find that the negligence action against U.S. Healthcare is not preempted.\nTherefore, I believe the overall purpose for the enactment of ERISA, as well as subsequent case law, would indicate that the negligence claim against U.S. Healthcare does not fall under the aegis of the preemption clause. It is for these reasons that I find state negligence laws have \u201conly a tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection with [ERISA] covered plans....\u201d New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans, et al. v.
