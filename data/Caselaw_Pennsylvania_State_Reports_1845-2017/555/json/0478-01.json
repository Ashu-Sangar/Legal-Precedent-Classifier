We note that the grant of allocatur in the instant case is strictly limited to the issue presented in this Order, and that the parties are not to brief or present argument concerning Petitioner\u2019s allegation that the lower courts should have permitted its garnishment action against Respondent Nationwide to proceed based on Nationwide's obligation to pay delay damages and/or judgment interest.",
