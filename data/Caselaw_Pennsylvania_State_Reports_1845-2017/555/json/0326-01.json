        "text": "OPINION\nCAPPY, Justice.\nWe granted allocatur to consider whether an arbitration award, that failed to grant teachers credit for past years of service following a break in employment with respect to their placement on a salary schedule, can be upheld in light of certain provisions of the Pennsylvania School Code (School Code). For the reasons that follow, we find that the arbitrator\u2019s award is violative of the School Code. Therefore, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Union County.\nThe Mifflinburg Area Education Association (Association) is the bargaining representative for the professional employees of the Mifflinburg Area School District (District). In 1988, the Association and the District entered into a collective bargaining agreement for the school years 1988-89 through 1992-93. The agreement contained the following salary step provision for the professional employees of the District:\nARTICLE XIII\u2014COMPENSATION\nAn employee shall be placed on their [sic] salary step on the first day of each school term and no change in salary step shall be made during the school term. The salary step on the.first day of a school term shall be one higher than the step on which the district placed the employee for the immediately preceding school term. The district shall determine the salary step for an employee who did not actually work as a professional or temporary professional employee for the district during the whole immediately preceding school term.\nBecause the previous collective bargaining agreement between the Association and the District did not contain salary step increments, the 1988 agreement also included a fifteen step salary schedule, with placement on the schedule dependent upon the employee\u2019s years of service in the District.\nFaced with the task of assigning approximately 140 professional employees with a range of one to twenty-nine years of service on the District\u2019s salary step schedule, the District and the Association executed a memorandum of understanding, which provided:\nThe following compaction salary schedule will become effective the second half of the 1988-89 school year.\nYears Bachelor Masters Step\n1 1-2 $20,575 $21,175\n2 3\u20144 $21,175 $21,775\n3 5-6 $21,875 $22,475\n4 7-8 $22,675 $23,275\n5 9-10 $23,275 $23,875\n6 11-12 $24,275 $24,875\n7 13-14 $25,125 $25,725\n8 15-16 $25,925 $26,525\n9 17-18 $26,875 $27,475\n10 19-20 $27,675 $28,275\n11 21-22 $28,475 $29,075\n12 23-24 $29,275 $29,875\n13 25-26 $30,075 $30,675\n14 27-28 $31,175 $31,775\n15 29 + $32,075 $32,675\nA master list of teachers will be approved. This list will contain the following: name, 1988-89 original salary, 1988-89 new salary, years of service including the 1988-89 school year, degree held; and, the 1988-89 step for the second half of the 1988-89 school year.\nFollowing the approval of the 1988-1993 collective bargaining agreement, the District and the Association jointly prepared and approved the required \u201cmaster list of teachers,\u201d placing each professional employee of the District on a step in the compacted salary schedule corresponding to the professional employee\u2019s years of service in the District.\nIn 1994, the Association filed a grievance on behalf of eight individual teachers of the District (Grievants). The Grievants had been previously employed by the District for varying periods of time, had resigned from service, most frequently for child-rearing purposes, and were subsequently re-hired. The Association claimed that when the Grievants were placed on the compacted salary schedule following approval of the 1988-1993 collective bargaining agreement, the District had improperly failed to give the Grievants credit for each year they were employed prior to their breaks in service.\nThe Board of School Directors denied the grievance and the matter was placed before an arbitrator in accordance with Section 903 of the Public Employe Relations Act. The arbitrator entered an award in favor of the District.\nThe Association thereafter filed an \u201cApplication to Vacate, Correct and Modify Arbitration Award\u201d in the Union County Court of Common Pleas. The court found that the arbitrator\u2019s award failed to consider the mandate of the School Code with respect to salary schedule placement. The court vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award and- ordered that the Grievants be placed on the appropriate step of the District\u2019s salary schedule taking into account the Grievants\u2019 prior years of service in the District.\nCommonwealth Court reversed the order of the Court of Common Pleas and reinstated the arbitrator\u2019s award. This appeal followed.\nThis court announced the \u201cessence\u201d test as the standard- of review for appeals of arbitrators\u2019 decisions in Community College of Beaver County v. Society of the Faculty, 473 Pa. 576, 375 A.2d 1267 (1977). Under this standard, an arbitrator\u2019s award must derive its essence from the collective bargaining agreement to pass judicial review.\nSection 1121 of the School Code requires that all contracts between school districts and professional employees contain a clause stating that none of the provisions of the School Code may be waived by school district employees. In addition, Section 703 of the Public Employe Relations Act prohibits the parties from effecting or implementing a provision in a collective bargaining agreement if implementation of that provision would violate or be inconsistent with a statutory enactment. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.703. Thus, by statute, actions taken pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement cannot violate the School Code.\nThe Association asserts that the failure of the District to give the Grievants credit on the salary step schedule for each year they were employed prior to their breaks in service violated Sections 1142(a) and 1149 of the School Code.\nSection 1142 provides in part:\n\u00a7 11-1142. Minimum Salaries and Increments\n(a) Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, all school districts and vocational school districts shall pay all regular and temporary teachers, supervisors, directors and coordinators of vocational education, psychologists, teachers of classes for exceptional children, supervising principals, vocational teachers, and principals in the public schools of the district the minimum salaries and increments for the school years 1968-1969 and each school year thereafter, as provided in the following tabulation in accordance with the column in which the professional employe is grouped and the step which the professional employee has attained by years of experience within the school district each step after step 1 constituting one year of service. When a school district, by agreement, places a professional employe on a step in the salary scale, each step thereafter shall constitute one year of service. When a district adopts a salary scale in excess of the mandated scale, it shall not be deemed to have altered or increased the step which the employe has gained through years of service.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 ll-1142(a)(Emphasis supplied).\nSection 1149 of the School Code provides:\nThe increments herein provided for are applicable only where the beneficiaries thereof remain in the service of the same school district. Where such teachers enter a new district they shall enter at a point in the schedule to be agreed upon between said teachers and the employing districts, which agreements shall be made part of the contract between them.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1149.\nThe District maintains that Section 1142(a) merely provides that teachers are entitled to a minimum salary with minimum yearly increments dependent upon years of experience within the school district. However, while Section 1142(a) was intended to assure that teachers receive a certain minimum salary, this section also speaks to placement on a salary schedule that is above the minimum scale. \u201cWhen a district adopts a salary scale in excess of the mandated scale, it shall not be deemed to have altered or increased the step which the employe has gained through years of service.\u201d 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1142. We interpret this provision to require that a teacher\u2019s past years of service are to be credited upon rehire for purposes of placement on a local salary scale. The language contained in Section 1142(a) protects professional school district employees from the patent unfairness of disregarding past years of service with the same school district when the district places a rehired teacher on a salary scale and the teacher is receiving a salary in excess of the state mandated minimum. The mandates of Section 1142 and 1149 express the legislature\u2019s intent to protect valuable years of service performed by employees who sustained breaks in service for a variety of reasons.\nThe Commonwealth Court in Centennial School District v. Centennial Education Association, 133 Pa.Cmwlth. 382, 576 A.2d 99 (1990) reached a similar decision. In Centennial, four professional employees who had resigned their positions were later rehired by the school district. At the time of rehiring, the employees were placed on the salary schedule at the same level as newly hired teachers. The Association filed grievances on behalf of the four teachers alleging that they had been placed on the salary schedule at a level lower than that required by the collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator concluded that the collective bargaining agreement required that rehired teachers were entitled to credit for the prior years of teaching within the District under Sections 1142 and 1149 of the School Code. The Commonwealth Court upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision, finding that the arbitrator\u2019s award drew its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\nThe District instead relies on Wildrick v. Board of Directors of Sayre Area School District, 491 Pa. 25, 417 A.2d 617 (1980). The District\u2019s reliance on Wildrick is misplaced as it has no relevance to the present dispute. Wildrick addressed the issue of whether the minimum salaries set forth in the School Code must be used in calculating salaries under a local salary schedule, even though the local salary schedule paid salaries above the state mandated minimum. In an assumpsit action against the district, the teachers claimed that they were entitled to placement on the local salary schedules at the corresponding step in the School Code commensurate with their salaries. The Wildrick court properly rejected the teachers\u2019 argument, finding that the district was not required to apply to its local salary schedule that step in the statutory schedule which was intended by the Legislature to determine the minimum pay for teachers.\nWildrick is inapplicable to the present matter because the professional employees in this case are not claiming that their placement on the salary schedule is determined by the salary steps in the School Code, irrespective of the employees\u2019 years of experience within that district. Instead, the Association is arguing only that Sections 1142 and 1149 require the District to credit the teachers for years of past service within the District. Thus, the Wildrick court\u2019s discussion of a district\u2019s obligations under Section 1142, regarding an issue very different from the one before us, provides no guidance.\nIn the present case, the Grievants are statutorily protected against losing credit for previous service under Section 1142 of the School Code, a protection that is incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator\u2019s award denying credit for past service is violative of the School Code, and thus, violative of the agreement. Thus, the award does not derive its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. We hereby reverse the order of Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Union County.\nJustice NEWMAN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice ZAPPALA files a dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice FLAHERTY joins.\n. This opinion was reassigned to this author.\n. Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1121.\n. For example, Grievant Carol Brann was employed by the District for four years (covering the school years 1960-61 to 1963-64), sustained a break in service of thirteen years and was re-hired by the District and continually employed for the next eleven years (covering the school years 1977-78 to 1987-88). When Brann was placed on the compacted salary schedule following approval of the 1988-1993 collective bargaining agreement, she was not given credit for her total of fifteen years of service in the District, but instead was only given credit for the eleven years of service that followed her break in service. Thus, the Association claimed that Brann should have been placed at step eight of the compacted salary schedule (corresponding to fifteen years of service), rather than step six (corresponding to eleven years of service).\n. Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.903.\n. The Centennial court based its decision, in part, on the fact that the collective bargaining agreement contained a statutory savings clause that explicitly incorporated the provisions of the School Code. However, as noted above, Section 1121 of the School Code provides that the statutory mandates of the School Code cannot be waived \"orally or in writing.\u201d 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1121. In addition, the Pennsylvania Employe Relations Act prevents the parties from implementing collective bargaining agreement provisions that are inconsistent with or conflict with any statute. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.703. Therefore, express language in the agreement incorporating the provisions of the School Code is not necessary because such provisions are incorporated, by operation of law.\n. In his dissent, our esteemed colleague Mr. Justice Zappala states that a different standard of review of arbitration awards exists in those cases where an arbitrator interprets statutory law that is incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement. Justice Zappala posits that this court\u2019s standard of review in such cases is plenary. With due respect, this assertion is not borne out by the case that he cites in support of his position or the numerous cases this court has rendered in reviewing labor arbitration awards under the Pennsylvania Employe Relations Act. Our standard of review in this case, as in all arbitration cases, is clearly the essence test.\nThe dissent relies upon Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Bald Eagle Area School District, 499 Pa. 62, 451 A.2d 671 (1982). Reliance by the dissent on this case is misplaced for a number of reasons. First, Bald Eagle is not a case involving this court\u2019s review of an arbitrator\u2019s award. Rather, it involves an unfair labor practice proceeding regarding whether a dispute was arbitrable at all. Second, the court in Bald Eagle did not set forth a standard of review to be used when an arbitrator\u2019s award is against the law. Instead, in obiter dicta, the court merely noted that judicial relief was available if an award was in conflict with statutory law. Finally, and most importantly, the Bald Eagle court did indicate that the judiciary had the right to correct or modify an arbitration award contrary to law in the same manner as jury verdicts on a motion for judgment n.o.v., citing the Uniform Arbitration Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7302(d)(2). In fact, this very language served as the basis for this court\u2019s creation of the essence test. Community College of Beaver County, 473 Pa. 576, 589-90, 375 A.2d 1267, 1273 (Pa.1977)(\u201c[w]hile the introduction of the \u2018n.o.v.\u2019 concept into the field of arbitration may have been a new departure, it is hardly a radical change, nor does it dictate that a much closer or different scrutiny of an arbitration award will be available than under the [essence test]\u201d). Thus, this court has made clear that when reviewing an arbitration award under the Pennsylvania Employe Relations Act, the standard of review is the essence test.\nAs this court stated in Pennsylvania State Education Association v. Appalachia Intermediate Unit 08, 505 Pa. 1, 476 A.2d 360 (Pa. 1984):\nWe set forth the standard of review for appeals of arbitrator's decisions under the [Public Employe Relations] Act in [Community College of Beaver County ]. We held there that an arbitration award must be upheld if it can in any rational way be derived from the collective bargaining agreement in light of language, context and other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention. In so holding we cited the Arbitration Act of April 5, 1927, P.L.381, No. 248, \u00a7 11, 5 P.S. \u00a7 171, which provided that a court could modify or correct a statutory arbitration award ... [w]here the award is against the law, and is such that had it been a verdict of the jury the court would have entered different or other judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Subsequent to the decision of the arbitrator in the instant case, the Arbitration Act of 1927 was superseded by the Uniform Arbitration Act, Act of October 5, 1980, P.L. 693, No. 142, effective in sixty days, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7301 et seq. The new Act provides that \u201cA court in reviewing an arbitration award ... shall ... modify or correct the award where the award is contrary to law and is such that had it been a verdict of a jury the court would have entered a different judgment or a judgement notwithstanding the verdict\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7302(d)(2). We conclude that this is a substantial reenactment of the corresponding provision of the Arbitration Act of 1927 and that the standard of review of an arbitration award under the Public Employee Relations Act is the same regardless of which arbitration act applies.\nPennsylvania State Education Association, 505 Pa. at 4-6, 476 A.2d at 362-63 (Zappala, J.)(emphasis supplied). See also, County of Centre v. Musser, 519 Pa. 380, 392-93, 548 A.2d 1194, 1200 (1988)(Arbitration Act of 1927 provisions relative to judicial review of arbitral awards retained in Uniform Arbitration Act, thus, it is clear that the \u201cessence\u201d test remains the standard of judicial review for arbitration awards which, are subject to section 7302(d)(2) of the Uniform Arbitration Act); Austin Area Education Association v. Austin Area School District, 159 Pa.Cmwlth. 640, 644 n. 6, 634 A.2d 276, 278 n. 6 (Pa.Cmwlth.1993)(The essence test is the equivalent of the judgment n.o.v. standard provided by section 7302(d)(2) of the Uniform Arbitration Act).\nIndeed, this court has reviewed an arbitrator's interpretation of, and reliance upon, statutory law, as part of our review under the essence test, rather than a distinct analysis under plenary review. Greater Johnstown Area Vocational-Technical School, v. Greater Johnstown Area Vocational-Technical Education Association, 520 Pa. 197, 553 A.2d 913 (Pa. 1989); See also, Pennsylvania State Education Association, 505 Pa. at 7, 476 A.2d at 363(awarding compound interest contrary to existing status of law, if award made by a jury, it would have resulted in judgment n.o.v. It cannot rationally be derived from the collective bargaining agreement). Finally, it would be unwise as a practical matter to inject a second standard of review in an area already fraught with confusion, especially where, as a general proposition, an award that is contrary to law will not satisfy the essence test. For all of the above-stated reasons, the dissent\u2019s suggestion that our standard of review in this case is plenary is simply without merit.",

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\ndissenting.\nBecause I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s expansive reading of Section 1142(a) of the Pennsylvania School Code (Code), I respectfully dissent.\nSection 1142 provides:\n\u00a7 11-1142. Minimum Salaries and Increments\n(a) Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, all school districts and vocational school districts shall pay all regular and temporary teachers, supervisors, directors and coordinators of vocational education, psychologists, teachers of classes for exceptional children, supervising principals, vocational teachers, and principals in the public schools of the district the minimum salaries and increments for the school year 1968-1969 and each school year thereafter, as provided in the following tabulation in accordance with the column in which the professional employe is grouped and the step which the professional employe has attained by years of experience within the school district each step after step 1 constituting one year of service. When a school district, by agreement, places a professional employe on a step in the salary scale, each step thereafter shall constitute one year of service. When a district adopts a salary scale in excess of the mandated scale, it shall not be deemed to have altered or increased the step which the employe has gained through years of service.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1142(a) (emphasis supplied).\nThe majority interprets the above emphasized sentence from Section 1142(a) to require that a professional employee\u2019s past years of service in the same school district are to be credited upon rehire for purposes of placement on a local salary scale. However, there is no language contained in the sentence to support such an interpretation.\nThe language of a statute must be read in a sense which harmonizes with the subject matter and its general purpose and object. Swartley v. Harris, 351 Pa. 116, 40 A.2d 409 (1945). The sole subject matter of Section 1142, as reflected in the title, \u201cMinimum Salaries and Increments,\u201d is the establishment and preservation of minimum salaries for professional school district employees based on years of service.\nWhen a school district adopts a local salary step schedule, Section 1142(a)\u2019s lone requirement is that the salary corresponding to the step on the local scale which a professional employee is placed be equal to or greater than the salary corresponding to the step on the state mandated minimum scale the employee has gained through years of service in the school district. The final sentence of Section 1142(a) does nothing more than prevent an employee\u2019s receipt of a salary higher than the minimum from being construed as placement on a step higher than he or she has attained through years of service.\nAs \u201c[t]he sole limitation the Legislature has imposed is the requirement that a school district comply with the applicable statewide minimum salary schedule,\u201d Wildrick v. Board of Directors of Sayre Area School District, 491 Pa. 25, 31, 417 A.2d 617, 619-620 (1980), the mere fact that in this case the District adopted a salary scale in excess of the statewide minimum does not alter or increase the Code-mandated minimum salary corresponding to the step which the Grievants had gained through total previous years of service in the District. The District\u2019s placement of the Grievants on the local salary scale at steps which did not give the Grievants credit for each year they were employed prior to their breaks in service is not in violation of, or inconsistent with the Code.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision denying the grievance thus represents a legitimate, reasonable interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement between the Association and the District, which is not in violation of, or inconsistent with statutory law. The order of the Commonwealth Court which reinstated the arbitrator\u2019s award should therefore be affirmed. Accordingly, I dissent.\nChief Justice FLAHERTY joins in this Dissenting Opinion.\n. Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1121.\n. In 1988, the Legislature enacted 24 P.S. \u00a7 1142.1, which effectively supersedes 24 P.S. \u00a7 1142. However, as the collective bargaining agreement in the instant case had already been entered into and was in effect prior to the effective date of Section 1142.1, Section 1142 remains applicable to the instant case.\n. In this case, although the Grievants were not given credit on the local scale for each year they were employed by the District prior to their breaks in service, each Grievant was placed on a step on the local scale with a salary greater than that required by the step on the state mandated schedule the employee had gained through total years of service in the District. For example, Grievant Carol Brann, whom the Association claimed should have been placed at step eight of the local scale (corresponding to fifteen years of service in the District), rather then step six (corresponding to eleven years of service), received the step six salary of $24,275 for the 1988-89 school year. That salary is significantly greater than the Section 1142 state mandated minimum salary of $9,800 for professional employees with fifteen years of service in the same district.\n. To the extent that such an interpretation of Section 1142(a) conflicts with Centennial School District v. Centennial Education Association, 133 Pa.Cmwlth. 382, 576 A.2d 99 (1990), the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision should be expressly overruled.\n. The majority opines that the proper standard of review in this case is the essence test. Although I certainly would agree that the essence test is the proper standard of review for a challenge to an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, such a deferential standard of review does not apply when reviewing a challenge to an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of statutory law incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement. In the latter case, as here, our standard of review is plenary. See generally Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Bald Eagle Area School District, 499 Pa. 62, 451 A.2d 671 (1982). There, we stated:\nCourts have no reason to assume an arbitrator will ignore the law and award a payment based on a contractual interpretation which conflicts with a fundamental policy of this Commonwealth expressed in statutory law. If so, judicial relief is available. See Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. State College, A.S.D., 461 Pa. 494, 337 A.2d 262 (1975); Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Zelem, 459 Pa. 399, 329 A.2d 477 (1974); Washington Arbitration Case, 436 Pa. 168, 259 A.2d 437 (1969). Moreover, the judiciary has express statutory authority to review and correct or modify arbitration awards against the Commonwealth or its political subdivisions in the same manner as jury verdicts on a motion for judgment N.O.V. Judicial Code \u00a7 7302(d)(2), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302(d)(2).\n499 Pa. at 67, 451 A.2d at 673 (footnote omitted).\nI note with interest the majority\u2019s lengthy response criticizing this reference to Bald Eagle. (Majority Op. at 344 n.6). I must point out, however, that I deliberately used as an introductory signal a term of art which I believed to be easily recognizable. See The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation 12 (1989) (\"An authority may be introduced ... by an ordinary English phrase explaining its force and or purpose.\u201d Rule 3.1(b)); The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation 23 (16th ed. 1996) (\u201cSee generally\u201d defined as: \u201cCited authority presents helpful background material related to the proposition.\u201d Rule 1.2(d)).\nMy position as it relates to the proper standard of review in this case remains intact. The majority finds, as a matter of law, that the arbitrator\u2019s decision is violative of the Code. By definition, the majority has conducted plenary review of the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of statutory law incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement, and has not deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s analysis as the essence test mandates.",
