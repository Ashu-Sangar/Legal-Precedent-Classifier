In <em>Reider, </em>the Commonwealth Court determined that the Parole Board’s decision to deny a prisoner parole does not constitute an adjudication under the Administrative Agency Law. Because the Administrative Agency Law allows appeals to courts only after adjudications are made by an agency, the <em>Reider </em>court held that prisoners had no right to appellate review from the denial of parole.

In <em>Bronson, </em>recognizing that a person who has been released on parole has a liberty interest in his freedom, this Court held that a released prisoner has a constitutionally-guaranteed right to seek review of an adverse parole <em>revocation </em>decision. However, the constitutionally-guaranteed right of review language in <em>Bronson </em>is narrowly confined to the parole revocation process. As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em><a href="/us/442/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="442 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1532158" data-case-paths="/us/442/0001-01">442 U.S. 1</a>, 9, <a href="/us/442/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="442 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1532158" data-case-paths="/us/442/0001-01">99 S.Ct. 2100</a>, <a href="/us/442/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="442 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1532158" data-case-paths="/us/442/0001-01">60 L.Ed.2d 668</a> (1979), parole release and parole revocation are quite different in that parole revocation involves a paroled prisoner <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>who presently enjoys a certain limited liberty to pursue employment and familial relationships outside the confines of prison, while parole release involves a prisoner who has no present liberty interest as a result of his confinement within a prison. Furthermore, as this Court stated in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Sparks v. Russell, </em><a href="/pa/403/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="403 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1299502" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0320-01">403 Pa. 320</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.2d%20884" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="169 A.2d 884">169 A.2d 884</a> (1961), parole is a matter of grace and mercy shown to a prisoner who has demonstrated to the Parole Board’s satisfaction his future ability to function as a law-abiding member of society upon release before the expiration of the prisoner’s maximum sentence. Thus, under both this Court’s precedent and the precedent of the United States Supreme Court, the Parole Board’s decision to grant or deny parole does not affect an existing enjoyment of liberty. Consequently, appellants fail to establish that they have a liberty interest in parole which is protected by the United States Constitution.</p>

This Court will not undertake to create such a right as a matter of judicial fiat. To hold otherwise would defeat the clearly stated intent of the Legislature by inviting an appeal from <em>every </em>denial of parole and by concomitantly extending the panoply of constitutional protections that apply to parole revocations to parole denials as well, including the right to the assistance of an attorney to pursue these claims.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> What is now an informal agency hearing would instead become a full-fledged, adversarial proceeding with the panoply of rights required.
