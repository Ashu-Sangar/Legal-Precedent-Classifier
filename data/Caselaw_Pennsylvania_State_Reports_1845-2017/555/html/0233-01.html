A twenty-five-foot tree branch lay across the throat which was wrapped in shirt material. After viewing the corpse, the County Coroner estimated that the victim had been dead for twelve to fifteen hours, placing the time of death between midnight and three o’clock, a.m., on July 24, 1981. An autopsy revealed that prior to death, the victim had sustained fifteen blows to the head with a jagged, blunt object, and had suffered various <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>bruises, a broken nose, internal hemorrhaging in the neck, swollen eyes, and a crushed windpipe. The crushed windpipe was determined to be the cause of death. After the victim’s death, his body was subjected to burns on parts of the torso, and trauma to the chest and scrotum, part of which was crushed.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[289,668,1113,533]]]'>A blood-covered jagged rock was found near the body. The blood was similar to the victim’s; the lacerations and punctures on the victim’s head were caused by this rock. The nearest rocks were two hundred feet from the body and were similar to the rock used to strike the victim. A pair of glasses found near the body was identified as those made and sold to Appellant by his optometrist, Dr. Perry. On July 25, 1981, the day following the death, Appellant returned to Dr. Perry and ordered another, identical pair of glasses.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[290,1224,1111,250]]]'>Blood found on Appellant’s shoes was consistent with that of the victim’s. Blood was also found on other items of clothing worn by Appellant on July 24, 1981. This blood could not be accurately examined because the clothes had been washed.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b465-7" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[288,1505,1109,418]]]'>Appellant’s mother testified that Appellant came home on July 23,1981, at 10:30 p.m. She recalled that he was covered with blood and asked her to say that he had come home early. Mrs. Pursell also testified that she was extremely upset when she heard about the murder on the evening news (July 24, 1981)—so much so that she required medication to calm down—and that Appellant was aware of her reaction upon hearing of the victim’s death.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b465-8" data-blocks='[["BL_465.7",465,[286,1946,1111,310]]]'>Finally, on July 27, 1981, while listening to a newscast reporting developments in this case, Appellant turned to his girlfriend, with whom he was watching the seven o’clock newscast, and asked whether she thought a person could be traced through his glasses. No mention had been made in any report that glasses had been found at the scene.</blockquote>

This Court has not addressed those <em>pro se </em>claims not included in the amended petition because to do so would exceed the Supreme Court’s mandate.

The provisions in the PCRA regarding waiver of issues, coupled with the requirement of proper preservation of issues for appellate review on direct appeals, force a petitioner to frame his claims as “layered” ineffectiveness claims, because there has usually been waiver by previous counsel’s failure to raise or preserve the underlying issue the petitioner wants the PCRA court to address.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Moreover, we recently held that we would no longer apply the “relaxed waiver” rule applicable to direct appellate review of capital cases in appeals from post-conviction proceedings in capital cases. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In the first instance, any claim that is based on counsel’s ineffectiveness must relate to ineffectiveness at a stage of criminal proceedings where a defendant has a right to counsel. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In other words, if the defendant has no right to counsel in a PCRA proceeding, he has no basis for claims of the ineffectiveness of PCRA counsel. In <em>Albrecht, </em>this Court held that although defendants do not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in PCRA proceedings, there is an enforceable right to post-conviction counsel created by Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure 1503 and 1504. <em>Albrecht, </em><a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">720 A.2d at 699-700</a>.

According to Appellant, these reports suggest a possible additional suspect for the murder, as the sexual advances were made close to Lawrence Park and during the two months preceding the murder. Appellant relies primarily on news reports of these incidents, which mention teenage complainants and refer to police reports of the incidents. Again, Appellant claims: (1) a <em>Brady </em>violation by prosecutors for allegedly failing to turn over the police reports concerning these incidents in the Lawrence Park area; and, (2) ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failing to pursue production of the purportedly-suppressed material and to secure favorable witnesses for trial from that material. With respect to the purported <em>Brady </em>violation, this issue is waived for Appellant’s failure to raise it at trial or on direct appeal, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b), and because Appellant has not properly presented this issue as a layered ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>

The pathologist stated that this dilation would not be unusual in a boy of the victim’s age. This testimony is consistent with Officer Krahe’s statements in the arrest warrant that the anus of the victim was “somewhat distended,” and does not prove deliberate or willful falsehood by Officer Krahe in his affidavit for the arrest warrant that sexual assault may have been the motive for the killing.

Subsequently, on August 11, 1981, James Lynch, a witness who encountered Appellant the night of the murder, informed the police that he had seen Appellant wearing what he believed were brown sandals. The police obtained an additional search warrant of Appellant’s room from that statement, to look specifically for a pair of sandals. During the execution of that search warrant, Officer Riffland searched under Appellant’s bed and discovered a brown pair of shoes. When examining the shoes, the officer detected dried blood stains. The information gained from this search for the sandals served as the basis for the search warrant used to obtain the shoes containing stains of the victim’s blood.

The fact that subsequent investigation by the pathologist turned up no conclusive evidence of sexual assault, and that the Commonwealth did not pursue this theory at Appellant’s trial, does not prove that Krahe’s initial suspicions of possible sexual assault, based on his observation of the crime scene, were false. Further, counsel’s decision not to impeach Krahe concerning his suspicions of sexual assault may have been to Appellant’s benefit, since the introduction of police suspicion of sexual assault may have worked to Appellant’s detriment. Finally, Appellant does not demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different had his trial counsel pursued this questionable method of impeachment.

The issue of whether the defendant should receive a new trial as a result of this improper use of his prior criminal record is waived for purposes of appellate review because there was no timely objection at trial. However, in either post-trial motions or, less preferably, in his brief to the Superior Court, the defendant who obtains new counsel post-trial can then raise a claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to object to the use of the defendant’s prior criminal record. If that new, post-trial counsel fails to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness, that issue of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness is waived. The defendant who obtains new counsel in a post-conviction proceeding must then raise prior appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to object to the use of defendant's prior criminal record.
