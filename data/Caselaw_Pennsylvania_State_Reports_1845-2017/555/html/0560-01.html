The matter proceeded to a trial before a jury. During closing argument, counsel for Sakel suggested that the jury should draw negative inferences from the Bennetts’ failure to call the police officer who investigated the collision and <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>two physicians who had treated Brenda Bennett.

And according to the records and cross-examination of Mrs. Bennett, the pain levels decreased in those three visits. Three visits from August 3 to August 11, 1992. I wonder why Dr. Negri wasn’t here to talk to you, especially when his records indicated that there wasn’t to be any return office visit. Those are questions that you, when you go back to the jury deliberation room, will ask yourselves why.

In <em>Bentivoglio, </em>the plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident with the defendant. The plaintiff sought treatment from several doctors for his injuries, but presented only a select few of them as witnesses at trial. The trial judge directed the jury that it could draw the inference that, because the plaintiff had failed to call the doctors to testify, their testimony would have been unfavorable to the plaintiff. This Court found that the instruction was in error, stating that: “ ... [T]he inference is permitted only where the uncalled witness is peculiarly within the reach and knowledge of only one of the parties.” <em>Id. </em>at 24, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20745" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="288 A.2d 745">288 A.2d at 748</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b783-5" data-blocks='[["BL_783.4",783,[259,1105,1155,959]]]'>Here, the Superior Court rejected <em>Bentivoglio </em>and instead relied on <em>Augustine by Augustine v. Delgado, </em><a href="/pa-super/332/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="332 Pa. Super. 194" data-case-ids="614790" data-case-paths="/pa-super/332/0194-01">332 Pa.Super. 194</a>, <a href="/pa-super/332/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="332 Pa. Super. 194" data-case-ids="614790" data-case-paths="/pa-super/332/0194-01">481 A.2d 319</a> (1984). In <em>Augustine, </em>the Superior Court held that it was proper for defense counsel to draw an adverse inference from the plaintiffs’ failure to call two pediatric neurologists who had been involved in the diagnosis and care of the plaintiffs’ infants. However, the court in <em>Augustine </em>neither inquired into nor placed any significance on whether the physicians were peculiarly within the reach or control of the plaintiffs. Rather, the court focused on whether counsel’s closing argument was appropriate. Here, the Superior Court found that the matter <em>sub judice </em>was more akin to <em>Augustine </em>than <em>Bentivoglio </em>because <em>Augustine, </em>like the instant matter, involved a challenge to counsel’s closing arguments, not an adverse instruction. We find the Superior Court’s interpretation of <em>Bentivoglio </em>too limiting. We further reject the reasoning of <em>Augustine </em>to the extent that it contradicts this Court’s holding in <em>Bentivoglio.</em>

    <p id="b784-5" data-blocks='[["BL_784.5",784,[221,1137,1159,573]]]'>To allow the Superior Court’s holding to stand in this case would have the undesirable effect of creating a paradoxical situation where an attorney would be allowed to suggest that the jury draw adverse inferences during closing arguments about his opponent’s failure to call certain witnesses when, based on the same facts, the trial court would be prohibited by <em>Bentivoglio </em>from giving an adverse inference instruction. We therefore hold that an attorney may not ask the jury to draw an adverse inference concerning the opposing party’s failure to call a witness where that witness was equally available to both sides.</p>
