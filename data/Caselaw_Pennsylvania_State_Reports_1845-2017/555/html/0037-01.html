Without question, probation officers carry out an important function about juvenile rehabilitation. The legislature endowed probation officers with responsibilities for the care, protection, treatment, and rehabilitation of delinquent minors. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6304 official comment (1976).

The contents of the file included Jackson’s report card and attendance record, a psychological summary, and the probation officer’s report. The probation officer recommended against certifying Jackson to stand trial as an adult. At the certification hearing, the juvenile court possessed Jackson’s entire juvenile file. Jackson’s counsel focused the attention of the court on some of the more laudable aspects of Jackson’s background. Jackson was a minor, who had no previous contact with the adult or juvenile criminal system. Although Jackson’s regular school had expelled him for assaulting a teacher, his counsel informed the court that Jackson’s grades and attendance at a disciplinary school were good, and the disciplinary school had recommended his transfer back to regular school. Prior to his arrest, Jackson lived with his mother. Both of Jackson’s parents told the probation officer that their son was generally a good person.</p>

First, the Commonwealth emphasized the adult nature and seriousness of the crime. Jackson participated in a premeditated, deliberate, and violent criminal activity with the potential for substantial bodily injury. Second, not only had Jackson been expelled from his regular school for assault, but also his first disciplinary school had transferred him to a second disciplinary school for possession of a BB gun.</p>

Because a probation officer frequently has the most comprehensive information about a delinquent youth, a juvenile court should dutifully review a probation officer’s report and recommendation. However, a probation officer’s report is only one factor that a court must consider when determining whether a minor is amenable to treatment as a juvenile. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6355(a)(4)(iii)(A). The Juvenile Act places no greater or lesser weight on the probation officer’s report than any of the other statutory factors before a juvenile court. In one case, the crime may be less sophisticated than in other cases, but the youth’s prior history of delinquency may be extensive. In another case, a youth may have committed no prior crimes, but the present crime for which the minor is charged was particularly grave in nature. While the Juvenile Act requires that a juvenile court consider all of the amenability factors, it is silent as to the weight assessed to each by the court. A juvenile court cannot abdicate its duty to determine whether a youth is amenable to juvenile treatment. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Superior Court concluded that, while in most cases the juvenile court’s findings would have adequately supported an adult certification, in the present case, the reasons of the court were insufficient in light of the conflicting evidence.

The certification hearing transcript demonstrates that the juvenile court was aware of a number of facts from different sources bearing on all of the factors under its consideration. Additionally, on at least two occasions, the juvenile court noted that it had reviewed the contents of the juvenile file.
