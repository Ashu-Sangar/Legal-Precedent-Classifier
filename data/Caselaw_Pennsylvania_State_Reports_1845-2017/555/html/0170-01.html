Appellee was the passenger in a car which West Manchester Township Police Officer Jeffrey Oberdorff observed speeding shortly after midnight on November 21, 1993. Since Officer Oberdorff was proceeding in the opposite direction, he radioed a colleague, Officer Keith Roehm, and advised him of his observations. Officer Roehm followed the vehicle for three or four tenths of a mile and determined that it was travelling twenty to twenty-five miles per hour over the posted forty mile per hour speed limit.</p>

Noticing that the license had expired, that the driver had a gang tattoo under his left eye, that the car contained a number of boxed motorcycle parts, and that the occupants of the car appeared nervous, Officer Roehm then asked whether there was anything illegal in the vehicle. After the driver responded in the negative, Officer Roehm proceeded to his police cruiser to check the license status and to write a warning for speeding.</p>

After stopping the truck, the trooper asked the driver for his license and registration. The driver produced his license and a bill of sale for the truck bearing the name of someone else. In response to questions concerning the ownership of the truck, the driver stated that it belonged to a friend and that he was taking it to have its shock absorbers repaired. The trooper subsequently told the driver that he would be held until the arrival of the DEA agent. At this point, the driver, appearing nervous, stated that he wanted to leave and requested the return of his license. The trooper replied that he was not free to leave at that time.</p>

The agent twice sought permission to search the truck, and the driver twice declined. Finally, the agent put his nose against the rear window of the truck and reported that he could smell marijuana. Without seeking permission, the Agent removed the keys from the ignition, opened the rear of the camper, and observed a large number of burlap-wrapped bales resembling similar bales of marijuana that he had seen on previous occasions.</p>

    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[222,465,1161,1444]]]'>In this matter, in light of the extremely limited nature of the putative “investigative detention,” the trial court properly determined that the evidence in the record was more than sufficient to sustain a reasonable belief that criminal activity was afoot. The trial court, as it was entitled to do, credited Officer Roehm’s testimony at the suppression hearing. This testimony established, <em>inter alia, </em>that the stop occurred at 12:22 a.m., that the TransAm had dealer’s tags, that it contained boxes of motorcycle parts in the back seat,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">10</a> that the two individuals in the car were more nervous than most people on traffic stops, and that the driver, who had a gang tattoo under his left eye, proffered an expired driver’s license and registration papers that did not match the vehicle. See Opin. at 9 (R. at 110a; also at 32a-38a). Considered in the aggregate, these circumstances lent far greater credence to the reasonableness of Officer Roehm’s suspicions of criminal activity than the circumstances that gave rise to the agent’s suspicions in <em>Sharpe. </em>In <em>Sharpe, </em>the DEA agent merely observed two vehicles which were exceeding the speed limit, one of which was a truck pulling a weighed-down camper whose driver appeared nervous after he was stopped and who failed to produce a bill of sale in his name. Here, before asking his one question, Officer Roehm similarly identified the driver’s extreme nervousness and inability to produce satisfactory documentation, but <em>further </em>identified the dealers’ tags as well as items and activity <em>within </em>the TramsAm which, based on his law enforcement experience, heightened his suspicions.</p>

In light of United States Supreme Court precedent, the single question posed by Officer Roehm did not amount to an “investigative detention.” In this respect, I reiterate the sensible concern that has partially driven the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in this area. Namely, if a single question amounts to an investigative detention, then any police inquiry, no matter how courteously made, would permit a criminal to defeat prosecution by voluntarily revealing all of the evidence against him and then contending that he acted only in response to an implied assertion of unlawful authority. <em>See Schneckloth v.

The Court’s error in this part of the case is a result of its failure to appreciate the principles that drive the distinction between the “reasonable suspicion” required for an investigative stop and the “probable cause” required for an arrest. In an investigative stop, the intrusiveness of the police conduct at <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>issue is comparatively negligible. The police are not seeking to strip the subject of his liberty and bring him to trial. Indeed, they do not seek to assert any authority whatsoever over the subject. Instead, they seek merely to ask questions of the subject—here, a single question. An individual may well be annoyed by having to answer a question—especially if that individual is trying to hide some criminal conduct—but police officers do not intrude on any deeply ingrained notion of liberty simply by posing a question to an individual. As noted in another context by Justice Harlan, “[Pjeaceful interrogation is not one of the dark moments of the law.” <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, 517, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.Ed.2d 694</a> (Harlan, J., dissenting).

One might argue that the Court tacitly determined that the officer’s question amounted to an investigative detention justified by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity afoot.
