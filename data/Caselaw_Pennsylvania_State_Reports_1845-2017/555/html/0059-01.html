The trial court initially cited <em>Ducjai </em>for the decision’s narrow holding that an on-the-job employee injured in an automobile accident may not recover, in addition to workers’ compensation benefits from her employer, damages at common law from her co-employee. Acknowledging that the present case involves the attempt to obtain uninsured motorist benefits from a third-party insurer under the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (the “MVFRL”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> rather than an action in tort for recovery of damages from the co-employee, the trial court nevertheless found that this was a distinction without a difference.

The Superior Court reasoned that the plain language of Section 205 of the Act limited the reach of co-employee immunity to employment-related claims directed at a co-employee arising out of his negligence. Thus, the Superior Court concluded that the co-employee immunity provision created no bar to recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from a third-party insurer predicated upon the negligence of a third-party tortfeasor.

Gardner counters that the dictum of <em>Ducjai </em>sweeps too far in that the legislative purpose underlying the repeal of Sections 1735 and 1737 of the MVFRL was not to preclude an employee’s dual recovery of workers’ compensation and uninsured motorist benefits.

As Section 1735 is not viewed as the source of the dual recovery, its repeal cannot be seen as an evisceration. With regard to the repeal of Section 1737, that provision plainly reflected only the authorization of claims against an <em>employer’s </em>motor vehicle insurance policy—it did not authorize, address or otherwise pertain to claims against a <em>co-employee’s </em>insurer. Thus, the repeal of that provision likewise cannot evidence an intent on the part of the General Assembly to disallow claims against a co-employee’s insurer.</p>

This broader assessment recognizes that, prior to Act 44, while recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from employer-purchased plans was expressly sanctioned and insurers were precluded from crafting policy exclusions or benefit reductions based upon workers’ compensation recovery, Section 1722 of the MVFRL barred claimants in tort actions and uninsured motorist proceedings from recovering expenses paid through workers’ compensation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> and, correspondingly, Section 1720 of the MVFRL restrained a workers’ compensation carrier’s right of subrogation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Conversely, after the enactment of Act <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>44, Section 1722 does not require a reduction of a claimant’s recovery in tort and uninsured motorist proceedings by the amount of workers’ compensation benefits received, and Section 1720 no longer impedes the rights of subrogation on the part of workers’ compensation carriers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Viewed in this context, the repeal of Sections 1735 and 1737 may be seen as an integrated aspect of these comprehensive changes, rather than as reflective of a specific legislative intent to preclude the dual recovery of workers’ compensation and uninsured motorist benefits.</p>

Thus, the Superior Court understood the legislature to have been exchanging one comprehensive system for another. In the previous arrangement, a workers’ compensation carrier had no right to subrogate against an employee’s claim and the employee could not recover from the uninsured motorist carrier any amounts payable under workers’ compensation.

For example, this Court has previously stated that the coverage of the co-employee immunity provision subsumes claims arising out of the negligent conduct of the co-employee. <em>See Apple v. Reichert, </em><a href="/pa/443/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="443 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1936978" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0289-01">443 Pa. 289</a>, 292, <a href="/citations/?q=278%20A.2d%20482" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="278 A.2d 482">278 A.2d 482</a>, 483 (1971) (stating that "[t]he language of [Section 205], as we read it, clearly provides that a co-employee is immune from liability for his negligent act resulting in injury to his fellow employee”).</p>

The question whether the recovery of underinsured motorist benefits should be permitted where the claim arises out of the negligence of the co-employee is not presently before us. We note, however, that many jurisdictions have found that the tort immunity of a co-employee means that the injured employee is not "legally entitled to recover” from the co-employee and therefore, as a contractual matter, may not recover pursuant to an underinsured motorist benefits policy. <em>See generally </em>Annotation, "Automobile Uninsured Motorist Coverage: ‘Legally Entitled to Recover’ Clause as Barring Claim Compensable Under Workers’ Compensation Statute,” <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.L.R.%204th%201096" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="82 A.L.R. 4th 1096">82 A.L.R.4th 1096</a>, §5 (1996). <em>But see Barfield v. Barfield, </em><a href="/p2d/742/1107-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="742 P.2d 1107" data-case-ids="10410638" data-case-paths="/p2d/742/1107-01">742 P.2d 1107</a>, 1112 (Okla.1987)(concluding that it would be manifestly unjust to permit an insurer to avoid contractual and statutorily defined duties by asserting third-party tort immunity as a defense to payment of uninsured motorist benefits).</p>

Because Gardner’s claim against Erie arises out of Erie’s contractual responsibility to provide uninsured motorist benefits, the Superior Court classified this case as one involving a claim against a third-party tortfeasor that would be permitted under Section 303(b) of the Act, 77 P.S. §481(b). Section 303(b), however, only expressly governs actions against third parties for their conduct that causes injury or death; therefore, it is not, on its terms, controlling.</p>

Erie also argues that the award of uninsured motorist benefits would adversely affect a co-employee in the form of higher insurance premiums. As a general proposition, this is speculative and unsupported by any record evidence. As a specific proposition, it is legally incorrect: an insurer may not increase motorist premiums under an insurance contract solely because a claim for uninsured or underinsured benefits has been made unless it is determined that the insured was at fault in contributing to the accident. 75 Pa.C.S. §1793(a)(1).</p>
