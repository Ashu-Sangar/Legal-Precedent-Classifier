On November 19, 1994, at approximately 6:00 a.m., appellant went into an abandoned building where he had formerly lived with several squatters. He forcibly entered the third floor apartment shared by Donald Minnick and Marsha Smith, the deceased victim. Appellant said Mr. Minnick could leave but that Ms. Smith had to stay. Mr. Minnick left to get help from the other occupants of the third floor and when they returned they saw that Ms. <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>Smith’s mouth was bloody and she was crying. Appellant then punched Mr. Minnick and a fight ensued. Mr. Minnick and the other occupants then evicted appellant from the building.

Here, the record established that when appellant departed the dwelling the first time, he said he would return and that the incident was not over. The fire was intentionally set and ignited at 6:00 a.m. when, based on appellant’s previous night’s experience, he could assume that the occupants were sleeping. And, as is discussed later, appellant voluntarily confessed to the setting of the fire. On review of the record, the Commonwealth has demonstrated that Marcia Smith was unlawfully killed in an intentional, deliberate and premeditated manner and that appellant perpetrated the killing.

Thus, appellant’s argument is that if the convictions had been misdemeanors and not felonies, the mitigating circumstances would have been weighed differently by the sentencing jury so that appellant would have received a life term and not a death sentence.

The officer further testified that a burglary had been reported and that Appellant had a knapsack with something sticking out of it. He stated that each time he approached Appellant in his car, Appellant walked away from him. The fourth time the officer saw Appellant, he stopped him and asked for identification. Appellant told the officer his name and said that his identification was in his knapsack. Appellant took off the knapsack and the officer frisked him. The officer testified that he believed Appellant was going to flee because he kept moving his head. As a result, he placed Appellant inside his patrol car. The officer then called for back-up assistance and retrieved Appellant’s identification from his knapsack. The back-up officer arrived, and when they saw Appellant try to get out of the car, they handcuffed him.
