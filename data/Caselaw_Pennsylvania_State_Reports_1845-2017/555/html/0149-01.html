Appellant was hired with the understanding that he could maintain his private law practice. Financial records for the City reflect that appellant was a salaried employee paid for a 7-hour workday (35-hour workweek). Appellant participated in the pension plan and the workmen’s compensation plan for City employees. Appellant was issued W-2 statements, and all federal, state, and municipal taxes were withheld from his paycheck, as was the practice with all City employees. Appellant accumulated paid sick leave and vacation time pursuant to City employment records.

    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[240,1012,1152,529]]]'>Appellant’s first issue is a constitutional claim challenging the jurisdiction of the Commission on the basis of separation of powers. The second objection to the Commission’s jurisdiction is an argument of statutory construction. When a case raises both a constitutional and a non-constitutional issue, a court should not reach the constitutional issue if the case can properly be decided on non-constitutional grounds. <em>Mt. Lebanon v. County Board of Elections, </em><a href="/pa/470/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="470 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1723873" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0317-01">470 Pa. 317</a>, <a href="/pa/470/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="470 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1723873" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0317-01">368 A.2d 648</a>, 650 (Pa.1977).

    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[239,1576,1154,688]]]'>Appellant asserts that the instant investigation is barred because he is neither a public official nor a public employee. Appellant argues that he is a Solicitor as defined under the Ethics Act, and that a Solicitor is a distinct classification from public official or public employee. This distinction in classification is significant because § 404 of the Ethics Act specifically lists solicitors along with public officials and public employees as subject to the financial disclosure provisions. However, § 403 of the Ethics Act, dealing with the conflict of interest provisions, speaks only to the restricted activities of public officials or public employees. Because solicitors are specifically mentioned in § 404 and not in § 403, appellant argues that solicitors are not subject to § 403.</p>

State Ethics Commission, </em><a href="/pa/496/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="496 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1772873" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0127-01">496 Pa. 127</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="496 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1772873" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0127-01">436 A.2d 186</a> (Pa.1981). <em>Ballou </em>held that a municipal solicitor was not a public official or public employee subject to the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics Act. In that decision the court acknowledged that the Ethics Act did not specifically include solicitors within its definition of public officials or public employees. The court then looked to the fact that Ballou was not an employee of any of the governmental bodies he served, but rather was a paid consultant. Among his clients, Ballou had four second class townships, a borough, a county coroner and an industrial authority. Thus, the court reasoned, the distinct governmental bodies Ballou served were no different than any other client he served in his capacity as an attorney.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[239,1205,1158,988]]]'>Subsequent to the decision in <em>Ballou, </em>the legislature amended the Ethics Act to specifically include a definition for Solicitor and to include both full-time and part-time solicitors as persons subject to the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics Act. 65 P.S. §§ 402 and 404(a). From this background appellant argues that the legislature recognized solicitors as distinct from public officials or public employees, and, that the legislature chose only to include solicitors in the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics Act. Appellant’s argument is one' of statutory construction. Appellant points to two specific rules of statutory construction: 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1), arguing that the legislature is presumed not to perform a useless act; and 1 Pa.C.S. § 1933, arguing that the particular controls the general. Thus, appellant concludes that the specific inclusion of solicitors in § 404 and the failure to amend § 403 to include solicitors establishes that the legislature only intended solicitors to be subject to the financial disclosure provisions of § 404.</p>
    <p id="b375-3" data-blocks='[["BL_375.3",375,[241,340,1153,1235]]]'>
      <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>Appellant’s reliance on the rules of statutory construction is to no avail. The amendment to the Ethics Act wherein a definition of solicitor was set forth provides as follows: “ “Solicitor.” A person elected or appointed to the office of solicitor for the political subdivision.” 65 P.S. § 402. At the same time this definition was added, § 404 was amended by the addition of the following sentence: “[p]ersons who are full-time or part-time solicitors for political subdivisions are required to file under this section.” As appellant notes, the amendment was prompted by this court’s decision in <em>Ballou. </em>The clear intent of the amendment was to include persons, such as Ballou, who were not employees of the governmental unit which they served as solicitor, within the scope of the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics Act. Hence the emphasis by the legislature on “full-time” <em>and </em>“part-time” solicitors. There was no need for the legislature to amend § 403 of the Act, as that section clearly referred to public officials and public employees. Thus a solicitor who is also a public official or public employee was already included within the scope of § 403. Appellant’s attempt to argue that the legislature intended solicitors only to be subject to § 404 is not supported by the actual amendments enacted, the plain reading of the statute, nor the rules of statutory construction.</p>

Appellant was hired by the Mayor to fill the position of Solicitor as a full-time public employee of the City. Appellant received a salary, benefits, and other emoluments of employment. Appellant’s salary was premised on a 35-hour workweek. As Solicitor he was responsible for taking or recommending official action of a nonministerial nature. The fact that appellant continued to maintain a private law practice while holding the position of Solicitor does not diminish the fact that he held the position of Solicitor for the City as an employee.

Appellant asserts that only this court possesses the authority to regulate the ethical and professional conduct of attorneys admitted to practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. From this assertion appellant argues that the investigation by the Commission is barred. Appellant’s argument focuses on the nature of the allegations prompting the Commission’s investigation. The investigation centered on a conflict of interest arising from appellant’s representation of the City defendants in the Johnson litigation through his private law practice, while simultaneously maintaining his position as Solicitor for the City of Erie. Appellant reasons that because the investigation looked to actions he undertook through his private law practice, which actions are encompassed by the Rules of <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>Professional Conduct regarding conflicts of interest, any investigation of his alleged misconduct lies solely within the exclusive jurisdiction of this court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b377-4" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[215,512,1155,1084]]]'>Appellant’s argument is mistaken. Appellant attempts to use his status as a member of the Bar of Pennsylvania as a shield protecting him from investigation by the Ethics Commission. Although members of the Bar of Pennsylvania are uniformly subject to the professional and ethical standards imposed and regulated by this court, they are not, by virtue of that membership exempt from all other professional and ethical regulations. This court spoke to this issue in <em>Maunus v. State Ethics Commission, </em><a href="/pa/518/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="518 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1811675" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0592-01">518 Pa. 592</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="518 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1811675" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0592-01">544 A.2d 1324</a> (Pa. 1988). The precise question in <em>Maunus </em>was whether attorneys employed by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board were exempt from the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics Act by virtue of the fact that they were attorneys. That question was answered in the negative. The proposition that mere status as an attorney shields one from additional regulations aimed at proscribing conduct was rejected. Nor did the court find that its exclusive jurisdiction over the professional and ethical conduct of all attorneys was infringed by the imposition of workplace regulations on persons who also happened to be attorneys. As the court so succinctly stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[258,1619,1111,515]]]'>However, notwithstanding our substantial authority in this area, it is ludicrous to suggest that employers be constitutionally precluded from imposing ethical and professional requirements on their employees, some or all of who may be attorneys.

Appellant is not exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission by virtue of his status as an attorney. Rather, appellant is subject to the jurisdiction of this court because of his status as an attorney.. The jurisdiction of this court is exclusive in the sense that it applies equally to all members of the Bar of Pennsylvania. The exclusive jurisdiction of this court is infringed when another branch of. government attempts to regulate the conduct of attorneys merely because of their status as attorneys.

In finding that the penal statute infringed on this court’s exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the professional and ethical conduct of attorneys, it was the fact that the statute made the conduct at issue criminal if performed by an attorney which was significant.
