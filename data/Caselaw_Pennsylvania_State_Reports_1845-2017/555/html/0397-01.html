      <p id="b626-6" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[236,1194,1157,1177]]]'>. Appellant raises several claims of trial court error that have been waived. Specifically, Appellant claims that the trial court erred: 1) by denying his motion challenging the composition of the jury array; 2) by allowing Henry Brown and Anita Johnson to testify that Appellant possessed a .32 caliber handgun; 3) by allowing the testimony of Olen Clay Gorby, who was incarcerated with Appellant prior to his first trial, regarding Appellant’s admissions to him, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights; 4) in its instructions to the jury regarding the finding of mitigating circumstances and 5) in recording a sentence of death because the jury found an aggravating circumstance not listed in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d). Because these claims could have been raised on Appellant's direct appeal from his convictions in the third trial, but were not; these claims are waived. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b); <em>Wallace, </em><a href="/pa/522/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="522 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1818923" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0297-01">522 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/pa/522/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="522 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1818923" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0297-01">561 A.2d 719</a> (1989). Since this Court will no longer invoke the relaxed waiver rule to reach the merits of a claim that has been waived under the explicit terms of the PCRA, we find that these claims of trial court error are not reviewable. Additionally, Appellant maintains that his convictions should be overturned because the record does not contain the verdict slip for the conspiracy conviction. Since Petitioner not only failed to raise this claim on direct appeal, but also failed to raise it in the PCRA petitions presented to the PCRA Court, it is not eligible for appellate review. <em>See Commonwealth v. Zillgitt, </em><a href="/pa/489/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="489 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1762381" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0189-01">489 Pa. 189</a>, 193 n. 3, <a href="/pa/489/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="489 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1762381" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0189-01">413 A.2d 1078</a>, 1080 n. 3 (1980) (appellate court will not consider issue unless it is presented in properly filed post-conviction petition in the first instance). Likewise, Appellant's cursory contention that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to "incomplete” polling of the jury was not raised in his PCRA petitions and therefore, does not allow for appellate review. Appellant has failed to plead and prove that any of these waived claims meet the conditions in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3)(h) or(iii).</p>

This claim fails. As the PCRA court noted, even assuming that the prosecution’s inaction constituted misconduct, it is clear that Appellant suffered no prejudice as a result because trial counsel knew of Officer Sharkady and his testimony prior to trial and could have called him as a witness. <em>See </em>PCRA Ct. Op. at 21. Further, it is questionable whether Sharkady’s testimony was truly exculpatory. As noted above, trial counsel chose not to put Sharkady on the stand after concluding that the officer might very well have identified Appellant as the second man he had observed near the crime scene. No relief is due.</p>
