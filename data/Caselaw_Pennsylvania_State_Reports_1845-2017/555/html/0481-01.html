In December of 1977, several months after the couple married, Husband received his Bachelor of Science degree in geography, whereas, Wife had three years of college and needed credits to complete her degree. During the marriage, Wife was a homemaker until she went back to school and obtained a medical technology degree in 1988. Since then, she worked as a medical technologist, and was the main financial support for the family, because two years after she started her career, Husband suffered a work-related injury. At the time of parties separated in 1993, Wife earned $29,836 per year in employment income.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.4",706,[210,987,1160,473]]]'>Husband was unemployed for the first year and a half of the marriage, and the parties lived on public assistance during that time. On January 9, 1978, Husband began work at Tygart Steel (employer) as a laborer. He worked there until July 29, 1985, at which time he injured the tendons and ligaments in his right wrist at work. At the time of his injury, Husband earned $371.28 per week ($19,306.56 per year or $1,608.88 per month). Husband also suffers from diabetes, which is unrelated to his work injury.</p>

In April of 1988, Husband’s employer apparently concluded that he could perform light duty work, and his status was changed to partial disability. However, he continued to receive payments until December 7, 1989 when his benefits terminated. (The record does not indicate if his benefits were reduced from April 1988 through December 1989.)</p>

This lump sum award represented partial disability payments for a period of 447 and <em>1/7 </em>weeks beginning December 7,1989 (eight and one-half years, or until July 3, 1998). The Agreement also provided that Husband was “to place said commuted amount in an IRA account and in a high interest bearing account. Claimant also intend [sic] to obtain a Master’s Degree to further his employment opportunities.” As stated before, Husband had a Bachelor of Science degree. He returned to school following his work injury and obtained a teaching certificate in April 1987. However, there is no information in the record that he earned any credits towards a master’s degree, either before or after the commutation agreement. Instead, since December 1987 through the time of this appeal, Husband has worked as a part time substitute teacher for the Ringgold School District. He has not obtained a full time job of any sort since his work injury. At the time of the parties’ separation in 1993, Husband earned about $8,000.00. Wife alleges that Husband does not want to work in a school district other than Ringgold, a fact that Husband disputes.</p>

At the time of separation, the parties stipulated that the fair market value of house was $71,000.00, excluding any recorded encumbrance on the property.

The Court of Common Pleas of Washington County (trial court) appointed a Master in Divorce on March 27, 1995. Both parties consented to the entry of a final divorce decree on August 14, 1995. The Master issued a Report on January 4,1996, in which he recommended that the marital estate be divided equally, with Husband receiving the marital home and Wife receiving various bank deposit accounts and proceeds from insurance. The bulk of the accounts were funded with the commutation award. The Report further recommended that the Husband pay Wife $15,000.00 in cash within 120 days. If the amount was not paid in 120 days, the house was to be sold and. the $15,000.00 taken from the proceeds of the sale. The Master specifically found that the proceeds of the commutation of Husband’s workers’ compensation benefits were marital property because they were received during the marriage and replaced wages earned during the marriage. The trial court adopted the Master’s findings and said that Husband’s workers’ compensation settlement was reimbursement for lost wages during the marriage and therefore, was martial property.</p>

In a separate Order, the trial court granted the parties a final decree in divorce. A timely appeal to the Superior Court was filed by Husband on a number of grounds, including the allegation that the trial court erred because it failed to take into consideration the $5,557.00 of marital debt attributable to the marital residence, and that it improperly included the commutation award as a marital asset. The Superior Court affirmed the trial court, finding that the evidence supported the distribution of assets that Husband’s workers’ compensation settlement was reimbursement for lost wages during the marriage and therefore, it was marital property.

    <p id="b709-7" data-blocks='[["BL_709.6",709,[232,591,1153,1233]]]'>Before we reach the exact issue on appeal, it is useful to begin our review with a brief history of the distribution of assets and liabilities as part of a divorce. Through the first half of the twentieth century, most states limited the grounds for divorce and, before granting one, required a spouse to show some form of marital offense on the part of the other spouse. <em>See, e.g., </em>Sarah E. Fette, Comment, <em>Learning. From Our Mistakes: The Aftermath of the American Divorce Revolution as a Lesson in Law to the Republic of Ireland, </em><a href="/citations/?q=7%20Ind.%20Int%27l%20%26%20Comp.%20L.%20Rev.%20391" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Ind. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. 391">7 Ind. Int’l &amp; Comp. L.Rev. 391</a>, 393 (1997). These fault-based laws were often unrelated to the true causes of the breakdown of a marriage. In the middle of this century the divorce laws gradually relaxed, and in recent years, a number of legislatures, including ours, enacted no-fault divorce laws (although Pennsylvania retained a fault-based provision for divorce). 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 3102, 3301(a), (c), (d). Currently, such no-fault laws exist in most jurisdictions across our nation. Fette, <em>supra; See also, </em>24 Am.Jur.2d <em>Divorce and Separation </em>§ 29 (1983). The purpose of these no-fault divorce laws is to effect a “clean break” between spouses, and encourage a one-time division of marital property. Fette, <em>supra </em>(citing Cynthia Starnes, <em>Divorce and the Displaced Homemaker, </em><a href="/citations/?q=60%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%2067" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="60 U.

The traditional methods to divide property at divorce were based on very different systems, either the title<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> or the community <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>property<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> system. A majority of states, including Pennsylvania, had used some form of the title system. <em>See generally DiFlorido v.

    <p id="b710-5" data-blocks='[["BL_710.5",710,[200,672,1161,679]]]'>The theory of equitable distribution derives from the “marital partnership” theory of community property law. However, the courts attempt to split property equitably, instead of equally, taking into consideration such factors as length of marriage, the contributions of both spouses, ages and health of each spouse. Obviously, a benefit of equitable distribution versus the community property system is that equitable distribution statutes allow a considerable degree of judicial discretion in the distribution of property. Whereas community property regimes automatically grant each spouse a one-half interest in the marital asset at issue, the equitable distribution scheme allows the trial court to weigh the particular equities of the case to control the asset allocation.</p>

Following the Master's division of property, Flusband filed an exception to the Master’s Report alleging, among other things, that the Master did not take into consideration that the marital residence had a mortgage remaining of $5,557.00. The trial court overruled the exception. The Superior Court held that Husband’s contention regarding the mortgage was meritless because Husband and Wife stipulated to the value of the marital residence, including the $5,557.00 debt remaining, and that the Master took this amount into consideration when he <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>divided the property and ordered the Husband to pay Wife a $15,000.00 cash payment.

The title system (also called the common law system) of dividing property essentially required courts to award property to the spouse who held title to the property during the marriage. Bell, <em>supra </em>at 117-119 (citing Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>§ 1.02, at 4 (2d ed.1994) and Leslie Harris et <em>al., Family Law </em>329 (1996)). As a <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>result, a Husband would retain all property titled in his name, and a Wife would keep the property titled in her name. The court would divide equally the property held jointly between the divorcing spouses. Generally, if a Wife had insufficient property or earning potential to support herself after divorce, courts would award permanent alimony. The alimony was usually a set monthly amount for an indefinite period, until either party died or Wife remarried. Awards of alimony in the title system were closely related to fault-based notions of divorce. Bell, <em>supra, </em>at 119.</p>

The community property system, still in effect in some jurisdictions today, treats the married couple as an economic unit and, upon divorce, the court equally divides all property and income acquired during the marriage. A party's title to the property is irrelevant; each spouse owns one-half of all property obtained during the marriage. However, properly that either spouse gets through gift, inheritance, or which was owned before the marriage, is separate property.

In <em>Moore, </em>the husband was injured at work and received a one-time lump sum payment. The trial court found that the proceeds of the worker’s compensation commutation award were marital property subject to equitable distribution. The Superior Court reversed, finding that the benefits in question were paid in lieu of future earnings and, consequently, did not constitute marital property. <em><a href="/a2d/710/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="710 A.2d 633" data-case-ids="11833503" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/0633-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/710/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="710 A.2d 633" data-case-ids="11833503" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/0633-01">at 635</a>.</p>
    <p id="b723-8" data-blocks='[["BL_723.7",723,[250,1355,1154,474]]]'>I am persuaded by the reasoning of <em>Moore. </em>The portion of a workers’ compensation commutation award which represents the injured employee’s loss of ability to work in the future, often long past the date of separation, should not be subject to equitable distribution. A spouse has no right to the other spouse’s earnings after the marriage ends; therefore, the spouse should have no right to a workers’ compensation commutation award that is intended as a substitute for those future earnings.</p>
