The trial court found this provision of the rule to be in violation of Article I, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides:</p>

Tenants, therefore, have a constitutional right to a jury in the adjudication of such disputes today. It also found that as to low-income tenants, the supersedeas requirement of Rule 1008B had the practical effect of depriving them of a jury trial because if they could not pay rent in arrears and therefore could not secure a supersedeas, they would likely be evicted. Thus, as a practical matter, the district justice’s determination would become the final determination in the case, for in the absence of the possibility of remaining in the premises, low-income tenants would not take an appeal from the order of the district justice.</p>

    <p id="b245-6" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[234,1492,1152,581]]]'>The thrust of the trial court’s analysis is that the constitutional right to trial by jury may not be “burdened by the imposition of onerous conditions, restrictions or regulations which would make the right practically unavailable.” <em>In re Smith, </em><a href="/pa/381/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="381 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1258918" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0223-01">381 Pa. 223</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20625" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="112 A.2d 625">112 A.2d 625</a>, 629 (Pa.1955), and that the payment of rent in arrears in order to have the appeal operate as a supersedeas makes the right “practically” unavailable. This is so because, as stated above, low-income tenants will not, as a practical matter, appeal orders of district justices granting possession to landlords if the appeal does not act as a supersedeas.</p>

It also acknowledged that the General Assembly may impose restrictions that a party must meet in order to obtain a jury trial so long as they are not unduly restrictive. The jury trial issue, therefore, is not whether there may be restrictions on the right to a jury trial, but whether any such restrictions are unreasonable.

Common law remedies included self-help, distraint, and confession of judgment, all of which were modified by the Landlord and Tenant Act and by the forty years of caselaw and rules changes which followed it. The landlord’s right to distrain, for example, although permitted by the Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> has been held unconstitutional. <em>Allegheny Clarklift v.

    <p id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[216,465,1158,522]]]'>In 1995 this trend was reversed to some extent by amendments to the Landlord Tenant Act. Among these changes were the provisions of 68 P.S. § 250.513, Act of July 6, 1995, P.L. 253, No. 33, § 1, which state, in part, that a tenant’s appeal to the court of common pleas will operate as a supersedeas only if the tenant pays the amount of any judgment rendered by the lower court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and that the tenant shall deposit the monthly rent as it comes due during the pendency of the appeal. Further, the landlord is allowed to apply for release of funds being held in escrow during the appeal.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[213,1012,1159,952]]]'>It is apparent that in passing the 1995 amendments to the Landlord and Tenant Act, the General Assembly was attempting to redress the balance of fairness which- had tipped, perhaps, too far in favor of tenants. Having conferred upon tenants the right to remain in possession after their contractual right to do so had expired in derogation of the landlord’s right to control and protect his property, it was reasonable for the General Assembly to require some measure of security from tenants. In our view, these remedial changes to the act were proper and had the effect of redressing the imbalance which had come to exist between the rights of tenants and landlords. We conclude, therefore, that in balancing the constitutional rights of tenants and landlords in the context provided by the Landlord and Tenant Act, the landlord’s right to possess and control his property has greater constitutional weight than the tenant’s right to a jury trial, and that Rule 1008B does not, therefore, unconstitutionally burden the tenant’s right to a jury trial.</p>

In all other cases, the challenged legislation will be upheld unless there is no rational basis for its enactment. <em>James v.

Since there is no constitutional right to housing, no other fundamental rights are at issue. Further, there are no suspect classifications in the case, since being a low-income tenant is not a suspect classification. The appropriate analysis of the rule, therefore, is to ask whether there is any rational basis for its requirements. The apparent reason for the requirement of payment of rent in arrears in order to obtain a supersedeas is to secure the judgment in favor of the landlord. Both the trial court and the tenants argue that the landlord is merely a judgment creditor and is not entitled to preferences unavailable to other judgment creditors. However, this view is not shared by the General Assembly, which elected to put landlords in a better position than other judgment creditors. We have no difficulty concluding that there is a rational basis for this legislative treatment of landlords, for, unlike other judgment creditors, landlords who have received judgments awarding them possession are forced into an ongoing and unwilling relationship with their tenants and they are at risk that their property may be damaged by the persons against whom they have the judgment and who remain in their property. Requiring payment of up to three months arrearages in order to get a <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>supersedeas serves as some measure of protection against whatever damage might be done to the property during the appeal. Additionally, the supersedeas requirement of Rule 1008B increases the likelihood that the tenant is pursuing a good-faith claim, not merely delaying an inevitable eviction. Moreover, in most cases of this sort, the tenants have no contractual right to remain in the property during the pendency of the appeal. And finally, these protections are particularly appropriate in the context of this case, where low-income tenants are likely to be judgment proof. Since there is a rational basis for the supersedeas requirement of Rule 1008B, there is no equal protection violation.</p>

Confession of judgment for the possession of real property in connection with a residential lease executed by a natural person has been abolished. The abolition has been effected by amending Rule 2970 defining the scope of the action to include a confession of judgment for possession of real property arising from "an instrument, other than a residential lease executed by a natural person.” Rule 2971 governing the commencement of the action has been revised by adding an averment to the complaint that judgment is not being entered against a natural person in connection with a residential lease.</blockquote>

The issue of whether the lease has expired by its express terms or through the tenant’s breach of a material condition such as non-payment of rent remains a live controversy for the jury to consider. That a tenant would forego presenting his or her case to the jury once removed from the premises is not the measure of the constitutionality of the rule. A jury trial is ultimately available, and the jury is in no way prevented from fixing the parties’ rights in the premises. If the jury finds in favor of the tenant, the hardships inflicted by the writ of possession can be taken account of in the form of a damages award. Also, an erroneously evicted tenant’s right of occupancy can still be vindicated through an ejectment action. <em>See Soffer v. Beech, </em><a href="/pa/487/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="487 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1759077" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0255-01">487 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="487 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1759077" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0255-01">409 A.2d 337</a> (Pa.1979).
