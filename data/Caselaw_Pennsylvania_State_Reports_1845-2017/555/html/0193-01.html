Because we discern no such requirement, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[215,899,1151,576]]]'>On March 4, 1995, Appellee, David Todd (“Todd”), was arrested for driving under the influence, 75 Pa.C.S. §3731(a), and submitted to a breathalyzer test as required under Section 1547(a) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. §1547(a). Todd provided inadequate breath samples in three attempts, and the testing officer terminated the test. The police subsequently reported a refusal to the Commonwealth, Department of Transportation (“DOT”), which suspended Todd’s license for one year. Thereafter, Todd filed a statutory appeal in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County pursuant to Section 1550(a) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. §1550(a).</p>
    <p id="b415-7" data-blocks='[["BL_415.7",415,[211,1502,1155,676]]]'>At the <em>de novo </em>hearing, the arresting officer testified that he initially had stopped Todd because he was exceeding the posted speed limit and driving erratically. According to the officer’s uncontradicted testimony, upon bringing the vehicle to a stop, Todd fled the scene of the traffic stop on foot, and, when he was ultimately detained, denied having been the operator of his vehicle. The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol on Todd’s breath, saw that Todd’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and observed that Todd was unsteady on his feet. After warning Todd of the statutory consequences of a refusal to submit to chemical alcohol testing, Todd consented to a test and accompanied the officer to a local police station for administration of the test.</p>
    <p id="b415-8" data-blocks='[["BL_415.8",415,[209,2211,1151,141]],["BL_416.1",416,[232,318,1158,678]]]'>The officer testified that the breathalyzer machine used, the Intoxilyzer 5000, operated on a three-minute test cycle, so the blood alcohol content had to be recorded within that time <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>period to obtain an accurate result. The officer, a qualified test administrator, informed Todd of DOT regulations requiring that two consecutive actual breath tests be accomplished. <em>See </em>67 Pa.Code §77.24(b)(1). According to the officer, Todd provided an inadequate breath sample on his first attempt, and he informed Todd of the deficiency and warned him that failure to supply sufficient samples would be deemed a refusal. Thereafter, Todd made two additional inadequate attempts, following which the officer declared a refusal, and told Todd to stop blowing. The officer acknowledged that the termination of the test occurred prior to the completion of the three-minute test cycle, accepting as a possibility the estimate that approximately thirty seconds remained in such cycle.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[231,1020,1158,732]]]'>Todd also testified at the hearing. He generally acknowledged the circumstances of his arrest, expressly conceding that he had attempted to evade arrest by falsely stating that he had not been the driver of his vehicle. He also admitted that he had consumed five to six servings of beer prior to his arrest. Concerning the breath test, Todd asserted that he “may not have been blowing that good” into the machine during his first attempt, as he was not familiar with the machine. He claimed, however, that, after the arresting officer emphasized the consequence of a failure to provide an adequate sample, he exhaled with as much force as he was able to generate on the second and third attempts. Todd also acknowledged a prior conviction for driving under the influence. .</p>
    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.5",416,[232,1780,1157,572]]]'>Following the hearing, the trial court sustained Todd’s appeal and reinstated his operating privileges. In its opinion, the trial court made factual findings that were generally consistent with the officer’s testimony, finding as a fact that Todd had failed to provide a sufficient breath sample, despite three attempts. Nevertheless, emphasizing that Todd never expressly or impliedly manifested an intention to refuse testing, the trial court concluded that the breath test was terminated by the police officer rather than by Todd’s refusal to supply a sufficient breath sample. The trial court reasoned that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b417-3" data-blocks='[["BL_417.3",417,[270,326,1109,525]]]'>

    <p id="b417-4" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[228,873,1153,630]]]'>DOT appealed, and a divided Commonwealth Court affirmed. The majority agreed with the trial court that, where a police officer terminates the testing procedure prior to the completion of the full testing cycle of the breathalyzer, the licensee’s provision of deficient breath samples does not constitute a refusal to submit to the test. The dissent, on the other hand, emphasized that a licensee’s failure to supply a sufficient breath sample is a <em>per se </em>refusal, absent valid medical reasons to explain the failure. Thus, the dissent concluded that Todd had a full, fair and reasonable opportunity to complete the test and that his unsatisfactory performance in three attempts was a refusal.</p>

Moreover, this Court has found that the failure to supply adequate breath samples during multiple attempts to administer a test was a deemed refusal to submit to testing, <em>see Boucher, </em><a href="/pa/547/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="547 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="468738" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0440-01">547 Pa. at 448</a>, <a href="/a2d/691/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="691 A.2d 450" data-case-ids="11913077,468738" data-case-paths="/a2d/691/0450-01,/pa/547/0440-01">691 A.2d at 454</a>, and the Commonwealth Court has issued an extensive line of decisions consistent with this principle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Implicit in these decisions is a <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>recognition that the purposes of the implied consent law would be undermined if licensees, by their volitional conduct, were permitted to thwart testing during administration.</p>
    <p id="b419-4" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[230,507,1151,581]]]'>Todd essentially concedes that, if the testing officer had not terminated the test before three minutes, and his performance remained deficient, his refusal would have been evident. He emphasizes, however, that at no time did he himself terminate the test or express a refusal. Where a licensee is not manifesting overt signs of refusal, Todd contends that the failure to exert a conscious effort should be measured against the entire length of the testing cycle. According to Todd, any contrary rule would allow the police unfettered discretion to prevent an otherwise cooperating driver from completing a test and preserving his license privileges.</p>

From the statute and DOT regulations, well established rules have evolved governing the procedures for obtaining and analyzing breath to determine alcohol levels. Such authorities, however, do not establish the mandatory window of opportunity advocated by Todd and suggested by the Commonwealth Court’s opinion. Indeed, the Commonwealth Court on a number of occasions has held that a refusal of chemical testing is supported by substantial evidence where, as here, the test administrator testifies that the licensee did not provide sufficient breath. <em>See, e.g., Pappas, </em>669 A.2d at 508.</p>
