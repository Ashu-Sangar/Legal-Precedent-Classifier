However, the individual privacy rights at issue are not strained by a search of the entire single family residence. Rather than supporting Pennsylvania’s protection of individual privacy rights, appellant’s position renders that important tradition impotent by requesting that this court extend it to absurd extremes. For example, a named eyewitness tells the <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>police that he was in Mr. Smith’s house 10 minutes ago, where he saw a dead body in the living room.

Under appellant’s theory, the police would be forced to return to the issuing magistrate to obtain another warrant to search the remainder of the house. Clearly a result not contemplated by the policy reasons which underscore the enhanced privacy rights found in Article 1, Section 8.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[218,874,1158,520]]]'>Applying the above analysis to the instant case, initially we note that appellant stipulated that the items to be seized were described with specificity and that police had probable cause to search the basement. Moreover, appellant does not assert that the premises to be searched in the warrant were not described with particularity. Thus, based on our analysis above, the scope of the search authorized by the warrant was lawful if it was limited to places within the premises where the police had probable cause to believe that the items to be seized could be found.</p>
    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[214,1442,1160,581]]]'>The search warrant included, among the items to be seized, any records of occupancy and/or ownership of property, any controlled substances, any drug paraphernalia, and any records, documents or photos related to drug trafficking. We find that the police could reasonably believe that these items would be found in places other than the basement and thus, police did not need to limit the scope of the search only to the basement. Moreover, appellant does not challenge that these specified items could be located in any of the areas that were searched by the police. Thus, we find that the search of appellant’s home was lawful.</p>

Accordingly, the search warrant issued in the instant case was not <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>overbroad pursuant to Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.
