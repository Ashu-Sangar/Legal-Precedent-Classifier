When the officer arrived at the home, he found Appellant bent over Jordan Shenk (“Jordan”), who was the eight month old son of Pamela Shenk (“Shenk”), Appellant’s girlfriend. Appellant stated to the police officer that he was performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (“CPR”) on the infant because he had found Jordan unresponsive in bed upstairs. The officer continued mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until an ambulance crew arrived at 2:56 a.m. At that time, Jordan was not breathing and had no pulse. The baby’s skin was an ashen color, and he had approximately eleven purplish-brown marks on his lower chest and upper stomach. Jordan was transported to Lancaster General Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 3:40 a.m.</p>

The detectives also told Appellant that he was not under arrest, did not have to answer any questions put to him, and could leave the police barracks at any time.</p>

The terms “accused” and “all criminal prosecutions” are not mere verbiage with which we may summarily dispense. Rather, they are necessary terms which define the scope of this right. Were we to hold .the attachment of the right to counsel is independent of the creation of an “accused” and the initiation of a “criminal prosecution,” and is instead triggered by some earlier interaction between the police and the defendant, we would divorce this right from its constitutional basis.

Recognizing a Sixth Amendment-type right to counsel at this stage of the proceeding would enhance the reliability of any confessions or statements produced at this stage. Yet, this is not the only concern to be weighed here. Countervailing the concerns of a suspect being interviewed by the police is the interest of the state in administering justice in a constitutional manner. Clearly, a holding by this court which would provide that every person being interviewed by the police had an Article I, § 9 right to counsel - distinct from his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel—would complicate the criminal investigative process. For example, the procedural safeguards for waiving a Sixth Amendment-type right to counsel are more onerous and would require judicial intervention at an earlier stage in the investigative process. We find that such a complication is simply not warranted. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the right to counsel, by its terms, does not apply where adversarial judicial proceedings have not commenced against the suspect.

The Commonwealth also showed that these injuries were inflicted with a level of force which would exceed employment of CPR. Furthermore, the jury had before it Appellant’s full and detailed confession to the crime. The inculpatory impact of this confession was heightened by the fact that it dovetailed with the forensic evidence, and showed that Jordan had not died due to CPR-related injuries, but rather was beaten to death by Appellant in a fit of rage.
