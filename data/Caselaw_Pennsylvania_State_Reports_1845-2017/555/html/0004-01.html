    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[238,557,1158,589]]]'>For purposes of this appeal, the record below establishes the following relevant facts. On January 3, 1995, David Bolasky, an Allentown architect, went to an Allentown apartment building which he owned in order to collect rent from his tenants. Mr. Bolasky was robbed and killed in the third floor apartment. His body was found on January 6, 1995, hog-tied and wrapped in bed sheets, in the woods along a secluded road in Allentown. Several weeks after the murder, the tenant of the third floor apartment, Miguel Moreno, made statements to the police implicating himself, George Lopez, George Barbosa and Appellant in the robbery and murder of Mr. Bolasky.</p>
    <p id="b228-6" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[236,1188,1162,639]]]'>At trial, Moreno testified that he, Appellant, George Lopez and Barbosa devised a plan to rob and murder Mr. Bolasky, who was Moreno’s landlord. Under the pretense that Moreno had rent money for Mr. Bolasky, Moreno brought Mr. Bolasky to his third floor apartment, where Appellant, Lopez and Barbosa were waiting for him. Moreno testified that he then left the apartment, at which time Mr. Bolasky was killed. A short time later, Moreno observed Appellant and Barbosa carrying Mr. Bolasky’s body, tied and wrapped in bed sheets, down the stairs and placing the body in Mr. Bolasky’s van. He testified that Lopez, Barbosa and Appellant then drove off and he went to clean up his apartment.</p>

      <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>George Barbosa was also called as a Commonwealth witness. Prior to Appellant’s trial, Barbosa had confessed to his role in the murder in statements made to Captain Anthony Bucarey of the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office. The confession was tape recorded by Captain Bucarey. In his confession, Barbosa also implicated Appellant, Lopez and Moreno in the planning and execution of Mr. Bolasky’s murder. Barbosa specifically indicated that he and Appellant hid in the bathroom while Moreno brought Mr. Bolasky to the third floor apartment. According to Barbosa’s statement, once Mr. Bola-sky was inside, Appellant struck his head with a .22 pistol. Barbosa admitted that he attempted to break Mr. Bolasky’s neck with a string. When this failed, however, Barbosa stated that he then put a towel around Mr. Bolasky’s neck and took turns with Appellant and Lopez tightening the towel around his neck until he was dead. Barbosa stated that he and Appellant then wrapped Mr. Bolasky’s body in bed sheets, carried it down the stairs, and placed the body in Mr. Bola-sky’s van. He, Lopez and Barbosa then drove to a desolate area of Lehigh County, dumped Mr. Bolasky’s body and abandoned the van. Barbosa pled guilty and received a life sentence.</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[212,1515,1157,683]]]'>On the witness stand at trial, Barbosa testified that he was previously interviewed by Captain Bucarey and that he had told him that there were other people involved in the robbery and murder of Mr. Bolasky. However, while Barbosa did testify about the involvement of George Lopez and Moreno in the killing of Mr. Bolasky, he excluded any reference to Appellant’s involvement and further refused to answer questions specifically regarding Appellant’s involvement. In light of Barbosa’s refusal to testify against Appellant, the Commonwealth was allowed, over defense objections, to call Captain Bucarey to the stand to read Barbosa’s transcribed statements from the tape-recorded interview which explicitly implicated Appellant in the murder.</p>

Daniel Lopez recounted that Appellant told him that he had gone to Moreno’s apartment and hid in the bathroom with another individual while they waited for Mr. Bolasky to arrive. Once Mr. Bolasky arrived, Appellant told Daniel Lopez that they took approximately $300.00 in cash that Mr. Bolasky was carrying. Mr. Bolasky was then struck in the head with a gun and strangled by placing and twisting a towel around his neck. According to Daniel Lopez’s testimony, however, Appellant told him that he “did not agree with what was happening there.” N.T., March 12, 1996, at 163. After Mr. Bolasky was dead, the conspirators searched him for additional valuables. Darnel Lopez further testified that Appellant reported to him that they then wrapped Mr. Bolasky’s body in bed sheets and he and another carried the body down the stairs to Mr. Bolasky’s van. Appellant told Daniel Lopez that he and the others then took the van and dumped Mr. Bolasky’s body.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[228,1241,1159,838]]]'>In his single claim of error presented in this appeal, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in allowing Barbosa’s prior statements from his interview with Captain Bucarey to be read into evidence because Barbosa was unavailable to be cross-examined on those prior statements. In rejecting Appellant’s argument, the trial court found that the statements were properly admissible as substantive evidence under <em>Commonwealth v. Brady, </em><a href="/pa/510/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="510 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1796921" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0123-01">510 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/pa/510/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="510 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1796921" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0123-01">507 A.2d 66</a> (1986), and its progeny. Although we agree with Appellant that it was error for the trial court to admit Barbosa’s prior statements against him, we find that such error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm Appellant’s judgment of sentence. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>Court explained that hearsay concerns are virtually nonexistent where an out-of-court declarant is a witness in a judicial proceeding. <em><a href="/pa/510/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="510 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1796921" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0123-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/510/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="510 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1796921" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0123-01">at 130</a>, <a href="/pa/510/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="510 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1796921" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0123-01">507 A.2d at 69</a>. Appellant does not dispute that the first prong of <em>Brady </em>is satisfied. Barbosa’s prior statement was tape-recorded and was therefore made under reliable circumstances. <em>See Commonwealth v. Wilson, </em><a href="/pa/550/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="550 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="281232" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0518-01">550 Pa. 518</a>, <a href="/a2d/707/1114-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="707 A.2d 1114" data-case-ids="11862133,281232" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/1114-01,/pa/550/0518-01">707 A.2d 1114</a> (1998) (for purposes of <em>Brady, </em>verbatim account of prior inconsistent statement that is tape-recorded is made under highly reliable circumstances). In terms of the second prong, the trial court found that Barbosa, despite his refusal to testify either about his prior confession as it related to Appellant or about Appellant’s involvement in the murder, was available for cross-examination because he had taken the stand at trial. Thus, the trial court found that his prior inconsistent statements were admissible under <em>Brady. </em>We disagree.</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">391 U.S. 123</a>, <a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">88 S.Ct. 1620</a>, <a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">20 L.Ed.2d 476</a> (1968), which held that a defendant’s confrontation rights are violated where a non-testifying co-defendant’s out-of-court statement expressly implicating the defendant is introduced at their joint trial. Just as the reliability of the co-<a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>defendant’s out-of-court statement cannot be tested when the co-defendant does not testify, the reliability of Barbosa’s out-of-court statement implicating Appellant could not be tested at trial where Barbosa refused to testify about Appellant's involvement in the crime. It would be inconsistent, illogical and fundamentally unfair to allow the Commonwealth to introduce an out-of-court inculpatory statement of a non-testifying co-conspirator who is no longer a co-defendant, where the admission of the same statement of a non-testifying co-conspirator who is tried jointly with the defendant is prohibited.</p>

For example, Mr. Bolasky’s body was found hog-tied, with a twisted towel around his neck, and wrapped in bed sheets as both Moreno and Daniel Lopez’s testimony indicated. Further, the medical examiner confirmed that Mr. Bolasky sustained a blow to the head and that his cause of death had been strangulation by ligature.</p>

In support of his contention that Barbosa’s statement was not cumulative of the testimony given by Moreno and Daniel Lopez, Appellant cites <em>Commonwealth v. Bujanowski, </em><a href="/pa-super/418/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="418 Pa. Super. 163" data-case-ids="916874" data-case-paths="/pa-super/418/0163-01">418 Pa.Super. 163</a>, <a href="/pa-super/418/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="418 Pa.

In <em>Bujanowski, </em>the Superior Court held that prior statements made by a non-testifying co-conspirator, implicating the defendant, were not admissible as substantive evidence. The Superior Court further found that the error in admitting the statements was not harmless since the statements were the only evidence linking the defendant to the crimes he had been charged with. Appellant argues that his case is similar to <em>Bujanowski </em>in that the inadmissible statement in his case, as in <em>Bujanowski, </em>was the only evidence directly implicating him in the murder of Mr. Bolasky. We disagree. Here, both Moreno’s and Daniel Lopez’s testimony provided evidence that Appellant actively participated in the murder of Mr. Bolasky. <em>See Commonwealth v. Carter, </em><a href="/pa-super/443/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="443 Pa.

In this regard, I note that Barbosa’s refusals to answer questions occurred during his direct examination by the Commonwealth. On cross-examination, however, Barbosa provided answers which, although punctuated by equivocations and memory lapses, were generally responsive to the questions posed by defense counsel. Indeed, Romero’s counsel was able to elicit helpful testimony from Barbosa that suggested a motive for fabricating his prior inculpatory statement (Barbosa testified that police had told him that Romero had implicated him in the murder). Accordingly, I would hold that Romero’s rights under the confrontation clause were not violated, and that the admission <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>of Barbosa’s prior extrajudicial statement did not violate the evidentiary rule of <em>Commonwealth v.
