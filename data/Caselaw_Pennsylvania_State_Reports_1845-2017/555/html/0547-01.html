The young women decided to have a party at the Dupert house, and Mrs. Dupert purchased alcohol for the party. After imbibing alcohol, two of the girls and Dupert’s daughter retired to her upstairs bedroom and went to sleep, while the two other girls had passed out in the basement. During the late evening of August 12 and the early morning of August 13,1994, Dupert sexually assaulted the two girls in the basement. One girl awoke to find Dupert raping her. When she repelled his attack, Dupert stopped having intercourse but began to perform cunnilingus on her. After she succeeded in fending off the sexual violations by Dupert, he advanced to the other sleeping girl. Dupert started kissing this girl on her legs, moving upward toward her vagina. She awoke and prevented additional sexual assault by curling her body into a ball.</p>

In his PCRA petition, Dupert alleged ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to 1) call an important fact witness; 2) file a motion to modify his sentences; and 3) discuss with him the importance of character witnesses and produce character witnesses for him. We are only reviewing the issue of character witnesses at this time. On August 13, 1996, the PCRA court conducted an evidentiary hearing. The PCRA court heard testimony concerning the absence of character witnesses at trial from Dupert’s trial counsel, Allen Welch (Welch), Du-pert’s father, Clarence Dupert, and several other witnesses. Dupert did not testify at his PCRA hearing, and he had not testified in his case during trial.</p>

Welch was folly aware of the importance of calling character witnesses and had done so often during his fifteen (15) years of practice, both as a public defender and private criminal defense attorney, and Welch had tried more than 175 cases. Welch confirmed that, as a matter of strategy, he prefers not to use character witnesses, if he cannot locate at least five (5) people willing to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 16, 31 (R.R. at 18-19, 20, 35). Welch stated that it is his customary practice where credibility is an issue to ask his clients for the names of people who could be character witnesses and investigate any names that a client provides. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 31-32, 37-39, (R.R. at 18-19, 35-36, 41-43). After interviewing all potential character witnesses, Welch makes a recommendation to his client. He testified that if a client insists on calling a character witness, regardless of his preference, Welch would use that person, if he or she were available. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32 (R.R. 35-36). Welch explained that his process of investigating, interviewing, and choosing character witnesses generates a clear paper trail. Because Dupert’s file does not indicate the existence of any character witnesses, Welch was fairly certain that Dupert had not given him any names to investigate. <em>Id. </em>at 15-17, 30, 32-33 (R.R. at 19-21, 34, 36-37).

      <em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 72-73 (R.R. 72-73, 76-77).

Three other witnesses appeared to testify about their role as character witnesses. Rather than having multiple witnesses provide repetitious testimony, the PCRA court relaxed the rules of evidence and allowed Dupert’s counsel to ask the three witnesses questions through a colloquy to elicit concise, relevant responses. All of the five people claimed that they were willing and able to testify at the trial about Dupert’s reputation as a truthful and law-abiding person, but Welch had contacted none of them. <em>Id. </em>at 42-60 (R.R. 46-64).</p>

The PCRA court concluded that Welch had conversed with Dupert about character witnesses, but neither Dupert nor anyone else offered to give Welch any names. Crucial to the analysis of the PCRA court was its belief that Welch understood the value of using character witnesses in this case, and he always investigated potential character witnesses when names were available. The PCRA court reasoned that had Dupert’s father possessed a list of character witnesses, he would have said something to Welch during the trial, which he did not do.</p>

Where a trial counsel has apprised his client of the importance of character witnesses, but the client refuses to provide any names to his attorney, the counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to call character witnesses. <em>See Commonwealth v. Walker, </em><a href="/pa/540/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="540 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="472214" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0080-01">540 Pa. 80</a>, 96-97, <a href="/pa/540/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="656 A.2d 90" data-case-ids="472214,7864474" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0080-01,/a2d/656/0090-01">656 A.2d 90</a>, 98 (1995).</p>
    <p id="b776-6" data-blocks='[["BL_776.5",776,[219,1264,1164,564]]]'>In the present case, the record supports the PCRA court’s factual determination that Welch had discussed with Dupert the importance of character witnesses, but Dupert refused, or neglected, to provide any names to Welch. After hearing testimony from both sides, the PCRA court concluded that Dupert’s father never offered to provide Welch with a list of names at trial. Dupert simply did not carry his burden of proof to show that Welch knew of any potential character witnesses. Consequently, Welch’s reasonable basis for failing to call character witnesses was not his lack of asking, but his lack of information.</p>

In <em>Weiss, </em>we clearly concluded that where there are only two direct witnesses, failure to present available character evidence creates a claim of <em>arguable merit, </em>which is the first prong. <em>See Weiss, </em><a href="/pa/530/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="530 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1833026" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0001-01">530 Pa. at 6</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="530 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1833026" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0001-01">606 A.2d at 442</a>. The defendant in <em>Weiss </em>fulfilled the second prong by demonstrating that trial counsel chose not to call any character witnesses because of his preconceived notions about their willingness to testify and the benefits of the testimony they could offer. <em><a href="/pa/530/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="530 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1833026" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0001-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/530/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="530 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1833026" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0001-01">

In the present case, the Superior Court has mistakenly suggested that any time there are only two direct witnesses in a criminal case, credibility is a paramount issue, and the defendant’s trial counsel presents no character witnesses, the trial counsel, <em>a fortiori, </em>lacked a reasonable basis for his decision. Not only is that presumption a misinterpretation of our holding in <em>Weiss, </em>it does not make sense. Many good reasons can exist for not calling character evidence, such as when no people are willing to testify or when the defendant can supply no names.</p>

The Superior Court examined the PCRA hearing record and determined that Welch had not discussed with Dupert the importance of presenting character testimony. Specifically, the Superior Court concluded that Welch never testified that his customary practice is to discuss the use of character evidence with his clients; the trial counsel merely stated what he usually does after a client gives him names. That conflicting factual finding belies the evidence relied on by the PCRA court. Explaining his customary practice at the PCRA hearing, Welch testified that “the way I do it is to ask the client to tell me who can be the character witnesses ... If a client tells me that he has character witnesses, then I must pursue them.” N.T. PCRA Hearing, Aug. 13,1996 at 38 (R.R. 42).</p>

Nonetheless, the PCRA court had sufficient evidence before it to find that Welch had a practice of informing his clients about the importance of character evidence, and Dupert failed to demonstrate that his attorney strayed from his routine. The record fully supports the finding of the PCRA court, which held that Welch pursued no leads because he had no leads.</p>
