HHY is a residential juvenile treatment facility in Adams County, which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>mental health treatment services. On or about September 8, 1995, several juveniles escaped from HHY and, along with several adults, broke into a private residence near the facility, where they remained for several days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the time, the owner of the residence, Carrie Staten, was visiting her daughter in Baltimore. A few days later, M.W. escaped and joined the others who had broken into Ms. Staten’s home. During their stay, the trespassers caused extensive damage to the residence, and, in particular, emptied Ms. Staten’s closets and drawers, destroyed her clothing, punched holes in the walls, damaged her furniture, broke glassware, tore a telephone out of the wall, set fires on her carpets, and discharged a shotgun inside the house. They also amassed a considerable telephone bill through calls made to a “sex line.” Ultimately, M.W. was arrested and a juvenile petition was filed, seeking an adjudication of delinquency on charges of burglary, criminal trespass, <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>criminal mischief, recklessly endangering another person, harassment, and conspiracy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Although the actual damages were much higher, $29,764.34, the juvenile court considered $1,000 reasonable, stating that it was impossible to distinguish between damages caused by one trespasser and those caused by the others.

      <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>In spite of his agreement to pay restitution, M.W. appealed the restitution order to the Superior Court, arguing that because the Commonwealth failed to either prove that he directly caused the victim’s losses or was otherwise criminally responsible for such losses, the restitution order was improper. A divided panel of the Superior Court vacated the order of restitution, reasoning that the offense which M.W. admitted, criminal trespass, did not contain damage to tangible property as an essential element. Thus, the Superior Court concluded that the damage to the residence was not a direct result of M.W.’s delinquent conduct, and therefore restitution could not be ordered. The Superior Court also determined that, since M.W. was not the initial trespasser who set in motion the resulting damages, the damages could not be viewed as an indirect result of his delinquent act. Judge Del Sole dissented, stating his view that since M.W. voluntarily entered a plea to criminal trespass and agreed to restitution as part of a negotiated plea agreement, the restitution order was proper.</p>

First, the Commonwealth contends that the order of restitution constitutes a discretionary aspect of sentencing, which would require the filing of a concise statement of reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal as part of the Superior Court brief, and as M.W. did not preserve this issue by including such a statement in his Superior Court brief, his appeal should have been quashed. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); <em>Commonwealth v.

We recognize that there has been some confusion as to whether an appeal of an order of restitution implicates the legality or the discretionary aspects of a particular sentence in a criminal proceeding. <em>See In the Interest of Dublinski, </em><a href="/a2d/695/0827-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="695 A.2d 827" data-case-ids="11973082" data-case-paths="/a2d/695/0827-01">695 A.2d 827</a>, 828-29 (Pa.Super.1997)(collecting cases). Where such a challenge is directed to the trial court’s authority to impose restitution, it concerns the legality of the sentence; however, where the challenge is premised upon a claim that the <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>restitution order is excessive, it involves a discretionary aspect of sentencing. <em>See generally Walker, </em><a href="/pa-super/446/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="446 Pa.
