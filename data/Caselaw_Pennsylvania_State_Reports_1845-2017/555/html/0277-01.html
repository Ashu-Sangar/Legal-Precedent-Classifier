For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the statute is constitutionally sound. We thus affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

      <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>The relevant facts are undisputed. Appellant sent documents by telecopy, or “fax,” to about forty people at their offices. Appellant sent many of the documents repeatedly so that altogether, the forty individuals received about four hundred faxes. The faxes contained racial and ethnic statements and derogatory comments about the medical and legal professions. The recipients included faculty and staff of the University of Pittsburgh, a temporary employment agency staffed by African-Americans, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) headquarters, an African-American former professional football player, law firms and other businesses. The faxes were unsolicited and sent anonymously. The recipients testified that the faxes disrupted their offices and invoked emotions of anger and fear. They complained to the police.</p>
    <p id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[223,1137,1157,573]]]'>The police investigated the incidents and ultimately arrested Appellant. He was charged with multiple counts of harassment by communication or address under 18 Pa.C.S. § 5504(a)(1) and (a)(2), and ethnic intimidation under 18 Pa. C.S. § 2710. After a jury trial, Appellant was found guilty of thirty-six counts of harassment by communication or address under Section 5504(a)(2) and not guilty of ethnic intimidation. Appellant filed an appeal raising in part that the harassment by communication or address statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague in violation of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The court explained that the right to free speech is not absolute and that certain classes of speech, such as obscenity and fighting words, may be restricted. It found that Appellant’s use of racial and sexual epithets in his faxes, which were sent repeatedly and anohymously, had no legitimate purpose. The court concluded that the faxes were intended to harass <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>and were not a form of communication safeguarded by the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[242,455,1153,694]]]'>The Superior Court affirmed. It explained that the statute is not overly broad on its face or as applied to Appellant because it is directed at conduct rather than speech and requires an intent to harass. The court stated that the legislature has a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from harassment. In addition, the court held that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. It explained that since Appellant was found guilty of having the specific intent to harass the fax recipients, he could not complain that he did not know what he was doing was criminal. The court further stated that the statute is not so vague that it could be arbitrarily enforced by police officers. We granted Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal on these issues of first impression.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In <em>United States v. Lampley, <a href="/f2d/573/0783-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="573 F.2d 783" data-case-ids="913834" data-case-paths="/f2d/573/0783-01">573 </a></em><a href="/f2d/573/0783-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="573 F.2d 783" data-case-ids="913834" data-case-paths="/f2d/573/0783-01">F.2d 783</a> (3d Cir.1978), for example, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals found that a defendant could not be confused where a statute required that he intend to perform acts of harassment to be culpable. <em>See also Richards, </em><a href="/idaho/127/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="127 Idaho 31" data-case-ids="11921241" data-case-paths="/idaho/127/0031-01">127 Idaho 31</a>, <a href="/idaho/127/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="127 Idaho 31" data-case-ids="11921241" data-case-paths="/idaho/127/0031-01">896 P.2d 357</a> (specific intent requirement precludes complaint that the crime of harassment was not understood). The statute at issue requires the Com<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>monwealth to establish that Appellant had the intent to harass. Finally, the jury found that Appellant made repeated communications anonymously with an intent to harass and thereby violated Section 5504(a)(2). Given the ordinary meaning of these words, and the fact that Appellant anonymously sent four hundred faxes to forty people, he plainly engaged in the conduct proscribed by the statute. Appellant’s vagueness challenge lacks merit.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[228,788,1148,204]]]'>In sum, we conclude that Pennsylvania’s statute defining the offense of harassment by communication or address, 18 Pa. C.S. § 5504, is not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The decision of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

While Appellant alleged that the statute violated the Pennsylvania Constitution, he did not develop this claim on appeal to the Superior Court and it held that it was waived. Appellant only presents an argument under the United States Constitution to this Court and thus that is the only claim before us.</p>

The record before the Court, however, does not reflect that standing was contested below. As such, we find that standing is not currently an issue before this Court.</p>
