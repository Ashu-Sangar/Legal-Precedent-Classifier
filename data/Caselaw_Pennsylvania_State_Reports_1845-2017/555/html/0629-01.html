The vehicle involved was a Chevrolet Nova. A search of the wooded area adjacent to where the automobile was parked resulted in the discovery of the body of the deceased, Anthony Milano. The body was lying face up with the left eye partially open, contusions in the facial area, and multiple “slashings” on the neck and throat. A postmortem examination revealed that the victim had been assaulted about the face and had sustained lacerations about the face, throat, neck and shoulder. The pathologist concluded that the deceased had been kicked and/or punched in both the right and left temple areas and the chin. A hairline fracture at the base of the skull was attributed to a blunt instrument striking the head. The lacerations were made by a sharp instrument, consistent with a utility knife. The pathologist opined that the “slashings” were hard enough and deep enough to sever the fifth and sixth vertebrae and were too numerous to count. It was also concluded that the victim aspirated on his own blood for five to ten minutes before expiring. Officer McGuigan testified that when he arrived at the scene he first observed the vehicle ablaze and assisted in extinguishing the fire. The vehicle was identified as being the 1976 Chevrolet Nova registered in the name of Rose Milano, the mother of the deceased. Police records further established <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>that Mrs. Milano had reported the deceased as a “missing person” when he failed to return to the family home in the early morning hours of December 15, 1987. This officer further testified that prior to the response to the car fire, at approximately 1:30 a.m. on December 15, he had responded, with two fellow officers, to a reported stolen car which was found in a parking lot of the Edgely Inn. To pursue their investigation they began interrogating the customers in the Edgely Inn. During that investigation he observed Chester, Laird, and the decedent at the bar. The time was fixed at approximately 1:30 a.m., December 15. He requested identification from each of these individuals and was satisfied that they were not involved in the car theft. At approximately 2:10 a.m., while he was still in the parking lot, he observed the deceased, Chester, and Laird leave the Inn together. This testimony was confirmed by the two officers that responded with Officer McGuigan to the stolen car complaint.</blockquote>

Gri'scavage’s apartment was located less than a mile from the murder scene. Griseavage testified that both were visibly agitated and were covered with blood. Chester attempted to explain their condition by stating that they had been engaged in a fight and “the dude is dead.” Griseavage took both men to Laird’s apartment where they attempted to remove and conceal their bloody clothing. The Commonwealth also produced additional witnesses to whom appellants made incriminatory statements and actions that reflected their complicity in the murder. The Commonwealth also produced a transcription of a consensually intercepted telephone call between Chester and Laird, during which Laird suggested that Chester leave town, recommended ways Chester could pass a polygraph <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>examination, and commented on the Commonwealth’s inability to prove a case without evidence.

During the January 1997 hearings on the petition, the PCRA court ruled that only issues arising from the guilt phase of petitioner’s original trial were cognizable under the current PCRA. The PCRA court reached this conclusion by reference to the provisions in the most recent amendments to the PCRA that limit review of claims to only those issues that “so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(2)(i) and (ii). The PCRA court reasoned that as penalty phase issues relate to the imposition of sentence, rather than the determination of guilt, penalty phase issues do not provide a basis for relief under the current PCRA. The PCRA court held that the PCRA in effect at the time of the hearing controlled. The PCRA court did permit the introduction of testimony as to penalty phase issues, and granted leave for PCRA counsel to submit additional written proffers as to evidence that would be presented if penalty phase issues were cognizable, so that a record would be available to the appellate court. (N.T.1/23/97). In its opinion denying PCRA relief the PCRA court did not address the merits of any issues relating to the penalty phase of petitioner’s trial.</p>

Based on this examination, along with a review of petitioner’s medical records and discussions with petitioner’s family members, Dr. Dee concluded that petitioner was substantially impaired on the night of the murder. Dr. Dee reached this conclusion from the results of psychological testing combined with background information from the petitioner’s mother and brother. Dr. Dee opined that petitioner suffered from ADD, and was hyperactive. Dr. Dee testified that these conditions caused petitioner to have diminished memory ability, increased irritability and a problem controlling his impulses. Dr. Dee learned that petitioner had been delivered with the aid of forceps and had, as a teenager, suffered two head injuries, one by falling on the hood of a car and another from a blow to the head which knocked him unconscious. From this information Dr. Dee concluded that petitioner suffered Organic Brain Damage, which would substantially impair his mental faculties. In addition Dr. Dee learned that petitioner had suffered physical and emotional abuse from his father, and possibly had been sexually abused by his father. Petitioner would not confirm the sexual abuse, that information came from petitioner’s brother, who was not a witness but “believed” that such abuse could have occurred. Dr. Dee also learned from petitioner that he regularly abused alcohol and amphetamines at the time of the murder. It was the combination of this information that led Dr. Dee to the opinion that petitioner’s mental and emotional state was significantly impaired on the night of the murder.

In support of his argument that the jury charge at issue violated the rule in <em>Mills, </em>petitioner relies upon a Third Circuit decision in <em>Frey v.

Petitioner’s reliance on the decision in <em>Frey </em>is unavailing for several reasons. First, although we may look to decisions of the intermediate federal courts for guidance in interpreting federal case law, those decisions are not binding on this court. <em>Commonwealth v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/551/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="551 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="507821" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0258-01">551 Pa. 258</a>, <a href="/a2d/710/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="710 A.2d 31" data-case-ids="11827068,507821" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/0031-01,/pa/551/0258-01">710 A.2d 31</a>, 39 (1998). Second, the instructions and accompanying verdict slip examined in <em>Frey </em>are not identical to the charge and slip at issue. In fact, the instruction and verdict slip in this case mirror the words of the charge and verdict slip which the Third Circuit found not to violate <em>Mills, </em>in <em>Zettlemoyer v. Fulcomer, </em><a href="/f2d/923/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="923 F.2d 284" data-case-ids="10542660" data-case-paths="/f2d/923/0284-01">923 F.2d 284</a>, 306-07 (3rd Cir.1991). Third, the Third Circuit fails to follow the holding of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em><a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">489 U.S. 288</a>, <a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">109 S.Ct. 1060</a>, <a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">103 L.Ed.2d 334</a> (1989), which prohibits retroactive application of decisions declaring new constitutional principles in criminal cases to cases on collateral appeal. The Third Circuit dismisses <em>Teague </em>by noting that the government failed to raise it. However, <em>Teague </em>sets a threshold that must be established before a habeas petitioner can qualify for relief, a fact that raises a serious question as to the import of the Third Circuit’s opinion in <em>Frey.</em>
