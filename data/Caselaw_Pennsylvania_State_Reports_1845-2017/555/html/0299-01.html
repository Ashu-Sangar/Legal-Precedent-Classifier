Kimball was arrested and charged with her murder. In statements to police, Kimball admitted that he had caused the Victim’s death, but denied that he had intended to kill her. Thus, at trial, the central issue was not the identity of the murderer but his degree of guilt. Elizabeth Beroes, Esquire (trial/defense counsel) of the Northumberland County Office of Special and Conflicts Counsel represented Kimball at trial.</p>

At midnight, he met the Victim, with whom he was friendly. They drank together in a bar until after 1:00 a.m., and then went to the Victim’s apartment.

According to Shortridge, Kimball admitted to killing the Victim by manual strangulation and wrapping a telephone wire around her neck to be certain she was dead. In exchange for his testimony, the Commonwealth promised Shortridge that he could serve his pending prison sentence in a county, instead of a state, facility. Although defense counsel was aware of the agreement the prosecution had with Shortridge, she did not cross-examine him concerning the deal he made with the Commonwealth. However, defense counsel did elicit from Shortridge that he had been convicted of several felonies, that Kimball told him that the Victim kicked him in the groin when they started arguing, and that Kimball had not planned to kill her.</p>

Nonetheless, defense counsel presented the testimony of Kimball’s adoptive father, Reverend John Kimball (Reverend Kimball), who stated that Kimball manifested behavioral problems since his infancy, had problems in school and the Navy, has a drinking problem, and has a history of violent and angry behavior.</p>

Judge Tamilia agreed with the majority that there is no substantive distinction between the prejudice standard applicable on direct appeal and that of the PCRA, but dissented from the majority’s holding that counsel was ineffective. Judge McEwen concurred in the result. Both Judge Hudock and Judge Popovich dissented on the basis that the PCRA renders more stringent the prejudice requirement, but disagreed about whether Kimball met that standard.

According to the <em>Buehl </em>plurality, pursuant to the PCRA, it is insufficient for a petitioner to show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s error, the outcome of the proceedings may have been different. Instead, in a collateral appeal, the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his conviction or sentence resulted from “[ijneffective assistance of counsel which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.” <em>Buehl, </em><a href="/pa/540/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="540 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="472178" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0493-01">540 Pa. at 503</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="658 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="472178,7872600" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0493-01,/a2d/658/0771-01">658 A.2d at </a>776 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. §9543(a)(2)(ii)).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Although the outcome of the <em>Buehl </em>trial may have been different had counsel requested a cautionary instruction, the <em>Buehl </em>plurality was unable to conclude that, due to the overwhelming evidence of the defendant’s guilt, counsel’s omission resulted in an unreliable verdict.</p>

For example, a situation could arise in which the prosecutor’s central piece of inculpatory evidence, which demonstrated the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt, was obtained through execution of an overly broad search warrant. In such a situation, if trial counsel neglected to move for the suppression of such evidence, an appellate court could easily conclude that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in failing to move to suppress the evidence. However, the reason such evidence would be suppressed would <em>not </em>be that the admission of the evidence undermined the <em>reliability </em>of the process by which truth is determined, but rather that admission of evidence obtained through an overly broad search warrant implicated the defendant’s privacy rights. Indeed, the admission at trial of such highly probative and relevant evidence would actually serve to <em>enhance </em>the reliability of the process by which truth is determined, even though it would properly be deemed excludible for reasons unconnected to the reliability of the truth-determination process.</p>

Only in the narrow circumstances where counsel’s ineffectiveness undermined the reliability of the process by <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>which the <em>truth </em>is ascertained does the proponent of collateral relief establish an entitlement to such relief under the PCRA.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[229,453,1152,747]]]'>By limiting ineffectiveness claims in this manner, the Legislature has carefully balanced the interests of convicted defendants with those of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has a compelling interest in achieving closure in criminal matters once the judgment of sentence has been affirmed on direct appeal, as such closure preserves the precious resources of both its law enforcement arm and its judicial arm, and also spares victims and their families the specter of never-ending collateral attacks based on procedural technicalities that do not implicate the defendant’s actual guilt or innocence. At the same time, the Legislature has ensured that a convicted defendant is always provided a forum in which to demonstrate that counsel’s ineffectiveness resulted in the conviction of an innocent person.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

    <p id="b545-6" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[229,1227,1152,421]]]'>In sum, I believe that the Legislature elected to narrowly confine ineffectiveness claims on collateral review, and that the Legislature acted well within its province by doing so, both constitutionally and also as a matter of policy. Because I believe that this Court has exceeded its proper role by neglecting to implement the standard which I believe the Legislature chose to employ in this context, I concur only in the result reached by the majority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

By the time the appeal had advanced to the United States Supreme Court, the Eighth Circuit had reversed itself and held that "double-counting” an aggravating circumstance at the penalty phase was constitutionally permissible. However, the United States Supreme Court assumed that, at the time of the sentencing hearing in <em>Lockhart, </em>the defendant would have been entitled to relief on the double-counting issue under the applicable law.</p>

By tampering with the conditions that the Legislature placed on the statutory right of collateral review, this Court risks the possibility that the Legislature will eliminate the right altogether.</p>

I note that the Legislature could easily cure the Court of the misapprehension under which I believe it is laboring by amending section 9543(a)(2)(ii) to provide for collateral relief only in those cases in which it is more likely than not that the ineffective assistance of counsel resulted in the conviction of an individual who is actually innocent in fact. There could be no misinterpreting such a clearly expressed standard, and, as explained at the outset of this Concurring Opinion, such a standard would not pose any constitutional problems.</p>
