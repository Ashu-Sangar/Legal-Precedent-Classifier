For reasons which differ from those relied upon by the Superior Court, we find that ERISA does not preempt these claims. We therefore affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>

Dr. Dickter consulted with a neurologist and a neurosurgeon; the physicians concurred that Pappas’ condition constituted a neurological emergency.

At approximately 12:40 p.m. when the ambulance arrived, Dr. Dickter was alerted to the fact that U.S. Healthcare was denying authorization for treatment at Jefferson. Ten minutes later, Dr. Dickter contacted U.S. Healthcare to obtain authorization for the transfer to Jefferson. At 1:15 p.m., U.S. Healthcare responded to Dr. Dickter’s inquiry and advised him that authorization for treatment at Jefferson was still being denied, but that Pappas could be transferred to either <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>Hahnemann University (“Hahnemann”), Temple University or Medical College of Pennsylvania (“MCP”).</p>

We also note that U.S. Healthcare puts great effort into arguing that it is not the negligent party here, and that Haverford and the physicians involved are solely responsible for the Pappas' injuries. U.S. Healthcare may ultimately be vindicated on these claims, but this is not the proper stage for these arguments. The issue with which we are concerned in this case is whether the claims against U.S. Healthcare are preempted; we have determined that they are not. It is now left for the fact-finder to determine if U.S. Healthcare’s defenses to the negligence claims are valid.</p>

Here, the defendant physician and hospital brought U.S. Healthcare into the action claiming that it was U.S. Healthcare’s refusal to authorize a medically necessary transfer which caused plaintiffs ultimate injury.
