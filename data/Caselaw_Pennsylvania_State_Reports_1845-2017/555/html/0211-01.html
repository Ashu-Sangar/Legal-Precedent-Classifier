Appellant commenced an action against Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie), and the case proceeded to arbitration. Following two hearings, the panel of Arbitrators awarded Appellant a total of $110,305.00 for lost earnings and earning capacity and pain and suffering. However, the Arbitrators deducted from the award the sum of $58,587.20, which represented future social security disability benefits that Appellant would receive because of the accident.

Pursuant to the 1927 Act, a trial court may “modify or correct the [arbitrators’] award where the award is contrary to law....” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 7302(d)(2). The 1980 Act, however, removed the “contrary to law” grounds from the scope of the trial court’s review. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 7314. Here, the trial court modified the Arbitrators’ award on the ground that it was contrary to law, and the Superior Court concluded that in doing so, the trial court erroneously applied the broader scope of review of the 1927 Act instead of the more limited review permitted by the 1980 Act.</p>

In its appeal to the Superior Court, Erie raised three issues: (1) whether the trial court erred in adding back to the arbitration award the amount of Appellant’s future social security disability benefits; (2) whether the trial court erred in holding that Appellant was a resident of her parents’ home for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage under her parents’ policy with Erie; and (3) whether the trial court erred in holding that Appellant’s injuries were caused by the October 5, 1991 motor vehicle accident. The Superior Court erroneously applied the provisions of the 1980 Act in addressing the three issues. Nevertheless, we decline to remand the residency and causation issues to the Superior Court for consideration pursuant to the provisions of the 1927 Act, because those issues are matters of pure fact, and therefore they are not reviewable pursuant to the “contrary to law” standard.</p>
