For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b381-11" data-blocks='[["BL_381.11",381,[213,1346,1152,580]]]'>The relevant facts are undisputed. On September 8, 1986, Oscar Hammerstein was killed in an accident when the motorcycle he was driving collided with a car driven by Susan Day. In subsequent litigation, after a non-jury trial, the trial court entered a verdict for the decedent’s estate and against Day in the amount of $595,616.13. With respect to insurance, Day was driving a car that she had leased from its owner, Northern Central Bank. The lease required that Day buy a minimum of $100,000 of liability insurance for the car. Day bought such a policy from USAA Insurance Company. The USAA coverage of $100,000 was paid to the decedent’s estate.</p>
    <p id="b381-12" data-blocks='[["BL_381.12",381,[210,1955,1153,420]],["BL_382.1",382,[232,329,1159,95]]]'>Northern Central Bank bought two other policies as the owner-lessor of the car. It bought a policy from Unigard Insurance Company, entitled “Business Auto Policy,” under which it is the named insured. The policy covers cars owned and leased by the named insured for one year or more where the lease requires the lessee to buy primary insurance. In addition, Northern Central Bank bought a policy from Diamond State Insurance Company entitled “Excess Third-Party <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>Liability Policy” to cover losses exceeding the liability limits of the Unigard policy.</p>
    <p id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[229,451,1159,520]]]'>The Administratrix of the decedent’s estate, Appellee Debra Harstead, brought a declaratory judgment action to determine the obligations of Unigard and Diamond State to provide insurance coverage as a result of the accident. Appellee alleged that Day was an insured under both policies and that Unigard and Diamond State are obligated to provide coverage to Day in the amount of $495,016.13—the portion of the verdict that remained unsatisfied. The parties filed motions for summary judgment and agreed that there are no genuine issues of material fact.</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[228,1006,1160,471]]]'>The trial court granted Appellee’s motion for summary judgment. After reviewing the policies, the court found that the Unigard policy covers Day and held that Unigard must pay $100,000 under its policy’s terms. In rejecting Unigard’s position, the court found that the policy language it relied upon is unenforceable under Pennsylvania law. The trial court further held that the Diamond State policy covers Day for the amount of the judgment against her in excess of $500,000, or $95,016.13.</p>
    <p id="b382-6" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[228,1505,1161,529]]]'>The Superior Court adopted the trial court’s opinion and affirmed. Judge Tamilia dissented. He found that the Unigard policy is a contingency policy that applies where, at the time of an accident, the insurance required by the leasing agreement is not collectable. Since Day’s primary insurance was collectable, Judge Tamilia found the Unigard policy did not apply. Judge Tamilia rejected the majority’s conclusion that the policy language requiring that the insurance be uncollectable is invalid. This Court granted allowance of appeal.</p>

Endorsement No. 1 states that it changes Unigard’s limit of liability. It sets forth in part split liability limits for bodily injury in the amount of $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each accident. Endorsement No. 2 details the condition that lessees obtain primary liability insurance. Endorsement No. 5, entitled “Owner Only—Second Level Coverage,” replaces Unigard’s liability limit as shown elsewhere in the policy, or the liability limit shown in any leasing agreement of one year or more requiring a lessee to provide primary insurance for the bank, to an upper limit of $500,000. Northern Central Bank paid an additional premium for Endorsement No. 5, which specifically excludes lessees like Day from the definition of the insured.</p>

One condition is the uncollectability of the liability policy the lessee is contractually obliged to buy. Unigard asserts that Northern Central Bank bought the Unigard policy to insure itself against claims that could be brought against it as the vehicle owner and because, under the Pennsylvania financial responsibility laws, it must insure that minimum limits of insurance cover the vehicle at all times. While the bank’s lease required that the lessee buy primary insurance, Unigard asserts the bank bought additional coverage to protect against the possible uncollectability of the lessee’s policy due to the lessee’s failure to pay premiums or other problems. Unigard states that the uncollectability contingency is not an “other insurance” or escape clause, as defined by Pennsylvania courts, and is enforceable.</p>

We agree. Unigard correctly states that the USAA policy was directly issued to Day and insures against the risk of claims against her. In contrast, the Unigard policy states that it provides contingent coverage with respect to lessees, who are required to obtain primary insurance under the policy. The policy insures against the risk that Day’s primary liability insurance may be uncollectable at the time of the accident and the bank, as owner, must bear financial responsibility. Under the applicable Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, Northern Central Bank is responsible for minimum liability limits. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1786, 1702 (stating financial responsibility requirement). Since the risks insured against are different, the two policies do not provide multiple insurance <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>coverage for the same loss. Thus, Endorsement No. 4 is not an escape clause seeking to avoid liability based on the USAA policy because the USAA policy is not “other insurance.” Since the contingency in Endorsement No. 4 did not occur and the USAA policy was collectable, the Unigard policy does not apply. Accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court’s order affirming the trial court’s grant of summary judgment for Appellee and against Unigard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The trial court determined, and it is undisputed, that the policy provides coverage for losses exceeding $500,000, which is the liability limit found in Endorsement No.. 5 of the Unigard policy. The court further held that the Diamond State policy covers lessees and Northern Central Bank. It reasoned in part that the policy uses the term “insured” and that the WHO IS INSURED provision of the Unigard policy, which includes lessees as insureds, is incorporated..

It contends that to the extent the policy incorporates the Unigard policy, it states that it does not incorporate inconsistent provisions. Diamond State maintains that the result below is absurd because Day was found to have the first $100,000 of coverage that the bank bought, not to have the next $400,000 of coverage that the bank bought, and then to have the excess coverage that the bank bought for losses over $500,000. We agree.
