He was pronounced dead at York Hospital at 10:58 p.m. that evening. The victim was found to have had a blood alcohol content of .356 percent.</p>
    <p id="b660-9" data-blocks='[["BL_660.8",660,[230,1183,1157,420]]]'>The Commonwealth’s principal witness at trial was Appellant’s girlfriend, Ruth Helen Emmil (Ms. Emmil). Appellant knew the victim, who had harassed and threatened Ms. Emmil on several occasions, and he had spoken with the victim in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to stop harassing Ms. Emmil. In May of 1983, the victim, without apparent provocation, hit Appellant in the face with a hatchet, knocking him unconscious and fracturing his jaw.</p>
    <p id="b660-10" data-blocks='[["BL_660.9",660,[231,1633,1155,311]]]'>Ms. Emmil testified that on the night of September 30, 1983, she and Appellant were drinking together in a bar. They left for another bar, and were walking on South Penn Street at about 9:30 p.m. when the victim crossed the street carrying a six-pack of beer and asked Appellant, Ms. Emmil, and another couple if anyone wanted some beer.</p>
    <p id="b660-11" data-blocks='[["BL_660.10",660,[229,1973,1158,419]]]'>At this time the victim approached the group and Ms. Emmil stated that, “I hope there don’t be no shit,” when the other couple, fearing an altercation, went on ahead to the second bar. It was then, according to Ms. Emmil, that Appellant took a knife from his pocket and, without provocation, stabbed the victim in the chest. The four-inch blade of the knife pierced through the victim’s sternum, severed the top of his heart and killed him.</p>

(The owner of the house, the attorney for the City of York, found the knife and handkerchief in his tomato garden the following morning.) Appellant and Ms. Emmil then met the other couple at the bar, as planned, and had some drinks.</p>

Ms. Emmil testified at trial that, after the stabbing, Appellant threatened to kill her if she told anyone what had happened. To add credibility to his threats, Appellant told her that he had killed his ex-girlfriend. Another Commonwealth witness testified at trial that, in July of 1983, that Appellant had offered him $500.00 to kill the victim.</p>
    <p id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[245,1253,1154,476]]]'>According to Appellant’s testimony, it was Ms. Emmil who had stabbed the victim without provocation and then wiped the knife with a handkerchief and threw the objects over the fence. Appellant said that he did not go to the police because he wanted to protect his girlfriend. He further stated that, after the stabbing, he asked a friend to purchase a knife similar to the one used by Ms. Emmil to confuse the police who, he was sure, would suspect him of the stabbing because of his known animosity toward the victim.</p>

The District Court stayed the habeas corpus action pending disposition of the PCRA appeal. When this Court issued a decision on November 19, 1992, denying Appellant’s appeal, the District Court lifted the stay and permitted Appellant’s counsel to withdraw. New counsel was appointed who filed an amended petition for habeas corpus and was granted leave to conduct discovery. The District Court issued an opinion regarding Appellant’s habeas petition on November 28, 1994. <em>Carpenter v.

    <p id="b680-7" data-blocks='[["BL_680.6",680,[221,694,1159,1356]]]'>In Appellant’s final ineffectiveness claim, he argues that his direct appeal attorney was ineffective for failing to raise the above-cited errors, and that, combined with the fact that the attorney took a position with the York County District Attorney’s office during his representation of Appellant, entitles him to the restoration of his direct appeal rights. He further alleges that his direct appeal counsel had no prior experience with murder cases, filed a “grossly inadequate” brief, spent “shockingly little” time on his case, and argues that counsel’s conflict of interest in accepting a position with the district attorney’s office, and actually beginning employment with the office before this Court’s decision on his direct appeal was decided, “taint the fundamental fairness of the entire appellate review proceedings.” Appellant’s brief at 81. The PCRA court, in denying relief on this claim, made several specific findings. It first found that Appellant’s appeal counsel’s representation was adequate. It also refused to find that time spent and volume produced equated with effective representation. Finally, and significantly, it pointed out that Appellant had offered no evidence that he had been prejudiced by counsel’s actions in accepting employment (to be commenced at a later date) with the district attorney’s office.
