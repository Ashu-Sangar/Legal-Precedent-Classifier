Appellant, an electrical engineer who had been employed by Duquesne Light for more than twenty years, was aware of the program. All employees had been informed that disciplinary action would be taken against any that refused to comply. On May 10, 1995, appellant was directed to report immediately for a urinalysis drug test. He was given an employee handout explaining that, if there were any questions or problems, he should feel free to consult his supervisor. Appellant, however, did not report for the test and did not inform his supervisor of any problem that would prevent him from being tested. The following day, when his supervisor asked about the test, appellant replied that he had no intention of being tested and that he did not <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>believe in the prograna. The supervisor informed him of the seriousness of this infraction and notified authorities in the corporate security and personnel departments. Appellant was instructed to leave the site and was placed on non-pay status pending further review. Soon thereafter he was notified that, due to his refusal to comply with the drug testing policy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> he was discharged effective May 11, 1995.</p>

It reasoned that the employee’s interest in privacy was outweighed by the employer’s interest in deterring theft.
