First, despite amending Section 302(b) in 1974, the General Assembly never amended Section 203 of the Act even though existing case law allowed statutory employers to escape liability if someone else was primarily responsible for paying compensation benefits. In <em>Capozzoli v. Stone Webster Engineering Corp., </em><a href="/pa/352/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="352 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="464082" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0183-01">352 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.2d%20524" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="42 A.2d 524">42 A.2d 524</a> (1945), this Court interpreted Section 302(b) of the Act as it existed prior to the 1974 amendment. In <em>Capozzoli, </em>the administratrix of the estate of a worker who was killed while performing his job for a subcontractor sought to recover <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>in a wrongful death lawsuit from a party who was found to be the deceased worker’s statutory employer. This Court affirmed the dismissal of the common law suit against the statutory employer on the basis that the sole remedy against the subcontractor and the statutory employer was the payment of compensation under Section 302(b) of the Act. In doing so, this Court stated that an agreement by a subcontractor to provide for compensation insurance does not remove the statutory employer from the protection of the Act, even though it may operate to relieve the statutory employer from directly paying compensation by placing that primary responsibility upon the subcontractor. <em>See also Swartz v. Conradis, </em><a href="/pa/298/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="298 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1120326" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0343-01">298 Pa. 343</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20A.%20529" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="148 A. 529">148 A. 529</a> (1929) (contractor and subcontractor agreed that subcontractor would carry compensation insurance; contractor still entitled to immunity of Section 203 from common law suit as the statutory employer of the subcontractor’s injured employee since contractor assumes reserve status in case subcontractor cannot pay benefits).</p>

The General Assembly, however, did not make any changes in the 1974 or subsequent amendments to Section 203 in spite of established case law. Also, our research has disclosed of no legislative intent to alter the result of cases like <em>Capozzoli </em>where compensation was paid under the Act by a party other than the statutory employer. Thus, since the amended Section 302(b) still provides that a statutory employer can be held liable for benefits under the Act in reserve status, we must conclude that the General Assembly still intends for a statutory employer who is not directly paying benefits to the injured employee of the subcontractor to be entitled to immunity from a common law suit.</p>

In determining legislative intent, sections of a statute must be read together and construed with reference to the entire statute. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). When the words of a statute are free and clear of all ambiguity, the courts cannot disregard the letter of it under the pretext of pursuing the spirit of the statute. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). Also, where the legislature includes specific language in one section of the statute and excludes it from another, the language should not be implied where excluded. <em>Cali v.

Thus, in accordance with the rules of statutory interpretation, the “unless” clause of Section 302(b) cannot be implied to amend Section 203. Furthermore, the fact that the General Assembly omitted the “unless” clause from Section 203 shows that the General Assembly had a different intent when drafting Section 203 (extending immunity to statutory employer from negligence cases) than it did when drafting Section 302(b) (providing security for payment of benefits to injured employee).

He is the statutory employer and is the insured employe’s employer for negligence immunity purposes and is secondarily liable for compensation even though the immediate employer or some other intermediate subcontractor ... is insured and responds fully on the injured employe’s claim. The reason for this difference ... must be that, since the general contractor remains statutorily liable, although only in reserve status, in return for this he has the statutory employer’s immunity from statutory employe negligence in suits in all events.</blockquote>

The purpose of the 1974 amendments was to prohibit an employer, contractor or employee from rejecting application of the Act. In eliminating the “elective compensation” language from the Act, its application became mandatory. The impetus of this change was to afford protection to employees. The Legislature never intended that the amendments would allow a general contractor to escape civil liability if it did not pay for the injured employee’s workers’ compensation insurance. I find the clear meaning of the 1974 amendments was to place responsibility for workers’ compensation benefits upon the general contractor <em>only where </em>the subcontractor or direct employer failed to do so. In reality, application of these amendments rarely, if ever, will result in the general contractor assuming responsibility for providing workers’ compensation insurance because in the modem construction workplace, general contractors will rarely, if ever, award a contract absent the subcontractor showing proof of workers’ compensation coverage. Common sense and logic dictate that the general contractor should not reap the benefits of civil liability immunity unless it undertakes responsibility of compensation coverage. If however, a general contractor does assume responsibility for the payment of workers’ compensation, then it should be afforded statutory employer immunity.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[217,1670,1154,634]]]'>In the present matter, application of the 1930 <em>McDonald </em>five part test leads to the conclusion that Appellee should be deemed the statutory employer and thus immune from civil liability. I submit, however, that in order to properly effectuate the legislative intent of the 1974 amendments and not foster an inadequate result, a sixth element should be considered. The sixth element requires the general contractor to show proof it assumed responsibility for providing workers’ compensation to the injured employee before statutory employer immunity attaches. I believe the Legislature by its amendments essentially added the sixth element in order to prevent the type of inequitable result which occurred today.</p>
