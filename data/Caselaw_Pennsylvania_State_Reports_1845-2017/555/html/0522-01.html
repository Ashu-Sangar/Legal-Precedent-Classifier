Upon arriving there, Officer Bey observed appellant sitting, apparently asleep, in a chair in front of the house. Appellant met the general description of “Mookie” given by Stephens. When Officer Bey exited his patrol car to approach appellant, he noticed a large bulge in appellant’s front left pocket. Concerned that appellant might be armed, Officer Bey ordered appellant to get up and put his hands against the wall. Appellant complied, and when he did, his sweatshirt pocket flared open, revealing several packets of crack cocaine. Officer Bey handcuffed appellant, searched him, and found several more packets containing crack cocaine in his front left pocket. Appellant was arrested and charged with several drug possession offenses. He moved to suppress the drugs found on his person as the fruit of an illegal stop and/or arrest, prompting the trial court to hold a suppression hearing on March 18,1995.</p>

And he had information on the 2100 block of Natrona Street, the exact address of this information being 2128 North Natrona Street. That a woman who had lived there, a senior citizen who he was to be doing work for, handling a service for, was having drugs sold out of her house, not by her, but by others, and that the drugs were also being sold at the street level in front of her property. At that time he also gave me a description of a male and the nickname of a male. This description was of a middle-aged man, heavyset, who went by the name of Mookie---- He gave information to me of this person being known to carry a gun and sell narcotics either from inside of this location or outside.</blockquote>

He further stated that upon receiving the information from Stephens, the name “Mookie” clicked in his head, and he believed that he had come into contact with “Mookie” before while on duty. However, he could not remember when, or in what context, that contact took place.</p>

The trial court’s decision to suppress the physical evidence was largely based on its finding that the information provided to Officer Bey by Stephens was skeletal at best, and failed to provide any details concerning the dates, times, and frequency of the alleged drug sales. In addition, the trial court noted that Officer Bey failed to personally observe any suspicious conduct on appellant’s part that would corroborate the incriminating aspects of the information provided by Stephens.</p>

Officer Bey offered no indication in his testimony at the suppression hearing that Stephens had given him any information concerning when appellant was alleged to have sold drugs at 2128 North Natrona Street, or with what regularity and frequency he was selling drugs there.

The trial court found that Stephens told Bey that he received his information concerning the drug dealing at 2128 North Natrona Street from a senior citizen for whom he provided services. Bey’s testimony provides no indication that Stephens told him how the senior citizen who gave him his information knew that “Mookie” had been selling drugs and carrying a gun at 2128 North Natrona Street.

In a <em>Terry </em>stop, the intrusiveness of the police conduct at issue is comparatively negligible. The police are not seeking to strip the subject of his liberty and bring him to trial. An individual may well be annoyed by having to respond to questions or by <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>submitting to a brief detention—especially if that individual is trying to obfuscate some criminal conduct—but police officers do not intrude on any deeply ingrained notion of liberty simply by asking a question or initiating an extremely brief detention to ensure the safety of the citizenry. That is why the standard of “reasonable suspicion” required for an investigative stop is far less exacting than the standard of “probable cause” for an arrest, which is itself far less exacting than the necessary “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” required to convict. These different standards are driven by the vastly different levels, of intrusion that are implicated by investigative stops, arrests, and finally by convictions.</p>
