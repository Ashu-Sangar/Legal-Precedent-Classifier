The court determined that the appellee’s conduct would not have resulted in criminal liability under Pennsylvania law because appellee had been convicted under subsection (b) of the Maryland law, under which the use of any amount of alcohol would support a conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol.

In 1994, a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or - greater was a <em>per se </em>violation of the Pennsylvania DUI statute. In 1988, at the time of appellant’s Maryland convictions, an alcohol concentration of 0.10% or more, as determined by an analysis of the person’s blood or breath, was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of intoxication. Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. § 10-307(e). Although the presumption was not a specific element of the crime, it did provide a mechanism by which a defendant could be found guilty of driving while intoxicated. It is clear that both the Maryland and Pennsylvania legislatures viewed driving with a 0.10% level of alcohol in the blood to be inherently unsafe. This Court should not circumvent the Pennsylvania legislature’s intent to punish repeat offenders, regardless of where the offenses originated, on this basis.</p>

Substantial similarity is satisfied where the statutes of the different jurisdictions proscribe the same general conduct, notwithstanding the fact that the statutes require differing degrees of culpability before criminal liability attaches. In my view, such a test alters the meaning of equivalency, and more importantly, potentially subjects a Pennsylvania offender to a harsher penalty due to the fortuitous circumstance that he had been convicted of a crime for actions in another jurisdiction which, if committed in Pennsylvania, may not have been criminal. I cannot attribute such an intent to our legislature. In my view, the provision imposing greater punishment for “equivalent” offenses must at a minimum mean convictions which required proof that would support a conviction under Pennsylvania law.</p>

As the Commonwealth concedes, the Maryland and Pennsylvania statutes, while similar, differ in the degree of intoxication required to support a conviction. The Pennsylvania statute specifically recognizes that alcohol intoxication can be measured by degree, and a conviction cannot be had unless the Commonwealth proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant either was intoxicated to a degree which rendered him or her incapable of safe driving or had a percentage of alcohol in his or her bloodstream of 0.10% or greater. Though a blood alcohol content of 0.10% constituted <em>prima facie </em>evidence of intoxication, the State of Maryland was not required to prove either fact as an element of Appellant’s previous convictions under Maryland’s Driving While Intoxicated statute.

This,shift in focus goes further than ensuring that drunk driving offenders do not escape an appropriate sanction for acts considered criminal in Pennsylvania merely because they were committed elsewhere. This interpretation of the statute would require courts to impose harsh penalties because of out-of-state convictions for acts which, because the other jurisdiction has defined the offense to require proof of fewer facts or a lesser degree of impairment than presently required in Pennsylvania, would not support a criminal conviction in this Commonwealth.</p>

The only test which can accomplish this goal is one of comparing the essential elements of each offense. If, as here, Pennsylvania law requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of one or more facts in addition to those required by the other jurisdiction the offenses simply cannot be found to be equivalent under the pretense of fulfilling the legislative intent. The clearest indication of the intent of the Legislature is the minimum proof it has required to invoke the sanction of the criminal law.</p>
