In February of 1997, she commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, seeking a declaration that such proceeds should not be subject to inheritance tax, contending that to apply the amendatory provisions contained in Section 9116(a)(1.1)(i) and (ii) of the Act otherwise would violate the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. VIII §1, and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, §1. Parsowith also sought equitable relief in the form of an injunction restraining the Commonwealth from requiring her to pay inheritance tax, mandating the allowance of a refund of taxes paid subsequent to the amendments, and exempting her from the filing of a tax return. Her arguments principally attacked the disparity in treatment as between widows whose husbands died after January 1,1995 (who would pay no tax on proceeds from survival actions), and widows whose husbands died before the effective dates for the reduced tax rates (who would be subject to the six percent tax, regardless of whether settlement proceeds were received after the effective date of the amendments). She also requested that the court permit a class action on behalf of similarly situated individuals.</p>

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Revenue (the “Department”), which is charged with supervising assessments under the Act, 72 P.S. §9103, filed preliminary objections, asserting, among other things, that the Commonwealth Court lacked jurisdiction over the matter because Parsowith failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. In this regard, the Department noted that the <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>General Assembly has channeled petitions for review of orders and decisions of the Department related to inheritance taxation, in the first instance, to the Board of Finance and Revenue (the “Board”).

The Department, on the other hand, takes the position that Parsowith’s claim constitutes a challenge to the administrative interpretation of the Act, rather than a direct attack upon the validity of the statute as written. As such, the Department argues, the issue raised by Parsowith was indeed amenable to consideration by the Board. Additionally, the Department asserts that the legislative scheme directing tax appeals to the Board would be thwarted if taxpayers were permitted to evade the statutory procedures simply by alleging a constitutional violation.</p>

Thus, Parsowith complains, a widow whose spouse died after January 1, 1995, is not subject to the tax on the proceeds of survival and other actions; whereas, Parsowith must pay inheritance tax at the six percent rate, even though she also has received and will receive the proceeds of settlements during the post-amendment period. According to Parsowith, choses in action must be treated differently from other forms of intangible personal property, because unliquidated tort claims are not reasonably capable of valuation until such time as the litigation is completed. As there is inherent delay involved in the process of liquidating an action, Parsowith argues, to conform with the requirements of the uniformity clause, the rate of taxation must be the rate in effect at the time when actual recovery is obtained.
