The complaint specifically alleged that Haver dispensed, among other things, Codeine, Demerol, barbiturates, sedative hypnotics, sleeping pills, Valium, and Tylox (Percocet), to Mrs. Macko, and that he ignored requests, which were made by both John Macko and Mrs. Macko’s mother, that he cease dispensing the drugs to her.

Mutual Benefit argued that Mrs. Macko’s injuries were a consequence of Haver’s “knowing endangerment” of her via his distribution of the contraband to her. Mutual Benefit also filed a motion for summary judgment against the Mackos on the same grounds as its declaratory action. The Mackos responded <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>with their own motion for summary judgment. They argued that their complaint alleged negligence, not willful, knowing conduct, that the policy contained an endorsement which covered the type of conduct alleged in their complaint against Haver, and that any inconsistencies between the exclusionary language relied upon by Mutual Benefit and the endorsement must be resolved against Mutual Benefit, since it drafted the policy. The trial judge denied Mutual Benefit’s motion and gránted the Mackos’ motion, and, in doing so, held that Mutual Benefit was obligated to both defend Haver and indemnify him for any damages assessed pursuant to the Mackos’ underlying complaint.</p>

Haver and the Mackos argue that coverage is triggered and that the knowing endangerment exclusion to coverage is not implicated by the Mackos’ complaint because the complaint does not contain allegations of willful or knowing misconduct by Haver, but instead, asserts claims of negligence in conduct that was below the standard of care required of a pharmacist. However, the particular cause of action that a complainant pleads is not determinative of whether coverage has been triggered. Instead it is necessary to look at the <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>factual allegations contained in the complaint. <em>See Scopel v.

We agree with Mutual Benefit that to allow the manner in which the complainant frames the request for redress to control in a case such as this one would encourage litigation through the use of artful pleadings designed to avoid exclusions in liability insurance policies. Appellant’s Brief at 18. Accordingly, we now consider the factual allegations contained in the Mackos’ complaint to determine whether coverage was triggered under the policy at issue. More specifically, we must determine whether the factual allegations in the complaint fall within the knowing endangerment exclusion to coverage that is contained in the policy. Count One of the complaint avers that Haver provided Mrs. Macko with the numerous prescription medications even though she lacked prescriptions. It goes on to allege that Mrs. Macko’s family members, personal physician and psychologist contacted Haver and advised him to stop giving her the drugs, but that Haver nonetheless continued to do so. We find that these factual allegations against a pharmacist constitute “knowing endangerment” as a matter of law, and therefore the knowing endangerment exclusion in the policy prevents Mutual Benefit from having to defend or indemnify<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Haver.</p>
    <p id="b759-4" data-blocks='[["BL_759.4",759,[239,1705,1153,305]],["BL_760.1",760,[230,350,1161,742]]]'>In reaching this conclusion, we reject the argument that the policy is ambiguous because it contains, in conjunction with the exclusionary language, an endorsement providing coverage for “professional liability,” which is defined in the policy to include “malpractice.” The Mackos cite <em>Blank’s Law Dictionary, </em>Sixth Edition, 1991, for the definition of malprac<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>tice, which, in the last line of its definition includes “any professional misconduct, unreasonable lack of skill or fidelity in professional or fiduciary duties, evil practice, or illegal or immoral conduct.” The Mackos, and to some degree Haver, conclude that this definition of malpractice is inconsistent with the language in the policy excluding coverage for knowing endangerment, and, therefore, the resultant ambiguity must be resolved against Mutual Benefit, as the drafter of the policy, and in favor of coverage. Their argument is that the terms evil practice, illegal conduct, and immoral conduct imply that intentional acts are a part of malpractice and therefore covered under the endorsement, while at the same time such intentional conduct contradicts the “knowing” portion of the knowing endangerment exclusion contained in the policy.</p>
    <p id="b760-5" data-blocks='[["BL_760.4",760,[224,1113,1165,1012]],["BL_761.1",761,[214,330,1153,321]]]'>We reject this argument for a number of reasons. First, irrespective of how <em>Black’s Law Dictionary </em>defines the term “malpractice,” we have described malpractice as consisting of “a negligent or unskillful performance by a physician of the duties which are devolved incumbent upon him on account of his relations with his patients, or of a want of proper care and skill in the performance of a professional act.” <em>Hodgson v. Bigelow, </em><a href="/pa/335/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="335 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1193082" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0497-01">335 Pa. 497</a>, 504, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20A.2d%20338" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 A.2d 338">7 A.2d 338</a>, 342 (1939).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This definition does not extend to the evil and illegal conduct relied upon by the Mackos and Haver. Therefore, there is no ambiguity created by the use of that term in the endorsement providing coverage for professional liability and the knowing endangerment exclusion in the policy. Second, when we are interpreting a contract such as the insurance policy in this case, our duty is to “ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written agreement.” <em>Standard Venetian Blind Co. v. American Empire Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/503/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="503 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1785950" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0300-01">503 Pa. 300</a>, 305, <a href="/pa/503/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="503 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1785950" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0300-01">469 A.2d 563</a>, 566 (1983). The context in which the term malpractice was used in the endorsement, as <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>well as the more common usage of the term, support the conclusion that when Haver and Mutual Benefit entered into this contract neither party intended to have it cover conduct such as that alleged in the Mackos’ complaint (i.e., illegal distribution of prescription drugs). The definition of professional liability found in the endorsement states:</p>
    <p id="b761-4" data-blocks='[["BL_761.4",761,[259,686,1108,154]]]'>C. <em>Professional liability </em>includes error or omission, malpractice, or mistake in connection with rendering or failure to render professional services at <em>your </em>retail drug store.</p>
    <p id="b761-5" data-blocks='[["BL_761.5",761,[217,878,1152,536]]]'>R.R. at 46 (emphasis in original policy). This language clearly indicates that the term malpractice was intended to cover negligent conduct, rather than intentional misconduct as advocated by Appellees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Finally, any ambiguity arising from the use of the term malpractice in the endorsement, as a result of the potentially evil or illegal connotation that might be attributable to that term, is illusory, since it would be against the public policy of this Commonwealth to permit a carrier to offer insurance for damages assessed as a result of evil or illegal conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

As stated above, in determining whether a carrier has a duty to defend or indemnify an insured we look to the complaint filed against the insured. Thus, our determination that the factual allegations in the Mackos’ complaint against Haver constitute knowing endangerment as a matter of law, makes this argument moot, since there need not be evidence on the record for us to make this decision. For the same reason, we reject the Mackos’ argument that Haver’s deposition testimony denying that he ever intended to harm Mrs. Macko prevents the knowing endangerment language from barring coverage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

To the contrary, there are a plethora of claims that a policy such as this one would cover, notwithstanding the fact that it does not cover the particular claim in this case. For example, the policy would still cover claims stemming from a pharmacist’s accidental issuance of a prescription to the wrong customer, or a pharmacist who negligently adds too much or too little of a chemical to a mixture that is subsequently dispensed to a customer.

According to the facts of this case, I believe that regardless of the averments in the complaint or the language of the policy of insurance, it is against public policy to allow insurance coverage for an illegal drug transaction. My reading of the record before us is that Ms. Macko is a substance <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>abuser who illegally bought a large quantity of controlled substances without a prescription from Haver for a period of approximately four years. Ms. Macko’s conduct, as well as Haver’s, was part of an illegal drug transaction, and is no less so because Haver was a pharmacist rather than a street corner pusher. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gordon, </em><a href="/pa/511/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="511 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1798759" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0481-01">511 Pa. 481</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="511 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1798759" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0481-01">515 A.2d 558</a>, 560-61 (1986) (pharmacist engaging in illicit and clandestine drug deals for prescription drugs is like common “street pusher”). There is little difference between this case and the case of drugs on the corner, and we should not treat it differently. <em><a href="/pa/511/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="511 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1798759" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0481-01">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b764-4" data-blocks='[["BL_764.4",764,[223,936,1159,1324]]]'>It is my opinion that the public policy of this Commonwealth does not allow insurance coverage for a criminal venture where one who has participated in criminal acts by obtaining drugs illegally can recover from the other participant’s insurance carrier simply because the result of the crime had bad or unintended results for one of the participants. I am mindful that this court should not lightly formulate judicial pronouncements of public policy. <em>Muschany v.

However, in the circumstances of this case, I believe that both the legislature and the courts of this Commonwealth have uniformly held that the drug transaction that occurred here is against the public’s health, safety, morals, and welfare. <em>See, e.g., </em>35 P.S.
