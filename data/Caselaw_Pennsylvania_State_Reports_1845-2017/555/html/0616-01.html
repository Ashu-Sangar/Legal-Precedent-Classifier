    <p id="b838-4" data-blocks='[["BL_838.4",838,[201,392,1162,733]]]'>On September 19, 1990, Annette Yaworsky was admitted to Pottsville Hospital and the Warne Clinic (the Hospital), with complaints of abdominal pain. Francis J. Pistone, M.D., who was on call that night, examined her and ordered a series of tests. During the next few days, physicians other than Dr. Pistone treated her for gallstones. On September 22, 1990, Dr. Pistone entered Annette Yaworsky’s semi-private room to perform an examination, and closed the privacy curtain around the bed. No other patient was in the room. He then fondled her breasts, exposed his genitals and masturbated in front of her. As a result of this incident, Dr. Pistone was charged with indecent assault and indecent exposure. He pled nolo contendere to a charge of indecent assault, and the charge of indecent exposure was nolle prossed.</p>
    <p id="b838-5" data-blocks='[["BL_838.5",838,[197,1148,1163,1212]]]'>. On March 28, 1993, Annette Yaworsky and her husband filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County (trial court) against Dr. Pistone, his employer Associated Surgeons, Ltd. (Associated) and the Hospital. The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dr. Pistone was negligent in exposing his patient to his sexual perversion, that Associated was negligent in hiring him, and that the Hospital was negligent in granting him staff privileges. Dr. Pistone and Associated both requested that their insurer, Physicians Insurance Company (PIC), defend them in the action. On April 19, 1992, PIC informed Dr. Pistone that it was denying coverage under its policy and that it would neither defend nor indemnify him with respect to the Yaworskys’ claim. The doctor did not file an answer to the Yaworskys’ complaint, and a default judgment was entered against him. PIC agreed to defend Associated, but only against the claim of the negligent hiring of Dr. Pistone. PIC then filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that it not be required to defend or indemnify Dr. Pistone or Associated. The Yaworskys filed a motion for summary judgment, and PIC filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the Yaworsky’s motion and granted PIC’s cross-motion. The Superior Court affirmed.</p>

In <em>Shemow, </em>a dentist administered nitrous oxide to a female patient before beginning to fill a molar. After the patient regained consciousness, the dentist’s tongue was in her mouth and she felt tenderness in her breasts. She attempted to resist the dentist, and he turned up the gas, causing her to slip back into unconsciousness. When the patient next awoke, she found the dentist on top of her, his tongue still in her mouth. Her attempts to resist were again met with an increased dose of nitrous oxide, which put her back to sleep. She again awoke to find the dentist in the same position. Realizing she was awake, the dentist helped the patient out of the chair, then approached her from behind, held her breasts and kissed her on the neck. When she left the office, she experienced a burning sensation in her nose, throat and chest. A pulmonary specialist later determined that because of excessive exposure to nitrous oxide, she suffered a permanent loss of lung capacity. She also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. After trial, the jury awarded her $300,000.00 in general damages and $100,000.00 in punitive damages. In a separate proceeding, the trial court held that the professional liability portion of the policy St. Paul issued to Dr. Shernow required it to indemnify him for the damages his patient sustained. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed, noting that the jury heard testimony that the negligent administration of nitrous oxide permanently injured the victim, and that some of the acts of professional negligence occurred before the sexual encounter. The Court stated:</p>

    <p id="b847-4" data-blocks='[["BL_847.4",847,[265,463,1154,620]]]'>Rather, I would find a more expansive definition of professional health care services which incorporates the conduct contemplated by <em>Marx </em>while also considering the context and circumstances of the physician’s ministrations. However, this conduct, whether negligent or intentional, need not be confined to a “medical skill associated with specialized training.” Thus, in such circumstances where the patient is in a vulnerable position, by virtue of appearing before the physician for diagnosis and/or treatment, any act the physician performs in the context of the doctor-patient relationship should be deemed professional health care services and be covered by professional liability insurance.</p>

On the day in question, Mrs. Yaworsky could not yet take food by mouth and was being fed intravenously. The hospital had run postoperative tests on her to determine the problem and she was awaiting the results when Dr. Pistone entered her semiprivate room and drew the privacy curtain around her bed. No one else was in the room. Pistone placed a folded towel over Mrs. Yaworsky’s face and eyes, leaving only her mouth exposed, and proceeded to open her dressing gown and conduct a physical examination of her, all the while urging her to “relax.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> He palpated her abdomen for about five minutes and Mrs. Yaworsky reported some tenderness. During the examination, he began to fondle her nipple and, when the towel slipped from her eyes, she saw that he had exposed his genitals and was masturbating.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

    <p id="b848-4" data-blocks='[["BL_848.5",848,[209,677,1162,950]]]'>Furthermore, I disagree with the majority’s wholesale rejection of the <em>Asbury </em>standard which finds that only conduct “intertwined with and inseparable from the [medical] services provided” is covered conduct. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Asbury, </em><a href="/ariz/149/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="149 Ariz. 565" data-case-ids="1480190" data-case-paths="/ariz/149/0565-01">149 Ariz. 565</a>, <a href="/ariz/149/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="149 Ariz. 565" data-case-ids="1480190" data-case-paths="/ariz/149/0565-01">720 P.2d 540</a> (Ct.App.1986). The majority finds that, because this standard places focus on the part of the body legitimately being examined, it leads to illogical results. Thus, the majority’s example that a urologist’s abuse of a patient’s genitalia is “intertwined with and inseparable from” the legitimate medical examination and would be covered, but a cardiologist’s abuse of the patient’s genitalia is not and would be denied, forces it to dismiss this standard. I disagree and believe that where a patient undergoes an examination by a physician of any ilk, the totality of the physician’s conduct in and around the examination is intertwined with and inseparable from the examination, and that both the urologist’s and the cardiologist’s conduct are covered.</p>

The substantial nexus test, in essence, merely requires that the inappropriate act “arise out of’ the medical activity. Viewing the present circumstances under this standard, I would find that Pistone’s untoward behavior has a substantial nexus with the administration of <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>professional health care services simply by virtue of the fact that such behavior took place in the hospital in the context of a physical examination for diagnostic and treatment purposes.</p>
