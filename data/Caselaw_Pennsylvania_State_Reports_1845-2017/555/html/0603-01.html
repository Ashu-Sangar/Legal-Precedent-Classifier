Stewart, a private investigator employed by defense counsel who interviewed members of Cross’s family; and the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On the basis of reviewing these documents, Dr. Melnick recanted his trial testimony and stated (1) he needed two hours instead of the one hour he spent to evaluate Cross, (2) if' he had reviewed all of the information in the documents listed above relative to Cross’s family background and (3) if he had reviewed the complete results of tests “similar to those done by Dr. Tarter,” he would not have testified that Cross was free of psychopathology:</p>

Since these concerns are virtually identical with the concerns raised by Dr. Melnick himself thirteen years after the fact, it can fairly be said that the facts upon which Melnick relied to formulate his recantation were known to Cross at the time of trial.
