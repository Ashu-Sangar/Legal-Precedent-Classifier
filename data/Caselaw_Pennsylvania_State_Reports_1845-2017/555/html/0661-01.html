Appellant challenges the constitutionality of the search as it took place in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion. As we find that the search of the student population, as conducted herein, affected a limited privacy interest, was minimally intrusive, was preceded by adequate notice, was motivated by a significant policy concern, and was directed towards an immediate need, individualized reasonable suspicion was not a necessary pre-condition to the search. Accordingly, the search was constitutional, the suppression of the knife was not warranted, and thus, the decision of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

Given this tradition of a heightened privacy interest under Pennsylvania law, and the fact that a majority of this court is only willing to tolerate searches of this generic nature within the school environment, we find that if a search within the school environment passes constitutional muster under Article I, Section 8, that search will also satisfy the reasonableness test of the Fourth Amendment set forth in <em>Acton. </em>Having identified the necessary framework for our analysis we now turn to a consideration of whether the search at issue satisfies the requirements of that framework.</p>

The distinguishing factor in comparing the search here with the one in <em>Cass </em>is the extension of the search beyond things in the student’s possession to the students themselves. However, looking to the <em>Cass </em>decision for guidance, we recognize that the search of school lockers obviously extends to an inspection of personal items within the lockers, including, but not limited to, book bags, purses and coats. Given that the same personal items were subject to search if found in a locker, it would be illogical to find a greater privacy interest at stake in searching those personal items outside a locker.</p>

The interest in keeping weapons out of public schools is a matter so obvious that the need to develop a record on this point is superfluous. There can exist no logical argument opposing the decision of a public school board to prohibit students, or anyone else, from entering a school with weapons in their possession. The myriad of interests at issue include the physical safety of the school students, teachers, administrators and other employees, the public concern of eliminating violence in the community in general and in the schools in specific, and the need to maintain schools as centers of learning free of fear for personal safety.</p>

In response to this concern the trial court took judicial notice of the increased rate of violence within the Philadelphia Schools. Given this alarming trend of increased violence we find that an immediate need to take precautionary measures exists.

Op. at 366, n.7. I would add to this that if the items seized become oppressive, the search itself may be regarded as an instrument of oppression and unconstitutional regardless of its purpose. 18 Pa.C.S. § 912 prohibits the possession of “any ... tool, instrument or implement capable of inflicting serious bodily injury.” If Swiss army knives are to be seen as <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>weapons, one must inquire whether objects which may be thrown, such as staplers, or objects which may be thrust, such as pointers, or objects which may be swung as clubs, such as the light steel and wood chairs used in classrooms, are not also weapons. And if they are, then what is the justification for criminal prosecution for possession of a Swiss Army knife but not for possession of one’s classroom chair.</p>

      <em>Acton </em>involved urine samples taken by school officials and parents for purposes of determining whether students would be eligible to participate in voluntary, interscholastic athletic events. In reaching its conclusion permitting the urine tests, which are deemed searches under the Fourth Amendment, the <em>Acton </em>Court specifically relied upon the fact that the test results were “disclosed only to a limited class of school personnel who have a need to know; <em>and they are not turned over to law enforcement authorities or used for any internal disciplinary function.” Acton, </em>at 658, <a href="/us/515/0646-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="515 U.S. 646" data-case-ids="1564392" data-case-paths="/us/515/0646-01">115 S.Ct. 2386</a> (emphasis added).

It is disconcerting that this is the second decision from this Court in approximately one year characterizing the school setting as unique and upholding searches on school grounds.

Today, the majority extends that aberration from normal constitutional protections by asserting that "[gjiven that the same personal items were subject to search if found in a locker, it would be illogical to find a greater privacy interest at stake in searching those personal items outside a locker.” Majority Op. at 365. While the majority’s language has superficial appeal, it conveniently overlooks the fact that "outside the locker” in this case refers to "on the persons themselves.” Here the purses and pockets that are searched are taken from the individuals themselves rather than from their lockers. Not only does common understanding dictate that an individual has the greatest expectation of privacy in items that are on his or her person, but so does precedent. <em>Commonwealth v. Martin, </em><a href="/pa/534/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="534 Pa. 136" data-case-ids="1839724" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0136-01">534 Pa. 136</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="534 Pa. 136" data-case-ids="1839724" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0136-01">626 A.2d 556</a>, 560 (1993) (explaining that a search of a person always involves a greater degree of intrusion upon the person’s privacy interest than the search of a thing). Justice Brennan expressed similar reasoning in distinguishing the sniffing of inanimate objects by drug dogs from the sniffing of human beings for purposes of what constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Doe v.

In the last paragraph of its opinion, the majority relies upon the fact that the search at issue was directed at all students as support for its finding that no constitutional violation occurred.
