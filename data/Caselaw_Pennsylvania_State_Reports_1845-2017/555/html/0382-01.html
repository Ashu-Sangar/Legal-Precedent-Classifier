The victim complied, asked if he was going to be shot, then turned to run from the scene. At that point, Domes brandished his own handgun, and he and Kelly both fired in the victim’s direction. One of the bullets struck the victim in the back of the neck, and the victim fell to the ground. Police did not find the murder weapon, and no determination was made as to which of the two assailants fired the fatal shot.

This bedrock, axiomatic and elementary constitutional principle prohibits the state from using evidentiary presumptions in a jury charge that have the effect of improperly relieving the state of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of a crime charged.

This Court must determine whether the challenged portion of the instruction creates a mandatory presumption, or merely a permissive inference. A mandatory presumption instructs the jury that it must infer the presumed fact if the state proves certain predicate facts. On the other hand, a permissive inference suggests to the jury a <em>possible </em>conclusion to be drawn if the state proves predicate facts, but does not <em>require </em>the jury to draw that conclusion. In determining whether a mandatory presumption or a permissive inference has been created, a reviewing court must assess the challenged instruction from the viewpoint of a reasonable juror and declare it to create a “mandatory presumption” if such a juror could reasonably believe that proof of the predicate facts automatically shifts the burden of persuasion on the relevant element to the defendant. <em>See <a href="/us/357/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="357 U.S. 513" data-case-ids="6164109" data-case-paths="/us/357/0513-01">id.,</a> </em><a href="/us/471/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="471 U.S. 307" data-case-ids="6202354" data-case-paths="/us/471/0307-01">471 U.S. at 315</a>, <a href="/us/471/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="471 U.S. 307" data-case-ids="6202354" data-case-paths="/us/471/0307-01">105 S.Ct. 1965</a>.</p>

In other words, the claim is that although the instruction declared the unlicensed weapon to be evidence of intent, the jury still had the discretion to determine whether to credit the evidence and to determine what conclusions to draw from such evidence. The Commonwealth’s argument overlooks the fact that the instruction specifically states that proof of the unlicensed weapon “shall be evidence of his intention to commit said crime of violence.” With this final phrase, the instruction is cured of the putative ambiguity upon which the Commonwealth bases its argument.</p>

If this Court were to undertake “harmless error” analysis and consider whether the evidence apart from the mandatory inference supports a verdict of guilty, this Court would be usurping the function of the jury.

In our system of law, the accused has the categorical right to have <em>all </em>of the state’s evidence examined and weighed by a jury, regardless of what “natural” inferences a judge or the legislature believes should be drawn from that evidence in its totality.

It is important at this juncture to take note of the one crucial difference between the instruction at issue and the language of 18 Pa.C.S. § 6104. The statute mandates the relevant inference based on the predicate fact that the accused was "armed with an [unlicensed] firearm, used or attempted to be used____” The actual instruction, on the other hand, mandated the inference based on the predicate fact that the accused was "armed with an [unlicensed] firearm <em>or ... </em>[such] a firearm was used or attempted to be used .... ” (emphasis added).

In contrast, the portion of the charge at issue in this matter is concerned with the inferences to be drawn from use of or possession of an <em>unlicensed firearm. </em>The portion of the charge relating to use of a deadly weapon merely suggests a permissive inference, whereas the subsequent portion relating to use of an unlicensed firearm prescribes a mandatory presumption.

Here, as noted by the Majority, the trial court, during its charge on accomplice liability, instructed the jury that Appellees’ possession or use of an unlicensed firearm “shall be evidence of his intention to commit said crime of violence.” N.T. at 432. The Majority concludes that this statement to the jury effectively relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving that Appellees had the requisite intent to commit murder. However, as part of the same jury charge, the court instructed the jury that “it is not the defendant’s burden- to prove each defendant is not guilty. Instead, it is the Commonwealth that always has the burden of proving each and every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>Id. </em>at 416-17. Regarding intent, the court then stated:</p>

The evidence presented at trial essentially pitted two conflicting versions of the events surrounding Carl Bracey’s murder. Testifying on his own behalf, Appellee Domes claimed that while he was present at the scene of the shooting, neither he nor Appellee Kelly possessed a gun during his fight with Mr. Bracey. Rather, Domes testified that he heard shots fired during the fight from an unknown source and immediately fled the scene along with Appellee Kelly. The Commonwealth, meanwhile, presented the testimony of eyewitnesses to the shooting who claimed that both Appellees not only had guns during Domes’ fight with Mr. Bracey but that both Appellees fired those guns at Mr. Bracey as he attempted to flee the scene of the fight. <em>See </em>N.T. at 79-81, 248.</p>
