However, while Section 1142(a) was intended to assure that teachers receive a certain minimum salary, this section also speaks to placement on a salary schedule that is above the minimum scale. “When a district adopts a salary scale in excess of the mandated scale, it shall not be deemed to have altered or increased the step which the employe has gained through years of service.” 24 P.S. § 11-1142. We interpret this provision to require that a teacher’s past years of service are to be credited upon rehire for purposes of placement on a local salary scale. The language contained in Section 1142(a) protects professional school district employees from the patent unfairness of disregarding past years of service with the same school district when the district places a rehired teacher on a salary scale and the teacher is receiving a salary in excess of the state mandated minimum.

The District’s reliance on <em>Wildrick </em>is misplaced as it has no relevance to the present dispute. <em>Wildrick </em>addressed the issue of whether the minimum salaries set forth in the School Code must be used in calculating salaries under a local salary schedule, even though the local salary schedule paid salaries above the state mandated minimum. In an assumpsit action against the district, the teachers claimed that they were entitled to placement on the local salary schedules at the corresponding step in the School Code commensurate with their salaries. The <em>Wildrick </em>court properly rejected the teachers’ argument, finding that the district was not required to apply to its local salary schedule that step in the statutory schedule which was intended by the Legislature to determine the minimum pay for teachers.</p>

      <em>Wildrick </em>is inapplicable to the present matter because the professional employees in this case are not claiming that their placement on the salary schedule is determined by the salary steps in the School Code, irrespective of the employees’ years of experience within that district.

The <em>Centennial </em>court based its decision, in part, on the fact that the collective bargaining agreement contained a statutory savings clause that explicitly incorporated the provisions of the School Code. However, as noted above, Section 1121 of the School Code provides that the statutory mandates of the School Code cannot be waived "orally or in writing.” 24 P.S. § 11-1121. In addition, the Pennsylvania Employe Relations Act prevents the parties from implementing collective bargaining agreement provisions that are inconsistent with or conflict with any statute. 43 P.S. § 1101.703. Therefore, express language in the agreement incorporating the provisions of the School Code is not necessary because such provisions are incorporated, by operation of law.</p>

In his dissent, our esteemed colleague Mr. Justice Zappala states that a different standard of review of arbitration awards exists in those cases where an arbitrator interprets statutory law that is incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement. Justice Zappala posits that this court’s standard of review in such cases is plenary. With due respect, this assertion is not borne out by the case that he cites in support of his position or the numerous cases this court has rendered in reviewing labor arbitration awards under the Pennsylvania Employe Relations Act. Our standard of review in this case, as in all arbitration cases, is clearly the essence test.</p>

Reliance by the dissent on this case is misplaced for a number of reasons. First, <em>Bald Eagle </em>is not a case involving this court’s review of an arbitrator’s award. Rather, it involves an unfair labor practice proceeding regarding whether a dispute was arbitrable at all. Second, the court in <em>Bald Eagle </em>did not set forth a standard of review to be used when an arbitrator’s award is against the law. Instead, in obiter dicta, the court merely noted that judicial relief was available if an award was in conflict with statutory law. Finally, and most importantly, the <em>Bald Eagle </em>court did indicate that the judiciary had the right to correct or modify an arbitration award contrary to law in the same manner as jury verdicts on a motion for judgment n.o.v., citing the Uniform Arbitration Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7302(d)(2). In fact, this very language served as the basis for this court’s creation of the essence test. <em>Community College of Beaver County, </em><a href="/pa/473/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="473 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1730315" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0576-01">473 Pa. 576</a>, 589-90, <a href="/pa/473/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="473 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1730315" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0576-01">375 A.2d 1267</a>, 1273 (Pa.1977)(“[w]hile the introduction of the ‘n.o.v.’ concept into the field of arbitration may have been a new departure, it is hardly a radical change, nor does it dictate that a much closer or different scrutiny of an arbitration award will be available than under the [essence test]”).

I must point out, however, that I deliberately used as an introductory signal a term of art which I believed to be easily recognizable. <em>See </em>The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation 12 (1989) ("An authority may be introduced ... by an ordinary English phrase explaining its force and or purpose.” Rule 3.1(b)); The Bluebook: A Uniform System of <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>Citation 23 (16th ed. 1996) <em>(“See generally” </em>defined as: “Cited authority <em>presents helpful background material related to the proposition.” </em>Rule 1.2(d)).</p>

The majority finds, as a matter of law, that the arbitrator’s decision is violative of the Code. By definition, the majority has conducted plenary review of the arbitrator’s interpretation of statutory law incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement, and has not deferred to the arbitrator’s analysis as the essence test mandates.</p>
