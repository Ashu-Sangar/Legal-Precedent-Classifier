Following the jury’s pronouncement of its verdict of guilt, a sentencing hearing was conducted in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711. The jury found that there was one aggravating circumstance, a murder committed before or <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>at the same time as another murder, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(11), and no mitigating circumstances, thereby imposing the death penally for each murder conviction. Appellant was then formally sentenced to death and to a concurrent term of one to two years imprisonment on the possession of an instrument of a crime conviction. Direct appeal from the judgments of sentence of death was taken to this Court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h).</p>

Stevens also testified that Sewell remained asleep in the front bedroom and got up occasionally to sell drugs. According to Stevens, Goines-Mills arrived at some point in the afternoon and she, Mason, and Goines-Mills spent the rest of the day and evening smoking cocaine. At some point Stevens observed Sewell with an envelope containing $150.00 in bills. <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>Stevens testified further that during the course of the evening, she was looking for matches when she observed a hatchet in Mason’s bedroom. Stevens remained at 1516 South Stillman Street until 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, April 10, 1988. When Stevens left, Sewell was asleep in the front bedroom, Goines-Mills and Appellant were asleep on couches, and Mason was entering the home after working on his car outside. Stevens returned to 1516 South Stillman at 10:00 a.m., found the bodies and called police.</p>

At some point, Gillespie stated, they attempted to collect money among themselves to purchase more drugs and Appellant indicated that he did not have any money.
