    <p id="b679-4" data-blocks='[["BL_679.4",679,[216,472,1152,686]]]'>Appellants are registered voters of Millvale who believe that appellee James R. Bum, Jr., who won an independent write-in campaign for the office of mayor of Millvale in November, 1993, was not a qualified candidate for the office due to his move to the borough sixty-five days before the election and thus failed to meet the statutory requirement that a candidate must reside in the borough for a full year prior to an election.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> They possessed abundant information tending to establish Bum’s residence in the Borough of Bellevue — such as wage tax payments, voter registration, telephone listing, and resident directory listing — until August 31, 1993, when he allegedly filed a change of address order with the U.S. Postal Service, changing his address from Bellevue to Millvale.</p>

An assistant responded by stating that the statutory jurisdiction of the attorney general did not <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>include matters such as mayors’ qualifications, and referring appellants’ counsel to the district attorney of Allegheny County-</p>
    <p id="b680-4" data-blocks='[["BL_680.4",680,[240,521,1167,778]]]'>Appellants’ counsel wrote to the district attorney, enclosing a copy of the attorney general’s letter, asking him to review appellants’ allegations and to respond. The district attorney refused to institute an action in quo warranto, stating that such an action could be brought by any member of the borough council and by any disappointed candidate for the office. Moreover, the district attorney informed appellants that they had equitable standing to challenge the mayor’s right to office, citing <em>League of Women Voters v. Bd. of Commissioners of Lower Merion Twp., </em><a href="/pa/451/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="451 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1948576" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0026-01">451 Pa. 26</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20797" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="301 A.2d 797">301 A.2d 797</a> (1973). The district attorney stated that he did not think it proper to institute an action on behalf of individuals who had standing to sue for themselves, mentioning instances in which this policy of his office had been followed in recent election contests.</p>
    <p id="b680-5" data-blocks='[["BL_680.5",680,[232,1332,1165,890]]]'>Appellants, interpreting <em>League of Women Voters, supra, </em>to establish equitable standing due to the district attorney’s refusal to proceed in quo warranto, brought suit in equity, seeking the disqualification of Mayor Bum. Appellees filed preliminary objections, alleging an adequate remedy at law as well as appellants’ lack of capacity to sue, seeking dismissal of appellants’ petition. The trial court granted appellees’ preliminary objections and dismissed appellant’s petition with prejudice, holding that quo warranto is the sole and exclusive remedy to challenge the right to public office and that appellants lacked standing to sue; the court relied on <em>DeFranco v. Belardino, </em><a href="/pa/448/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="448 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1944728" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0234-01">448 Pa. 234</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="292 A.2d 299">292 A.2d 299</a> (1972) and <em>Spykerman v.

Col-ville, the official empowered to challenge by quo warranto the mayor’s right to hold office, refused, in his official capacity, to <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>proceed in quo warranto, stating his refusal on the official letterhead stationery of his office. Quizzically, he included in his letter the assertion: “Nor is this an official refusal to bring action.” In order to assess appellants’ equitable standing to challenge the mayor’s right to office in terms of <em>League of Women Voters, supra, </em>the district attorney’s letter must be regarded as an official refusal to bring action.</p>
    <p id="b681-4" data-blocks='[["BL_681.4",681,[190,748,1158,314]]]'>In dismissing appellants’ petition for lack of standing, the trial court relied in part on the district attorney’s denial of “an official refusal to bring action.” This was error. The question is whether, given the district attorney’s refusal to proceed, appellants have equitable standing under <em>League of Women Voters, supra, </em>and other precedents.</p>
    <p id="b681-5" data-blocks='[["BL_681.5",681,[192,1088,1148,96]]]'>In <em>League of Women Voters, </em>in circumstances indistinguishable from this case, this court wrote:</p>
    <blockquote id="b681-6" data-blocks='[["BL_681.6",681,[231,1203,1115,1019]]]'>The first argument that must be dealt with in this appeal is whether appellees’ failure to bring their action in quo warranto is fatal to their cause. While it has long been the law of this Commonwealth that quo warranto is the proper method with which to contest the right to public office, there are exceptions to that rule. In <em>DeFranco v. Belardino, </em><a href="/pa/448/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="448 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1944728" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0234-01">448 Pa. 234</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="292 A.2d 299">292 A.2d 299</a> (1972), we stated that under certain circumstances, there may be exceptions to the limited remedy of quo warranto, and equitable relief may be granted. In the instant case, we are presented with circumstances that are an exception to the rule. The attorney general refused to institute the proceedings and the district attorney also failed to grant appellees’ request for the institution of quo warranto against appellant. Under this set of facts, appellees were precluded from a course of action that would challenge appellant’s right to office, and equity was their only avenue of approach. This failure of the proper parties to institute the quo warranto proceedings established the right of appellees to such a remedy in equity.</blockquote>

The home rule charter detailed a procedure for the recall of any elected municipal officer by majority vote of the electorate at a public election. We held that the procedure violated Article VI, section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which states that all elected public officers "shall be removed by the Governor for reasonable cause, after due notice and full hearing, on the address of two-thirds of the Senate.”</p>

This case involves an alleged lack of qualification to hold office. <em>In re Petition to Recall Reese </em>involved an attempt to remove a validly-elected officer; the constitutional question addressed therein does not arise in this case and its holding is therefore not applicable.</p>
