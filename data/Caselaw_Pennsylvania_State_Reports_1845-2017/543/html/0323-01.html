    <p id="b462-14" data-blocks='[["BL_462.13",462,[255,1407,1162,312]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from a per curiam order of the Superior Court which quashed as untimely an appeal filed by Sue Ann Bassett, the appellant herein. Appellant sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County which upheld a master’s decision apportioning marital property pursuant to a divorce.</p>

Appellant decided to take an appeal to the Superior Court. A notice of appeal was required to be filed with the prothonotary of Perry County within thirty days. The thirtieth day fell on October 9, 1994, a Sunday. Monday, October 10, 1994, was Columbus Day. Appellant’s counsel assumed that the prothonotary’s office would be closed on that day. Accordingly, he filed the appeal on Tuesday, October 11, 1994. The prothonotary’s office had, however, been open for business on Columbus Day, the employees having elected to remain open on that day and close instead on the day after Thanksgiving. Since it would have been possible <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>to file the appeal on Columbus Day, Superior Court quashed the appeal as untimely.</p>

Clearly, however, courts of common pleas do not have the power to contravene, by administrative rule, directive, or practice, the duly enacted laws of this Commonwealth and of the United States as to what constitutes a legal holiday. Our legislature has designated the second Monday in October, known as Columbus Day, a legal holiday. 44 P.S. § 11. The same day has been designated by the laws of the United States as a legal holiday. <a href="/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 U.S.C. § 6103">5 U.S.C. § 6103</a>(a).

Appellant’s counsel was entitled to rely on the fact that the day was a legal holiday without having to check with the prothonotary’s office to determine whether someone might be there to receive a notice of appeal.</p>

Uniformity would clearly be undermined by allowing deadlines for filing appeals to vary from county to county depending on whether at any given time the employees of a county choose to honor or ignore legal holidays. The practicing bar is entitled to rely on the fact that, under the Rules of Appellate Procedure, legal holidays falling on the last day of an appeal period will be excluded in determining whether an appeal is timely filed.</p>
