Panichelli (Panichelli) was injured in a motor vehicle accident on December 2, 1987. Panichelli was insured at the time under a policy, issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance Group (Liberty Mutual), which was written and issued in accordance with the provisions of the MVFRL. This policy provided for income loss benefits under the Combination First Party Benefits provision. Panichelli, who was rendered unable to work as a result of the injuries he sustained in the accident, filed a claim with Liberty Mutual for loss of income benefits. During the period from December 3, 1987 through August 1, 1988, Panichelli received sick pay benefits from his employer in an amount equal to his gross income. Liberty Mutual, taking the position that it was entitled to set-off for Panichelli’s sick pay benefit received by him, did not pay any income loss benefits during this time. Liberty Mutual began making income loss benefits to Panichelli after August 1,1988, but took a set-off in <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>an amount equal to Panichelli’s monthly social security disability benefit which he was then receiving.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[295,494,1161,312]]]'>Panichelli then filed the instant action against Liberty Mutual seeking the full amount of his monthly salary less the 20% statutory deduction, for a payment amount of $2,186.80.

The lower courts reasoned that sick pay and social security are “programs” which provide payment of benefits when the ability to earn income is impaired. As the trial court stated in its well-<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>reasoned opinion, the terms in § 1719(a), “any program” and “other arrangement” for payment of benefits, are extremely broad and easily encompass both sick leave benefits and social security benefits. Liberty Mutual urges that the examples used in § 1719(b) show the intent of the Legislature to encompass only health care benefit plans in the definition of “programs” in § 1719(a). This argument, however, fails to address the “includes, but is not limited to” language in § 1719(b). Moreover, it fails to take into consideration the reference made in § 1719(a) to § 1712(2). We agree with the lower courts that, based on the language of § 1719(a), sick pay and social security benefits programs must be construed as providing benefits in excess of, and not in duplication of, the income loss benefits payable under § 1712(2).</p>

These are benefits for which the employee has paid in the form of lower wages for the sick leave benefits and in the form of payroll deductions for the social security benefits. Thus, in receiving his sick leave pay, Panichelli was exhausting his <em>earned </em>employee benefit.. Similarly, Panichelli has paid for social security disability benefits through payroll deductions, and he is now drawing on these benefits because his accident has rendered him unable to work. Liberty Mutual would have us lose sight of the fact that Panichelli has paid for his income loss benefits through premiums he paid Liberty Mutual with his own funds. He is entitled to income loss benefits under his policy in the full amount of his income loss without any offset for sick pay or social security benefits received by him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Liberty Mutual argues that its liability to appellee should be calculated by multiplying his normal monthly salary by 80% and then subtracting the social security benefits from the 80%. If this calculation were performed, Liberty Mutual would then be required to pay appellee only $1,328.90 per month ($2,733.50 (gross income) x 80% — $857.90 (social security benefits) = $1,328.90). Were this scenario accepted, Liberty Mutual would then be paying <em>less </em>than 80% of appellee’s <em>actual loss </em>of gross income. This assertion is incorrect as it also serves to circumvent the liability imposed under § 1712(2)(i).</p>
