Indeed, quite the contrary was proven at the individual voir dire of the 121 prospective jurors. As the trial court noted, 11 of the principal jurors selected had no knowledge of the facts of the case and the 12th juror had a small amount of knowledge but no fixed opinion as to guilt or innocence. <em>See Irvin v.

This leads us to the conclusion that the community was not saturated and as such, Appellant had failed to meet his burden of showing that the pre-trial publicity was prejudicial per se. Compare this present situation with <em>Casper, supra, </em>(where despite the fact that roughly % of the venirepersons had some knowledge of the facts of that case, the court nevertheless held that no presumptive prejudice was <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>proven) and <em>Commonwealth v.

Our review of the record discloses that the Commonwealth’s Third Discovery Answer included copies of the search warrant, supporting affidavit and inventory for the search of the Rucci residence and the affidavit and inventory for the removal of hair and blood from Appellant; however, a copy of the search warrant for the hair and blood was not included in the record sent to this court. We note, however, that defense counsel, Mr. Alterio, stated at the Suppression hearing that he received a copy of the search warrant for the blood and the hair samples during discovery. The following exchange took place between the Court and Mr. Alterio and Mr. Petro, the prosecutor:</p>

The police, in an apparent abundance of caution, also obtained the executor's consent to search the home. Appellant raises the validity of the third party consent given by the executor. However, as we have determined that the wife’s consent was validly given and thus the subsequent search was valid based thereon, we need not reach the issue of the validity of the executor’s consent.</p>
