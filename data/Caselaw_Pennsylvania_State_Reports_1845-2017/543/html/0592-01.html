In 1976, Fiori suffered a second head injury while being treated at a Veterans Administration hospital (‘VA”). Fiori never regained consciousness after this second injury, and he was diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state (“PVS”). The term “vegetative state” describes:</p>

The failure of the Act to address situations such as Fiori’s does not preclude these PVS patients from exercising their right to refuse medical treatment. The legislature was meticulous in stating that the Act does not "impair or supersede any existing rights or responsibilities not addressed in this chapter.” 20 Pa.C.S. § 5412. Furthermore, the Act specifically declared that “[t]he absence of a declaration by a patient shall not give rise to any presumption as to the intent of the patient to consent to or to refuse the initiation, continuation, or termination of life-sustaining treatment.” 20 Pa.C.S. § 5407(b).
