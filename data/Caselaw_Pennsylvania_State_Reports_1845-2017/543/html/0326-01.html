The Agreement provided that Moon Authority would design, construct and operate sanitary sewage facilities in the Montour Run drainage area and furnish sewage services to the airport. In return, Allegheny County agreed to provide funding of approximately $450,000 and pay sewage charges on a monthly basis for sewage service for the airport. More significantly, the Agreement also provided that if a new authority for enlarging and operating the sanitary sewage facilities was created by Allegheny County, then Moon Authority would be compelled to convey the existing sanitary sewage <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>facilities including the sewage treatment plant, certain intercepting and main sewers, any capital additions, all rights-of-way, land and other facilities to the new authority.

    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[269,1375,1161,1017]]]'>The construction of the sanitary sewage treatment facilities was completed in 1973; the facilities are known as the Mont-our Run Water Pollution Control System (“Montour Run System”). In 1988, with a new “Midfield Terminal” under construction for the airport, Allegheny County adopted a resolution to create a new area-wide authority. Consequently, Allegheny County filed articles of incorporation for the “Allegheny Waste Management Authority” and demanded conveyance of the Montour Run System from Moon Authority pursuant to Article XXI of the Agreement. Moon Authority refused to effectuate the conveyance. Allegheny County filed an equity action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County seeking specific performance and also filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings asserting that the trial court must order the conveyance of the Montour Run System as a matter of law. Moon Authority filed an answer and a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting that the conveyance was barred by the Municipal Authorities Act and Moon Authority’s August 1,1963, Trust Indenture.</p>

Thereafter, at the request of Moon Authority the trial court certified the case for immediate appeal. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed, holding that Moon Authority’s power to sell, lease, transfer, or dispose of “property” is unlimited under the Municipal Authorities Act. The Commonwealth Court ordered that the matter be remanded to the trial court to determine the proper compensation owed to Moon Authority for conveyance of the Montour Run System to Allegheny County pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and directed the trial court to require that the present bondholders be paid in full prior to such conveyance. We granted Moon Authority’s petition for allowance of appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[169,1249,1155,799]]]'>The primary issue raised in this appeal is whether Moon Authority has the power under the Municipal Authorities Act to convey its sanitary sewage system to Allegheny County. Moon Authority contends that it is prohibited from conveying the Montour Run System to Allegheny County because the system is a “project” and that under the Municipal Authorities Act, Moon Authority is precluded from selling or transferring a “project” to an entity other than Moon Township. In support of this proposition, Moon Authority raises two arguments. First, Moon Authority argues that 53 P.S. § 317 and § 321 of the Municipal Authorities Act provide the exclusive method by which a project may be conveyed under the Act. Second, Moon Authority contends that the Municipal Authorities Act purposefully differentiates between an authority’s power to sell or transfer property as opposed to a project.</p>

If the legislature intended to limit an authority’s power to convey its property it would not have used such expansive language. Moreover, this Court has recognized instances in which an authority’s waterworks project was sold to another authority. <em>See Burke v.

Specifically, Moon Authority contends that although an authority is permitted to convey real property without limitation under 53 P.S. § 306 B(d), an authority is not permitted to convey a “project” such as a sanitary sewer system without limitation since the Municipal Authorities Act only expressly allows for the purchase and not the sale or transfer of “projects” under 53 P.S. § 306 B(e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Relying on the rule of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(the inclusion of one thing indicates an intent to exclude the other), Moon Authority suggests that the legislature intended to preclude the sale of projects by an authority under the Municipal Authorities Act. However, such a strict reading of the Municipal Authorities Act would require that § 306 B(d) be ignored in its entirety. This we will not do. It is well established that when determining the meaning of a statute, we must assume that the intent of the General Assembly was not to produce an absurd or unreasonable result. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1). Moreover, practical results of a particular interpretation may be considered when examining the meaning of a statute. <em>Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farmers v. Commonwealth, Bureau of Employment Sec. etc., </em><a href="/pa/498/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="498 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1776049" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0521-01">498 Pa. 521</a>, 526, <a href="/pa/498/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="498 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1776049" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0521-01">447 A.2d 948</a>, 950 (1982); 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(6). To prevent an authority from selling projects when it can clearly sell property would inevitably cause havoc upon our local governments. In particular, such an interpretation would prevent an authority which is experiencing financial difficulties or is threatened with bankruptcy from selling off portions of its property or its entire project in order to improve its fiscal position or to meet its bond obligations. This is clearly not a consequence that <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>the legislature intended and is not a position that this Court is willing to take under the guise of such a strict interpretation.</p>
    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[168,473,1156,1386]]]'>Moreover, the principles of equity do not permit Moon Authority to escape its accountability under the parties Agreement. To reach another conclusion would be nothing less than egregious. This is particularly relevant in light of the fact that Moon Authority and Allegheny County bargained for and entered into a contract which provided that Allegheny County was entitled to the Montour Run System in the event that the County needed to expand the sanitary sewage system in that region. Furthermore, Allegheny County provided a significant amount of consideration (nearly a half of a million dollars in 1970 plus an agreement to pay a monthly service fee) to help build the very sanitary sewage facilities that Moon Authority now wishes to maintain as its own. The Montour Run System itself perhaps would never have been built without the funds provided by Allegheny County and the Agreement most likely would never have been entered into but for the stipulation that Moon Authority would convey the property to Allegheny County. We should not have to remind Moon Authority that the statutory language which it now relies upon in order to avoid their contractual obligation was, in fact, enacted well before this Agreement was reached. Moreover, as previously stated, an authority is specifically empowered to sell, lease or transfer <em>any </em>property without limitation. This obviously would include, <em>inter alia, </em>the system’s sewage treatment plant, intercepting and main sewers lines, rights-of-way and any real property,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Moon Authority argues that the 1963 Trust Indenture, in existence before the 1970 Agreement at <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>issue, requires that the Authority receive authorization from its consulting engineer that the sale is in the best interest of the Authority before it can sell its property. Moon Authority’s Trust Indenture states in relevant part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[324,565,1117,523]]]'>No sale or other disposition of fixed properties having a value in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) shall be made unless the Consulting Engineer shall first have filed his certificate with the Authority and the Trustee recommending such sale or other disposition of said fixed properties and shall have stated in such certificate that the sale or other disposition of said properties is in the best interest of the Authority and will not impair the security of the bonds and the retention of said properties is not necessary for the efficient operation of the Water and Sewer System.</blockquote>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[280,1111,1160,898]]]'>Moon Authority contends that its consulting engineer does not believe that the sale is in the best interest of the Authority. Moon Authority also asserts that the Commonwealth Court’s order requiring that the engineer file the certificate required by the Trust Indenture would violate the ethical standards of his profession. However, aside from making the bald assertion that its own consulting engineer believes that the conveyance would not be in the best interest of the authority, Moon Authority fails to demonstrate how the sale would impair the rights of the bondholders or how it would adversely affect the efficient sanitary sewage services in Moon Township or in the region. To the contrary, by acquiring the Montour Run System, Allegheny County would be able to provide effective sewage services for the entire region including Moon Township, other municipalities and the International Airport. In fact, this was the very reason that the parties entered into this Agreement in the first place.</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[279,2032,1162,365]],["BL_475.1",475,[168,341,1150,96]]]'>Furthermore, as the Commonwealth Court correctly points out, the Agreement between the parties was entered into seven years after the Trust Indenture was created. Thus, the terms of the Agreement, including the possible conveyance of the property over to Allegheny County, were entered into with the full knowledge of the requirements of the Trust Indenture. Any attempt now to avoid accountability under the Agreement <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>through the terms of the Trust Indenture would only infer that Moon Authority entered into the contract in bad faith.</p>
