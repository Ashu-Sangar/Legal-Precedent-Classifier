    <p id="b185-12" data-blocks='[["BL_185.11",185,[164,1654,1154,311]]]'>The sole issue raised in this case is whether the police may conduct a warrantless search of an automobile, absent exigent circumstances, after its occupants have been arrested and are outside the automobile in police custody. For the reasons that follow, we hold that such a search is illegal and that evidence seized as a result must be suppressed.</p>
    <p id="b185-13" data-blocks='[["BL_185.12",185,[162,1992,1153,423]]]'>The facts of record are that in late 1989 Pittsburgh police received anonymous telephone calls identifying William White and Henry Bennett as drug dealers. The caller described the two men and gave their addresses and locations where they allegedly dealt drugs. Subsequently, police met with a confidential informer who confirmed the information given by the anonymous caller and added a description of Bennett’s car and the method by which the two made drug deliveries.</p>

      <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>In late January, 1990, police arranged a controlled purchase of cocaine using the confidential informer. One of the two officers who witnessed the purchase and the informer identified White as the person who sold cocaine to the informer. The material purchased from White tested positively as cocaine.</p>
    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[253,701,1159,411]]]'>In February, 1990, the confidential informer told police that he had seen a large supply of cocaine in Bennett’s house; that Bennett told him that he would be selling cocaine that weekend; and that the drugs were being moved back and forth between Bennett’s and White’s residences. He also told detectives that the dealers intended to make a sale of cocaine behind Abbott’s Beer Distributor on Saturday, February 17, 1990.</p>
    <p id="b186-6" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[250,1145,1161,475]]]'>Police arranged to have the area put under surveillance on February 17. The two detectives who had been working on the case met with others who would be assisting that day and briefed them. The essence of what the other police were told was that a blue car was expected to be involved in an illegal drug sale. Early on February 17, the two detectives who controlled the investigation drove by Bennett’s house and witnessed Bennett, White and another man standing on the front porch.</p>
    <p id="b186-7" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[252,1644,1157,312]]]'>Based on the totality of their information, the detectives secured search warrants for Bennett’s residence, his vehicle, and his person as well as White’s residence and person. They did not obtain a search warrant for White’s vehicle. The detectives then returned to the stakeout area and communicated to other officers that they had secured search warrants.</p>
    <p id="b186-8" data-blocks='[["BL_186.7",186,[250,1982,1157,259]]]'>Shortly thereafter, White drove his blue Ford into the area. An unidentified man got into White’s car, and as this was happening, Bennett drove into the area and passed White’s car several times before leaving the area. When Bennett was gone, police converged upon White’s car.</p>

According to one officer’s account, the driver emerged at gunpoint; another officer, who was also present, said that the driver exited the car voluntarily after the officer identified himself and asked him to come out of the car.</p>
    <p id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[128,668,1154,482]]]'>Next, two officers partially entered the car from both open doors. The officer on the passenger side of the car first noticed and communicated to his colleague that a marijuana cigarette was present on the console between the seats; moments after that the officer on the driver’s side retrieved a brown paper bag from between the two front seats, which he took outside the car to open. Upon discovering that the bag contained cocaine, the officer announced to the others that he had “the dope,” and the occupants of the car were handcuffed.</p>
    <p id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[125,1193,1155,479]]]'>The court of common pleas, sitting as a suppression court, suppressed the evidence on the grounds that White was not arrested until after the warrantless search uncovered a marijuana cigarette and the cocaine. The court further observed that there were no exigent circumstances justifying a warrant-less search of the car and that police had time to secure a search warrant for the vehicle because they received information about the February 17 transaction between thirty-six and forty-eight hours before the search.</p>
    <p id="b187-7" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[123,1715,1154,691]]]'>Superior Court reversed, holding that a search warrant for White’s automobile was not required because police had probable cause to search the vehicle and the search was properly conducted pursuant to the “automobile exception” to the warrant requirement. The rationale for this exception is said to be that it is impracticable to obtain warrants for vehicles in transit because of their highly mobile nature, and that absent the search it is possible that the vehicle will be moved and contraband will disappear. Superior Court acknowledged that a warrantless search of a vehicle is permissible only when probable cause arises in an unforeseen way, but concluded that probable cause was unforeseen in this case because it was unknown what vehicle would be used.</p>

      <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>Superior Court also held that in any event, the search occurred “incident to a lawful arrest,” and was, therefore, justified.</p>

This claim is meritless. White clearly raises a claim under the Pennsylvania Constitution, cites cases in support of his claim, and relates the cases to the claim. That is sufficient. In <em>Edmunds, </em>in dicta, this court clearly stressed the importance of briefing and analyzing certain factors in order to aid the courts in reviewing state constitutional issues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> While not mandating the analysis, we reaffirm its importance and encourage its use. In other words, <em>Edmunds </em>expresses the idea that it may be helpful to address the concerns listed therein, not that these concerns must be addressed in order for a claim asserted under the Pennsylvania Constitution to be cognizable.</p>

      <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Having concluded that White has raised cognizable claims under the Pennsylvania Constitution, it remains to address whether the search was justified because it was conducted pursuant to the “automobile exception”; whether the search was justified because the probable cause on which it was based arose in an unforeseen manner; whether the search was permissible because it was incident to an arrest; and whether the search is to be excused because an inventory search would have disclosed the same evidence.</p>

Nonetheless, when Ionata drove up to his apartment, police removed him from the car and searched the car, finding illegal narcotics and drug paraphernalia.

The first prong we are required to analyze under <em>Edmunds </em>is the text of the Pennsylvania Constitutional provision. In <em>Edmunds, </em>we noted that Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is “similar in language” to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>Edmunds, </em>526 Pa. at 391, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="586 A.2d 887" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d at 887</a>.

It has long been the rule in this Commonwealth that the police may search the passenger compartment of a car incident to an arrest only to protect their safety or to prevent the occupants from destroying contraband. <em>Timko, </em><a href="/pa/491/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="181" data-cite="491 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1765690" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0032-01">491 Pa. at 37</a>, <a href="/pa/491/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="491 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1765690" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0032-01">417 A.2d at 622</a>. In contrast, the <em>Belton </em>rule allows the police to search the passenger compartment and any containers contained therein even where no such exigency exists. The instant case demonstrates this point. Here, the defendant was removed from the car and arrested. At this point, the safety of the officers was no longer in jeopardy, and the defendant was unable to <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>destroy any evidence contained in the passenger compartment. Had the officers wanted to conduct an evidentiary search of the car, they could have secured the vehicle and obtained a proper search warrant. In my opinion, <em>Belton </em>carves too wide an exception to the warrant requirement where none is justified. We are asked today to follow <em>Belton </em>and dispense with the privacy interest in an automobile long recognized in our state constitution for the sake of a bright line rule. I am not convinced that our previous rule found in <em>Timko </em>and based upon <em>Chimel </em>created such practical law enforcement problems in this Commonwealth as to mandate that we dramatically curtail the privacy rights of motorists for the sake of a bright-line rule. In short, I do not believe that the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in <em>Belton </em>carries the day. In my opinion, the widely criticized reasoning of <em>Belton, </em>the long-recognized privacy interest in an automobile under the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the lack of any evidence of insurmountable law enforcement problems in enforcing the current rule in this Commonwealth convince me that there are important and substantial reasons for departing from federal Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in this case. Like several of our sister states, I would not follow the <em>Belton </em>bright line rule; instead I would maintain the rule set forth in <em>Chimel.</em>

This Court has previously adopted bright line rules where “experience proved it to be difficult for law enforcement <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>officials to administer” more flexible rules based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v.

The United States Supreme Court, in adopting a bright line rule permitting searches incident to arrest, reasoned that a “police officer’s determination as to how and where to search the person of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quick ad hoc judgment which the Fourth Amendment does not require to be broken down in each instance into an analysis of each step of the search.” <em>United States v. Robinson, </em><a href="/us/414/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="210" data-cite="414 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="11715586" data-case-paths="/us/414/0218-01">414 U.S. 218</a>, 235, <a href="/us/414/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="211" data-cite="414 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="11715586" data-case-paths="/us/414/0218-01">94 S.Ct. 467</a>, 477, <a href="/us/414/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="212" data-cite="414 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="11715586" data-case-paths="/us/414/0218-01">38 L.Ed.2d 427</a> (1973).</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[186,1126,1157,1242]]]'>This rationale is equally applicable to the present situation. To require a police officer who has independent probable cause to search a vehicle to first consider whether there was sufficient probable cause based on other factors upon which he could have obtained a warrant prior to stopping the car creates uncertainty and confusion for both the police and the citizen who may be subject to the search. In order to deter what some may consider police misconduct and to afford citizens a clear understanding of what the law is, I would urge the adoption of a bright line rule that would allow warrantless searches of all automobiles for which police have independent probable cause to believe: “that a felony has been committed by the occupants of the vehicle, or that it has been used in the furtherance of the commission of a felony, or the officer must have a basis for believing that evidence of a crime is concealed within the vehicle, or that there are weapons therein which are accessible to the occupants.” <em>Commonwealth v. Lewis, </em><a href="/pa/442/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="442 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1935432" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0098-01">442 Pa. 98</a>, at 101, <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%2051" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="275 A.2d 51">275 A.2d 51</a>, at 52 (1971). Such a bright line rule would prevent police from having to make a Solomon’s choice of whether to either try to obtain a warrant and risk flight of the automobile and its occupants, or to not obtain a warrant and risk suppression of the contraband in the automobile.</p>

      <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>I must further note that the majority’s statement declining to adopt the bright line rule of <em>New York v. Belton, </em><a href="/us/453/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="215" data-cite="453 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="11722898" data-case-paths="/us/453/0454-01">453 U.S. 454</a>, <a href="/us/453/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="216" data-cite="453 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="11722898" data-case-paths="/us/453/0454-01">101 S.Ct. 2860</a>, <a href="/us/453/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="217" data-cite="453 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="11722898" data-case-paths="/us/453/0454-01">69 L.Ed.2d 768</a> (1981), is unnecessary dicta and as such would not be binding authority. The issue in the present case is whether suppression is required where police failed to obtain a warrant even though they had sufficient probable cause to do so before the search, and <em>not </em>the permissible scope of a search once a car is stopped, which is the issue presented in <em>Belton. </em>Indeed, neither party even cited <em>Belton </em>or addressed the <em>Belton </em>issue in their briefs or in oral argument. Because the issue of whether this Commonwealth should adopt <em>Belton </em>was therefore not before this Court, any ruling on that issue is merely dicta. <em>Tulewicz v. SEPTA </em><a href="/pa/529/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="218" data-cite="529 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="1831209" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0588-01">529 Pa. 588</a>, 594, <a href="/pa/529/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="219" data-cite="529 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="1831209" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0588-01">606 A.2d 427</a>, 429 (1992) (Court’s comments on issue not raised or argued by either party before the Court are dicta). As Mr. Justice Flaherty so aptly stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Blouse, </em>while dicta may be instructive in predicting what direction this Court is likely to take on a given issue, it “is not what is meant by precedential authority in our system of jurisprudence.” <a href="/pa/531/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="220" data-cite="531 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1834402" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0167-01">531 Pa. 167</a>, 176, <a href="/pa/531/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="221" data-cite="531 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1834402" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0167-01">611 A.2d 1177</a>, 1182 (1992) (Justice Flaherty, dissenting). Therefore, the majority’s assertion that <em>Belton </em>does not apply in this Commonwealth does not have the authority of <em>stare decisis.</em>
