    <p id="b325-13" data-blocks='[["BL_325.13",325,[183,1683,1152,529]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from an order of the Superi- or Court which vacated an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granting summary judgment in favor of the appellant, Paul Davis Systems of Pittsburgh South, Inc. (PDS). The appellee, Republic Insurance Company (Republic), as subrogee of the holder of one of its homeowner’s policies, sought recovery from PDS for damages to the policyholder’s residence. At issue is whether recovery is barred by a release executed by the insured. The factual background of the case is as follows.</p>

On June 8, 1988, a rainstorm occurred, causing further damage to the structure. Republic paid for substantially all of the damages. Later, the insured sued Republic alleging that there were additional unreimbursed losses. Republic settled the claim by making an additional payment of $5,000, and obtained a release.</p>

In defense, PDS interposed the release which Republic had obtained from the insured. PDS asserted that the release was a general one containing language broad enough to bar Republic’s claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of PDS.</p>
