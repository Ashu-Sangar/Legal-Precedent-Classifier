Samms, a would-be candidate in the April 23,1996 primary election.</p>
    <p id="b821-4" data-blocks='[["BL_821.4",821,[164,499,1152,693]]]'>Samms seeks the Democratic Party’s nomination, from the 167th district, for the office of Representative in the General Assembly. A candidate for that office must file a nomination petition containing at least three hundred signatures. Election Code, 25 P.S. § 2872.1(14). Samms filed a petition containing three hundred three signatures. Appellee Myron R. Henninger, a registered Democrat who resides in the 167th district, filed a petition challenging five of the signatures. Two were alleged to be from persons registered in another political party. Two more were alleged to be from persons residing outside of the 167th district. An additional one was challenged as a duplicate, since Samms had signed his own nomination petition twice.</p>
    <p id="b821-5" data-blocks='[["BL_821.5",821,[164,1233,1152,150]]]'>Samms filed a motion to dismiss Henninger’s petition. He did not dispute the merits of the petition. Rather, he asserted that Henninger lacked standing as a real party in interest.</p>
    <p id="b821-6" data-blocks='[["BL_821.6",821,[163,1424,1153,312]]]'>Samms claims that Henninger is a mere straw party in this action. He contends that Henninger does not actually wish to deny him the nomination, and that Henninger filed this action only as a favor to friends in the Republican Party. Samms further contends that counsel for Henninger is being paid by a Republican organization.</p>
    <p id="b821-7" data-blocks='[["BL_821.7",821,[162,1777,1153,636]]]'>The real parties in interest, according to Samms, are various Republicans who solicited Henninger to assist in challenging the nomination petition. Samms claims that without the cooperation of a registered Democrat to act as a straw party in filing this action, the Republicans would have been unable to secure a challenge to his candidacy. This reflects the established rule that members of one party do not have standing to contest the nomination process of an opposing party.

He also acknowledged that his fees were likely being paid by a Republican source. Another witness, a Democratic Party official, testified that Henninger expressed an intention to vote for Samms in the general election if Samms became the Democratic nominee. The witness related that Henninger said that he filed this action as a favor to a friend. He testified further that Henninger expressed a desire not to go back on his word to his friend. Samms also testified, and he too related statements made by Henninger declaring that Henninger would vote for him in the general election and stating that this action was filed as a favor to a friend. None of the witnesses testified, however, that Henninger ever stated a desire to withdraw the action. Henninger was not called as a witness and did not attend the hearing.</p>

    <p id="b823-6" data-blocks='[["BL_823.6",823,[141,983,1154,638]]]'>Thus, to have standing to challenge a nomination petition, one must be registered to vote in the district holding the primary election and be a member of the political party to which the nomination pertains. Under <em>Pasquay, </em>there are no other requirements. Thus, Henninger, as a Democrat registered to vote in the 167th district, had standing to challenge the nomination petition of that district’s Democratic candidate, Samms. The court below properly interpreted <em>Pasquay </em>as not making the existence of standing dependent on other factors, such as the challenger’s underlying intentions and motivations. Such factors are simply not relevant when the requirements of standing set forth in <em>Pasquay </em>have been met.</p>
    <p id="b823-7" data-blocks='[["BL_823.7",823,[139,1655,1156,637]]]'>Samms next contends that the court below erred in denying his motion for dismissal of Henninger’s petition. Dismissal was sought on the ground that Henninger was not present at the hearing. The motion was denied on the basis that Henninger was not required to attend, given that he made an appearance through counsel of record. Henninger’s Democratic registration and residence within the 167th district were not contested; hence, there was no need for him to testify as to those matters. Also, Samms had not subpoenaed Henninger, even though he learned in advance that Henninger was not planning to attend. In short, there was no requirement for Henninger to be present.</p>

That rule provides: “A party who fails to appear for trial shall be deemed to be not ready without satisfactory excuse.” The note accompanying the rule provides: “The mere failure to appear for trial is a ground for the entry of a nonsuit or a judgment of non pros....” Samms’ reliance on this rule is, however, misplaced.
