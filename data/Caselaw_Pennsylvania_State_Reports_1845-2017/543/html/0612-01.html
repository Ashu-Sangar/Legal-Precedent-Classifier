The Commonwealth first made this offer over the objection of [Appellant] that it was a hearsay statement; and after [the court] sustained the objection on the grounds that the statement made to the officer focused on the issue before the court, to-wit the charge against [Appellant] of operating while under the influence, the statement could not possibly be one stated merely for the fact of what was said.

We note that there is some confusion in the record as to the specific issue presented at the suppression hearing. The prosecutor informed the trial judge that he had spoken with defense counsel and that "the only issue [they were] really addressing ... [was] in regard to the initial stop made by the officer and his initial contact with [Appellant] and whether he had probable cause or a reasonable suspicion to do so.” Notes of Testimony of December 8, 1993 Suppression Hearing (N.T.) at <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>1. The court, however, responded, "So for the record, that’s the only issue is [sic] whether there was probable cause to perfect an arrest?” (N.T. at 1-2). The prosecutor responded in the affirmative and defense counsel clarified that the issue was the validity of the stop of the vehicle based on the observations of the officer.</p>

In his Concurring/Dissenting Opinion, Chief Justice Nix finds that based upon the “totality of the circumstances,” sufficient grounds existed to support the stop. Applying the proper standard of whether there were reasonable and articulable grounds to suspect that a violation of the Vehicle Code had occurred, we must only consider the circumstances known to the officer prior to the stop. Here, Cressley’s statement coupled with the fact that it was 2:45 a.m. is insufficient to meet this standard. The fact that Officer Moore identified Cressley from a previous encounter does not add to her credibility. Because Officer Moore had no other ground upon which to base his "suspicion,” the stop was invalid.</p>

The bar closed at 2:00 a.m. (R.R. at 38a). The timing and location of this observation aroused Officer Moore’s suspicion. (R.R. at 5a). Officer Moore testified that he drove over to the parking lot to ascertain why the people were there. (R.R. at 6a). He <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>further testified that Cressley and another woman were standing next to the driver’s side of Appellant’s vehicle. (R.R. at 6a). Although the officer was unable to identify Appellant at that time, he was fairly certain that the person behind the wheel in the vehicle was a male. (R.R. at 6a-7a).

One of the women, Cressley, informed the officer that everything was alright and that she had Appellant’s keys; the clear implication being Appellant was intoxicated. (R.R. at 38a). Officer Moore testified that he had no reason to believe that she would lie to him. (R.R. at 30a).

Officer Moore then noticed Appellant’s vehicle coming out of the parking lot. (R.R. at 25a-26a). The officer testified that he recognized Appellant’s car because of its missing grill. (R.R. 26). Officer Moore then put his paperwork away, put the car in gear, and pulled out into the street. (R.R. at 26a). The officer testified that it was his intention to find out who was driving.

I believe that the majority’s attention to Officer Moore’s failure to “further inquire as to whether Appellant was fit to drive” is misplaced. Op. at 618. Based on Cressley’s statement that she had the keys, there was no reason to investigate further. By failing to inquire fiirther, it can be reasonably assumed that Officer Moore believed Cressley’s assurances that everything was alright and that the situation, at least for the time being, did not warrant further action on his part. This is especially true in this case where Officer Moore testified that he knew Cressley and had no reason to believe that she would lie to him. (R.R. at 7a, 30a). Thus, it would have been perfectly reasonable for the officer to believe that either Cressley or the other woman would have driven Appellant home or that Appellant was going to wait and sober up before driving.</p>
