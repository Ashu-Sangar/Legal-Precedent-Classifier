    <p id="b345-7" data-blocks='[["BL_345.6",345,[164,594,1156,1275]]]'>Appellant, Andre Stevens, was convicted, following a non-jury trial, of two counts of first degree murder<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and one count of possessing a firearm without a license<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>. At the penalty hearing, Appellant elected to proceed with a jury, which determined that he should be sentenced to death on both murder counts. As to both victims, the jury found as aggravating circumstances that the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7), and that the defendant has been convicted of another murder, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(11). As to one victim, Michael Love, the jury found a third aggravating circumstance, that the killing was committed by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8). In both cases the jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed two mitigating circumstances: the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1), and he was under the influence of extreme mental and emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2). Post-trial motions were filed, argued and denied. On September 26, 1994, Appellant was formally sentenced to death based on the sentencing jury’s verdict and to a concurrent term of imprisonment of twelve to sixty months for the firearms violation. Direct appeal from the judgment of sentence was taken to this Court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h).</p>

As Stevens and Love were leaving the dance floor in different directions, Appellant opened fire on them. He shot his estranged wife twice in the head. Appellant then turned toward Love and fired a series of shots into his body. After a brief pause, Appellant fired a final shot into Love’s scrotum area and then calmly left the bar.

Pre-trial publicity will be deemed inherently prejudicial where the publicity is sensational, inflammatory, slanted towards conviction rather than factual and objective; revealed that the accused had a criminal record; referred to confessions, admissions or re-enactments of the crime by the accused; or derived from reports from the police and prosecuting officers. <em>Commonwealth v.

Although the motion was denied, the trial court agreed to frame its voir dire questions in such a way as to determine if any prospective juror was predisposed to a penalty as a result of the pre-trial publicity.

Furthermore, the Commonwealth contends, the media coverage that reported the guilt phase of the trial was objective and based upon information that was already a part of the record. With respect to the Supplemental Motion for Change of Venue or Venire, the Commonwealth argues that the news coverage of the trial court’s order summoning thirty more prospective jurors from the county at large only detailed the manner in which the prospective jurors were summoned.
