Not only did the court overlook Appellant’s failure to comply with this directive, the record indicates that the court went to great lengths to ensure that Appellant was afforded ample opportunity to present evidence in support of his claims for relief.

It is almost incomprehensible how, upon being given two months’ notice, he can now contend that a continuance was necessary to present his evidence.

Appellant argues that the Commonwealth withheld evidence prior to trial in violation of Rule 305 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In support of this claim, Appellant contends that the Commonwealth used a pair of gloves found in the victim’s car as the basis for showing color photographic <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>slides to the jury at his trial. The motive for showing these gloves, Appellant argues, is that “the jury could be expected to infer that [the] Commonwealth’s lack of offering fingerprints of [Appellant] could be attributed to the wearing of these gloves.” Brief for Appellant at 13.</p>
    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[187,619,1151,572]]]'>The crux of Appellant’s claim is that because the gloves were not introduced as evidence at trial, the jury should not have been permitted to view the photographic slides in which the gloves were shown.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Apart from the highly speculative and convoluted reasoning offered by Appellant on this point, we are not presented with any substantive basis to conclude that Appellant was prejudiced by the jury having viewed these slides. Rather, we find Appellant’s explanation, that he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth’s failure to show that his fingerprints were found at the murder scene, to border on the absurd.</p>
    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[185,1222,1153,796]]]'>The gloves are also the focus of a separate charge of wrongdoing by the Commonwealth. Appellant characterizes the gloves as “newly discovered evidence” and makes the unsubstantiated claim that “although [he] has for years sought to provide definitive proof of the actual assailant’s identity through latent fingerprint testing and/or DNA testing, the Commonwealth has avoided this specific scientific testing.” Brief for Appellant at 14. Appellant implies that the Commonwealth has intentionally prevented him from disproving his guilt with respect to this evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> However, the record indicates that the gloves were present at the April 6, 1994, hearing, and, according to the assistant district attorney, had been made available for Appellant’s inspection at all times prior to that hearing.

Although Appellant would have us believe that the trial court’s ruling has foreclosed him from pursuing any future claims for relief under the PCRA, our review of the record belies such an implication. Notwithstanding the fact that Appellant was afforded the opportunity to raise any and all issues that he believed warranted relief, the court specifically stated that it was denying only the specific claims presented in Appellant’s Motion for a New Trial as evidenced by the following oral ruling:</p>
      <blockquote id="b453-9" data-blocks='[["BL_453.8",453,[254,2306,1083,74]],["BL_454.1",454,[320,1707,1094,154]]]'>[T]hese are matters that I understand your position, and having heard it, I’m going to deny your motion in this regard as far as the gloves <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>and the other items that I’ve mentioned, and I indicated that I was prepared to hear additional testimony at another time on other issues, but I have no basis to do that. You’ve given no basis to do that, so that <em>I’m ruling on what is here now, and that's it.</em>

      <p id="b454-8" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[255,1934,1158,273]]]'>. Counsel states in Appellant’s brief to this Court that Appellant was notified immediately after the evidentiary hearing was scheduled on February 8, 1994, and instructed to reply to materials and statements in anticipation of that hearing. Counsel submits that Appellant did not respond "for whatever reason” until the day before the hearing. Brief for Appellant at 9. This is clearly insufficient to explain Appellant's unresponsiveness or lack of preparation.</p>

      <p id="b454-9" data-blocks='[["BL_454.8",454,[256,2227,1156,154]]]'>. Counsel for Appellant erroneously refers to this rule throughout Appellant’s brief as "Rule 305 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence." Counsel, a member of the Pennsylvania bar, is apparently unaware that the rules of evidence in Pennsylvania have not as yet been codified.</p>

These charges do not rise to the level of a claim that can be properly evaluated in the course of our review.</p>
