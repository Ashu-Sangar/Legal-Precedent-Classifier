The passenger of the vehicle got out and proceeded in a northbound direction as Rodriquez’s co-defendant, Felix Ramos, approached him. The two men engaged in conversation. The passenger then handed Ramos an undetermined amount of United States currency, which prompted Ramos to turn to Rodriquez and state, “One.” (R.R. at 29a). At this point, Rodriquez walked west on Oxford Street until he was outside the officer’s field of vision. Approximately five seconds later, Officer Fetters saw Rodriquez walking back towards the unidentified passenger.

The back-up officers were able to locate the vehicle and subsequently arrested the passenger.

If an observation location becomes known to the public at large, its value to law enforcement probably will be lost. The revelation, moreover, may jeopardize the lives of police officers and of cooperative occupants of the building.” <em>Anderson v.

Arguably, the reasons for maintaining the confidentiality of a surveillance site may be more compelling than the reasons for protecting the identity of a confidential informant.

It was also elicited that people were playing basketball on a court adjacent to a vacant lot on the northeast comer of Lawrence Street and that these people were between Officer Fetters’ surveillance location and the place where the buyer’s car was parked on Lawrence Street. (R.R. at 50a-58a). Using this information, defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined Officer Fetters as <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>to his ability to view the illicit drug transaction clearly and without obstruction. It is apparent from a review of this cross-examination that defense counsel had deduced the approximate location of the confidential surveillance site and was able to conduct an effective cross-examination with that information. Accordingly, we must agree with the Superior Court that Rodriquez has failed to meet his burden of explaining how a more detailed disclosure of the confidential surveillance location would have been necessary to his defense.</p>
    <p id="b798-5" data-blocks='[["BL_798.4",798,[280,875,1162,685]]]'>We likewise find that Feliciano has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that disclosure of the exact surveillance was necessary. Feliciano claims that he needed to know the precise location where the surveillance took place in order to “show, through extrinsic photographic evidence, that the observing officer’s view into the buyer’s car was blocked by light reflections on the windshield.” Brief for Appellant at 17. Although this appears to be a more specific and compelling basis for disclosure, our review of the record satisfies us that disclosure of the exact surveillance location would not have assisted the defense in proving this theory. With respect to this issue, the following exchange took place on cross-examination:</p>
    <blockquote id="b798-6" data-blocks='[["BL_798.5",798,[321,1586,1116,147]]]'>Q. [by defense counsel] Would it be fair to say that there was a reflection coming off the windshield [of the buyer’s car]?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b798-7" data-blocks='[["BL_798.6",798,[321,1754,663,42]]]'>A. [by the surveillance officer] No.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b798-8" data-blocks='[["BL_798.7",798,[321,1920,1116,157]]]'>Q. To the best of your recollection, you saw no reflection? A There was no reflection on the windshield when I looked through.</blockquote>
    <p id="b798-9" data-blocks='[["BL_798.8",798,[280,2099,1159,312]],["BL_799.1",799,[148,359,1154,796]]]'>(N.T. 5/29/92, 28-24). Officer Brosnan, the surveillance officer, was shown a photograph of the intersection taken from the perspective of what was described as the approximate surveillance location. (N.T. 5/29/92, 23). The photograph depicted a car parked in the vicinity of where the officer testified that he had observed the buyer’s car. (N.T. 5/29/92, <a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>23) . Although Officer Brosnan testified that a glare was present on the windshield of the car in the photograph, he reiterated that there was no such glare when he observed the transaction between Feliciano and the buyer. (N.T. 5/29/92, 24) . Based on this fine of cross-examination, we fail to see how a more precise description of the surveillance location would have enabled defense counsel to expand on the theory that the officer’s view was impaired by light glare. Had Officer Brosnan’s exact surveillance location been disclosed, it is not apparent, and Feliciano does not explain, how this cross-examination would have been different or more effective. Thus, we conclude that the Superior Court was correct in holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding disclosure of the exact confidential surveillance location.</p>
    <p id="b799-5" data-blocks='[["BL_799.4",799,[147,1201,1154,638]]]'>Finally, we must address the argument of both Appellants that our recent holding in <em>Commonwealth v. Payne, </em><a href="/pa/540/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="540 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="472142" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0054-01">540 Pa. 54</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="656 A.2d 77" data-case-ids="472142,7864181" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0054-01,/a2d/656/0077-01">656 A.2d 77</a> (1994), is applicable to our resolution of the question of disclosure. In <em>Payne, </em>an alleged drug sale between the defendant and an undercover state trooper was witnessed by a confidential informant. At trial, the only Commonwealth witness was the trooper, and the defendant raised a defense of mistaken identity. In order to challenge the trooper’s identification, the defendant sought to compel the prosecution to produce the confidential informant. The trial court denied this request, and the defendant was convicted. The Superior Court affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b799-6" data-blocks='[["BL_799.5",799,[147,1881,1155,529]]]'>On appeal, we stated that “[w]here other corroboration of the officer’s testimony exists, disclosure of the informant’s identity is ... not necessarily required.” <a href="/pa/540/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="540 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="472142" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0054-01">540 Pa. at 59</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="656 A.2d 77" data-case-ids="472142,7864181" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0054-01,/a2d/656/0077-01">656 A.2d at 79</a>. However, where, as in Payne’s case, the confidential informant was the only material witness other than the lone police officer, we held that fundamental fairness mandates disclosure of the informant’s identity. Rodriquez and Feliciano contend that like <em>Payne, </em>the Commonwealth’s case in each instance rests on the uncorroborated testimony a single police officer. We disagree.</p>

      <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>In each Appellant’s ease, the surveillance officer relayed a description of the observed individuals to backup officers who made immediate arrests based on the descriptions that they had received. Thus, there were other officers on the scene who were able to corroborate each surveillance officer’s description. In contrast, the undercover officer in <em>Payne </em>was the only individual (other than the informant) involved in the transaction. Furthermore, the defendant in <em>Payne </em>was not arrested until seven months after the transaction. In addition, unlike <em>Payne, </em>the withheld information in either of the instant cases could not offer a version of the events that conflicts with the testimony of the surveillance officers. The most that the defense could have gained from disclosure of the actual surveillance location is further information to cast doubt on the ability of the officers to clearly view the illicit drug transactions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The facts of these cases are clearly distinguishable from <em>Payne </em>and therefore compel a different result.</p>

The trial court dismissed Rodriquez’s post trial motions for failure to file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal as required by Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure.

Thus, the court addressed the merits of Rodri<a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>quez’s appeal because it determined that Rodriquez’s failure to file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal did not impede its review of the issues presented on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.
