The referee awarded Appellee, Rachael Brown, benefits pursuant to the Workers’ Compensation Act, Act of June 4, 1937, P.L. 1552, § 1 (codified as amended at 77 P.S. §§ 1-1603) (“the Act”) for a partial disability. This Court granted review to address the issue of whether the Act provides for the payment of partial disability benefits to an injured employee after she returns to a light duty position earning the same hourly rate as she was paid prior to her injury but less than her average weekly wage as calculated at the time of her injury due to the unavailability of overtime for all employees. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

On March 2, 1992, Appellee remained physically unable to resume her pre-injury position but returned to a light duty position which paid the same hourly rate as she had been paid in her pre-injury position. Upon returning to this light duty position, Appellee signed a supplemental agreement which suspended her benefits until her average weekly wage could be determined. Later that month, Appellee filed a Petition for Review claiming a loss of earnings as of the date she returned to work in her light duty position. The parties entered into a stipulation of facts agreeing that prior to Appellee’s work injury, overtime was available and this overtime accounted for Appellee’s average weekly wage being $640.68. Appellee further stipulated that the difference between her earnings in her light duty position and her pre-injury position was due to economic conditions which made overtime unavailable and not her work-related disability.</p>

Appellant further argues that section 772<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> of the Act prevents the award of partial disability benefits to Appellee as her loss in earnings is not related to her disability.</p>

Appellee cites section 512 of the Act in support of her argument that her earning power upon returning to work in a light duty position, the amount she actually receives each week, is less than her pre-injury average weekly wage. Appellee additionally notes that the supplemental agreement entered into upon her return to work creates a presumption that her residual physical disability is causally related to her work injury.

As such, they all received compensation calculated as two-thirds the difference between their pre-injury average weekly wages and their wages upon returning to their light duty or restricted positions. Following the return to work of these injured employees, the employer negotiated a wage concession agreement and reduced the wages of all of its hourly employees. As a result, the partial disability benefits the injured employees received increased to reflect the difference between their pre-injury wages and their decreased post-injury wages. This resulted in the injured employees’ post-injury wages and compensation benefits totaling more than the average wages earned by co-employees performing the injured employees’ pre-injury jobs.</p>
