Accepting the testimony of Dr. Gauriloff and Bumsworth, the sentencing court apparently concludes that only 10-12 plants were confiscated, and as such, concludes that the Commonwealth failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the mandatory sentence should apply at all, notwithstanding its decision on the constitutionality of the sentencing provisions. <em>Commonwealth v. Burnsworth, </em>No. 2738 of 1993 and No. 2739 of 1993, slip op. at 1 (September 15, 1994). While this finding is somewhat contradictory to the conclusions made during the sentencing proceeding, we note that the sentencing court’s reliance on the testimony of the expert is inconsistent with the opinion we render today. Instead, the testimony of Officer Podpora reveals that 77 plants were confiscated. Moreover, Bumsworth testified that he was "essentially responsible for the plantings," (N.T. 7/8/94 at 40), that with respect to the 16 plants (Count 2738), he planted each plant individually from an individual seed, (N.T. 7/8/94 at 44), and that with respect to the 61 plants found in the fenced-in area (Count 2739), he put each individual plant in the soil. (N.T. 7/8/94 at 45.) In fact, when questioned in regard to the planting of the 61 plants, Burnsworth testified as follows:</p>
