Moreover, the referee found as a fact that the parties stipulated that appellant’s benefits should be suspended for the period of September 11, 1990 through March 31, 1991 because she returned to work at a business her brother owned where she was employed as a nurse’s aide working approximately twenty (20) to thirty (30) hours per week for wages which were greater than or equal to her pre-injury wages of $177.85 per week.</p>

For the remaining time beginning on August 19, 1989 to September 10, 1990 and from April 1, 1991 to the present, the Board ordered that appellant’s benefits only be modified based upon the wage rate of the Sears <em>&amp; </em>Roebuck position since this was determined to be the first available job that she failed to pursue in good faith. Accordingly, the Board ordered that appellant’s benefits be modified to $51.38 per week rather than her original workmen’s compensation benefit of $160.07 per week.

In essence, the holding in <em>Castro </em>would allow appellant’s benefits to be modified as of August 19, 1989 (the date the Sears &amp; Roebuck position was referred to appellant which offered weekly wages less than appellant’s pre-injury wages) and then be suspended as of September 20, 1989 (the date of the Valleybrook referral which offered wages equal to or greater than her pre-injury wages) if these positions were found to be available on the date of the referrals. However, since no findings were made as to whether these positions were actually available as of the date of the referral, the majority remanded the case for such findings of fact and ordered that any conclusions of law which arose from those findings be consistent with the court’s opinion.</p>

The dissent also believed that <em>Associated Plumbing </em>affirmatively prohibited any subsequent modifications or suspensions of workmen’s compensation benefits based upon failure to pursue later referred jobs. In essence, the dissent’s opinion would entitle UCP only to a modification of benefits and not suspension of benefits since the first position which was not pursued in good faith (the Sears <em>&amp; </em>Roebuck position) did not provide appellant with wages equal to or greater than her pre-injury wages.</p>

First, disability under the Act has always been synonymous in Pennsylvania with the loss of earning power. <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>
      <em>Kachinski, supra. </em>Second, as previously discussed herein, there is an important distinction between the relief offered when compensation is suspended versus a modification of benefits. When a claimant’s benefits are suspended, the claimant no longer receives any workmen’s compensation benefits because the claimant’s physical disability no longer adversely affects her earning power since she can earn wages equal to or greater than her pre-injury wages. On the other hand, when the claimant’s benefits are modified, the claimant receives a portion of her original workmen’s compensation benefits since her physical disability only allows her to regain some, rather than all, of her pre-injury earning capacity.</p>

Nothing in the language of Section 413(a) can be read to limit an employer to only one of the allowed remedies based upon whichever one occurs first in time. Instead, the words of Section 413(a) show in an unambiguous fashion that the legislature has clearly decided that an employer is entitled to each distinct remedy offered on the date that the claimant’s earning power undergoes a change justifying that remedy. Thus, Section 413(a) allows a referee initially to modify a claimant’s benefits effective as of the date of the first job referral not pursued in good faith and then to suspend benefits as of a later date based upon a subsequent referred job which pays wages equal to or greater than claimant’s preinjury wages as long as the subsequent job accurately reflects claimant’s earning power on that specific date.

An important distinction exists as .to the relief offered between a suspension of benefits versus a modification of benefits. When a claimant’s benefits are suspended, the claimant no longer receives any workmen’s compensation benefits because the claimant’s physical disability no longer adversely affects her earning power since she can earn wages equal to or greater than her pre-injury wages. However, when the claimant’s benefits are modified, the claimant receives a portion of her original workmen’s compensation benefits since her physical disability only allows her to regain some, rather than all, of her pre-injury earning capacity. <em>See Dillon v.
