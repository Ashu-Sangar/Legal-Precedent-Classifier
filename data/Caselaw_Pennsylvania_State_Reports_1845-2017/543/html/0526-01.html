The Superior Court held that Appellant’s prior criminal conviction, which had been affirmed by the Superior Court and denied review by this Court, was final for purposes of collateral estoppel, notwithstanding Appellant’s filing of a Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) petition, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546. This Court granted allocatur to determine the point at which a criminal conviction is considered final in order to serve as a basis for collateral estoppel in a civil trial.

      <p id="b668-9" data-blocks='[["BL_668.8",668,[303,2205,1126,195]]]'>We find <em>Souter </em>distinguishable in that it was grounded in admiralty and maritime law. As such, when an appellate court hears an admiralty appeal, the case is heard <em>de novo. Souter v.

As for <em>Dunn, </em>we hold that to the extent that <em>Dunn </em>contradicts this Court’s holding today, it is expressly overruled.</p>
