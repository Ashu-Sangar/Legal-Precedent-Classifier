The appeal was to this court from the order of Commonwealth Court. However, the secretary in the law office who was responsible for filing the appeal became ill shortly after the appeal was prepared, and left the office without filing it. The appeal papers remained on her desk unfiled. When the secretary returned a week later, the appeal period had expired. This error was not discovered because the secretary was also the person in the office who was responsible for checking to make sure that all secretarial work was performed.

Although we respect Commonwealth Court’s diligent effort not to misconstrue our holding, we believe that this reading of <em>Bass </em>is too narrow. It would be anomalous, as the dissent below points out, to allow an appeal nunc pro tunc because of the non-negligent acts of a third party but not allow it in the case of non-negligent acts of appellant himself.

This raises the inference that Cook was unable to perfect his appeal while he was hospitalized. There was no evidence to the contrary except for Cook’s admission that he was able to read and write and receive visitors after his release from intensive care. Cook met his heavy burden of proving an adequate excuse under <em>Bass </em>for failing to file the appeal, and the contrary evidence did not rebut the inference raised by Cook’s evidence.

To be precise, I would hold that <em>Bass, </em>which involved this Court's decision to exercise its authority to allow the nunc pro tunc filing of an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court, does not directly control the question whether a referee or the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review has authority, or should exercise the authority, to allow a late appeal from a decision of the Office of Employment Security. At most, <em>Bass </em>can be cited as an example of the type of circumstances in which a late appeal has been considered permissible in the judicial system. It is not proper, however, to impose the "rule” of <em>Bass on </em>administrative proceedings such as these.</p>
      <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.8",525,[250,1436,1120,630]]]'>The legislature has established that the "time for filing an appeal ... shall be governed by general rules.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 5571(a). It is at least arguable that since the appeal period is not entirely fixed by statute but also by action of the Court, the Court has inherent authority to provide for exceptions to the general rule of 30 days adopted in Pa.R.A.P. 903(a), 1113(a), 1311(b), and 1512(a). But see Pa.R.A.P. 105(b) (court may not enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal, a petition for allowance of appeal, a petition for permission to appeal, or a petition for review.) It does not follow, however, that the Court has the same interpretive authority over the time period for appeals within an administrative agency. In this context, the longstanding rule that “where an <em>act of Assembly </em>fixes the time within which an appeal may be taken, courts have no power to extend it, or to allow the act to be done at a later day, as a matter of indulgence,” <em>Tuttle v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-super/160/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="160 Pa. Super. 46" data-case-ids="458321" data-case-paths="/pa-super/160/0046-01">160 Pa.Super. 46</a>, 47, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20847" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="49 A.2d 847">49 A.2d 847</a>, 848 (1946), takes on even greater force.</p>
      <p id="b525-8" data-blocks='[["BL_525.9",525,[250,2070,1120,312]]]'>I would also note that in the context of the Workers’ Compensation Act, the General Assembly has specifically provided that "[t]he board may, upon cause shown, extend the time provided in this article [20 days] for taking such appeal or for the filing of an answer or other pleading,” 77 P.S. § 853. Similar power has not been granted to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review. The majority’s approach glosses over this statutory difference and would allow for the equivalent of extensions of time in any administrative appeal.</p>

I believe the Board's determination that this burden has or has not been met in a particular case is entitled to some deference, akin to an abuse of discretion standard, in the same manner as similar procedural decisions of the intermediate appellate courts (e.g., denying permission to appeal an interlocutory order under Pa.R.A.P. 1311) are reviewed. Here, the uncontested facts found by the referee were that prior to his release from the hospital the claimant was alert, could read and write, and could receive visitors. Under the abuse of discretion standard, or even under the substantial evidence standard, I find no error in the Board’s decision.</p>
