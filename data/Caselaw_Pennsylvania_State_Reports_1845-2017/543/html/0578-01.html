In the circumstance where we have accepted an issue by granting allowance of appeal, and this Court, after conducting our review of the issue, enters an order dismissing the appeal as having been <em>improvidently granted, </em>the effect is as though this Court never granted allowance of appeal. In other words, a dismissal as being <em>improvidently granted </em>has the exact same effect as if this Court had denied the petition for allowance of appeal (allocatur) in the first place. Where we dismiss an appeal as <em>improvidently granted, </em>the lower tribunal’s opinion and order stand as a decision of that court and this Court’s order has <em>no </em>precedential value.</p>

Thus, our order in <em>Abraham </em>has precedential value, under the doctrine of law of the case and the rule of <em>stare decisis, </em>as to the final disposition in <em>Abraham. </em>Accordingly, we thus did not <em>sub silentio </em>overrule <em>Harris </em>by our <em>per curiam </em>order of affirmance in <em>Abraham.</em>
