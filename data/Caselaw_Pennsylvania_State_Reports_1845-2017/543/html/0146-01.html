Because the evidence amply demonstrates that appellee here was able to freely consult with counsel before executing the contract in question, that there were no threats of actual bodily harm, and that appellee did in fact consult with counsel four days prior to signing the contractual agreement, economic duress was not a valid defense to the contract at issue. Accordingly, the trial court erroneously denied appellant’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b287-7" data-blocks='[["BL_287.7",287,[173,1470,1155,949]]]'>The evidence giving rise to the instant dispute is that in June of 1981, appellee, Donald Degenhardt, a general contractor, obtained preliminary approval to build a federally subsidized, high-rise apartment building for the elderly in Baldwin Borough, Pennsylvania (“Baldwin Towers”) from the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (“PHFA”). On August 31, 1981, appellee and appellant, the Dillon Company, executed a Memorandum of Agreement by which the parties agreed to serve as general partners in the project. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement, each party retained a one percent equity interest in the project and the remaining 98% of the equity interest in the project was to be sold through syndication to limited partners. The syndication proceeds from the sale were to be divided equally between appellee and appellant, less certain specified deductions (e.g. closing costs and points). In addition, appellee maintained the right to manage the property or to designate a managing agent for the building.</p>

Appellant learned that appellee had been experiencing financial difficulties and had filed for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 11 earlier that year, in January of 1981. Believing that appellee’s personal bankruptcy jeopardized the completion of the project and final PHFA approval, appellant threatened to withdraw from the project unless appellee surrendered to appellant the right to control the development of the project, including the selection of the project syndicator. In an attempt to allay appellant’s fears, appellee signed an addendum to the Memorandum of Agreement on January 28, 1982, which, <em>inter alia, </em>gave appellant the sole and exclusive right to choose the project syndicator. Appellant then selected the National Corporation for Housing Partnerships (“NCHP”) as the project syndicator.</p>

On July 9, 1982, appellant’s president and legal counsel met with appellee and requested that appellee assign his right to manage the property and his entire interest in the joint venture to appellant in exchange for $110,000 since appellee was still in bankruptcy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Degenhardt left the meeting and contacted the law firm which represented him in his bankruptcy proceedings in order to secure his own legal counsel at the meeting. Although appellee’s bankruptcy counsel was not at that time present, his partner arrived and, after consulting with appellee, informed the parties that appellee was prepared to take whatever steps were necessary to end the problems arising from the bankruptcy proceeding but appellee would still resist attempts by appellant to force him out of the project totally. Thereafter, Degenhardt’s counsel sent several letters to appellant’s counsel in order to notify appellant of appellee’s efforts to resolve his ongoing financial problems and of appellee’s intent to remain on as general partner in the <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>project. Appellee also indicated his awareness of appellant’s previous offer to purchase appellee’s interest in the project but did not expressly accept it or reject it.</p>

Appellant continued to insist that appel-lee assign his interest in the project for consideration while appellee pressed appellant to select a different project syndi-cator who would allow appellee to maintain the exclusive right to manage the property. Appellant’s counsel, in the presence of appellee’s counsel, offered appellee an alternative: either acquiesce to appellant’s terms and assign over his interest in the project or appellant would pull out of the deal altogether. After the meeting, appellee and his counsel discussed the various options available to appellee including the possibility that either party might have grounds to bring legal action against the other in the event that the venture failed. Appel-lee then conceded to his counsel that he felt that he had no choice other than to agree to appellant’s terms.</p>

The parties then executed an “Assignment Agreement” by which appellee assigned most of his interest in the project to appellant including the right to manage the property. Appellee further agreed to a general release of all future claims against appellant relating to the project. By the terms of the Assignment Agreement, appellee retained the right to receive 50% of the net syndication proceeds, less a $75,000 prior advance from appellant. Appellee also signed a separate agreement with the syndicator by which appellee accepted an offer that provided employment for his wife and for himself, a rent-free apartment in Baldwin Towers, and a share of the management fees. Upon completion of the project, in 1983, appellee and his wife were employed as resident managers at Baldwin Towers.</p>

The Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s judgment, finding that since there existed conflicting evidence regarding appellee’s representation by counsel, the trial court properly denied appellant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Specifically, the Superior Court found that, even though appellee was represented by the same legal counsel who represented him in his bankruptcy proceeding, there was conflicting evidence as to whether such representation was limited only to that function. The Superi- <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>or Court also affirmed the trial court’s reliance on <em>Litten, supra, </em>finding that appellant’s actions on the date of the final closing placed appellee in an inextricable financial crisis for which counsel’s advice would have provided little meaningful effectiveness. On this basis, the Superior Court determined that because the trial court instructed the jury that, in order for appellee’s claim of economic duress to succeed, it was necessary for him to prove an absence of an immediate legal remedy, therefore the trial court’s refusal to instruct the jury regarding the availability of counsel did not unduly prejudice appellant.

The reason appellant asserted for attempting to "buy out” appellee was that NCHP was not willing to proceed as a project syndicator with appellee as a general partner unless appellee terminated his Chapter 11 proceedings.

Initially, we note that contrary to the Superior Court's conclusion that counsel’s representation in this matter was limited to bankruptcy matters, we find that the evidence amply demonstrates that appellee’s bankruptcy lawyers, Mr. Sable and his partner Mr. Lampl, provided significant legal representation with regard to the Baldwin Towers project. In particular, both Mr. Sable and Mr. Lampl represented appellee at two different meetings in which appellee’s status as a general partner in the project and the closing of the Baldwin Towers project were discussed with appellant’s representatives. Moreover, appellee’s counsel wrote three different letters to appellant’s representatives advocating, <em>inter alia, </em>appellee’s position as a general partner in the project, appellee’s dissatisfaction with appellant’s choice of NCHP as the project syndicator and appellant’s $110,000 offer to purchase appellee’s interest in the project. Thus, it cannot be said that counsel's representation in this matter was limited to appellee’s bankruptcy proceedings. Moreover, the issue is whether appellee had the <em>opportunity </em>to consult with counsel before entering into the Assignment Agreement. Here, appellee clearly had such an opportunity. His choice of <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>counsel, whether such counsel is primarily a bankruptcy or other civil practice attorney, is of no moment and provides no basis for relief in this action. If appellee feels counsel provided inadequate representation, there exist other avenues and causes of action by which a client may seek redress.</p>

Appellee counters this option by suggesting that litigation would not have been “practical” at the time he signed the Assignment Agreement because he was unable to afford a lengthy legal battle. Brief for Appellee at 40-41. We expressly reject appellee’s invitation to make such an exception to the <em>Carrier </em>rule as such an exception would virtually swallow the longstanding <em>Carrier </em>rule that no duress exists where the contracting party has an opportunity to consult with counsel.</p>

There is evidence to suggest that appellant insisted upon appellee’s assignment of his interests in the project even before the September 26, 1982, meeting. Thereby giving appellee an even greater opportunity to consult with counsel. However, we find that even this four day advance notice period was sufficient to negate a claim of duress given our determination that, under <em>Carrier, </em>even if a plaintiff is immediately and unfairly sutprised by the aggressive negotiations of new contractual obligations but nonetheless is not prevented from consulting with counsel, a claim of duress cannot be sustained.</p>

Appellee also argues that this Court should ignore the principle articulated in <em>Carrier </em>and instead adopt the Superior Court’s reasoning in <em>Litten v.

Moreover, unlike the defendant in <em>Litten, </em>appellant here in no way contributed to, much less caused, appellee's financial difficulties since these difficulties existed independently of the development project at issue. Further, in. <em>Litten, </em>plaintiff’s counsel was the brother of the defendant’s attorney.

For example, at the July 9, 1982, meeting, when appellant’s representatives began discussing the possibility of buying out appellee’s interest in the project, appellee left tbe meeting and telephoned the his bankruptcy lawyer for assistance.
