The facts relevant to those convictions establish that on the night of December 19, 1990, appellant and his co-conspirator, “Danny,” pulled into a parking lot on the 700 block of North 46th Street in Philadelphia. Appellant and Danny exited from a black Camaro and approached a group of people walking on the sidewalk of North 46th Street. As they approached this group appellant handed Danny a gun. Danny pointed the weapon at the decedent, Vivian Smickle, and ordered him to lay face down on the sidewalk. Danny then shot Vivian Smickle twice in the back. The other people in the group: Laura Bickerstaff, Ainsworth Kerr and Yolanda Gilliam, immediately began to flee the scene upon Danny’s order to Vivian to lay on the sidewalk. As the others were running away they heard more gunshots. According to the testimony of the three witnesses, it sounded as if more than one weapon was being fired as they fled the scene. Ainsworth Kerr was hit twice by gunfire as he fled. Laura Bickerstaff positively identified appellant as the man who handed Danny the gun immediately before the shooting. Ainsworth Kerr and Yolanda Gilliam positively identified appellant as the man who was standing next to Danny when Danny killed Vivian Smickle.</p>

When counsel pointed out this omission the trial court mistakenly replied that the charge had been given and refused to repeat same. The trial court had, however, omitted the charge. The defendant sought a new trial claiming that the omission prejudiced him as it emphasized his failure to testify in the minds of the jury.

The “fundamental” right at stake here is the right not to be “compelled to give evidence against [oneself]” from which the “no-adverse-inference” rule derives. Thus, if defendant and his or her counsel determine that the fundamental right to remain silent is best served by not drawing attention to defendant’s silence, the derivative right (i.e., the “no-adverse-inference” instruction), may be validly waived.

In accordance with these principles we now turn to appellant’s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to either request the no adverse inference instruction or obtain appellant’s waiver of the instruction. As this claim is premised upon trial counsel's inaction, appellant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s failure to act to such a degree that absent counsel's error the outcome of the verdict would have been different. <em>Travaglia </em>at 116-20, <a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="661 A.2d 352" data-case-ids="470782,7870893" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01,/a2d/661/0352-01">661 A.2d at 356-57</a>.</p>

In addition, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of two police officers who apprehended appellant fleeing the scene after the shooting, and a ballistics expert who identified the gun found in the getaway car as the murder weapon. The defense at trial focused upon the fact that appellant was not the shooter, and attempted to dispute the circumstantial evidence regarding existence of a conspiracy to murder the decedent.</p>

In contrast to the instant case, the situations which would prompt counsel to consider requesting or omitting a no adverse inference instruction normally arise where the testimony of the accused is vital to the nature of the defense asserted. In <em>Lewis, </em>the murder at issue occurred during a prison altercation involving numerous people. There the defense asserted was self-defense and/or mistaken identity created by the mob nature of the assault. In <em>Edwards, </em>there were only two people in the house at the time of the murder, one of them was dead and the other was in a drunken stupor with a gun next to him and his shoes stained with the victim’s blood. In <em>Rasheed, </em>the charge was rape and the defense was consent. In each of these cases, the circumstances of the crime would heighten the jury’s awareness of the defendant’s failure to testify. We cannot find that such concerns arise from the circumstances of the shooting as presented in the case at bar. Nor has appellant alerted this Court to any particular reason why the absence of a no adverse inference instruction adversely affected the outcome of this case.

    <p id="b782-5" data-blocks='[["BL_782.4",782,[241,1018,1161,638]]]'>However, it is apparent to this Court that further elucidation for the trial bench and bar is required on the question of when a no adverse inference instruction is warranted. In order to finalize the endless argument as to when and how the subject instruction is to be given and if waived, how it is to be waived and, in light of the rule already established by this Court in <em>Edwards, </em>we find it necessary and prudent to take additional steps to ensure proper consideration of the ramifications of this particular instruction. Accordingly, we hold that from this day forward the no adverse inference instruction shall be given absent an <em>express </em>on the record colloquy by the defendant waiving the charge.</p>

Appellant relies upon <em>Commonwealth v. Huffman, </em><a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="536 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1843201" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01">536 Pa. 196</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="638 A.2d 961" data-case-ids="1843201,7374211" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01,/a2d/638/0961-01">638 A.2d 961</a> (1994) in arguing that the charge as given here failed to adequately set forth the legal standards for accomplice liability on first degree murder charges.

The charge in <em>Huffman </em>incorrectly advised the jury that they could find the defendant guilty of first degree murder if either he or his co-conspirator possessed the neces<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>sary specific intent to kill at the time of the murder. In contrast to <em>Huffman, </em>the charge in the instant case correctly stated the law as to the liability of an accomplice in the commission of the crime. The pertinent portion of the charge from the case at bar, is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b783-5" data-blocks='[["BL_783.4",783,[221,605,1111,309]]]'>I mentioned the word accomplice to you, I am also going to charge you on the concept called conspiracy.

You may find that the Defendant is guilty of a crime without finding that he personally performed the act or engaged in the conduct that is required to commit the crime.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b783-6" data-blocks='[["BL_783.5",783,[221,930,1114,363]]]'>The Defendant is guilty of a crime if he’s an accomplice of another person who commits the crime. He’s an accomplice if with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime he either solicits, encourages, commands or requests the other person to commit it or he aids or agrees to aid or attempts to aid the other person in planning or committing it.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b783-7" data-blocks='[["BL_783.6",783,[221,1309,1112,248]]]'>You may find the Defendant guilty of the crime on the theory that he was an accomplice as long as you’re satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed and that the Defendant was an accomplice of the person who committed it.</blockquote>

This portion of the charge was preceded by the definitions of the different degrees of murder and the definition of specific intent which is required to find a person guilty of first degree murder. In fact the charge as given here is identical to the charge on accomplice liability recently approved by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Chester, </em><a href="/pa/526/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="526 Pa. 578" data-case-ids="1825890" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0578-01">526 Pa. 578</a>, 613, <a href="/pa/526/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="526 Pa. 578" data-case-ids="1825890" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0578-01">587 A.2d 1367</a>, 1384 (1991), where the defendant was also convicted of first degree murder as an accomplice.</p>

Appellant is in error. The charge to the jury must clearly and completely advise the jury of the law as it pertains to their resolution of the case before them. The <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>manner in which the jury is so advised is a matter left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court is not required to deliver the charge within a prescribed pattern. The charge as given in the instant case adequately and correctly established the requirements which the jury must find in order to render a verdict on the issue of accomplice liability for first degree murder. Accordingly, as the charge was legally correct, counsel was not ineffective for falling to object to the charge.</p>

However, as <em>Rasheed </em>was tried prior to the announcement of the per se reversible error rule in <em>Edwards, </em>a harmless error analysis was undertaken. This Court concluded that the giving of the charge in that case was not harmless a new trial was therefore awarded.</p>
