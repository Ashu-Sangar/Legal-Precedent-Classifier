In the present case, the trial court gave a comprehensive explanation for departing from the minimum sentencing guidelines. Principal among the reasons were (1) that appellant did not have a prior record; (2) that appellant was the only person who could care for her young children; (3) that appellant showed remorse; (4) that appellant’s husband, the victim, had <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>been an abusive husband over a period of time and appellant’s limited education kept her from removing herself from the situation; (5) that a favorable psychiatric report showed appellant to be in sound mental health and feeling guilty over what she had done; (6) that a favorable pre-sentencing report showed that appellant had created a good home environment for her children and had a desire to improve her education; and (7) that appellant had an absence of drug or alcohol abuse.

Bethea, </em><a href="/pa/474/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="474 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1732115" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0571-01">474 Pa. 571</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="474 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1732115" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0571-01">379 A.2d 102</a> (1977), is not limited to constitutional errors, I must dissent.</p>
    <p id="b713-6" data-blocks='[["BL_713.6",713,[184,758,1153,432]]]'>The majority concedes that the trial court erred in giving Appellant credit for the absence of a criminal record twice in the sentencing procedure. Op. at 571-72. Notwithstanding that fact, the majority holds that the Commonwealth is not entitled to relief because “[t]he application of our decision in <em>Bethea </em>is limited to the narrow category of cases in which a trial court impermissibly penalizes a defendant for exercising constitutional rights.” Op. at 574.</p>
    <p id="b713-7" data-blocks='[["BL_713.7",713,[183,1235,1159,1038]]]'>Although the impermissible factor considered in <em>Bethea </em>was constitutional in nature, <em>ie., </em>the defendant’s exercise of his right to trial, I do not perceive a need to limit the remedy of vacating a sentence only to those wrongs that implicate a constitutional question. Accordingly, I believe that <em>Bethea </em>stands for the proposition that both a defendant and the citizens of this Commonwealth share an equal right to demand that a trial judge properly follow the sentencing guidelines when imposing sentence and consider only those aggravating and/or mitigating factors that are permissible pursuant to the sentencing guidelines. “[I]t is essential to the sentencing process, not only that the sentence imposed be just, but that it be perceived as just, by the victim, the offender, and the community generally.” <em>Commonwealth v. Puchalski, </em><a href="/pa-super/310/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="310 Pa. Super. 199" data-case-ids="209781" data-case-paths="/pa-super/310/0199-01">310 Pa.Super. 199</a>, 207, <a href="/pa-super/310/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="310 Pa. Super. 199" data-case-ids="209781" data-case-paths="/pa-super/310/0199-01">456 A.2d 569</a>, 573 (1983). When a trial judge fails to properly follow the guidelines, an appellate court is mandated to point out this error, vacate the sentence and remand the case back to the sentencing judge for sentencing consistent with the guidelines.</p>

    <p id="b714-9" data-blocks='[["BL_714.8",714,[225,1158,1162,736]]]'>The controlling portion of the statute for the case at bar is section 9781(c)(3) because the trial court departed from the guidelines. Appellant maintains that even if <em>Bethea </em>applies to a sentence, the Superior Court is still required to make a separate finding of unreasonableness under section 9781(c)(3), which provides that the Superior Court shall vacate and remand a sentence if it finds that “the sentencing court sentenced outside the sentencing guidelines and the sentence is unreasonable.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9781(c)(3). However, since “a sentence based in part on an impermissible consideration is not made proper simply because the sentencing judge considers other permissible factors as well” a separate finding of unreasonableness is unnecessary. <em>See Bethea, </em><a href="/pa/474/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="474 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1732115" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0571-01">474 Pa. at 580</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="474 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1732115" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0571-01">379 A.2d at 106</a>.</p>

Even with the promulgation of the sentencing guidelines, which was intended to structure the exercise of the sentencing power, that power is, notwithstanding, a function to be performed by the trial court. <em>Where an appellate court determines that a sentence is illegal or otherwise improper, the proper remedy is to vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the trial court for sentencing in accordance with the ruling of the appellate court.</em>

An appellate court will now have to forecast how the trial court would have acted had it realized that it deviated from the guidelines.
