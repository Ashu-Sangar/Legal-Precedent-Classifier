The first Commonwealth complaining witness testified that at approximately noon, a black car backed into her driveway and a white male, not appellant, exited the vehicle and banged on her front door calling for “Jim.” The witness described the male as white with brownish, longer styled and feathered back hair, wearing a button-down shirt with rolled up sleeves. When the man moved away from the door, the witness went to a room located directly above the driveway and observed that the black car was a later model car and that the door was open with a second person’s arm sticking out of the car. The witness could not see the second person’s face but observed that the person wore a watch and a short-sleeved shirt. The witness then heard a third person walking on the driveway stones and believed it was another male who had exited the vehicle; thereafter, the first male began knocking on her front door again. The complainant was alone in the house and was caring for a nine-month-old baby and was understandably fearful to answer the door.</p>

Jones, </em><a href="/pa/501/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="501 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1782444" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0162-01">501 Pa. 162</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="501 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1782444" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0162-01">460 A.2d 739</a> (1983) (issue was waived where defense counsel immediately objected to prosecutor’s conduct but made no request for mistrial or curative <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>instructions); <em>Commonwealth v. Gonzales, </em><a href="/pa/463/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="463 Pa. 597" data-case-ids="1707989" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0597-01">463 Pa. 597</a>, 603, <a href="/pa/463/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="463 Pa. 597" data-case-ids="1707989" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0597-01">345 A.2d 691</a>, 694 (1975) (objection that cautionary instructions should have been given was waived where "at no time during trial or the judge’s charge did defendant request that cautionary instructions be given”). Hence, we reject this claim.</p>
