The record here, however, fails to provide the needed evidence. The Commonwealth’s motion to <em>nol pros </em>the charges included in the first complaint explicitly stated that the Commonwealth was undertaking this action because it had insufficient evidence at that time to sustain its burden of proof. Nowhere in the motion or on record does it state that the <em>nol pros </em>was being sought in conjunction with a plea agreement to the other charges. Also, per the trial court, the 'written plea agreement which appellant admitted to reading, signing and understanding, failed to state that the <em>nol pros </em>of the charges in the first complaint was in any manner an inducement or part or condition of the plea agreement.</p>

Appellant points to the above described verbal plea colloquy where a vague reference was made by appellant’s defense counsel to a “collateral charge” and to an “understanding which was a corollary to this plea” to establish the interrelationship to these two cases. Under such a slender thread does this appellant hang his hope of acquittal on these charges. However, at the hearing on appellant’s motion to dismiss the reinstated charges relating to the first complaint, the Potter County assistant district attorney involved in both the guilty plea agreement and the <em>nol pros </em>motion vehemently denied that there was any type of “package plan” in order to induce appellant to plead guilty to the charges contained in the second complaint. The assistant district attorney also stated that she consistently rejected any overtures made by appellant to persuade the Commonwealth to agree to such a deal. The trial court found this uncontro-verted testimony to be credible and we will not disturb that finding. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em><a href="/pa/506/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="506 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="1790978" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0469-01">506 Pa. 469</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="506 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="1790978" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0469-01">485 A.2d 1102</a> (1984) (a determination of the credibility of witnesses is within the sole province of the trier of fact).

Thus, jeopardy does not attach to bar the Commonwealth from reinstating the charges contained in the first complaint. Accordingly, <em>Diaz </em>does not provide appellant with relief from prosecution for these reinstated charges. <em>See Hart, supra (nolle pros </em>of original indictment did not prevent Commonwealth from trying and convicting a criminal defendant on a second indictment for the same charges); <em>Perillo, <a href="/pa-super/426/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="426 Pa.
