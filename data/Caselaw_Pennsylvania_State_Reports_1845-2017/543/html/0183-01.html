Such action lets stand the lower courts’ rulings which I believe were erroneous. Instead, I believe that the Court should have reached the merits of this appeal and reversed the Superior Court’s affirmance of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas order compelling ap-pellee’s acceptance into an Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (“ARD”) program. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s <em>per curiam </em>order.</p>
    <p id="b322-13" data-blocks='[["BL_322.13",322,[264,1592,1160,638]]]'>In this case, appellee was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. When he was arrested, appellee’s driver’s license had been expired for two months and five days. Appellee applied to the district, attorney for admission into ARD. Because his expired driver’s license made him unable to obtain automobile insurance, the district attorney denied his application for admission into ARD on the basis that a denial was proper in order to protect society from the economic harm presented by uninsured drivers to others on the road. Despite this rejection, appellee moved the Court of Common Pleas for admission into ARD and the Court of Common Pleas issued an order compelling appellee’s acceptance into “ARD.</p>

I further believe that the district attorney presented a sufficient reason for not moving for appellee’s admission into ARD, and since the appellee has failed to demonstrate that the district attorney’s refusal was wholly, patently and without a doubt unrelated to protecting society, the Court of Common Pleas improperly interfered with a decision that was within the sound discretion of the district attorney.</p>
