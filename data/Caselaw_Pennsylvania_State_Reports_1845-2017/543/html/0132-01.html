The $19,200 annuity purchases in the 1988-1989 school year were found not to be includable in Retirement Code compensation because the payments were components of a severance package and were also characterized as nonincludable bonuses and fringe benefits.

A newspaper reporter’s comment that Christiana’s salary at that time exceeded that of Pennsylvania’s Governor was repeated in the headlines of a local newspaper.
