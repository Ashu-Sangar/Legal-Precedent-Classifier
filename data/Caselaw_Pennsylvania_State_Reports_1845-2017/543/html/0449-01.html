They approached a group of youths who fled. The accused youth discarded what appeared to be a small rock before he was tackled and handcuffed by one of the police officers. The “rock” turned out to be crack cocaine. In a 7-2 decision, Justice Scalia held that even if (as was conceded by the State of California) the officers’ pursuit had not been based upon reasonable suspicion, the drugs discarded were not the illegal fruit of a “seizure” of his person under the Fourth Amendment. The majority based this conclusion upon its reasoning that an arrest (the quintessential “seizure” of a person under the Fourth Amendment) requires either the application of physical force with lawful authority or submission to the assertion of authority and, under the facts of <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>
      <em>Hodari D., </em>the accused- had not been touched by the pursuing officer at the time he discarded the drugs. Moreover, assuming that the police officers’ pursuit constituted a show of authority enjoining the accused to halt, the accused did not comply and therefore was not “seized” until one of the officers tackled him. In passing, Justice Scalia clearly notes that the State of California conceded that the police in <em>Hodari D. </em>did not even have “reasonable suspicion” to stop the accused under <em>Terry, </em>let alone probable cause to arrest.</p>

As they drove towards a group of youths, the youths looked in the officers’ direction and immediately fled. The officers exited their car and pin-sued the youths to investigate. While Hodari D. ran, he discarded what the pursuing officer believed to be a small rock. After seeing the rock discarded, the officer tackled Hodari D. and handcuffed him. At trial, the prosecution established that the “rock” that was discarded was crack cocaine.</p>

In arriving at its conclusion, the Court held that under the Fourth Amendment a seizure does not occur unless the police either apply physical force <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>with lawful authority, or the suspect submits to the assertion of police authority. Since at the time Hodari D. discarded the evidence that was later used against him, police had neither physically touched nor restrained him, and Hodari D. had not submitted to any assertion of police authority (e.g. by stopping), the Court found that no seizure had occurred. Rather, a seizure was found only to have occurred at the moment the pursuing officer physically tackled the youth. Hence, because the illegal contraband was discarded before any police seizure occurred, the Court considered it voluntarily abandoned and, therefore, admissible evidence.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[168,953,1153,849]]]'>Given the similarities between <em>Hodari D. </em>and the instant three cases, it is clear that the officers’ pursuit of appellants in the instant cases did not constitute seizures under the Fourth Amendment. Here, at the time appellants discarded their respective contraband, the police officers had not physically touched or restrained them and the appellants had not submitted to the police officers’ assertion of authority. Rather, appellants, of their own volition, fled from the police officers upon merely observing the officers approach their location. Hence, there was no seizure which had occurred at the time appellants discarded the illegal contraband during flight. A seizure occurred only at the time the police officers physically restrained appellants. Thus, under the United States Constitution and <em>Hodari D., </em>appellants’ federal Fourth Amendment rights were not violated and the evidence was properly admissible. <em>Hodari IX, supra.</em>

Here, each defendant clearly believed he <em>was </em>free to leave as each was indeed exercising this belief by leaving the respective locations when police officers approached. The police did not physically stop the defendants from leaving, did not order the defendants to stop and, indeed, did not interfere with their freedom in <em>any </em>manner. The officers here were in a public place attending to their assigned duties. Appellants chose to flee rather than confront the officers. They should not now be able to complain if the officers chose to give pursuit, as is their lawful authority. To hold that a police officer cannot pursue an individual in the situations described here is to give to the interpretation of the Pennsylvania Constitution, an absurdity that was never meant by its framers.</p>

The officers’ unintrusive conduct here cannot be said to be improper. Logically, the holding by the majority may be extended to prevent police officers from pursuing vehicles on the highway or from following suspicious individuals on the public streets unless the police possess probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe a crime has occurred. Evidence voluntarily abandoned during these situations would most likely be suppressed under the majority’s opinion. Part of a police officer’s duty is to <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>investigate crime before it occurs, not simply stand by idly and wait for an offense to be committed before taking action. A visible police presence is essential to satisfy this duty. That a person voluntarily chooses to flee from the “mere presence” of a police officer should not immunize that person when he abandons contraband, weapons, or any other evidence during the course of his flight and a police officer’s pursuit. In sum, “there is but one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.” (Attributed to Napoleon I, after his retreat from Russia, December, 1812). Such step has now been taken by the majority which inexplicably affords to criminals in Pennsylvania greater protection for their deviant conduct than that afforded criminals in our sister states and which now greatly restricts police officers’ effectiveness in ferreting out criminal conduct.</p>
