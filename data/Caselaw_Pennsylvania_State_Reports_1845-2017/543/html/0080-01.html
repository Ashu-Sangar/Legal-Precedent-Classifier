First Federal agreed that these constituted property of which the Commonwealth was entitled to take custody. However, First Federal challenged findings that certain additional funds should be remitted to the Commonwealth. These consisted of: passbook interest due on accounts not receiving interest as a result of changes in minimum balance requirements, minimum balance and dormant account charges deducted from savings accounts, and passbook interest due on deducted minimum balance and dormant account charges.</p>
