    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[272,492,1158,528]]]'>This appeal presents the question of whether Act 78<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> permits the recision of a policy of automobile insurance on the basis of fraud, where the fraud could not have reasonably been discovered, within the 60 day period after the policy was issued. For the reasons that follow we conclude, with the limited exceptions as set forth herein, that the insurer does not have the ability to rescind the policy of insurance, beyond the 60 day period immediately following issuance of the policy. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the learned Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[272,1062,1170,366]]]'>The catalyst for the present legal action was a fatal automobile accident which occurred on September 23, 1989. Kevin. Stover, while intoxicated, was operating a Ford pick-up truck insured by appellant. The truck collided with a vehicle driven by William Sherman, killing William, his wife Ellen, and two of their three grandchildren; the third grandchild survived, but suffered serious injuries.</p>
    <p id="b504-7" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[269,1464,1163,745]]]'>The policy of insurance for the truck had been issued by appellant to Bryan Lake, as the alleged owner and sole operator of the vehicle. However, Kevin Stover was the actual owner and operator of the truck. Stover had paid for the truck and at all times had actual possession of the truck. Stover was unable to obtain automobile insurance in his own name. Lake, as Stover’s friend, agreed to have the title of the vehicle placed in his name and to add the vehicle to his own policy of insurance with appellant. Stover paid the insurance premiums to Lake in cash; Lake then forwarded the premium to appellant. This scheme had been on-going since 1987, with this truck being the third vehicle insured with appellant, for Stover’s exclusive use, but, through the fiction of being titled to Bryan Lake.</p>

Appellees’ demand for payment under the policy prompted appellant’s investigation, which uncovered the fraudulent manner in which the insurance policy had been procured. Appellant then filed the instant complaint for declaratory judgment seeking to void the insurance contract. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment before the trial court. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellant, plaintiff below, and denied summary judgment as to appellees, the defendants below.</p>

      <em>Bonnie Beck </em>considered the appeals of two Pennsylvania insurance companies. In each case the insurance company had rescinded a policy of insurance upon discovering material misrepresentations of fact made by the respective insured parties regarding their driving history. Each insured appealed the recision to the Insurance Commissioner, asserting that the termination provisions of Act 78 provided the only available means by which an insurance company could sever its relationship with an insured. The Insurance Commissioner ruled in favor of the insured in each case. On appeal to the <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>Commonwealth Court, the decisions of the Insurance Commissioner were affirmed.

    <p id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.6",508,[274,1588,1158,583]],["BL_509.1",509,[162,367,1149,148]]]'>This Court next reviewed the issue of recision versus cancellation in <em>Miller. Miller </em>did not deal with a claim under Act 78 rather it involved a claim under the Unfair Insurance Practices Act (UIPA), 40 P.S. § 1171.1 et seq. In <em>Miller, </em>Metropolitan Insurance Co. had rescinded Mr. Miller’s home owner’s policy upon discovering that he failed to inform them of three prior fire losses on his property which had occurred within the five years preceding his application for that insurance. Mr. Miller contested the recision under the procedures of the UIPA before the Insurance Commissioner. The Insurance Commissioner held that Metropolitan could only terminate the <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>policy through cancellation or non-renewal, not by recision.

    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[159,540,1157,462]]]'>In reversing the lower tribunals, this Court found that the misrepresentations made by Miller were in fact material to the risk undertaken by the insured. The Court further found that <em>unlike </em>Act 78, the UIPA specifically excluded instances of fraud in the inducement from its provisions governing cancellation of policies. Thus, in the absence of specific language in the UIPA addressing termination of policies induced by fraud, the Court reasoned that the common law remedy of recision would still be available to the insurer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[160,1044,1154,787]]]'>The most recent decision of the Court relevant to the impact of Act 78 upon the recision of an insurance policy was <em>Klopp. </em>In <em>Klopp, </em>Keystone Insurance Company accepted an application for automobile insurance from the Klopps and issued a binder to them on February 7, 1985.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The very next day Mrs. Klopp was involved in an automobile accident. On April 4, 1985, 57 days after acceptance of the application, Keystone rescinded the policy and the binder, and returned the premium payment. Keystone had discovered that the Klopps failed to disclose two prior speeding violations and a prior automobile accident, information material to the risk insured. On cross motions for summary judgment the trial court found that recision was not a remedy available to Keystone under Act 78. The Superior Court affirmed. This Court reversed.</p>
    <p id="b509-6" data-blocks='[["BL_509.6",509,[159,1865,1152,147]],["BL_510.1",510,[279,365,1164,681]]]'>The decision in <em>Klopp </em>turned on the particular facts of that case. The Court did not directly address whether the legislature intended to exclude the remedy of recision in all instances <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>when they enacted Act 78. Instead, the case was resolved solely by reference to § 1008.6 of the Act, which provides: <em>“[n]othing in this act shall apply: </em>... <em>[t]o any policy of automobile insurance which has been in effect less than 60 days.” </em>Thus, in <em>Klopp </em>the Court reasoned that, even if the legislature intended to limit the manner of termination of insurance contracts solely to the methods of cancellation set forth in Act 78, the Act itself offers the insurance industry a 60 day grace period before its remedial terms become effective. Therefore, as Keystone was outside the parameters of Act 78 when on the 57th day after issuance of the policy it rescinded same, the recision is unaffected by the terms of Act 78.</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[278,1086,1165,584]]]'>Admittedly, the <em>Klopp </em>decision begged the question of whether the termination provisions of Act 78 were intended to encompass the sole means of severing the relationship between the insurer and insured. However, having now reviewed all our previous decisions on this subject, we are compelled to conclude that an insurance company may only avail itself of the remedy of recision within the 60 day period before the terms and conditions of Act 78 become effective. After the 60 day period only the prospective remedies as set forth in the Act may be utilized to cancel an automobile insurance policy.</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[278,1694,1161,529]],["BL_511.1",511,[165,362,1155,529]]]'>Act 78 is a piece of remedial legislation, the object of remediation being practices of the insurance industry which unfairly disadvantage the average consumer. In attempting to regulate the industry, the legislature focused upon “the disparate bargaining positions between insurance companies and individuals.” <em>Bonnie Beck, </em><a href="/pa/517/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="517 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1809881" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0218-01">517 Pa. at 224</a>, <a href="/pa/517/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="517 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1809881" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0218-01">535 A.2d at 591</a>. One of the primary factors in this disparity of bargaining positions, is the fact that operators of motor vehicles in Pennsylvania are required by law to carry automobile insurance <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>. Thus, the insurance industry holds a virtual monopoly <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>over the pool of consumers. In this context it is easy to understand why the legislature found it necessary to limit severely the insurance industry’s use of the common law remedy of recision, and instead require termination of coverage through only the prospective remedies of cancellation and non-renewal. Obviously, the requirement that all motorists obtain automobile insurance explains why Act 78 sets greater restrictions on the termination of automobile insurance policies than the UIPA requires for the termination of homeowners liability insurance. <em>See, Miller.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[163,920,1157,475]]]'>However, with the passage of Act 78, the insurance industry was not completely deprived of the remedy of recision. As realized by the Court in <em>Klopp, </em>the remedial constraints of Act 78 do not come into play until 60 days after the issuance of an insurance policy. Thus, the insurance industry has a window within which they can investigate the necessary risks attendant upon their agreement to issue insurance in each particular case. Once that window has been closed, however, the parties are bound by the parameters of Act 78.</p>
    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[162,1423,1154,744]]]'>In the instant case, the appellant complains that the 60 day window is of no moment. The type of fraud perpetrated in this case was impossible to discover through normal channels. Appellant is correct. Appellant’s grievance is of significant import; it has never been the object of the law to allow someone to benefit from their illegal conduct. In fact, such an outcome would be absurd. <em>See, Klopp, </em><a href="/pa/528/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="528 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1829849" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0001-01">528 Pa. at 8</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="528 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1829849" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0001-01">595 A.2d at 4</a>. Although the perpetrators of the fraud at issue have not appealed from the order of summary judgment which essentially rescinded the policy as to them, by the very nature of appellant’s claim we are constrained to address the question. In asking this Court to declare the policy at issue void <em>ab initio, </em>appellant necessitates consideration of its right to rescind this contract as to <em>all </em>parties.</p>

Therefore, an insurer may rescind a policy of insurance as to the actual perpetrator of the fraud, where the fraud could not reasonably have been discovered within the 60 day period immediately following issuance of the policy; limited to those instances where the undiscovered fraud was of such a nature that it is clear that an insurer would never have accepted the risk inherent in issuing the policy.

This concept of providing for the foreseeable consequences of driving in today’s society is certainly one of the most important policy considerations prompting the remedial legislation in this area. <em>Klopp, <a href="/pa/528/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="528 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1829849" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0001-01">528 </a></em><a href="/pa/528/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="528 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1829849" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0001-01">Pa. at 9</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="528 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1829849" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0001-01">595 A.2d at 5</a> (concurring opinion).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The distribution of financial risk is a legitimate public policy concern. In the area of automobile insurance the industry benefits by the fact that the consumers must purchase insurance, therefore, the insurance industry has a guaranteed market. Although the consumer must buy, the consumer benefits from the knowledge that he cannot be denied coverage without good cause and that coverage may only be terminated prospectively, thus, allowing an opportunity to find alternate insurance. This trade off obviously has shortcomings. In this case appellant complains, justifiably, that it was tricked into assuming a risk that it would never have assumed knowingly; and, that the trickery could not have reasonably been discovered within the 60 day period immediately following issuance of the policy. That trickery is <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>now causing appellant a significant loss. Appellant, however, has been paid all the premiums for the policy. The parties who committed the fraud have been precluded from benefit-ting from their wrongdoing. The appellees, however, should not be left to suffer. Although on the surface it appears harsh to force the insurance company to abide by a contract procured by fraud, it would be beyond harsh to preclude the third party appellees, who are innocent of trickery, and injured through no fault of their own, from receiving protection under the policy. Weighing all the factors, we are compelled to conclude that it is clearly the intent of the remedial legislation known as Act 78 to preclude recision of an insurance policy, as to third parties, beyond the 60 day grace period within the Act itself.</p>
