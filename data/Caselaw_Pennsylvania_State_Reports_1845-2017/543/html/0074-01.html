    <p id="b213-13" data-blocks='[["BL_213.13",213,[177,1803,1154,466]]]'>This case raises issues concerning the proof and effect of voluntary retirement as they affect partial disability payments in the context of workers’ compensation. A referee suspended the partial disability payments of claimant Albert Henderson based on a finding that the claimant had retired as of that date. The Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board reversed and its order was affirmed by the Commonwealth Court. We granted the appeal to review the standard applied by the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Within a year, he returned to a light duty position with SEPTA and his compensation was reduced to partial disability. In 1985, due to a recurrence of work-related disability, Henderson returned to total disability status, then later in 1985, reverted to partial disability. Subsequent litigation in 1989 over his proper status resulted in hearings before a referee, who decided that Henderson was entitled to total disability compensation until July 1, 1989.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[271,838,1159,468]]]'>The referee suspended Henderson’s compensation due to his testimony that he was receiving Social Security retirement benefits and that he was applying for a pension from SEPTA on his 65th birthday, June 18, 1989, together with evidence that he began receiving pension benefits on July 1, 1989. Henderson testified that he was not looking for work. The referee concluded that Henderson was retired from the labor force as of that date and was therefore not entitled to further compensation.</p>

The Commonwealth Court emphasized, as did the WCAB, the statement in <em>Dugan, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="569 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="1399098" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0218-01">supra,</a> </em>that suspension of compensation benefits is appropriate upon retirement if “a claimant states unequivocal<a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>ly that he has no intention of seeking future employment.” <em>Dugan, </em>131 Pa.Cmwlth. at 222, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="569 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="1399098" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0218-01">569 A.2d at 1040</a>. At his June 5, 1989, compensation hearing, Henderson was asked, “And you are not looking for any work; is that correct?” He responded, “No sir. Not now.” Neither the WCAB nor the Commonwealth Court regarded the answer to be sufficiently unequivocal to justify suspension of benefits upon Henderson’s retirement.</p>

    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[166,961,1156,572]]]'>The issue arose in the context of litigation over whether Henderson’s total disability status should have been reduced to partial disability due to the availability of light duty work within Henderson’s physical limitations. In the seminal case of <em>Kachinski v.

We set forth a requirement that the employer prove a referral to an available job which satisfies the claimant’s medical clearance. <em><a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">at 252</a>, <a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">532 A.2d at 380</a>.

    <p id="b215-6" data-blocks='[["BL_215.6",215,[165,1558,1157,841]]]'>The effect of retirement has, however, been the subject of several Commonwealth Court opinions. In <em>Dugan, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="569 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="1399098" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0218-01">supra,</a> </em>the court refused to apply the <em>Kachinski </em>rule requiring the employer to prove a referral to an available, medically satisfactory job when “a claimant states unequivocally that he has no intention of seeking future employment,” <em>Dugan, </em>131 Pa. Cmwlth. at 222, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="569 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="1399098" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0218-01">569 A.2d at 1040</a>, and is therefore no longer part of the labor market. The Commonwealth Court so formulated its rule based on the testimony in the <em>Dugan </em>case: “Are you attempting to obtain employment, Mr. Dugan? No, I am retired.” <em>Id. </em>at 221, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="569 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="1399098" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0218-01">569 A.2d at 1040</a>. Conversely, in <em>Schmidt </em>and <em>Patterson-Kelly Co., supra, </em>the Commonwealth Court refused to suspend compensation as in <em>Dugan </em>due to proof that the retired claimants intended to continue working after retirement, and in <em>Nabisco, </em>due to the claimant retiring only because of his work-related injury.</p>

The mere possibility that a retired worker may, at some future time, seek employment does not transform a voluntary retirement from the labor market into a continuing compensable disability. An employer should not be required to show that a claimant has no intention of continuing to work; such a burden of proof would be prohibitive. For disability compensation to continue following retirement, a claimant must show that he is seeking employment after retirement or that he was forced into retirement because of his work-related injury.</p>
