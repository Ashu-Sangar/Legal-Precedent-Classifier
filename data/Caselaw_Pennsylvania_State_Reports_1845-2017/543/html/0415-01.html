    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[216,472,1152,738]]]'>Appellants raise two related issues in this appeal. First, appellants contend that the Commonwealth Court exceeded its scope of review in reversing the trial court’s grant of appel-lees’ variance request which would have allowed them to build a 400 square foot deck in the rear of their residence to provide a play area for their child. Second, appellants contend that the zoning board did not commit a manifest abuse of discretion or an error of law which would merit the Commonwealth Court’s reversal of the trial court’s affirmance of the variance grant. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the Commonwealth Court properly found that appellants’ need for a larger play area for their child did not warrant a variance and that the trial court abused its discretion in affirming the Zoning Board’s grant of the variance.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[215,1234,1153,630]]]'>The underlying history giving rise to the instant dispute is that in 1988, appellants purchased a residential property located at 816 Grandview Avenue in the City of Pittsburgh. The original residence was thirty-six feet deep. Shortly thereafter, appellants built a three story addition with a basement to the rear of the existing two-and-a-half story residence. The addition was forty-four feet deep with an additional concrete pad which was six feet deep by twenty feet wide, the same width as the residence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Beyond the concrete pad, like those of their neighbors all along Grandview Avenue, appellants’ property dropped off steeply to the Ohio River, making much of the rear portion of their property unusable.</p>

Specifically, appellants wanted to add to their property a twenty-by-twenty foot deck off the rear of the house in order to provide their two-year-old child with an outside play area.

Appellee, who resides in a multi-unit condominium located directly next door to appellants’ residence appealed the grant of the variance to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Court remanded the matter to the zoning board for further testimony in order to clarify the board’s findings of fact and to address the issues of the effect of the variance on appellee’s property and the existence and nature of the claimed hardship. After additional testimony was taken, the Zoning Board reaffirmed its ruling and the Court of Common Pleas affirmed the Zoning Board’s grant of the variance. On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, appellee argued that appellants had failed to satisfy the criteria needed to support the grant of a variance. The Commonwealth Court agreed and reversed the <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>trial court’s affirmance of the Zoning Board’s grant of the variance.
