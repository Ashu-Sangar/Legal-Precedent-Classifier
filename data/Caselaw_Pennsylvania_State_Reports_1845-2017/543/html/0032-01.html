The first issue is whether the Commonwealth Court properly dismissed appellant’s complaint because of his failure to comply with the court’s order directing him to amend his defective service of the complaint within a specified time. The second issue is whether a party is entitled to a writ of mandamus to force the Attorney General or District Attorney to prosecute a private criminal complaint against persons appellant believes are deserving of prosecution. Because we find that the Common<a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>wealth Court acted within its discretion in dismissing the complaint and because petitioner was not entitled to the relief sought regardless of the defective service, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s order.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[265,591,1158,692]]]'>The history underlying this action is that appellant Frank S. Konya was convicted of third degree murder in 1991 for the 1971 death of a three-year-old child and is presently serving a sentence of eight to sixteen years imprisonment. Following his conviction, appellant sought to file a private criminal complaint with the Northampton County District Attorney’s Office alleging that three of the witnesses in the criminal trial had perjured themselves in that proceeding. After the District Attorney declined to prosecute, appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for review in the Commonwealth Court, requesting the court to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the Attorney General and the District Attorney of Northampton County to initiate criminal proceedings against those witnesses.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[263,1311,1163,419]]]'>Appellant served the complaint upon the Attorney General via first class mail.

It is not disputed that appellant did not comply with the court’s order. Appellant nevertheless argues that the Commonwealth Court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint since the parties suffered no prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[297,661,1162,728]]]'>To require the Commonwealth Court to overlook appellant’s failure to comply with a court order and to accept service which is filed beyond the court-ordered extended deadline for amended service would be to countenance the dilatory actions of litigants who blatantly disregard court orders. We see no reason to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule that, as long as no prejudice is suffered by untimely service, a court order can be disregarded. In fact, if we were to adopt such a <em>per se </em>rule, we would be hindering the orderly disposition of cases before the courts of the Commonwealth and injecting into well-grounded procedure an element of uncertainty were there should be none. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion by the Commonwealth Court in dismissing appellant’s petition under these facts.</p>
