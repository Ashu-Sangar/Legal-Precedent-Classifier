The lower court concluded that in all probability, a sufficient number of ballots were altered between the time of the initial tabulation and the recount so as to change the outcome of the election. <em>In re Petition to Contest the General Election for District Justice in Judicial District 36-3-03 Nunc Pro Tunc, </em>No. 10051 of 1994, slip order at 4-5, finding of Fact No. 11 (C.P.

On May 5, 1994, the court of common pleas filed an opinion in this matter pursuant to Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), to “more fully explain” why it set aside the election. <em>Petition II. </em>In this opinion, the court noted that, although the voting machines operated properly on both election night and on January 5, there were substantial differences in the vote totals for the two candidates. <em>Petition II, </em>slip op. at 1.

While Zupsic did not specifically state that the Board of Elections was derelict in its duties, he did specifically allege that fraud in the election occurred between the first machine count on November 2 and the second machine count on January 5. Since the ballots were in the exclusive control of the Board of Elections and/or the court during that time, the only logical conclusion to be reached from the Petition is that any alleged ballot tampering occurred while the ballots should have been secured by the Board of Elections.</p>

However, in <em>Orsatti, </em>there was no indication that the ballots were under the Election Board’s control at the time the alleged forgeries occurred. In contrast, the failure to adequately secure ballot boxes alleged here qualifies as a breakdown in the Board of Elections’ operation due to some failure on the part of its officers.

Rule 1.11 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which Laughlin cites, is clearly inapplicable because it prohibits attorneys in the public sector from participating in matters “in which [they] participated personally and substantially while in private practice.” The District Attorney’s endorsement of Zupsic has nothing to do with what she may have done in private practice. Further, we agree with the lower court that any supposed conflict of interest would go to the weight <em>of </em>testimony rather than its admissibility. <em>See, e.g., Weir by Gasper v.
