We hold that the failure to sign a consent form does not per se constitute a refusal to submit to chemical testing. However, in the instant case, the record establishes that the licensee demonstrated a general unwillingness to submit to testing that was not based solely upon her refusal to sign the consent form. Under these circumstances, the licensee’s conduct constituted a refusal.</p>

Officer Kriebel approached Appellee’s vehicle and noticed that she had a facial cut to the chin and bloodshot, watery eyes. When Appellee informed the officer that she had no other injuries, the officer detected a strong odor of alcohol on her breath. Appellee admitted that she had consumed a few drinks. An ambulance crew arrived at the accident site, treated Appellee for her injuries, and transported her to a hospital.</p>

Finally, he asked Appellee to tell him her age, phone number, social security number and date of birth. Appellee answered each question without hesitation. When Officer Kriebel again asked her if she would consent to the blood test, she did not respond.</p>

Appellee then stated that she <em>would </em>submit to the test. Thereafter, Officer Kriebel handed Appellee a clipboard with the consent form attached and requested that she read the form and sign it. Appellee stated that she could not lift her arm to sign the form. Officer Kriebel then informed her that if she did not sign the consent form, he would consider her action a refusal to submit to the blood test. Appellee did not sign the form and Officer Kriebel informed her that her action was a refusal. Shortly thereafter, Officer Kriebel observed Appellee sign a hospital treatment form presented by a nurse.</p>

The court <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>dismissed Appellee’s appeal, concluding that her actions were so inconsistent with her purported verbal assent that they constituted a de facto refusal of the test.</p>

[U]nder the circumstances of this case, there was no issue as to whether [Appellee’s] response related to the chemical test or the implied consent form that she was requested to sign. The record reveals that when [Appellee] was requested to sign the implied consent form on at least two occasions, she turned her head away from the officer and refused to respond to him. Because [Appellee’s] actions were so completely inconsistent with her purported verbal assent to the chemical test, the Court concluded that such actions constituted a de facto refusal of the test.</blockquote>

In <em>Miller, </em>the licensee was requested to sign a consent form that also contained provisions for waiver of liability. The licensee objected to the liability provisions and the hospital clerk crossed them off the form. The licensee then stated that he would sign the form only if the hospital agreed to accept liability should he contract AIDS or hepatitis and if the director of the hospital initialled the form. The hospital did not comply and the licensee refused the test.</p>

The latter case held that where a licensee has shown that he is unwilling in general to submit to a blood test, the subsequent presentation of a waiver of liability form to the licensee would vitiate the refusal of the blood test.</p>
