T., 1915, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. York Co., Oct. T., 1911, No. 214, opening judgment, in case of Catharine E. Hutton v. Kerwin W. Altland, Executor of the Last Will and Testament of Catharine Naylor.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Elkin, Mosohzisker and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for rule to open a judgment entered upon a judgment note. Before Ross, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the judgment defendant alleged that the note, upon which the judgment had been entered, was obtained from her by fraud or else that the note was a forgery; that she had never seen the note or any note similar to that upon which judgment had been entered previous to the entry of the judgment; that the judgment plaintiff was the daughter of the judgment defendant; that although the note was witnessed by two persons, the paper was folded over when they witnessed it and they did not know what paper they were witnessing; that the judgment plaintiff subsequent to the date of the note .had admitted in the presence of a reputable witness that the judgment defendant owed her nothing. Outside of the testimony of the plaintiff there w\u00e1s nothing on the record to indicate to the court that, the defendant ever had any notice that the judgment note existed until judgment was confessed thereon.\nThe lower court opened the judgment. The judgment plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nAllen C. Wiest, with him William A. Allen and Josiah W. Gitt, for appellant.\nJas. G. Glessner, for appellee.\nMay 26, 1915."
