Where the relation between a man and woman was illicit at its commencement, the presumption is that it so continued and the burden is upon those who assert that a marriage subsequently took place to establish the fact of such marriage.\n2. Where the children of intestate decedent who were the offspring of a union illicit at its commencement, petitioned for a citation to compel the administratrix of such decedent to file an account, the petition was properly refused in the absence of evidence that petitioner\u2019s mother was ever married to decedent, or that decedent had ever publicly recognized her as wife, or had ever cohabited with her in a common dwelling.\nArgued May 10, 1915.\nAppeal, No. 250, Jan. T., 1914, by Harry C. Fuller and Lucy Kate Thorne, formerly Lucy Kate Fuller, from order of O. C. Fayette Co., June T., 1912, No. 98, dismissing petition for a citation, in estate of William C. Fuller, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Elkin, Moschzisker and Frazer, JJ.\nAppeal dismissed.\nAppeal from decree of the Register of Wills refusing to compel an administratrix to file an account. Before Work, P. J.\nIt appeared from the record that William C. Fuller died at his home in Perryopolis, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, September 14, 1901, intestate. Letters of administration were granted to his mother, Catherine Fuller, on October 31, 1901. On August 17, 1912, Harry C. Fuller and Lucy Kate Thorne petitioned the register of wills of Fayette County for a citation to compel Catherine Fuller, administratrix, to file her account or to show cause why an account should not be filed. The respondent in her answer denied that the petitioners were such parties in interest as would entitle them to maintain such a proceeding, or that they were heirs at law of William C. Fuller. It appeared that the petitioners were the offspring of the decedent and Anna Mary Bradley, with whom the decedent had maintained intimate relations for a long period of time.. It did not appear that the decedent had ever publicly recognized the mother of the petitioners as his wife, or had ever cohabited with her in a common dwelling, but on the contrary, it appeared that he had lived with his parents in another town, a short distance from her home, and had visited her only at intervals. There was evidence tending to show that he had on various occasions recognized the petitioners as his children.\nThe petition for the citation was refused by the register of wills. On appeal, the Orphans\u2019 Court sustained the decree of the register. Harry C. Fuller and Lucy Kate Thorne, appealed.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nE. G. Hig\u2019bee, with him Earry A. Gottorn and E. P. Gottorn, for appellant.\nR. F. Eopwood, for appellee.\nMay 26, 1915 :"
