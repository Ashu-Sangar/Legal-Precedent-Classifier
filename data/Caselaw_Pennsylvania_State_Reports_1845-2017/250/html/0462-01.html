    <p class="syllabus" id="b493-3" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[182,507,1150,1148]]]'>3. In an action for the price of malt sold by plaintiff to defendant, the contract provided that “the buyer shall order the malt to be shipped......in approximately equal monthly shipments,” that the failure of the buyer to give shipping orders as required “shall entitle the seller to charge the buyer with storage or carrying charges of one cent a bushel per month or fraction thereof for the time any shipments are delayed by reason of such failure......” It appeared from the statement of claim that defendant had accepted several shipments, but on the date when the last order should have been given, refused to give shipping directions for the balance, and that plaintiff had thereafter carried the malt for defendant, and claimed the contract price thereof. Judgment was entered for plaintiff for want of an affidavit of defense. The defendant moved to strike off the judgment and filed an affidavit of defense which alleged that the malt which plaintiff shipped and intended to ship was of an inferior grade to that specified in the contract, which fact had been acknowledged by plaintiff; that an adjustment had been made, but that such adjustment “was not sufficient to cover the loss the defendant suffered by reason of the failure of the plaintiff to perform his contract,” which loss could not “be accurately determined but is estimated to exceed $2,500; that plaintiff “did not offer or tender to ship the standard mentioned in the contract, and by reason thereof the defendant did not give the shipping orders.” The lower court refused to strike off the judgment. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b493-7" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[180,1665,1151,595]]]'>4. In such case the rule that for breach of an executory contract for the sale of goods not specific, the measure of damages for the refusal of the buyer to accept the same is the difference between the price agreed upon and the market value on the day appointed for delivery, was not applicable in view of the express provision in the contract that if no shipping orders were received from the buyer at the expiration of the period fixed for delivery, the seller could carry the goods for its account; the plaintiff therefore had the right to set aside the goods, carrying them for the defendant, and recover the full contract price, and the defendant was entitled to a delivery of the goods at any time upon payment of the judgment secured against it with interest, cost and proper carrying charges.</p>

At the expiration of the period of delivery and failure of the buyer to order out all of the malt within said period, it shall be optional with the seller to cancel this contract as to the balance not shipped and taken, or to charge the buyer with storage and carrying charges at the rate above stated for such time as the seller elects to carry the malt for the buyer”; that it had delivered and defendant accepted and paid for 4,511 bushels of the malt, but on July 1, 1912, the date when the last shipping order should have been given, and from thence to the time of suit, the defendant had “failed, neglected and refused to give the seller shipping directions for the balance of said contract, to wit, 1,489 bushels”; that notice had been given under the contract to the defendant that plaintiff “exercised its option to carry the said 1,489 bushels of malt for the buyer”; that “by the said election under the contract the plaintiff-seller has been since July 1,1912, and is now, carrying the said 1,489 bushels of malt for the (defendant) buyer”; that “the defendant refused and still refuses to receive the said 1,489 bushels of malt”; therefore, the plaintiff sued for the full contract price.</p>

Fairchild, <a href="/pa/168/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="168 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="868525" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0246-01">168 Pa. 246</a>; Baker v.

The. averment as to the damages alleged to have been suffered by the defendant because of a prior shipment of inferior malt is too vague and indefinite for serious consideration: Sitgreaves v. Griffith, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.N.C.%20705" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 W.N.C. 705">2 W. N. C. 705</a>; Baker v.

It is to be noticed, however, that under the contract the seller was not to ship, and, therefore, it must be presumed the plaintiff did not “intend to ship,” any malt whatever until orders to that effect were received from the defendant; hence, in view of the express admission by the defendant that it had given no shipping orders, in the absence of an averment by the latter that malt tendered in express anticipation of such orders, or that the 1,489 bushels which the plaintiff was carrying for it, were not of the grade and quality stipulated in the contract, the vague, general allegation that the plaintiff “openly acknowledged the malt which it intended to ship” was not of the character called for, without stating how, when, where, by whom, or under what circumstances, such alleged acknowledgment was made, was clearly inadequate from every standpoint. The further general allegation that the plaintiff had “not' offered, nor tendered” the quality of malt mentioned in the contract likewise was insufficient, for there is no condition in the contract requiring an offer or tender by the plaintiff until shipping orders are received from the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b498-3" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[305,848,1148,854]]]'>While the general rule is that on “an executory contract for the sale of goods not specific, the measure of damages for the refusal of the buyer to accept the same is the difference between the price agreed upon and the market value on the day appointed for delivery,” yet, this rule does not apply under the special contract here involved, which specifically states that if, at the expiration of the period fixed for delivery, no shipping orders are received from the buyer, the seller may carry the goods for its account, making “carrying charges” therefor; hence, under the contract, the plaintiff had the right to set aside the goods, carry them for the defendant, and recover the full contract price, the defendant, of course, being entitled to a delivery of the goods, at any time, upon payment of the judgment secured against it with interest, costs and proper carrying charges.</p>
