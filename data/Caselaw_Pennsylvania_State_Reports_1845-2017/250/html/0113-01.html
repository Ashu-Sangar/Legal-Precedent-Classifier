In view of the testimony offered in support of the application to open the judgment — a recital of which would serve no good purpose — the court below would have clearly erred if it had not granted the relief prayed for; and this is all that need be said in answer to the complaint of the appellant that error was committed by the order or decree from which she has appealed.</p>
