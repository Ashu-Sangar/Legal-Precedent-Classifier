Plaintiffs, in 1883, leased the coal under four tracts of land to defendant, which agreed to pay therefor certain royalties. The terms of the lease were performed for a period of about twenty years, after which defendant, while continuing to mine, refused payment of royalties, alleging that it was the owner of one of the four tracts demised, and that it had through accident and mistake, and believing and relying on the ownership by lessor, paid for more coal than was under the other three pieces of land, and was, therefore, under no further obligation to pay the lessor for coal mined, but was entitled to reimburse itself for such over-payments from that part of the premises which lessor admittedly owned. It appeared that defendant company was in fact the owner of one of the four pieces of land mined, but that plaintiffs had color of title thereto, and that all the facts concerning the disputed title were matters of record at the time the lease was made. There was no evidence of any mistake of fact, except the mere acceptance of the lease by the tenant. <em>Held, </em>the lower court did not err in deciding that if any mistake was made in the execution of the lease, it was purely a mistake of law which would not avail the lessee as a defense against the payment of the stipulated royalties.</p>

If in any year, the lessee failed to mine as much coal as it had paid for in any such year, it was permitted to mine the deficiency in any subsequent year of the term without further charge. When the coal is exhausted so as to render the production of the annual fixed minimum impracticable, the lessee is relieved from the production of the full annual minimum and only required to mine and pay for such quantity as can be mined and removed. The agreement also provides payment, not included in the annual rental, for pea coal.</p>

By a written agreement made by the parties on the trial of the cause, it was stipulated that the amount paid in royalties is equal to the amount of coal mined, under the lease and the coal yet unmined in the first, second, and third pieces described in the lease; but that the coal unmined in the fourth piece described in the lease is more in quantity and value than the installments of rent sued for in this case.</p>

The defendant company filed an affidavit of defense in which it admitted the lease, denied that the plaintiffs owned the fourth piece of land at the date of the execution of the lease, averred that, through accident and mistake and believing in the ownership by plaintiffs, it paid the rents and royalties under the lease based on the total acreage as described in the lease, and further averred that as the plaintiffs were not the owners of the fourth piece of land the defendant had overpaid the plaintiffs fifty thousand dollars under the terms of the lease and claimed a set-off to that amount against the plaintiffs.</p>

He also held that the plaintiffs had color of title which, coupled with facts about the surface conditions, afforded sufficient consideration for the agreement on the part of defendant to mine and pay for the coal, that the defendant entered into the agreement with knowledge of the facts and is estopped from setting up its title to the land as a defense to payment of the rent <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>sued for, that the sale was an entire and unseverable sale of the four pieces of land, and that as to the defect in the title there was at most a mistake of law which would not avail the lessee as a defense against the payment of the stipulated royalties.

The ground on which relief is sought is that at the time the lease was executed the lessee and not the lessor was the owner of the fourth tract of land, and that the lease was entered into by reason of a mutual mistake of law as to the title to the tract. The only evidence of the alleged mistake is that the lessee, although the owner of the land at the time, entered into the contract and thereby purchased and agreed to pay to the lessor the stipulated price for the coal. There is no evidence in the record as to what occurred between the parties during their negotiations and at the time of the execution of the lease. From the importance of the transaction in a financial point of view, we must assume that both parties were represented by counsel. The deeds and other muniments of title were on record, and, therefore, each party knew, not only his own but the other’s title to the land. The plaintiff’s title had its inception in a patent issued by the Commonweath in 1821 which was antedated by a patent issued to the defendant’s predecessor in title for the land abutting on <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>both sides of the strip of land in question which was called a road. We must, therefore, assume that the parties knew at the time they executed the lease that the lessee was the owner of the land, and there is nothing in the record to rebut the presumption. In such cases, the purchaser is presumed to receive compensation in the collateral benefits of a bargain and equity will refuse relief : Perkins v. Gay, 3 S. &amp; R. 327; Lighty v.

The leased property consisted of four small contiguous pieces of coal, claimed by the lessor, none of which with the possible exception of the first was large enough for a coal operation. The lessor manifestly would desire to let the coal under the four pieces if she let any of it, as working the small tract as a separate operation would not be practicable. The lessee owned the adjacent coal. The lessor, of course, claimed title to the tract but the record, which was notice to both parties, showed a better title in the lessee. This was the situation which confronted the parties when they were negotiating for the lease and it was subsequently executed. It is, therefore, more than probable that the parties and their counsel discussed the title, and, that while the lessee company asserted its own title, agreed to take the lease as a compromise of the conflicting claims to the title because of the advantages which would thereby accrue to it. At all events there is not a particle of evidence save the taking of the lease by the lessee, and that is wholly insufficient, to show that there was any mistake as to the title of either party when the lease was executed. Twenty years have elapsed since the execution of the contract, during which time the lessee has operated the coal and paid the rentals, and direct and satis<a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>factory proof of the alleged mistake should be produced before, a chancellor is moved to rectify it.</p>

The land in question is what was known as a “Commissioner’s Road,” and the alleged mistake was in construing the defendant’s title to the adjacent land as extending to the edge of the road and not to its center. As pointed out above, there could not have been a mistake of fact, as the title of each party was of,record and hence the parties had all' the facts before them when the lease was made. It is not alleged that the lessee was induced to enter into the lease by any fraud, misrepresentation, concealment of facts, or other inequitable conduct on the part of the lessor. . There are no .special circumstances or facts in the case, disclosed by the record,, to induce a chancellor, to give relief to the containing, party. As suggested above, the contract may have been advantageous to the lessee company notwithstanding- it ■ was the owner of the fourth piece of coal. We are, therefore, dealing here with a mistake of law, pure and simple, unaided by any equitable consideration which' should move a chancellor to grant relief.

Co. v. Johnson, 6 House of Lords’ Cases 798. The rule is stated by Mr. .Pomroy (2 Pom. Eq. Jur. 3 Éd. Sec. 842). as follows: “The Joe-,, trine is. settled that, in general, a mistake of law, pure,, and simple, is not adequate ground fpr relief. Where a party with knowledge of all; the mi|LÍ(Mn§I'Í3,g'ts, and with- , out any other special circumstances'giving rise to an equity in his behalf, enters into a transaetion affecting his interests, rights and liábilities, under an ignorance <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>or error with respect to the rules of law controlling the case, courts will not, in general, relieve him from the consequences of his mistake.” In assigning reasons for the rule, the learned author says, inter alia: “If ignorance of the law were generally allowed to be pleaded, there could be no security in legal rights, no certainty in judicial investigations, no finality in litigations.” In Norris v. Crowe, <a href="/pa/206/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="206 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="931692" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0438-01">supra,</a> Mr. Justice Dean directs attention to our cases, among them Wilson v. Ott, <a href="/pa/173/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="173 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="875901" data-case-paths="/pa/173/0253-01">173 Pa. 253</a>, relied on by appellant, which he calls exceptions to the general rule and says that relief was not granted in those' cases “solely on the ground of ignorance of the law; but there were in addition circumstances of great hardship resulting from the ignorance, or, in addition to the mistake of law, facts pointing strongly towards fraud or undue influence, yet which would not have been so certainly established as to warrant setting aside the contract.” The learned judge then comments on the remarks in the opinion in Wilson v. Ott, <a href="/pa/173/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="173 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="875901" data-case-paths="/pa/173/0253-01">supra,</a> tending to throw doubt on the rule announced in Good v. Herr, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 253" data-case-ids="481841" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0253-01">supra,</a> says no assault on the general rule was necessary, and reaffirms the doctrine by saying: “But nevertheless, we adhere to that rule as the law of this Commonwealth, that is, ‘In no case is ignorance or mistake of the law with a full knowledge of the facts, per se, a ground for equitable relief.’ ” ;</p>
