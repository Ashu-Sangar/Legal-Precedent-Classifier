The Supreme Court concluded that the reduction so made was insufficient, for the reason that we apparently allowed a recovery on the basis of almost the entire estimated product of plaintiffs’ mine, without making any allowance for the lack of cars to transport the coal mined in the region where plaintiffs’ mine was located. We made a general reduction of one-fifth from the amount returned by the jury as single damages, intending this to cover both the reasonably certain diminution in the amount of product by reason of delays and difficulties in mining, as also on account of the impossibility of procuring the necessary cars.

If there was evidence that an equitable rate of distribution had been charged, and from our examination of the record we think there was, such rate would be a fixed factor in the case for the determination of the amount of coal that would be shipped. The fact that the amount of remitter ordered by the court is so much-less than it would have been had the rate of car distribution been considered is to our mind convincing that the evidence touching this matter was overlooked, with the result that we have here a judgment based on the productive capacity of the mine, whereas only so much of the coal could have been marketed as would have been accommodated in the cars which plaintiffs could rightfully have demanded of the defendant. A new trial of the case ought not to be necessary, but however this may be wha.t for the present we must regard as a manifest injustice to the defendant calls for correction, and a reversal of judgment is therefore required only however that the motion for a new trial in the court below may be reinstated.”</p>

According, to Exhibit 43, which, under the decision of the Supreme Court, furnishes the fixed standard for ascertaining the car supply in the years 1903 and 1904, we must conclude that in 1903 the car supply was only 22.7 per cent, of the .capacity of the mines, and in 1904 the car supply was only. 18.2 per cent, of this capacity. The product of plain<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>tiff’s mine, as estimated by Mr. Lawton, whose estimate was assented by Mr. Quinn, the quantity was ascertained upon the assumption that a double turn could have worked continuously day and night, and that nothing would have occurred to prevent the continuous prosecution of the mining. We were of opinion when we disposed of the original motion for a new trial that this estimate was too high, because common experience teaches us that there necessarily would have been delays and difficulties which would have prevented the continuous operation of the mine. We made a general reduction of one-fifth to cover this and the lack of car supply. At present we are not called upon to make any allowance for lack of car supply, because we shall apply the fixed standard designated by the Supreme Court,- and found in Exhibit 43. We will, however, deduct from Mr. Lawton’s estimate of the capacity of the mine ten per cent., and make our calculation as to the single damages upon this basis, using the prices which were agreed upon at the trial. The discrimination complained of by plaintiffs was amply proved by the evidence and the record upon this subject has been duly approved by the Supreme Court. We will, therefore, in making our computation of the amount of single damages due at the date of the verdict in this case make an allowance for the delay in payment not exceeding six per cent, per annum for the loss ascertained for each month. From this calculation it appears that the total loss sustained by plaintiffs by reason of defendant’s failure to supply a siding for their shipments of coal up to the date of the verdict is $9,552.09. In addition the plaintiffs claim for loss sustained upon coal mined prior to January, 1903, and which was not shipped because no siding facilities were furnished. Mr. Lawton testified that in his opinion the coal thus mined and ready for shipment was 1,001 tons. Mr. Womelsdorf, a witness for the defendant, testified that he made an estimate from figures given by Mr. Lawton in December, 1902, in regard to the length and width of the various headings, and that he <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>estimated the quantity of coal taken out at about 1,001 tons. He agreed with Mr. Lawton’s estimate on this subject, and stated that “it was originally from twelve to fourteen hundred, and then the actual figures brought it down to 1,001, and my figures agree with that.” Apparently the testimony for both plaintiffs and defendant fixes the quantity of dump coal at 1,001 tons. Mr. Law-ton testified that some sales had been made of this dump coal amounting in all to <em>222 </em>tons and 14 cwt. Sales were made to various parties at various prices, and Mr. Law1 ton fixed the total amount received therefor at $200.66. Counsel for plaintiffs contend that in disposing of the original motion for a new trial we made a mistake in estimating the loss on this dump coal. It appears that we allowed the plaintiffs for only 779 tons of coal, and that we charged against the market price of this coal in January, 1903, the market price of 779 tons in 1905, and allowed them as loss on dump coal only $3,308.75. This apparently was an error, for the testimony is clear that 1,001 tons of dump coal was agreed upon by Mr. Lawton and Mr. Womelsdorf in their estimates. We have carefully read the testimony of Mr. Lawton and all the other testimony on this subject. He testifies that the only part of this dump coal which was sold was the 222 tons and 14 cwt. He very clearly states that this is all the coal which was sold by the plaintiffs from the pile on the dump, and that all the remainder was a total loss, that it was injured by exposure to the air, and was not fit for anything but ballast. We are therefore constrained to conclude that we made a mistake against the plaintiffs in computing the loss upon dump coal, and we now find that their claim for this loss is as stated by them .....'.............................. $5,304.84 To this we add an allowance not exceeding 6 per cent, per annum from January, 1903, to the date of the verdict............... 1,697.54</p>

To transport this quantity there must have been used 78,835 cars of 33 tons capacity. The estimated tonnage according to the testimony of Mr. Lawton from plaintiffs’ mine during the year 1903 was 64,464 tons.

In the light of this offer and this agreement the Supreme Court has determined that Exhibit No. 43 established a “fixed factor” for the car supply to which plaintiffs would have been entitled if they had been shipping coal in 1903 and 1904, and we are bound to follow the conclusion thus reached by the court of last resort. Presumably the Supreme Court had its attention called to the apparent discrepancy between Mr. Johnson’s testimony at page 242 and the statements contained in Exhibits 42 and 43, and after considering the same concluded that under the offer and agreement above referred to, Exhibit 43 must be accepted as establishing the proper percentage of distribution of the car supply. It will be noticed that the agreement states that the exhibit shows the number of cars actually placed in this region with respect to mine capacity during the years in question. Thus it seems to be admitted that the cars were actually distributed in 1903 and 1904 according to the percentage contained in Exhibit 43.

    <p class="summary" id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[301,966,1153,1016]]]'>At the argument of the motion to reconsider it was contended by the defendant that we were in error in allowing the plaintiffs the total value of the coal upon the dump in January, 1903, and that plaintiffs were entitled to recover only for such loss upon the dump coal as would have been sustained upon the quantity of coal which could have been shipped with the proper allotment of car supply. It is manifest that the percentage of cars to which plaintiffs were entitled under Exhibit 43 would not have enabled them in January, 1903, to have carried to market the dump coal and the coal mined during that month. Apparently the defendant is not chargeable with loss upon this coal estimated at the prices prevailing in January, 1903. The defendant contends that the most which plaintiffs can claim with respect to this dump coal is an allowance of 22.7 of cars in each month until the coal was shipped, and suggests that the loss upon this coal is properly estimated in the following table:—</p>

It is therefore ordered that if the plaintiffs within five days from the filing hereof shall consent in writing that the verdict for single damages shall be reduced to $11,845.27, the prothonotary is now directed upon the filing of such consent, to note upon the record that the reinstated motion for a new trial is overruled and that judgment is now entered upon the verdict for single damages, as thus reduced, in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant for the sum of $35,535.81, being the treble damages under the act of assembly upon which this action is based; said judgment to bear interest from May 13th, 1908, to date of the verdict.
