Fuller died at his home in Perryopolis, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, September 14, 1901, intestate. Letters of administration were granted to his mother, Catherine Fuller, on October 31, 1901. On August 17, 1912, Harry C. Fuller and Lucy Kate Thorne petitioned the register of wills of Fayette County for a citation to compel Catherine Fuller, administratrix, to file her account or to show cause why an account should not be filed. The respondent in her answer denied that the petitioners were such parties in interest as would entitle them to <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>maintain such a proceeding, <em>or </em>that they were heirs at law of William C. Fuller. It appeared <em>that </em>the petitioners were the offspring of the decedent and Anna Mary Bradley, with whom the decedent had maintained intimate relations for a long period of time.. It did not appear that the decedent had ever publicly recognized the mother of the petitioners as his wife, or had ever cohabited with her in a common dwelling, but on the contrary, it appeared that he had lived with his parents in another town, a short distance from her home, and had visited her only at intervals. There was evidence tending to show that he had on various occasions recognized the petitioners as his children.</p>
