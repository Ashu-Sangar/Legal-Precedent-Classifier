      <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>But read in connection with the antecedent provision for vesting full possession in each child as they severally became of legal age, this clause for the benefit of the half brother must be deemed to refer to the possible event of death of the children during minority, and therefore before their respective estates become vested. Hence, as between the children and the half brother, it is a case of alternative contingent remainders, where one became vested by reason of the happening of the primary contingency and thereupon the other fell; as in such case only can ever take effect: Mitchell on Real Estate, Etc., 237, and cases there’ cited. -</p>

It is believed to be unnecessary to cite authorities for the proposition that this result is the one that would be favored in case of doubt as to the testator’s meaning. &gt; It will be noted that while plaintiffs apparently derive title from all four of the children because the four first conveyed to the mother, yet three only are above named in tracing title from testator. That is because these are the four lots on the easterly side of Main avenue — formerly the Plank road — which were distributed among these three children, the other one, Euphemia, getting a lot on the opposite side. Just why she joined in the deed to the mother doesn’t appear. But it is of no consequence. The deed passed the fee to the mother who eventually aliened by deed under which plaintiffs now claim. Thus it is believed the issue is with them, and in accordance with the stipulation of counsel, judgment is directed to be entered for plaintiffs in the sum of $5,500, the lien of- which, as well as of any execution to be issued thereon, to be restricted to the land described in the exhibit attached as part of the facts stated.</p>
