Each reservation had its peculiar and special features; and in authorizing the secretary of agriculture to meet these local conditions, Congress was merely conferring administrative functions upon an agent and not delegating to him legislative power.......From the beginning of the government, various acts have been passed conferring upon executive officers power to make rules and regulations, not for the government of their departments, but for administering the laws which did govern. None of these statutes could confer legislative power.

It was said, referring to the power of the secretary of war to require the removal of obstructions to navigation (page 195) : “It is for Congress, under the Constitution, to regulate the right of navigation by all appropriate means, to declare what is necessary to be done in order to free navigation from obstruction, and to prescribe the way in which the question of obstruction shall be determined. Its action in the premises cannot be revised or ignored by the courts or by juries, except that when it provides for an investigation of the facts, upon notice and after hearing, before final action is taken, the courts can see to it that executive officers conform their action to the mode prescribed by Congress. Learned counsel for the defendant suggests some extreme cases, showing how reckless and arbitrary might be the action of executive officers proceeding under an Act of Congress, the enforcement of which affects the enjoyment or value of private property. It will be time enough to deal with such cases as and when they arise. Suffice it to say that the courts have rarely, if ever, felt themselves so restrained by technical rules that they could not find some remedy consistent with the law for acts, whether done by government or by individual persons, that violated natural justice or were hostile to the fundamental principles devised for the protection of the essential rights of property.”</p>

It was said by Mr. Justice Day (page 559) : “It is unnecessary now to determine whether the action of the board in refusing or revoking such a permit would be judicial and thus reviewable by mandamus or certiorari, or whether, if the authority should be arbitrarily or improperly exercised, the only remedy would be an application for the removal of the officers ; for those are questions that may arise in the administration of the law, but do not go to its validity......It is presumed that public officials will discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law.

It was held that the court would not attribute improper motives to the law-making power, and on a mere charge regard a statute imposing inspection fees as an act to raise revenue ; that, prima facie, the charge for inspection in an act otherwise constitutional is reasonable; and that if the inspection fees exact under a State statute average largely more than enough to pay expenses, the presumption is that the State will reduce them to conform to the constitutional authority to impose fees solely to reimburse for expense of inspection; that a requirement by the legislature that illuminating oils must be safe, pure and afford a satisfactory light establishes a sufficient primary standard, and remitting to the proper State board the establishment of rules and regulations to determine what oils measure up to those standards does not amount to a delegation of legislative power. Where one complains that regulations promulgated under legislative authority by a State board are unreasonable and oppressive, he should seek relief by applying to that board to modify them.</p>

The court referred to the fact that the exhibitions, on account of the low price of admission, are frequented and patronized by a large number of children, and that the audiences included those classes whose age, education and situation in life especially entitle them to protection against the evil influence of obscene and immoral representations, and said: “The purpose of the ordinance is to secure decency and morality in the moving-picture business, and that purpose falls within the police power......The welfare of society demands that every effort of municipal authorities to afford such protection shall be sustained, unless it is clear that some constitutional right is interfered with......” Page 264: “There is a great diversity of opinion as to what constitutes good moral character, but it is beyond, question that an officer authorized to grant a license to keep a dram-shop may determine whether the applicant has a good moral character, and there has been no ground for complaint that the power has been wrongfully or oppressively exercised against applicants.” Page 263: “Manifestly it would be impossible to specify in an ordinance every picture or particular variety which would be considered immoral or obscene, and no definition could be formulated which would afford a better standard than the words of the ordinance......The average person of healthy and wholesome mind knows well enough what the words ‘immoral’ and ‘obscene’ mean, and can intelligently apply the test to any picture presented to him......It is presumed that the chief of police or the mayor, in case of an appeal to him, will perform his duty with reasonable intelligence and in accordance with the generally accepted moaning of the <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>words.

In the former case it was said: “Moving-picture shows are of comparatively recent origin, but of rapid growth, springing up everywhere in the large cities and invading even villages and towns of modest size. While, as generally conducted, some educational value may be conceded to exist in these shows, it is nevertheless true that the chief aim is to furnish the sort of entertainment that will draw the most dimes. To furnish people with innocent and cheap amusement is laudable, but experience teaches that, where amusements are furnished for pecuniary profits, the tendency is to furnish that which will attract the greatest number rather than that which instructs or elevates.

There is a voluntary board known as the National Board of Censorship of Motion Pictures in New York, which has issued publications giving its policies and standards of judgment, and it is working in harmony with manufacturers, importers and exhibitors. That board views from 150 to 185 film subjects a week, and the pictures are daily seen by about 8,000,000 of people in 18,000 motion-picture houses in the United States. During last year 53 subjects were condemned and parts eliminated in 401. The cost of these negatives, copies included, was over $582,000. Realizing that pictures stimulating the senses require particular study from the point of view of the adolescent, the board has adopted standards curtailing prolonged love scenes which are ardent beyond the strict requirements of the dramatic situation, and restricts the display of clothing and the person in ways to arouse the imagination and suggest immorality and indecency. It has diseounté<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>nanced the portrayal of crime where it degenerates into pandering to a morbid appetite, and excludes gruesome and suggestive details. Careful elimination has also taken place in various forms of sex lapses, where pictures have been calculated to arouse rather than minimize passion, or tend to perpetuate the double standard of morality, but it has given support to subjects and films which present facts in a sincere and dramatic way.
