Prom this we may conclude that the amount realized from the sale of Jacob Stern’s interest did not reach this mortgage if it was divested. The amount named in the mortgage covered the entire property. If one of the interests was sold, and the mortgage was to be divested as to that interest, or a payment was to be made on the mortgage, the mortgagee would be entitled to payment from the fund realized or paid on account of that interest.</p>
