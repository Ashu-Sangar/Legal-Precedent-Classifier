    "head_matter": "Wilkey\u2019s Appeal.\n1. The fact that the widow of a decedent is illiterate, and over seventy years of age, does not deprive her of her statutory preferred right to letters of administration on the estate of her husband, where she appeared to have \u201c as good business capacity as the ordinary run of farmers\u2019 wives.\u201d Bowersox\u2019s Appeal, 4 Out., 434, followed.\n2. On an appeal from the refusal of the Orphans\u2019 Court to order the revocation of letters of administration granted by the Register of Wills, the Supreme Court will not review the discretion of the Register in granting such letters unless it appears that his discretion was abused, or his duty was manifestly disregarded.\n3 On an appeal in a case such as the above, evidence offered by the appellant to show errors in the inventory filed by the administratrix and to show the extent of the decedent\u2019s estate and the position of the heirs in regard to a certain contest pending about it, is irrelevant and inadmissible.\nFebruary 2d, 1885.\nBefore Mercue, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trtjnkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nCertiorari to and Appeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Fay~ ette County: Of July Term, 1884, No. 169.\nThis was an appeal by John Wilkey and Henry Wilkey, from a decree of said court dismissing their appeal from the .decision of the Register of Wills granting letters of administration upon the estate of James Wilkey, deceased, (appeL lant\u2019s father) to Catharine Wilkey his widow.\nJames Wilkey, an aged farmer, died intestate, possessed of an estate real and personal valued at about 140,000, leaving to, survive him a widow and four children, the youngest of whom, Philip, had resided with his father during the latter years of his life. Prior to the old man\u2019s death, the other children had caused a proceeding in lunacy to be instituted, alleging as evidence of insanity, that he had made certain agreements with his son Philip under undue influence and weakness of mind, whereby the latter acquired a claim to the bulk of his property in consideration of his maintaining his father, which consideration was grossly inadequate, &c. These proceedings were pending at the time of decedent\u2019s death.\nThe demand of the widow for letters of administration to be granted to her was supported by Philip, but was opposed by John and Henry on the ground that she was aged, illiterate, unduly influenced by Philip, and generally incompetent to administer the estate. The Register decided otherwise, and issued the letters to her. Thereupon John and Henry appealed from the Register\u2019s decision to the Orphans\u2019 Court. The grounds of tbe appeal were set forth in the petition as follows:\u2014\n1st. The said Catharine is more than seventy-eight years old and is unable to read or write English.-\n2nd. The said Catharine is unacquainted with business and money matters and incapable of discharging the duties of the said administration.\n3d. The said Catharine is unduly influenced and controlled by the said Philip Wilkey.\n4th. The duty of the said administrator will be to contest the validity of numerous transfers and assignments of personal property and choses in action made by the said James to the said Philip through fraud and undue influence exercised by the said Philip, to the damage of your petitioners, and the said Catharine positively declared to the said Register before the said letters were granted to her, that' she would not carry on any lawsuit or litigation against the said Philip.\n5th. The said letters,of administration should be granted to a stranger.\nThe answer of the administratrix set forth that \u201c she has faithfully performed her duties as administratrix, in accordance with the requirements of the oath she took when entering upon said duties; that she has filed a true inventory of said estate, had a sale, and filed in the proper office a true return thereof; that she has given a bond in the sum of two thousand dollars for the faithful performance of her duties, and that the allegation in the appellants\u2019 petition that your respondent is unduly influenced by her son Philip, is wholly untrue, and that the further statement that your respondent said before the Register that she would not carry on any lawsuit, or litigation against Philip, is also wholly untrue; as your petitioner then and now says she will do her whole duty as administratrix of the said estate.\u201d\nThe testimony showed that Mrs. Wilkey was over seventy years of age and illiterate, but \u201cshe has as good business capacity as the ordinary run of farmers\u2019 wives.\u201d' \u201cShe is just as competent to settle James Wilkey\u2019s estate as any other woman \u2014 no woman would be ordinarily. If she could read and write she would have to have an attorney.\u201d There was a conflict of testimony on most of the questions involved.\nThe appellants in the court below offered to show by a witness (1) that the inventory and appraisement filed by the administratrix is not correct, and offers to prove certain items of personal property belonging to the said estate which are omitted from the said inventory for the purpose of showing that the administration of the estate so far, has not been properly done.\u201d (2) to show the entire extent of James Wilkey\u2019s real estate, and the position of the heirs in regard to a certain contest pending about it.\nOffers objected to as irrelevant; objections sustained, and evidence excluded. Exception. (First and second assignments of error).\nTbe court dismissed tbe appeal from tbe Register, and confirmed tbe grant of letters of administration to tbe widow. John and Henry Wilkey thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error tbe exclusion of tbe above offers of testimony and tbe decree.\nEdward Campbell, for tbe appellant.\n3 3. Lindsey, for tbe appellee."
