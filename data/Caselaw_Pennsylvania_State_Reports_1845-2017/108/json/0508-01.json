Smith\u2019s Appeal.\nAil attachment execution served upon A., as executor of B., will pot hind property of the defendant in his hands as executor of C.\nJanuary 26th, 1885..\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County : Of July Term, 1884, No. 32.\nAppeal of Charles E. Smith from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County, in the matter of the distribution of the trust estate of Elizabeth T. Bunting, deceased. \u2022\nBefore the Auditing Judge, Hanna, P. J., the following facts appeared: Sarah Clark died in 1869, leaving a will bequeathing and devising a share in her residuary estate to her executors to sell and distribute the proceeds among the children of her sister, Elizabeth A. Bunting, and in trust as to the portion of Elizabeth T. Bunting, one of said children, to pay her the income, and, if necessary, part of the principal, for her use for life, the balance, at her death, to be \u201c divided among her brothers and sisters then living, and the issue of such then deceased, in the same shares as if she had died seised or possessed thereof intestate.\u201d\nElizabeth A. Bunting, the sister of the testatrix, died in February, 1878, after making a will, the executors of which were the same as those under the will of Sarah Clark. On February 25th, 1878, Charles E. Smith issued an attachment sur judgment against Samuel C. Bunting as defendant, and against the executors of Elizabeth A. Bunting as garnishees. The judgment was afterwards revived by sci. fa. On June 5th, 1883, the defendant assigned for value all his interest in Sarah Clark\u2019s estate to Mary Bunting. Elizabeth T. Bunting died June 3, 1883, leaving four brothers and sisters, of whom Samuel C. Bunting was one. The trustees of the trust estate of Elizabeth T. Bunting filed their account, showing a balance in their hands for distribution, of which the one fourth interest of Samuel C. Bunting was claimed by Mary Bunting, his vendee, and by Charles E. Smith under the above attachment.\nAfter stating the above facts, the Auditing. Judge reported as follows: \u201cThe proper garnishee having been summoned, the description of the capacity in winch he held or might hold any moneys of the defendant was not material, and could be added in the interrogatories filed or supplied even in the verdict and judgment, which were under the control of the Court. While this Court cannot amend the attachment, yet the Court of Common -Pleas has full authority, and we must consider that as done which ought to be done, particularly where, as here, the garnishee is not harmed, he still having the fund.\u201d\nHe thereupon awarded the one fourth interest of Samuel C. Bunting to Charles E. Smith. Exceptions were filed to this report by Mary Bunting, which, after argument, were sustained, and the said one fourth interest awarded to her. Whereupon the said Charles E. Smith took this appeal, assigning for error the decree of the Court.\nJ. Cooke Longstreth, for appellant. \u2014\nAn attachment need not describe the property to be attached: Layman v. Beam, 6 Wharton, 181.\nThe description of the garnishees was surplusage, and therefore immaterial: Bentley v. Kaufman, 3 W. N. C., 352; S. C., 5 Norris, 99; Wright v. Herrick, 125 Mass., 154; Sullivan v. Langley, 128 Id., 235; Hoyt v. Christie, 51 Vermont, 48.\nThe attachment bound all funds of the defendant in the hands of the garnishees: Rushton v. Rowe, 14 Smith, 63.\nNo subsequent creditor or assignee of the debtor could acquire any better title than the debtor had after the attach-men: Neely v. Grantham, 8 Smith, 433.\nAlbert N. Letchworth, for appellee. \u2014\nThe attachment execution cannot be enforced against the garnishee, as executor for another, and an entirely different estate than the one mentioned in the writ, without an amendment. But such an amendment cannot be permitted to prejudice the rights of third persons: Black v. Dobson\u2019s executrix, 11 S. & R., 96; Zimmerman v. Briggans, 5 Watts, 186; Crutcher v. Com., 6 Wharton, 350; Smith v. Hood, 1 Casey, 218."
