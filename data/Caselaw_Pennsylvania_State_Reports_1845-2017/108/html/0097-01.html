The bargain is that they will deliver 300 tons’of plow steel, and specifies the different kinds at 3-|-, 4, 4|-, 4|, and 4£ cents, and ends by saying, “ All shapes not named in the same proportion as above.” Now we have no evidence — and if it were necessary for the defendant’s case that we should have, the burden is upon them and they suffer in consequence of their neglect — that there were any other shapes, or that the other shapes would be of a higher value than the lowest priced article mentioned in this contract. It <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>will be observed, as plaintiffs’ counsel have stated, that there is no presumption as to the amount of each of these various articles Spratt, Johnston &amp; Co. might order. They might order a ton, or any small quantity, or none at all probably, of the highest priced steel, and have only needed and ordered the lowest priced. Whether that is a matter of any serious moment is for you to determine.</p>

If the preceding points be refused then the court is requested to charge that the defendants, having failed to show that they specified and ordered any shapes or kinds of steel, there is no standard but the price of slab steel by which the jury can estimate the defendant’s damages, and the jury can only allow them the difference in the price of slab steel, if any there be.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b116-10" data-blocks='[["BL_116.10",116,[250,1431,1177,558]]]'>Answer. That point is affirmed just as it stands, for the reason that this contract provides for a purchase of slab steel, and there being no evidence of what Spratt, Johnston &amp; Co. would have ordered, there is no presumption about it, and you have a right to take it that it was the lowest priced article, and that was slab steel. These various straight cuts were all the same price as slab steel, because they are all put in the. same category at 3|- cents per pound. But they would not be entitled in the absence of evidence on their part that they desired and. were compelled to purchase higher priced articles than slab steel, to claim for anything but the article which is the basis of the prices of the other articles as has been testified to by the witnesses. &lt;</p>

That would be a matter that you will determine under the testimony if you find that there was any difference when this default occurred. If slab steel was more expensive and higher priced in the market than 3-| cents a pound, then the difference would be the amount of damage to these defendants, and that amount you \yill allow. If that <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>amount be in excess of §1,200, then your verdict would be for the defendants.

That was an action of covenant, brought by Jane Calhoun against Hugh Hamilton, to recover damages for non-performance of articles of agreement, by which, in- consideration of a release of dower, Hamilton covenanted to pay her “the sum of $33.33 annually, during her natural life; $10 of which is to be paid in cash, the residue or $23.33 to be paid in trade, according to her wants, to wit, grain, meat, hay, &amp;c., at market prices of any and all such articles as she receives each and every year.” Mr. Justice Rogers, delivering the opinion of the court, sajm: “ The contract is for the delivery of the grain, meat, hay, of a stipulated value, as they may be wanted for the support of the widow. She may elect what part she will receive in grain, what in meat, and what in hay, or whether she will receive the whole in the one or the other article, or in any other commodity, the product of the farm. It cannot be the duty of Hamilton to make a tender, for, until she makes a demand, it is impossible 'for him to know what to tender, or in what quantities or at what times.” Applying the rule here stated, it was plainly the buyers’ right to elect what they would receive; a tender in “ Magnolia slabs,” “ Bull Tongues,” or “ Pony Points,” might well be refused upon the ground that these particular shapes had not been designated for delivery. Without such designation, therefore, there could be <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>no delivery of tbe steel, no default on part of 'the compare, "arid therefore no damages sustained b)'’ the garnishees: Wheeler &amp; Wilson Mf'g Co. <em>v. </em>Teetzlaff, 53 Wisc. 211; Wharton Cont. 576; Lobdell <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 5 Cowen 516; Barr <em>v. </em>Myers, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20299" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 299">3 W. &amp; S. 299</a>.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[241,613,1175,927]]]'>" It is said, however, that as there was in fact, an order and 'specification delivered for fifteen or twenty tons of steel under •the contract, which the company had failed or refused to fill, the company having subsequently become insolvent, the necessity for further designation was thereby dispensed with. It is admitted that bankruptcy or insolvency alone does not establish such proof of incapacity to perform as would justify the garnishees in treating the contract as broken,'and it is difficult •to determine how the failure to deliver the fifteen' or twenty ‘tons, taken alone or along with insolvency, can be considered 'Rs a refusal to deliver the whole. . No greater significance or ieffect can be given to such partial default than it necessarily ■'implies'. The part demanded may have been of a kind difficult, perhaps impossible a.t the time, to provide, but <em>non </em>constat, «that further orders may be for that kind,'or may not be supplied; fhe default may result from a merely temporary suspension or derangement of business; a further, demand may, ■b'y assignment of the contract of otherwise, be fully provided for, or creditors may intervene through a receiver and provide means of compliance, in order that they ma3r realize the avails "of the contract: Southwick <em>v. </em>Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20N.Y.%20421" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="84 N.Y. 421">84 N.
