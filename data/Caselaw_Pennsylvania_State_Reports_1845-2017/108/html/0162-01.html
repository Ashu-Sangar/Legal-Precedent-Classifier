Compensation for the sale or negotiation of the bonds necessarily implies an agent or employee of the city to sell to others- — one who shall use his best endeavors and influence to sell for the best practicable price, for the benefit of the city.

If they are agents, entitled to commission, the city is entitled to the benefit of whatever they may sell the bonds for above par.

There were other sinking funds certain to be in .the treasury fairly applicable to the payment or purchase of these bo'nds. The Master takes this view of the case, saying: “The syndicate has not the right to have a single bond except in exchange for money that is needed to pay these Street Bonds.” He goes on to say that he “understands the City Controller will not permit bonds to issue where the city lias money from other sources,” and that he further “ understands the syndicate now concedes that they are not entitled to bonds when there is money in the sinking fund to pay street indebtedness,” and that therefore no interference with the contract is required on that account. In this conclusion we disagree with the Master. We look irt vain, in the testimony and papers of the case, for any such pledge from the syndicate. It is not their position on argument of the case, on motion for a preliminary injunction. It was not their position -taken in December, 1883, when they demanded and received the full $1,405,000 of bonds, for the Temporary Loan Bonds due January, 1884, although the city then held in its treasury, in its sinking fund, idle, over $900,000, of which over $250,000 was, by law, bound to bé applied to the payment of these bonds, and, in addition, $91,000 of the bonds had been bought with money of the municipal sinking fund, and had actually been in possession of the city for months.

The effect of the decision of the court below is not only to prevent further issue of the1 bonds, to the great damage of the city, but to invalidate those already issued, exceeding a million and a half dollars, and which are in the hands of innocent purchasers for value, who are nevertheless affected with notice of want of lawful authority to issue them.</p>

F. S. 130. While the Supreme Court will rarely disturb the findings of fact of a Master, confirmed by the court below, that rule does not apply to deductions or inferences of fact from other facts found ; in such case the Master’s conclusion is 'simply a result of reasoning of which the court is as competent to judge as he : Phillips’ Appeal, supra. The Master’s qualified finding in this case that no actual fraud “ has been proven,” is merely his deduction or inference from facts found, and as that finding was not sustained by the court below, it has no weight in this court as a finding of fact. The facts from which he drew the inference of “ constructive fraud,” moreover, fully sustain a deduction of actual fraud. He reports: “We must find that the syndicate was guilty of that which would amount to a fraud in a party dealing at arm’s length with the city, <em>or </em>that they actually knew that they occupied a situation whichi m&gt;posed on them higher duties, and knowing this, failed to perform those duties.” He further finds that they occupied suchi a confidential relation to the city which imposed on them such higher duties; that “in the case in hand there was manifestly no severing of the relation of principal and agent existing between the city and the syndicate — the very contract recites this agency. There is no evidence anywhere of notice by them to the committee — ‘you must look out for us, it is now every man for himself.’ The relation then existed on May 14th, 1881, in full force......The Master is certainly not convinced that the syndicate advised the committee as they would have done as against a third party offering to purchase. To put the matter in a little different form, it does <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>not appear affirmatively that they put the committee in a position to deal with them with as little risk as, with their aid, they (the committee) could have dealt with third parties. And this seems to have been their duty.” ..... “We are compelled to conclude that he (Mr. Whelen) misapprehended his real position, and regarded himself simply as a possible purchaser of these bonds, and as such bound to do nothing to enhance their value.” And, nevertheless, the Master deduced the inference, from the above findings, that there was no fraud in fact! When, in addition to this, we look back from the point of view of the date of the final contract of May 14th, 1881, to the prior contracts and acts of Whelen &amp; Co. as confidential agents — their depreciation to the committee of the state of the eastern market for such loans, their advising, and in their first contract as agents stipulating that the committee should procure additional legislation to make the bonds more desirable by extending the time of payment to the full term of thirtjr years, upon which the committee acted, and otherwise manipulated to the great disadvahtage of the city in the event of an improved credit and money market, &amp;c., &amp;c.,— the. whole scheme becomes apparent, and the only impartial inference is that the appellants knowingly and fraudulently took undue advantage of their influence arising out of their intimate confidential relation, to advance their own individual interests at the .expense of the interests of their principal. But we contend that even upon the finding by the Master of “ constructive fraud,” this transaction, was against public policy and void, and equity has jurisdiction in this proceeding to restrain the city from ratifying it, and compel it to annul the contract.</p>

The first agreement does not contemplate any sale of the bonds to the appellants, but merely their employment as agents to sell the same for the benefit of the city.

In the one case the appellants are bound to act in good faith, and to endeavor to obtain for the city the highest market value for its bonds. In the other the bonds are to become the property of the appellants, so they may dispose of them as they see proper and enjoy the proceeds thereof.

It cannot correctly be said that this transaction in effect is the same as if the appellants had been authorized to sell the bonds at par, and were to be paid a commission of one per cent, for making the sale.

D. 1879, and its several supplements.” Then follow the conditions of payment and delivery, and it concludes with its execution by the signatures and seals of the sub-committee of finance, and Whelen and McCandless. “ If this is not a contract of sale I must confess my ignorance of the form and purport of such an instrument, and it does seem to me that the contrary assumption ignores both the common and technical meaning of the words which the parties have made use of. “ The city of Pittsburgh sells at par and accrued interest, to Henry Whelen and Wilson McCandless, $6,000,000 of the Improvement Loan Bonds.” There is no such thing as an avoidance or misinterpretation of this language; it is a plain, straightforward sale of .these bonds at par, as required by the Act quoted. Indeed, nothing else is pretended; the counsel for the appellants says: “ the syndicate are, in effect, purchasers of the bonds.”</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.9",216,[266,1994,1167,389]],["BL_217.1",217,[198,360,1169,216]]]'>By what authority, then, does it come about that Whelen and McCandless, by a subsequent clause of this same contract, are to be allowed a commission of one per centum-on all bonds purchased or exchanged by them? A commission for buying these securities ? It can hardly be argued that as agents for the city they sold to themselves. Such a transaction would be a legal curiosity, and worthy of careful scrutiny, but the fact is, that they were purchasers directly from the city, and so the contract of sale reads. It follows that this pretended <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>commission means nothing more or less than an abatement of one per centum from the price to be paid for the bonds; in other words, these purchasers were to have them at one cent less on the dollar than par. The result is, that the city authorities were acting <em>ultra vires </em>when they made this contract.</p>
    <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[195,577,1175,1338]]]'>The Master, however, argues that if these parties acted in good faith under the previous arrangements, that is, those of the 23d of April, 1880, and 23d March, 1881, and bought the bonds themselves at as high a price as could be obtained from any other party, the allowance of a commission did not •violate either the spirit or letter of the statutory prohibition. There is here, however, an assumption that the facts do not support. These parties cannot stand on the hypothesis that in the final contract they were acting as agents for the city, not only because of the patent inconsistency of making a sale to themselves, but because this contract so modifies the previous arrangements as to annul the agency for the disposition of the bonds, and substitute the agreement for an absolute sale. Moreover, whether the appellants bought the bonds for a price as high as others would have given, is a matter unknown, for no opportunity was given for competition after the supplementary Acts of March 11th, and April 15th, 1881. Thus the Master’s conclusion respecting the commissions fails for .the want of the facts necessary for its support, and there is only left the anomaly of a bonus given to Whelen and McCandless, not as sellers, but as purchasers, of the city bonds. The fact that these securities have, in violation of the express terms of the Act of Assembly, been sold at less than their par value, cannot be concealed or its effect destroyed by so flimsy a theoiy as that volunteered by the Master. Worse still, if his hypothesis be correct; if these men were indeed still acting, under the previous arrangements, as the agents of the city in the execution of the contract of the 14th of May, then, according to the Master’s own finding, was the whole transaction in which they were engaged, so tainted with fraud (he calls it legal fraud), that the city was not bound by it.</p>

He is, therefore, of the opinion that the city of Pittsburgh has the right to disaffirm said contract of May 14th, 1881.” We cannot exactly understand how the city can disaffirm a contract it never made; but no matter, for the effect of the finding is not only to avoid the contract, but also what might be regarded as its ratification by.the city councils in their action, on the report of the financial committee, of December 11th, 1882. In this I agree with the Master; that is, on the hypothesis that he is correct in assuming that Whelen and McCandless were, at the time of <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>making the contract under consideration, acting as agents of the city, and as such were to receive commissions for the sale of the bonds to themselves.

Indeed, such ratification on part of the city officials would in itself be a fraud, and therefore open to the investigation of the citizen. With the principle here stated the learned Master was doubtless acquainted, hence, he designates the actual fraud which he has discovered and pointed out, as legal fraud, thus making the contract susceptible of ratification by the councils, and so turns the plaintiffs out of court.

In such case, their experience and knowledge were their own, and they were not obliged to impart it to the committee with which they were dealing. In either case, however, the contract comes to nothing; in the one because it is void for fraud; in the other because prohibited by the Act of 1879, hence its execution on part of the city was unlawful.</p>

I have no hesitation in assenting to what his Honor, Judge Ewing, finds to be a fact; that is, that there was actual fraud in the procurement and making of the contract, and that with the peculiar moral ideas of the defendants we have nothing to do. They may have thought it a good thing to first gain the position of a financial confidant of the municipality, and when in that position make a bargain with it as though they were dealing at arms’ length. But, with the honorable judge below, I am not of that opinion. To sustain the court in this finding we need go no farther than the Master’s report, and even in it we <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>•might confine ourselves to the citation of the testimony of Mr. Whelen. This gentleman when asked whether his firm had not been dealing in Pittsburgh bonds prior to the execution of the contract of May 14th, 1881, answered: “ I think not; it would not have been a wise thing on our partand on being further interrogated why he did not consider it a wise thing for his firm to do, said: “ why, after I became the owner of a lot of bonds of course it would be my interest to put the price of the bonds up, if I could, and not before, and that is true of all marketable securities.” Under this piece of evidence, the Master, whilst giving Mr. Whelen credit for acting up to what he believed to be the whole measure of his duty to the city, concludes that he misapprended his real position, and regarded himself only as a possible purchaser of the bonds. T agree that there is here somehow a misapprehension; Mr. Whelen certainly did misapprehend both his position and duty, or the Master misapprehended Mr. Whelen and his associates. <em>If </em>it be true that these bankers, whilst acting as agents for the city, were thus quietly endeavoring, if but negatively, to prevent an appreciation of Pittsburgh securities, and in this manner to keep down the city’s credit until they could secure to themselves the control of the forthcoming bonds, the moral vision of that man, or court, that cannot see a gross fraud in such a transaction, must not only be obscured but totally perverted.</p>

Pittsburgh bonds at $1.05; the quotation by his own house, in July of the same year, of the same bonds, at a premium; of the sale of compromise bonds at $1.07 and $1.08, and of the premium on the five per cent, building bonds of 1880. So, syndicate and committee alike seem to have overlooked the prompt and eager bidding of the city banks and business men for the $1,400,000 Temporary Loan of March 1879. Furthermore, in the face of this exhibit of the sound financial standing of Pittsburgh; regardless of its assured commercial prosperity, its .credit was impeached. This .credit had been at one time doubtful, therefore, and notwithstanding all the evidence to the contrary, it was alleged still to be doubtful. Great care seems to have been taken to impress this upon the committee; a committee, who having tried the experiment, soon discovered that however it might be as to their skill in the several businesses in which they were engaged and understood, they were no match for these astute bankers in the matter of finance. As the Master informs us, the mere shrug of Whelen’s shoulders was a.matter.of awe and terror-to those <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>unskilled committeemen. Now, all this was well enough as long as these appellants were understood to be acting as agents of the city in the sale of her bonds, for in that case they could make nothing by the depreciation of these securities since they could only have their commissions, and all that they said and did might be regarded as merely an effort to enhance the value of their services in the eyes of the committee. So, it would have been all well enough had they from the first occupied the position of mere purchasers or bidders, for then their knowledge would have been their own, and the city could not justly have complained that they withheld it; in that case they would have dealt with her at arms’ length, and if by their skill and silence they got the better of the bargain, they would have been of good standing at least in the. forum of legal ethics. But if we are to take it that all this negotiation for special legislation, all this <em>suppressio </em>veri, this carefulness to do nothing that would tend to appreciate the credit of Pittsburgh, had for its object the contract of May 14th, 1881, by which they, acting as the agents of the city, procured a sale of the bonds to themselves, and at the same,time retained their commissions; when by these means they seek to draw from the municipal treasury some half million dollars which as much belong to the city as any other part of the proceeds of the bonds, the matter presents a very different appearance. It cannot be sleeked over under the name of ‘legal fraud’ and so passed off as something that has done the citizen no harm; as a matter with which he has nothing to do, and as though if only the treasury were thus depleted in a genteel manner, and by respectable men he ought to be satisfied. How coolly this man, whom the Master presents to us as a paid city agent, tells us that his house took care not to have anything to do with these bonds till after the contract of the 14th of May ; “ It would not have been a wise thing”; it would have been working in the interest of his principal, and that was not a wise thing to do. But “after I became the owner of a lot of bonds it would be to my interest to put up the price of those bonds, if I could, and not before.” And this agent, this attorney in fact of the city'', who steadily keeps in view his own interest to the exclusion of that .of his principal; who carefully prepares the way for the 14th of May contract, through and by which he and his associates are to get at par city bonds representing 16,000,000, which even then commanded a premium of five per centum, and which he and they knew would, in their hands, still further appreciate ; this municipal agent and his associates, who, if the Master’s position be correct, deserve anything rather than compensa<a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>tion, are to have for their services in thus helping themselves, in addition to their enormous speculation, the modest sum of sixty thousand dollars!!</p>

The character of the men engaged in this transaction would seem to negative so harsh an assumption, and we, therefore, the rather adopt the conclusion of the court below, that the agreement of the 14th of May abrogated the previously existing agency, and put the appellants in the position of purchasers of the bonds at a discount of one per centum.</p>

It is plain that a mere error of judgment on the part of the city would not stamp the transaction as fraudulent. While, therefore, the wisdom of the contract is not an important element in determining its character, it is nevertheless necessary to refer briefly to the circumstances under which it was made.

In Commonwealth ex rel. Whelen <em>v. </em>Select and Common Councils of the City of Pittsburgh, 7 Norris 66, we decided that these bonds were the bonds of the city of Pittsburgh and a part of its funded debt; and ordered a peremptory mandamus to issue to the councils of said city, commanding them to make provision for the payment of the interest. The interest which had accumulated at that time, together with interest for the current year, amounted to about $1,400,000, and the city had not the cash means on hand to pay this large sum. This was in the latter part of 1878. In January, 1879, two gentlemen selected by the finance committee of city councils, visited Philadelphia and New York for the purpose of procuring a loan of money to enable the city to pay this interest. They were unable to obtain the loan at either place, at any rate of interest, and returned and so reported. Subsequently an effort was made to place this loan in Pittsburgh, and after much exertion the movement became a success and the money was secured. The loan was for five years, and the rate of interest was six per cent. It further appears that each subscriber was to be allowed a commission of one per cent., or what would be the equivalent of it. It also appears that eventually more money was offered than was required, and the subscriptions were scaled down. We have no doubt that the taking of this loan by the citizens of Pittsburgh went very far towards re-establishing the credit of the city. That it did so fully, would perhaps be saying too much. Credit is a thing of slow growth, and when once impaired, from whatever cause, can seldom be fully restored by a single transaction, and the eifcyr of Pittsburgh could not reasonably expect, even after this show of confidence on the part of her own capitalists, to place a loan on as favorable terms as a cifcyr which had never defaulted on its bonds, nor litigated with the holders thereof.</p>

The other debt of the city then outstanding amounted to $8,152,405.11, making altogether an indebtedness of $14,826,105.11.

I knew that the reputation of the city had gone before it in every financial centre, and that she had defaulted on her railroad debts, and had defaulted on the interest of the Street Bonds ; that she was very greatly in debt, and that our people had previously decried the credit of the city. That we never had introduced an appropriation ordinance without its; <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>being looked upon as exceedingly harsh in its rate of taxation, and I knew that the credit of Allegheny county had always been above ours ; that she had placed a loan in February or March of 1880 at 5 per cent., sold $1,128,000 of it at par, and subsequently sold a smaller amount, $400,000, at a premium. Knowing that her bonds had always sold higher, I thought if we could get, I believed if we could get, a contract that would give us the same rate of interest for a sum of money that was more than the county debt entire, we would be doing a very good thing.</blockquote>

Carnahan, Esq., a member of councils and of the finance committee, also testified that in December, 1881, the Monongahela Navigation Company had decided to issue a new loan for $500,000, and that the directors after consultation had fixed the rate of interest at five per cent, as the best terms they could get. That this circumstance had some weight with the witness, as he regarded that corporation as good as any in the state of Pennsylvania. The witness also referred to some School Bonds in his School District which they were not able to get below five per cent, in 1881, and to the five per cent, bonds issued by Allegheny county in payment of riot losses, which were issued in 1880 at par; subsequently they commanded a small premium. The witness then continued : “ There were other matters, too, if you want me to give the whole subject; I considered the credit of the county was good and the credit of the city was bad. There was no interest appropriated and no money for interest, I think, in 1877 and 1878. In 1879 a mandamus was issued by one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas No. 1; he had rendered a long opinion which went abroad against the'validity of the bonds ; I remember reading it in the New York newspapers ; we were in the position of repudiators, forced to pay under an order of court, and under the opinion of one of our local judges that the bonds were not good; these things were against the credit of the city; and I was informed that you, sir, had gone East to negotiate a loan, and found the doors of the bankers closed, and they would not talk to you.”</p>

On the 19th of March preceding the sub-finance committee had advertised in the official papers of the city of Pittsburgh for a loan of that amount to redeem these bonds. The advertisement invited bids at par for bonds at four, four and a half and five per cent., to be accompanied with a certified check for ten per cent, of each bid, and the right was reserved to reject any and all bids. Not a single bid was received for either class of bonds. This advertisement has been the subject of much <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>criticism, and the court below evidently regarded’ it as a link in the chain of fraud. The learned judge said : “If it were intended to make a show of inviting proposals where none were desired, it would be intelligible. Of course no bids were received.” It would have been more satisfactory if the grounds of his objection had been stated. We see nothing upon the face of it to indicate fraud or bad faith. The notice was short, it is true, but the learned judge omits to state, what the evidence clearly shows, that this was no fault of the committee, and it is not alleged that the appellants had anything ■to do with this advertisement. -The truth is the finance committee had inserted the $141,000 in the appropriation ordinance for that year, but one branch of councils struck it out, and -in'its amended form the ordinance only passed about two .weeks before the advertisement appeared, and as the Street Bonds' matured on the first of April, all the notice appears to have been given that was practicable. The proposal for the three kinds of bonds was proper, and while the stipulation for •ten per cent, in cash was perhaps unnecessary, it was not unusual in such transactions, and would not be likely to deter bidders. The fact remains that not a bid was offered.</p>

They were but opinions, however, and do not touch the question of good faith. It may be, looking at the transaction from the standpoint of 1884, we might conclude that the bonds could have been placed to better advantage, but even this is by no means certain. The occasional sale of a small lot of bonds in 1880 and 1881 at a premium would not of itself furnish any safe guide 'to assume that the large quantity of $6,000,000 could be disposed of in excess of par, and it furnishes no justification for branding as rogues all concerned in the transaction.

Some importance was attached to the fact that in November, 1880, Mr. Whelen had sold to the Dollar Savings Bank of Pittsburgh a small amount of what are known as Pittsburgh Railroad Compromise five per cent, bonds at 105. Mr. Ford knew of this transaction, however, and it is of slight importance from the fact that the bonds in question appear to have been of a higher market value; they were issued by the city in compromise.of a long litigation, and the holders thereof had no reason to anticipate further difficulty in regard to them.</p>

The future was concealed from their vision as well as from others. The opinion of many prominent men of Pittsburgh whose testimony is before us, shows that they entertained a different view of the situation. They thought that the revival of business would increase the demand for, and the rates of money, and that the time was favorable for providing for the large indebtedness of the city soon to mature, by securing a five per cent, loan at par. And the appellants may well have thought that by taking such a loan — thereby guaranteeing the credit of the city for several years — they were assuming a serious risk. There is much testimony which tends to prove that the very fact of this loan having been taken, at par, by capitalists admittedly able to carry out their contract, hada beneficial effect upon the credit of the city, and was an important element in the rise in value of its bonds.</p>

The' way, and the only way by which such a result could have been accomplished, would have been to buy at a fixed price all the bonds that were offered on the market. This, in time, would give the bonds a fixed market value, when the purchaser could begin to sell and reimburse himself for his outlay. This course of dealing is known to every intelligent man at all conversant with the negotiation of municipal and other corporation bonds. It was the way Jay Cooke kept the Northern Pacific Railroad Bonds at par some years ago, when he was acting as the financial agent of the company, and it resulted in his financial bankruptcy. The load became too heavy to carry.

The evidence shows that the learned judge was probably over sanguine in his expectations upon this point. Be this as it may, I see nothing to interfere with the right-of the city to apply this money when and as it is received, to the payment of Street Bonds. The contract means, taking it as a whole, that the appellants are to furnish so much money, and no more, as may be necessary to retire said bonds. That was the subject matter about which the parties had been negotiating, and which culminated in the contract of May 14th, 1881. The amount inserted in the contract, $6,000,000 was the sum supposed to be necessary; and taking the whole amount of Street Bonds with the interest, and the probable receipts from the compromise referred to, would appear not far from accurate.
