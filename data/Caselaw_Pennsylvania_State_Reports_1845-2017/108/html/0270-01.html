In November, 1882, Mr. Marston agreed to sell a certain lot of ground in Montgomery County, and stated to the purchaser that the record was clear, but these two liens were certified upon the searches, and delayed the sale.

An attentive examination of the Act of 1791, has convinced us that it was not the intention of that Act to impose upon the plaintiff in a judgment the heavy penalty which it provides for a refusal or neglect to enter satisfaction without a previous request of the plaintiff himself. This penalty, for such it must be regarded, inasmuch as it is not necessary to prove that the plaintiff has suffered any actual damage (Henry <em>vs. </em>Sims, <a href="/whart/1/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Whart. 187" data-case-ids="1829070" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0187-01">1 Wh., 187</a>), may by the terms of the Act extend to one half of the debt or damages recovered. An Act imposing such a forfeiture is. not to be extended by construction. The Act requires the request to be made of the party, not of his attorney, and it was doubtless so intended, for it would be unreasonable to impose such a, penalty upon the party for the mere neglect or omission of his attorney, and without-any notice to himself. If it be objected that the plaintiff in the judgment may reside out of the jurisdiction the answer is obvious, that the request may-be made out of the jurisdiction as well as within it. If he can be served with a summons in an action, there can be no difficulty in making a request to him to satisfy the judgment as a preliminary step to the action. And this appeared to us to be, under the. Act of 1791, a necessary preliminary to the bringing of an action. Rule discharged.”</p>

The court erred, we think, in construing the Act to require a personal request to the party; a notice to the attorney of record, in all matters pertaining to the suit is notice to the party. The Act does not expressly provide that the request shall be personal to the party, and it seems to contemplate a request to either the party or Ms attorney, for it provides that if such person having received satisfaction.of his debt, “by Mmself <em>or Ms attorney </em>shall not within eighty days <em>after request </em>.....enter satisfaction as aforesaid, <em>he, she, or they </em>refusing or neglecting so do do, shall forfeit and pay,” &amp;c.</p>
