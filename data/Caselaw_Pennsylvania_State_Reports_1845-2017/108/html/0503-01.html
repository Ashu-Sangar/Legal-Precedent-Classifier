The sheriff levied upon the stock of goods and machinery in the defendant’s factory, and on October 29th, 1881, sold them at sheriff’s sale for $15,115, the purchaser being M. A. Furbush &amp; Son.

There is evidence that certain executions of the garnishees were in the hands of the sheriff’s deputy, who levied on goods in the factory of the defendant. Some of the witnesses say $5,000 of these goods were sold in one room in mass and without being divided into lots. If the sale was not conducted according to law; if the sale, especially of the lot in that one room, was so conducted as to disregard a subdivision into lots, it was invalid and void; that, however, would not afford the plaintiffs any right in this action, unless the jury also find that the goods were bought by the garnishees; if, however, the goods passed into the possession of the plaintiffs in the executions who are the present garnishees, then, in my opinion, if you find the facts I have stated, the plaintiffs here are entitled to a verdict in this case.” (Second and third assignments of error.)</p>

The sheriff exercised his discretion as to the manner of ’making the sale, which discretion could not be controlled by the execution creditor. Any one injured thereby, could move to set the sale aside before its final confirmation. After that it cannot be attacked except on the ground of fraud. A lumping sale may be irregular, but it is not fraudu<a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>lent <em>per se. </em>A void sale passes no title, but an irregular sale can only be questioned by those whose rights are coexistent with it. The law presumes that a public sale is made in good faith. This presumption stands unless overthrown by clear and satisfactory evidence of fraud.

Whilst the point itself could not be sustained, and was, therefore, properly refused, yet the statement as above set forth, and which was made part of the answer, was not, as we think, warranted by the facts of this case. The charge is in effect that the sale of a large quantity of goods in one lot or parcel is <em>prima facie </em>fraudulent and void. This is not the law; it has never been so ruled in this court. Such a sale may be evidence of fraud, but is not in itself fraudulent. As was said by Mr. Justice Mercur, in Barton <em>v. </em>Hunter, 5 Out., 411, “ The law presumes that a public sale is made in good faith. This presumption stands unless .overthrown by clear and satisfactory evidence of fraud or unfair means.” In the case in hand, we can see nothing in the manner of conducting the sale of Seybert’s goods which of itself tends to rebut this legal presumption of good faith. It <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>is a mistake to suppose that the case of Klopp <em>v. </em>Witmoyer, 7 Wr., 219, supports the court below.</p>
    <p id="b523-6" data-blocks='[["BL_523.6",523,[127,500,1188,433]]]'>In this case two separate parcels of lumber with a coal yard and its contents were sold as a single lot, and it was this kind of a sale that was pronormced <em>per se </em>fraudulent. But Mr. Justice’Strong, who delivered the opinion, says: “Within .certain limits, doubtless, the officer must exercise his own judg ment. He is not bound to sell in all cases by the single article. He may and often should sell in lots or parcels; what lots or parcels must be left to his honest judgment.” Fie also admits that cases may occur that would justify a sale by the aggregate of all the personal property seized in execution.</p>
    <p id="b523-7" data-blocks='[["BL_523.7",523,[133,933,1184,1337]]]'>If then, the sheriff is to exercise his own judgment in this matter, how can the honest exercise of that discretion be called in question when he does sell in lots or parcels ? So also, in the recent case of Yost <em>v. </em>Smith, Kline &amp; Co., [9 Out., 628.] we hekl that when the goods of a store were “divided into eight parcels and thus sold, the sale was good. The question was not the size of the lots, or whether of more or less value, but of the discretion of the officer so to sell them. In the case in hand, so far as we can gather, the goods were sold in two lots; in one was the machinery of the establishment, and in the other a quantity of shawls, some in cases, and others, perhaps samples, on the counters. Should these goods, the product of a large manufacturing establishment, in a commercial city like this, have been sold by the piece; auctioneered off day by day to the rabble which might happen to drop in ? Certainly not, for no better way could have been devised for the sacrifice of this property. That is certainly not the way in which similar transactions are conducted in the wholesale trade, and why should a sheriff or other officer adopt a different rule? He must sell in lots or parcels, and if so who is to be the judge of the size and value of such lots ? It is admitted in Klopp <em>v. </em>Witmoyer, that the circumstances may be such that a sale of all the goods seized in execution, in the aggregate, may be proper and advisable, but here, again, the sheriff must in the first instance judge of the propriety of such disposition of the property, and we think that it is only in a clear case that a court ought to be permitted to pronounce the exercise of a lawful discretion <em>per se </em>fraudulent. We are thus satisfied that the court was wrong in its instruction of the jury that, disconnected from other circumstances, a presumption of - fraud might be raised from the character of the sale itself.</p>
