De Silver, widow of Robert P. De Silver, together with interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum payable half yearly,.....then the above obligation to be void,” and although Emily B.De Silver is still alive — yet we contend that the tender of the full amount of principal and interest due on the bond, before suit brought, and its refusal, was a bar to this action for interest. The condition of the bond was for the protection of' the obligor, not the obligee. The obligor could not be compelled to pay the principal until Mrs. De Silver’s death, but he was not bound to await that event. .There is no <em>covenant </em>in the bond, or the mortgage, to pay interest, and no suit could be maintained against the obligor for interest alone. A fortiori there can be no action against Mrs. Dreer on an implied assumpsit for interest alone, for as between her and' the obligee there is neither privity of estate nor of contract. This is not like the case of a suit by A. against C. to recover money paid by B. to C. for the benefit of A. If any promise arises on the part of Mrs. Dreer by accepting the bequest, it is for the protection of the testator’s estate, and the action for breach must be by his executors. She cannot be liable to two actions, one by the executors, another by a stranger, for the same thing, at the same time: Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, <a href="/watts/6/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts 182" data-case-ids="1846089" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0182-01">6 Watts 182</a>; Kountz <em>v. </em>Holthouse, 4 Nor. 235; Guthrie <em>v. </em>Kerr, 4 Nor. 303; Wynn <em>v. </em>Wood, 1 Out. 216; Torrens <em>v. </em>Campbell, 24 P. F. S. 470. Nor does this case come within the principle of Etter <em>v. </em>Greenawalt, 2 Out. 422, and prior similar cases, that where a testator’s direction to a devisee to pay a sum to a third party is the <em>consideration </em>of the devise, a personal liability attaches to the devisee accepting the devise. The devise to Mrs. Dreer in this case is absolute, not on condition or in consideration of her paying anything; the provisions of the will as to the application of the money being simply directory. If she did not apply it as testator directed, and the estate suffered, the estate might hold her, but not the parties to whom she was directed to pay it. The language of the will is: “ She supporting and maintaining our unmarried daughters until their marriage, and also paying thereout the interest on the incumbrances on my real estate, and the principal of the incumbrances, i-f there be surplus income unexpended.” Did the testator mean to subject his wife to a suit by any incumbrancer in the event of the latter claiming that the “ surplus income unexpended ” received by her was sufficient to pay him .his interest or his principal? How much <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>ought to have been expended by her for her out of her provision for her daughters’ support? Was this a bequest to the incumbrancer of the interest as it accrued? This bequest was very different from a charge of the interest on the land devised, in favor of the incumbrancer.</p>
