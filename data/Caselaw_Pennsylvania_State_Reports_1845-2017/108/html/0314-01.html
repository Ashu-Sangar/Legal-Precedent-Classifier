Joseph Peace died in 1845, and Edward Peace, the surviving trustee, died September 10th, 1879, and on March 13th, 1880, Samuel C. Perkins was appointed by the court substituted trustee under the said marriage settlement, and entered security, as required, in the sum of $20,'000. Neither of the former trustees had ever filed an account, but in 1882 the account of Edward Peace, as trustee, was filed by his exdcutors, and was referred to an Auditor. At this audit Mr. Perkins took an active part in the investigation of the account, which was a voluminous one, extending from 1838 to 1879, a period of forty years; the Auditor of that account stating in his report that the services rendered by Mr. Perkins as succeeding trustee involved on his part “a degree and. character of skill and attention such as would ordinarily have been performed by a professional adviser, as being over and beyond the duties strictly pertaining to the office of a trustee.”</p>

He has held the fund for about a year, without any other labor than collecting the income, on which also he is allowed five per ce.nt. in addition (about $225). At the distribution he will put the securities in a broker’s hands for sale, pay Mm a commission for the <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>sale, and in a day ox two receive Iris check for the proceeds, pay the collateral inheritance tax, and remit the residue.to the distributees. For such services he would be well paid at two per cent. As to his services at the first audit (about ten meetings, most of them spent in vouching the income account), he might have had counsel, had he chosen, and the latter would have been well paid by $250. The trustee was his own counsel at the audit, and no objection is made to his adding such a counsel fee to his commission, which would give him about three per cent, in all. He charged about seven, and the court reduced him to five. At the first audit he appeared in a dual capacity — as attorney for the life-tenant and also as succeeding trustee. Two thirds of his services there were rendered in the former capacity. It is rather hard that they should be paid out of the fund.</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[201,1039,1178,687]]]'>It has been held that where a trustee asks more than five per cent, he must show affirmatively that he is entitled to it, which this trustee has not shown. It would require very extraordinary services, of great difficulty and responsibility, to warrant a charge of over five per cent, in an estate. Of late years, through the conveniences for transacting business, commissions have been much lower than forty years ago. Trust companies now administer trusts at about one half of the rates formerly charged, and even their commissions have been reduced by this court. In Montgomery’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/86/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="86 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1056604" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0230-01">86 Pa. St., 230</a>, but $500 was allowed on $41,000. Even the five per cent, allowed in the court below is excessively high; much-more than the court would have allowed had the evidence been before them, but no exception was taken by the appellees, as they were desirous of a speedy distribution without further litigation.</p>

To the first, it was objected that the professional services in question were rendered not for the benefit of the trust estate, but in the special interest of the beneficiary for life; and, to the second, that the charge was excessive. Both of these exceptions were fully considered by the -learned Auditor and by lrim overruled. As to the first, the substance of his finding was that the professional services, rendered by appellant before his appointment as trustee, were for the benefit of the trust estate, and in the interest of ex-<a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>ceptants and others entitled to the <em>corpus </em>thereof. This satis? factorily disposed of the only allegation of fact on which that exception is based. As to the second exception, the learned Auditor found, from the testimony before him, that in view of the services, of a strictly professional character, rendered by appellant, in connection with his duties and responsibilities as trustee, the compensation claimed by him was just and reasonable ; and this conclusion of fact appears to have been warranted by the evidence. • For the purpose of showing the character and extent of the special services rendered by appellant, the account of Ms predecessor in the trust, and report of the Auditor to whom it was referred, were given in evidence. From these it appeared that the account, exhibiting the administration of the trust for the period of forty years, was necessarily very voluminous; and, of course, a proper examination of the same required considerable time as well as professional skill and judgment. It was the duty of appellant as successor of the deceased trustee to cause a thorough examination of the account to be made. Instead of employing counsel for that purpose, as might have been done, he gave Ms personal attention to the matter. The learned Auditor, to whom that account was referred, says in Ms report thereon: •“ The accounts of both principal and interest were very thoroughly examined with the vouchers, receipts and other evidences of the transactions, both by the Auditor and the succeeding trustee (Mr. Perkins), involving, on the part of the latter, a degree and character of skill and attention such as would ordinarily have been performed by a. professional adviser, as being over and beyond the duties strictly pertaining to the office of a trustee.”</p>

F. S., 230. WMle in practice it is usually claimed ■and awarded in the form of a'commission, the rate is not determinable by any established rule. It must be graduated .according to the responsibility incurred, the amount of the estate, the nature and extent of the services necessarily performed : Harland’s Appeal, <a href="/rawle/5/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1824629" data-case-paths="/rawle/5/0323-01">5 Rawle, 323</a>, 330. In that case, CMef Justice Gibson says, compensation “maybe awarded even m a gross sum, according to a common practice in the country, wMch. I take to be the preferable one, as it necessarily leads to an examination of the nature, items and actual extent of the services, which the adoption of a rate <em>per centum </em>has a tendency to le.ave out of view.” It cannot be doubted that for services of an extraordinary character, rendered by a trustee, he is entitled to extra compensation beyond the usual <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>allowance for receiving and disbursing trust funds. If professional services, necessary to tbe proper administration of tbe trust, have been rendered by a trustee in person, lie is clearly entitled to such reasonable compensation as he would have paid had he been obliged to employ counsel.

He took into consideration the professional as well a's the ordinary services of the trustee; and, in connection therewith, he very properly took into consideration the necessity of yet converting into money, for the purpose of distribution, the securities which represent the <em>corpus </em>of the estate. These securities, consisting of shares in eight or ten different corporations, valued at about $25,000,‘ came into his hands from his predecessor in the trust. It will doubtless be necessary for the trastee to sell these stocks, and distribute the proceeds among the twenty or more parties in interest.</p>
