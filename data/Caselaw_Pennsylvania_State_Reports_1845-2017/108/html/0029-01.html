The testimony shows that prior to August, 1872, the plaintiff had the reputation of being a shrewd business man, was made the custodian of the savings and acted as the business adviser'for many of his neighbors; that the violent and unexpected death of his son at this time was a great shock to him. Upon this point some of the plaintiff’s witnesses testify to what seems to them strange remarks and peculiar conduct upon.the part of the plaintiff during the “wake” preceding the burial of his son’s body and immediately succeeding the time of his loss. These, facts,'wlién considered under the circumstances in which they took place, are, in our opinion, more indicative of the grief and excitement attendant upon the loss he had sustained than of mental weakness or permanent impairment of mental capacity; but time, the great assuager of grief, seems to have relieved the plaintiff from the excitement .immediately attendant upon the event, for shortly afterwards we have the testimony of Mr. Doloughty, showing knowledge and capacity to attend to matters of business in the making of the contracts for a monument to be erected over his son’s grave, and in September, 1873, taking charge of a complicated partnership settlement then pending before a board of arbitrators, in which his son had been one of the partners, and which continued for over two years; that he was during this .time au acceptable <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>indorser of notes for different parties, and, in fact, was attending to business in about tbe same manner that he had prior to his son’s death. Covering the time from the death of the son to and including the date of the conveyance, we have the testimony of John J. Mitchel, Esq., a member of the bar of Allegheny county for almost forty years, of high standing and reputation in the community and among the profession, who had known the plaintiff for thirty years, was a member of the same church, and was at this time acting as attorney-for the plaintiff before the arbitrators in the partnership matters above referred to, and who was employed by the plaintiff to prepare the deed of March 21st, 1871. Mr. Mitchel states: “ At the time Mr. Kelly (plaintiff) made those first deeds in March, 1874, the question of Mr. Kelly’s sanity never presented itself to my mind. I had no reason whatever to entertain a doubt upon the subject......I certainly considered he was then of sound mind.” The long personal acquaintance of Mr. Mitchel with the plaintiff, his professional experience and training, with his immediate association with the plaintiff on professional business, entitles his opinion and testimony to great weight; and being corroborated, as it is, by the facts stated, we are of the opinion that the plaintiff has not sustained the allegation of mental incapacity at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed of March 21st, 1874, as alleged in the amended bill.</p>

If you make a deed of all your property to your nephew, you will place yourself absolutely in his power. . . . We had considerable conversation on the subject, in which I» raised all the objections I could.” After this consultation with his counsel the plaintiff left the office, but returned either the same or the next daj-, bringing with him the several deeds for his real estate, and gave instructions for the preparation of the deed of March 21st, 1874. A day or two was consumed in preparing the deed, during which the plaintiff called several times at tile office to make inquir}- as to the progress being made. After its preparation and before execution, it was submitted to the plaintiff, who upon examination found it to contain a piece of property which he had previously sold, and this was made the subject of consultation with his counsel.

As the trusted agent and bosom friend of his old uncle, he should not have accepted such deeds with a <em>verbal understanding </em>such as he states, leaving his old uncle penniless and helpless in case of his own death, or with the power to cheat the other heirs in case of his uncle’s death.

It is probable that a chancellor, were he called upon to compel the execution, by assignments or conveyances, of an unexecuted contract like that embraced in the papers above mentioned, would hesitate so to do. On the ground of inadequacy of consideration he might interfere to protect one who had improvidently agreed to divest himself of all his property on a mere oral promise of maintenance. But it is otherwise with an executed contract; inadequacy of consideration alone will not induce a chancellor to rescind such contract: Graham <em>v. </em>Pancoast, 6 Cas. 89; Aiman v.

As to the case in hearing, the court below agrees with the Auditor, that there was neither such mental incapacity, on part of the grantor, as would of itself avoid his deed, neither was there evidence of actual fraud on part of the grantee. But the case is put on the ground of constructive fraud, and Judge Story is quoted as saying that equity will grant relief in cases where a confidence has been reposed and that confidence has been abused.

Ward, ‘ that all the lawyers in town would not have made him deviate from what he intended to do,’ show this transfer to have been the deliberate act of the plaintiff, when in the full possession of his faculties, after consultation with able and disinterested counsel of his own selection, who fully informed him of the consequences of his act, and cautioned him against it, and done after time for deliberation, after having been advised of the consequences of the proposed act.” Then there is, second, in this statement of the court, the further assumption that Kelly gave away his large estate without reserving one dollar to himself, or providing for his support in his old age. The Master, on the other hand, finds, that at the time of the transfer of the 21st of March, 1874, there was a verbal agreement between the parties by which the defendant undertook to provide for. the wants of the plaintiff during his life, including the use and occupancy of the lio use on Ross street, and also to convey, after the plaintiff’s death, a portion of the real estate to certain persons then and there agreed upon. Here certainly was a good and legal consideration, notwithstanding the court's assumption to the contraiy, and one that was executed to the letter. For. though the latter part of this parol agreement might not be enforceable under the statute of frauds and perjuries, yet this defect was cured by the execution of the deed of trust of November 10th, 1874. What remains simply goes to fortify the conclusion of the Auditor.</p>

The two deeds, of November 10th, 1874, <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>embracing the same property as that conveyed by the deed of the 21st of March, 1874; and the declaration of trust, as above stated, appear to have been drawn and executed at the instance and dictation of the plaintiff without any previous consultation with his nephew. So, when we come to the paper of the 18th of April, 1876, b}r which the defendant assigns to his uncle the rents of all the property which had been conveyed to him, we see in it a disposition on part of the nephew to submit to whatever his uncle required of him.</p>

There could be now no secret and undue influence of the nephew over his uncle ; the parties were at arms length ; Edward Kelly, Sr., was now married, and his wife may be presumed to have had some common sense even though her husband had not. He had the counsel and advice of three able lawyers; the compromise was most carefully considered, deliberately executed and delivered, and he took and has since retained the possession of the property conveyed to him by it. Nevertheless, the court below, in commenting on this part of the case, says: “ In view of these facts it is almost impossible to doubt that the plaintiff was induced to sign the compromise by fraud and imposition.” But in view of what facts, or by whose fraud and imposition ? That the property he received by the compromise was not worth nearly so much as that retained by the defendant? That the counsel employed by him did not bring suit, but rather preferred a compromise ? That their fees were excessive, and that his friend and agent, Capt. Ward, urged him too strongly to sign the agreement? But in this connection a few things, evidently' overlooked by the court, are to be remembered: (1) That the fee to the entire property was lawfully in the defendant, and that what he re-conveyecl to his uncle was <em>ex gratia, </em>and not of any legal compulsion. (2) That as the facts of the case did not warrant the bringing of a suit, his counsel were wise in preferring a compromise. And (3) On the day after the evening on which Capt. Ward brought the compromise agreement to him for his signature, he carefully re-examined this paper with his three attorneys, and, acting under their counsel and advice, approved of it, and agreed to its subse<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>quent delivery. But it may be pertinently asked: What bad the defendant to do with all this ?</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[161,475,1163,434]]]'>If the plaintiff’s friends and counsellors imposed upon and defrauded him, a conclusion which neither the character of these gentlemen nor the testimony warrants, how can the defendant be compromised thereby? He can no longer be charged with the guardianship of his uncle, or made responsible for his uncle’s improvidence. In this compromise he acts for himself alone, and if by it he has got the better of the bargain, he has it by no unfair or unlawful means, hence, the plaintiff, or rather those who now represent his estate, have no equitable ground of complaint.</p>
