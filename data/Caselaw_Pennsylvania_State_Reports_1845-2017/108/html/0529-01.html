It was there held that broad as is the authority of the master of a vessel, it does not extend to signing bills of lading for goods not put on board, and.that all persons are bound to take notice that such is the rule. Grant <em>v. </em>Norway is followed in England and by the Supreme Court of the United States (see The Schooner Freeman <em>v. </em>Buckingham, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Howard%20191" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="18 Howard 191">18 Howard, 191</a>), and the principle applies for a stronger reason to the shipping clerk of a railway, whose powers are obviously not so large as those of the captain of a ship (Coleman <em>v. </em>Riches, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20C.B.%20104" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="16 C.B. 104">16 C.

In Hubbersty <em>v. </em>Ward (8 Excheq., 330) the Court went still further by a decision, that when the master has once signed a bill of lading for goods that have actully been shipped Iris power is exhausted, and he cannot charge the owner by signing a second bill for the same goods.</p>

If the master of a vessel could render the owner answerable to the full extent of any goods, however rare or costly, that the hold could contain, a prudent man would hardly send a ship to sea without accompanying her as supercargo and limiting the authority 'of the captain to the navigation from port to port.

The decision is irreconcilable with the <em>ratio decidendi </em>in Freeman <em>v. </em>Buckingham, although the court essayed to distinguish the case on the ground that the goods were by the terms of the bill of lading deliverable to the order of the consignee and not to the consignor’s.

It has indeed been said of late years that the rules laid, down in the state courts for commercial transactions, by such names as Kent, Walworth, Tilg-hman, and Gibson, though acquiesced in for half a century by the mercantile community, and sanctioned by the general assent which gives usage the force o'f law, may be disregarded by the courts of the United States, if they are not, in the opinion of those courts, consistent with the commercial law, which should theoretically be the same throughout the civilized world, but is in fact different on either side of the English Channel, and even in capitals which, like London and Edinburgh, obey the same Parliament. (See Swift <em>v. </em>Tyson, 16 Peters, 1; Carpenter <em>v. </em>The Providence Insurance Company, Id., 495; Watson <em>v. </em>Tarpley, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Howard%20517" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="18 Howard 517">18 Howard, 517</a>; Oates <em>v. </em>The National Bank, 10 Otto, 245.) Tins view is attended with consequences that are peculiar, and have not perhaps been sufficiently observed. The United States are not forbidden to impair the obligation of contracts, and there is consequently nothing to preclude the Federal tribunals from invalidating an agreement that has been entered into on the faith of the principles enunciated in one judicial decision, by another which discloses the error of its predecessor, or. comes nearer to absolute truth. It has accordingly been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that, while the United States has no power to regulate the internal commerce of the several states, and such an attempt by the legislature or the Executive would be unconstitutional, the Judiciary of the United States may interpret the commercial law of a state as they deem expedient, even when the effect is to annul contracts based upon the prior decisions of the state courts, and growing out of instruments which, like a policy of insurance, are not ordinarily regarded as commercial. (Swift <em>v. </em>Tyson, 16 Peters, Í; Carpenter <em>v. </em>The Providence Insur<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>anee Company, Id., 495; Watson <em>v. </em>Tarpley, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Howard%20517" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="18 Howard 517">18 Howard, 517</a>; Oates <em>v. </em>The National Bank, 10 Otto, 245.) But the same august tribunal has decided that the state courts are under like circumstances bound by their prior judgments, as it -regards intervening contracts, and cannot constitutionally rectify an error however manifest, at the expense of a plaintiff or defendant who has taken it for truth. (See Gelpcke <em>v. </em>Dubuque, 1 Wallace, 175; Olcott.v. The Supervisors, 16 Id., 678; Louisiana <em>v. </em>Pilsbury, 15 Otto, 278, 292.) Nothing is better established in the Court of Chancery or at common law than that taking land or chattels as a collateral <em>security </em>for a preexisting debt, does not render the creditor a purchaser for value in the absence of an express or implied agreement for forbearance, although time is actually given in reliance on the means of payment so obtained. (Petrie <em>v. </em>Clark, 11 S. &amp; R., 371; Dickerson <em>v. </em>Tillinghast, 4 Paige, 215; Garrard <em>v. </em>The Railroad Company, 5 Casey, 154; Ashton’s Appeal, 23 P. F.

Such also is the long-established rule of the law merchant, as interpreted in Pennsylvania and New York, in accordance with the earlier English precedents (Bay <em>v. </em>Coddington, 5 Johnson, Ch. 54), and when the question was considered in Goodman <em>v. </em>Simonds (<a href="/citations/?q=20%20Howard%20343" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="20 Howard 343">20 Howard, 343</a>, 371) it was treated as open to discussion and one where the usage of each locality might be followed consistently with principle. Yet in the recent case of Oates <em>v. </em>The National Bank (10 Otto, 245), the court' went out of its way to intimate that in determining whether such a transfer will free a promissory note from antecedent equities, they will not be guided by the law of the state where the instrument is made or negotiated.</p>

(16 Peters, 495), the effect was to impair an obligation, which agreeably to the New York and Massachusetts cases would have been valid. The suit was brought on a policy of insurance which seems to have been executed in Rhode Island, and might not, therefore, be governed by the law of New York, where the premises were situated, and the policy had been signed with the consent of the insurers for the protection of a mortgage; but the court took the broad ground that while the decisions of the state courts are entitled to respect, they are not authoritative and will not control the judgments of the Federal courts, even as it regards intervening contracts which have presumably been based on the rule as defined'by the state judiciary.</p>

Such a relation between tribunals sitting in the same territory, and professedly administering the same principles, is anomalous, and so far as I am aware unparalelled in the history of jurisprudence; but a subordinate tribunal must accept the law as it is written with-. out considering the consequences too deeply. Conceding therefore that the shipping clerk, whose misconduct gave rise to the present controversy, could not have given a valid bill of lading under the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of The Schooner Freeman <em>v. </em>Buckingham, the courts of Pennsylvania are, notwithstanding, bound by the decisions of the same court not to follow that rule, and must, on the contrary, look to the precedents in New York for their guide. If, therefore, Weiss was such an agent as the -case of Armour <em>v. </em>The Michigan Railroad Company contemplates, he must be so regarded for the purposes of this suit, and we cannot render judgment for the defendant without impairing the obligation of a contract which was presumably founded on the <em>lex loci </em>contractus, as declared authoritatively by the commission which, for the time being, constituted a court of last resort in New York.</p>

If he was clothed with a general power to issue bills of lading, and determine when the circumstances required its exercise, the railway company are bound by his signature to the instrument in suit, while no such conclusion can be reached if his powers were confined within narrower limits, and manifestly exceeded in what he did’. (Brady <em>v. </em>Tod, 9 C. B. N. S., 592.) The term general agent is used in two different senses, which are yet in legal effect much the same; in one of them it denotes a person who, like the manager of a bank or superintendent of a joint stock manufacturing company, has charge of the entire business of his principals, and may bind them by any agreement within its scope, but it is also applicable to one who, though retained for a specific purpose, has yet a general authority relatively to that purpose, as for instance, to issue certificates of stock and determine, when the occasion requires that such an issue shall be made. (Dingle <em>v. </em>Hare, 7 C. B. N. S., 145.) It is immaterial that the powers of such an agent are subject to limitations, and ought not to be exercised save in a certain state of things, if the limitations are known only to his principal, or the agent is to determine when the condition is fulfilled. (Edmunds <em>v. </em>Bushell, L. R. 1 Q. B., 97.) In conducting the inquiry the court may consider not only what powers were actually conferred, and what were the intentions of the principal, but the impression which his conduct and language were calculated to convey to third persons, and one who is held forth as a general agent may act as such whether it be or be not his true character. The question is, nevertheless, primarily one of facts and circumstances, and until these are ascertained it is not possible to draw legal inferences.</p>

It is there stated that Weiss was the shipping agent of the railroad with authority to issue bills of lading. Were this all, we should presumably be obliged to hold, conformably to Armour <em>v. </em>The Railroad, that he was a general agent, and might bind his principal by an admission that goods had been received, contrary to the fact; but we also learn, that while ‘the said P. J. Weiss, the shipping clerk of the defendant, was duly authorized to issue- bills of lading for goods actually received, he had no authority whatever to issue the same without receiving goods therein mentioned,’ and the case stated adds, ‘ nor had the defendant ever done or said anything to lead any one to suppose that they had authorized the said Weiss to issue bills of lading without receiving the goods therein mentioned.’ This is the marrow of the controversy, and so far as I can dis<a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>cern makes an end of the plaintiff’s case. One who has no real or apparent authority save in a contingency that has not occurred, may bind himself, but cannot enter into any engagement that will be obligatory on the person whom he represents. Every one who deals Avith an agent must verify his powers or take the risk; and it is not until the act in question is shown to be within their real or apparent scope that it is incumbent on the principal to show why he could not be bound: (Brady <em>v. </em>Todd, 9 C. B. N. S., 592.) Such is the rule laid down by Mr. Justice Curtis, in the ease already cited of The Schooner Freeman <em>v. </em>Buckingham, and the difference between his judgment and that rendered in Armour <em>v. </em>The Michigan Railroad Company, was not owing to the denial of a generally recognized principle, nor because it is at all doubtful lhat the delivery of the goods is a condition precedent to the execution of a bill of lading, but because the New York Court held that a shipping clerk has such an appearance of authority as will justify third persons in taking for granted that the condition was fulfilled. By an apparent authority I understand that which, whether it exists or not, may be justly inferred from the acts or language of the principal. No man can properly be held answerable save for what he says or does, and if a different rule prevailed in the case of agency it would be imprudent to employ an agent. When, therefore, it is stated as part of the plaintiff’s case, not only that Weiss had no authority to issue bills of lading Avithout receiving the goods, but that the railroad company never did or said anything to lead any one to suppose that such an authority had been conferred, we cannot avoid the inference that he had neither a real nor apparent authority to issue the bill of lading which is the foundation of the present suit.</p>

Defendant is a common. carrier corporation, and, at one of its stations in the state of New York, had in its employ P. J. Weiss as shipping clerk, duly authorized to issue bills of lading for goods delivered to the company for shipment over its line. Plaintiffs, as commission merchants in Philadelphia, received over, defendant’s road, from F. <em>Q. </em>Williams, of Batavia, New York, several consignments of- barley, on which, from time to time, they made advances, by accepting and paying drafts drawn on them by the consignor and attached to the bills of lading signed by Weiss for and on behalf of defendant. All the bills of lading except one represented actual consignments of barley; but that one was fictitious, having been fraudulently issued by Weiss and delivered to Williams for a carload of barley never delivered to defendant nor shipped to plaintiffs. These facts were of course <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>well known to both Weiss and Williams, who conspired to commit the fraud of which plaintiffs were wholly ignorant. Williams made a draft on plaintiffs and attached it to the. fraudulent bill of lading. The draft was duly presented, and, on the faith of the bill of lading, was paid by plaintiffs; but of course the pretended carload of barley never arrived. Plaintiffs, who thus became the innocent victims of the fraud to the extent of several hundred dollars, claim that defendant, through whose shipping agent they were defrauded, should make good the loss.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[247,833,1176,300]]]'>The claim appears to be both reasonable and just; and, notwithstanding the authorities cited in support of the opposite view, we are satisfied it is so. Under the circumstances cited in the case stated defendant is estopped from denying what its accredited shipping agent asserted in the bill of lading by. which plaintiffs, without any fault on their part, were misled to their injury.</p>
    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.6",560,[246,1133,1167,1281]],["BL_561.1",561,[148,412,1169,1159]]]'>A question has been raised as do whether, upon the facts presented, the law of this state or that of New York should govern in determining defendant’s liability. We are not prepared to admit there is any material difference between the laws of the two states, applicable to the case; but if there is we think it very clear that the law of New York must control, for the reason that the transaction took place in that state. It is well settled that whatever concerns the rights of parties, especially in matters of contract, is governed by the <em>lex loci </em>contractus, while the remedy, including whatever relates to the limitation of actions, etc., must be determined by the <em>lex fori: </em>4 Minor’s Inst., pp. 509, 740; Bulger <em>v. </em>Roche, <a href="/mass/28/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="28 Mass. 36" data-case-ids="2016155" data-case-paths="/mass/28/0036-01">28 Mass., 36</a>. It is said in the last case, “ the authorities both from the civil and the common law concur in fixing the rule that the nature, validity and construction of contracts are to be determined by the law of the place where the contract is made; and all remedies for enforcing such contracts are regulated by the law of the place where such remedies are pursued.” Applying that as the correct principle, the present case is virtually ruled by Armour et al. <em>v. </em>The Michigan Central Railroad Co., <a href="/ny/65/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="65 N.Y. 111" data-case-ids="1952925" data-case-paths="/ny/65/0111-01">65 N. Y., 111</a>. The facts of that case, as stated in the opinión of the court, are not distinguishable in principle from those of the case before us.. Defendant company’s shipping clerk knowing it had not received from or on account of Michaels- any lard whatever, issued and delivered to him certain bills of lading which were attached by Michaels to his drafts on plaintiffs, who “ upon the faith that defendant had received and would transport to the places specified in the respective bills, the lard therein described to be in its possession, paid the sums specified in the respective drafts at the time and <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>in the order in which they were presented; and thus the question comes up whether the defendant is not estopped from setting up as a defence to this action that its statements, known by its agent at the time of making them to be untrue, were in fact false, and that no lard whatever was recieved by the railroad company for or on account of' Michaels. The true answer to this question is not involved in doubt. The well recognized principle that a party who, by his admissions, has induced a third party to act in a particular manner is not permitted to deny the truth of his admission, if the consequence would be to work an injury to. such third party, applies to and governs this case.” Again, in another portion of the opinion, it is said, “ Street, having power to issue bills direct to consignees for goods actually in the possession of defendant, and the present bills being in no way distinguishable in form from those which were usually employed, he must, as to the plaintiffs acting in good faith, be considered 'as having the necessary authority......The representations in the bills were made to any one who, in the course of business, might think fit to -make advances on the faith of them. There is thus present every element necessary to constitute a case of estoppel <em>in </em>pais, a representation made withfthe knowledge that it might be acted on, and. subsequent action upon the faith of it to such an extent that it would injure the plaintiffs if the representation was not made good.” The language thus employed in that case may very appropriately be applied to the present one.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[147,1572,1173,728]]]'>The same principle is recognized in Coventry, Sheppard &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>The Great Eastern Railway Company, 11 Law Rep., Q. B. Div., 776, the facts of which were briefly these: The railroad company received a consignment of wheat and issued therefor a delivery order which came into the hands of B., who obtained advances thereon from plaintiffs. Shortly afterwards the company issued a second delivery order in respect of the same consignment of wheat. The two orders were different, and such as might be reasonably supposed to relate to distinct consignments. On the second order B.. obtained further advances from plaintiffs, who were under the belief that the delivery orders related to distinct consignments. B. having after-wards become insolvent, it was held that the company was estopped by the negligence of its agent from showing- that the two delivery orders related only to one consignment, and that it was liable to compensate plaintiffs for the loss sustained by them through their advances to B.</p>
    <p id="b561-6" data-blocks='[["BL_561.6",561,[149,2300,1171,130]],["BL_562.1",562,[276,411,1174,1446]]]'>It is contended that inasmuch as no authority, real or apparent, to issue bills of lading without receiving the goods mention ed therein, had actually been given by the railroad com<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>pany to Weiss, it was not in any manner responsible for his unauthorized act, even as to innocent third parties, who were misled and injured thereby. We cannot assent to this proposition. As between principal and third parties, the true limit of the agent’s authority to bind the former is the apparent authority with which the agent is invested; but, as between the principal and the agent, the true limit is the express authority or instruction given to the agent: Evan’s Agency, 594, 606; Adams Express Co. <em>v. </em>Schlessinger, 25 P. F. Smith, 246. The principal is bound by all the acts of his agent within the scope of the authority which he held him out to the world to possess, notwithstanding the agent acted contrary to instructions; and this is especially the case with officers and agents of corporations. Since a corporation acts only through agents it is bound by its agent’s contracts when made ostensibly within the range of their office. One who authorizes another to act for him in a certain class of contracts undertakes for the absence of fraud in the agent acting within the scope of his authority: Whart. Cont., Sec. 96, 130, 269. The authority of an agent to act for and bind his principal will be implied from the accustomed performance by the agent of acts of the same general character for the principal with his knowledge and consent: Evans’ Agency, 193, note. These elementary principles are founded on the doctrine that where one of two persons must suffer by the act of a third person, he who has held that person out as worthy of trust and confidence, and as having authority in that matter, should be bound by it: Evans’ Agency, 591. It is conceded in this case that the company did not authorize the issuance of bills of lading without receipt of the goods, but it put Weiss in its place to do that class of acts, and it should be answerable for the manner in which he conducted himself within the range of his agency. Public policy, as well as the ultimate good of corporations themselves, requires that this should be the rule.</p>
