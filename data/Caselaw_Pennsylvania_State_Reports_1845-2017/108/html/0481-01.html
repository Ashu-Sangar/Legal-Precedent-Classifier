Whenever it appears from the contract between parties that the owner of personal property has transferred the possession thereof to another, reserving to himself the naked title, solely for the purpose of securing to himself the payment of the price agreed between them, the contract is necessarily a conditional sale and not a bailment; and while good between the parties, is worthless as to creditors and bona fide purchasers from the transferee without notice.

An agreement between A., the owner of certain looms, and B., recited that A. “has agreed to sell” eighteen looms to B. “for the price or sum of $2,100, to be paid in four equal instalments of $525, with interest.” The agreement then provided for the immediate delivery of the looms to B. “ for use by him in his said business,” and that upon payment of each instalment a bill of sale for a certain number of them ■ should be executed; and further that the looms should remain the property of A. until paid for. B. covenanted to insure them in A.’s name, and not to remove them from his (B.’s) premises without A.’s consent. Upon B.’s failure to keep any covenant A. had the right to re-take possession of the looms then unpaid for. Under this contract B. held and operated the looms until they were levied on by the sheriff under an execution against him. A. then claimed property in them and on a feigned issue under the Sheriff’s Interpleader Act, the court charged the jury that under the contract there was a conditional sale — not a bailment — of the looms to B., which rendered them subject to the claims of his creditors, and that the verdict must be for the defendants.</p>

Charles Andrews, the defendant in the writ. The property thus levied on having been claimed by John Forrest, this feigned issue, under the Sheriff’s Inter-pleader Act, was directed to determine whether, as against the execution creditors, Nelson Bro’s. &amp; Co., the property belonged to the claimant or not. The burden of proving title in himself, at the date of the levy, was of course on Forrest, the plaintiff in the issue. He undertook to do this by showing that, as admitted owner of the looms in question, he entered into a written contract with Andrews on January 27th, 1880, whereby the latter obtained possession of the looms on the terms and conditions therein specified, and continued to so hold them until they were levied on by the sheriff as his property. The contract was given in evidence and speaks for itself.</p>

It is merely a question of law upon <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>the construction of that agreement.

' Under this view your verdict should be for the defendants.” This instruction is the subject of complaint in the second specification of error; but the very learned and able argument of plaintiff’s counsel has failed to convince us either that the case did not properly resolve itself into a pure question of law, or that the question was not rightly decided.</p>

If the agreement, properly construed, constituted a bailment, the title to the property levied on never passed to the defendant in the execution. On the other hand, if it is a conditional sale, the plaintiff had no title which he could successfully assert as against execution creditors of his vendee. A present sale and delivery of personal property to the vendee, coupled with an agreement that the title shall not vest in the latter unless he pays the price agreed upon at the time appointed therefor, and that in default of such payment the vendor may resume possession of the property, is quite different in its effect from a bailment for use, or, as it is sometimes called, a lease of the property, coupled with an agreement whereby the lessee may subsequently become owner of the property upon payment of a price agreed upon. As between the parties to such contracts, both are valid and binding; but, as to creditors, the latter is good, while the former is invalid. In some cases the line of demarcation between a conditional sale and a bailment is not very clearly drawn ; but, in the case at bar we think the controlling features of the agreement are those of a sale. It recites that Forrest, the plaintiff, “ has agreed to sell ” eighteen weaving looms to Andrews “for the price or sum of $2,100, to be paid in four equal instalments or payments of $525 each, with interest: the first to be made on the 80th day of April, 1880; the second on the 31st day of July, 1880; the third on the 27th day of October, 1880, and the fourth and last on the 27th day of January, 1881.” It also provides for immediate delivery of the looms to Andrews, “ for use by him in his said business,” and that, upon payment of each instalment, a bill of sale for so many of the looms as shall be equal to the amount thereof shall be executed and delivered to Andrews; that the “ looms and every of them shall be and remain the property of the party of the first part (Forrest) until paid for by the prompt payment of the quarterly instalments as aforesaid.” <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>Andrews covenanted to insure the looms in Forrest’s name; to not remove them without his consent; to punctually pay the quarterly instalments, and, in default thereof, to return the looms that were not paid for. It further provides that, in the event of Andrews failing or neglecting to keep and perform all and every his covenants and agreements, it shall be lawful for Forrest to take possession of the looms then remaining unpaid for.</p>
    <p id="b503-6" data-blocks='[["BL_503.6",503,[177,746,1179,261]]]'>It thus appears that the contract possesses all the features of a conditional sale, — a sale of the looms on a credit of three, six, nine and twelve months, coupled with provisions for the purpose of enabling the seller to enforce payment of the price agreed upon, and, failing in that, to resume possession of the property.</p>

Carpenter having received the furniture under this agreement afterwards sold it to Stadtfeld, an innocent purchaser without notice.

F. S., 27, and Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, 29 Id., 488, both of which are on the border, the doctrine of bailment was carried to its extreme limit. Upon the facts peculiar to those cases respectively, they were doubtless decided correctly, but any further advance in the same direction would be unwarranted.</p>
    <p id="b504-7" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[266,1045,1178,429]]]'>In Edwards <em>v. </em>Stranghellan, 9 Out., 103, Ward obtained possession of the hotel furniture by virtue of the lease, and as is there said, “ the subsequent provision for a sale could not alter the character of that possession or change the nature of the contract resulting from it. His possession, being originally under tire lease, determined the character of the transaction and fixed it, in the outstart, as a bailment; and, as he never complied with the conditions of the contract, under which alone he could have acquired title, the matter remained throughout as it began, a bailment.”</p>
    <p id="b504-8" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[266,1474,1177,777]]]'>The principles, underlying bailments and conditional sales, and by which every such agreement must be tested, in determining to which class it belongs, are so fully and clearly stated in the case last cited that repetition is unnecessary. Whenever it appears, from the contract between the parties, that the owner of personal property has transferred the possession thereof to another, reserving to himself the naked title thereof, solely for the purpose of securing payment of the price agreed upon between them, the contract is necessarily a conditional sale, and not a bailment; and while it is perfectly good as between the parties themselves, it is worthless as to creditors and <em>Iona fide </em>purchasers from the transferee without notice. If the contract is verbal, it is, of course, the exclusive province of the jury to inquire, and ascertain what the parties meant; if it is in writing, its construction is for the court. Properly construed, and tested by the principles above stated, the contract in question was void as to the defendants ; and hence the second specification is not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b504-9" data-blocks='[["BL_504.8",504,[269,2251,1173,171]],["BL_505.1",505,[170,392,1174,475]]]'>The plaintiff’s offer “ to prove, that at the time of the execution of said agreement between Forrest and Andrews the words, ‘ with interest,’ were inserted as an agreement to pay rent,” was rightly rejected by the court. The contract was <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>executed in duplicate. In one of the duplicates, the words “ with interest,” in the clause providing for the payment of the four instalments of $525 each, etc., were written out in full; in the other, they were interlined. The language employed was neither doubtful nor ambiguous; and it needs no citation of authorities to show that the learned judge was clearly right in refusing to permit plaintiff to prove that interest on quarterly instalments of purchase money meant rent, for the use of the looms in controversy. If such testimony were admissible, written contracts would scarcely be worth the paper on which they are inscribed.</p>
