Bidwell, to secure the sum of $10,000 which he owed the estate of William Dilworth, deceased, gave a mortgage of that amount to the executor, Joseph Dilworth, on 19 lots owned by him at Oakland E. E-? Pittsburgh, upon which there were two prior mortgages amounting to about $10,000, one held by the M. &amp; M. Bank, and the other by Josiah King, in trust. Bidwell was at the time owner of and occupied property in the rear of this plan of lots, and had for many years had his driving road over the land in front, on which his plan was laid to the public thoroughfare. The firm • of Dilworth, Porter &amp; Co., of which Joseph Dilworth was a member, became the owners of Bidwell’s homestead, and Bidwell moved to the' house on his plan of lots, and closed up the way. Joseph Dilworth thereupon, with a view, as he testified, to obtain a right of way over the Bidwell plan of lots, first had proceedings instituted and then stayed on the mortgage held by him as executor, and then obtained control of the prior mortgages and thereon sold, and became the purchaser at marshal’s sale, in the name of Graham Scott, at a bid of $50, of the lots in question. Bidwell having filed exceptions to the sale on the ground of inadequacy of price, an affidavit was sworn to by Joseph Dilworth setting forth, after reciting the three mortgages on the Oakland property as being owned by deponent as executor, and in his own right, that deponent has no other means of collecting his said debt than the said land. It was then agreed on Mr. Bidwell and Mr. Dilworth’s behalf that the amount of the prior mortgages standing in the name of the M. &amp; M. Bank and of Josiah King, should be considered as the amount of the bid, and satisfaction of those mortgages procured to be made by Dilworth. The sale was thereupon confirmed and the mortgages subsequently satisfied accordingly. The date of the deed to Graham Scott (for Joseph Dilworth) was July 3d, 1879, the amount paid the King mortgage and judgment thereon was (April 12th, 1879,) $3,717.10, <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>and the amount paid the M-. &amp; M. Bank mortgage and judgment thereon was.(June 4th, 1879,) $4,688.56. These payments were paid out of Dilworth’s individual funds. There was no available fund belonging to the estate with which they could have been paid. This left the whole amount of the, mortgage held by the executor, ($10,000,) unpaid. Scott on November 17th, 1879, at the instance of Dilworth, conveyed three of the lots so purchased, together with two lots not embraced in the mortgage, and the house thereon, to Dilworth’s daughter-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Dilworth, who made necessary repairs to the extent of $1,200, and occupied the house until November 2d, 1882, when she exchanged it for town lots on the North Pacific R. R., at a valuation of $10,000, on the advice of Joseph Dilworth. Scott conveyed the remaining lots to Joseph Dilworth, who'on January 4th, 1882, conveyed them to his son, Lawrence Dilworth, at $800 each, taking his due bill therefor, which has not been paid. Lawrence Dilworth sold fourteen of these lots on September 2d, 1888, at $350, and one since, the date of which was not given, at $525. He, in fact, knew when he purchased, of the existence of the Bidwell mortgage held by his father as executor, and that his father had become the purchaser through the prior mortgage.</p>

From the date of his purchase until some time after his final sale, the value of real estate at Oakland was very much depressed, and there were very few sales. The front tier of lots in the Bidwell plan was subject to a heavy street assessment, which Dilworth’s grantees assumed to pay. It does not appear that Dilworth was notified by any of the parties interested that he would be held accountable as trustee for the lots purchased by him, until after the date of his conveyance to his son, Lawrence Dilworth. Mr. Dilworth was of opinion at the date of the marshal’s sale, that the lots purchased by him were worth more than the amount of the first two mortgages fixed as the amount of the purchase money.”</p>

Of the questions raised by the numerous assignments of error we discover but one that need be re<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>marked, namely, is the executor of William Dilworth, deceased. liable to account for the increase in value and -the rents of the land he conveyed to Mrs. Dilworth, from the date of said conveyance until she conveyed it to Rev. Reid? All other questions were well considered.</p>
    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[246,629,1176,461]]]'>The marshal’s deed for. the land purchased by the executor, was acknowledged on July 19th, 1879, and on November 17th, in the same year, Mrs. Dilworth received her deed. In making the purchase the executor paid over $8,000, his own money, to satisfy prior liens — there was no available fund belonging to the estate with which he could have purchased. “ The value of the five lots and house conveyed’ to Mrs. Dilworth, was at the time of the convejumce $5,000.” It is not found by the Orphans’ Court that the executor, in any particular, acted recklessly, or in bad faith; nor is there evidence of actual fraud.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[246,1101,1169,1287]],["BL_113.1",113,[165,416,1167,88]]]'>When the land was conveyed to Mrs. Dilworth the power of the executor to control it ceased. Thereafter he had no potential control before it passed into the hands of a bona fide purchaser for value. As respects the executor she owned it and had as good right to sell and convey as if she had been such purchaser. True, it was not a sale. It was an executed gift, and could only be avoided at the election of the legatees. They could avoid a sale and conveyance to a purchaser for value, if he had notice of the trust, as well as a conveyance to a volunteer; in either case they could, if they so elected, recover the land. And in either case, after the land has co'me into the hands of an innocent purchaser, they may compel the executor to account for all the profit which has been made by him, with interest on said profit. This rule was applied to the proceeds of the land which the executor sold to Lawrence Dilworth. Had the executor recklessly, or in bad faith, sold the land to him for less than its market value, he would be liable to account on the basis of that value instead of the purchase money. In case of fraud in fact he might, also, be held to account for the increased value of the land after it passed into the hands of his vendee. It was the duty of the executor to make a bona fide sale of the land for its value in the interest of the legatees. He was not bound to hold it for higher price. Uninformed of the legal rule applicable to the facts .he believed he held the land in his own right, and disposed of it accordingly. He conveyed a part to his daughter for the expressed consideration of $5,000, and that sum was its value. He was able to give it without hurt to anybody, and he did no more wrong in so conveying than if she had paid him the money. Thenceforth the rise in value and use <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>belonged to her. Her title was not void, none could avoid it except the legatees.</p>
    <p id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.6",113,[165,504,1170,602]]]'>There is no occasion to inquire whether the legatees might have compelled the trustee to purchase other lands of .equal value, for they have elected to take the proceeds of the sale with interest. Where the trustee, having mistaken his right, at a proper time, conveyed the land ostensibly for its value, why should he be held liable for a larger sum? Is he deserving of punishment as one guilty of negligence or turpitude? Mrs. Dihvorth’s sale put it out of the power of the <em>cestuis que trustent </em>to recover the land itself. They compel the trustee to account for his profit. In absence of actual fraud, he is liable with respect to the land he conveyed to a volunteer to the same extent as for that he sold to a purchaser with notice of the trust. The liability is measured by the market value, át the date of the conveyance.</p>
