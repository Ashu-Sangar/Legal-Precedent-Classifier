On that day an explosion from fire-damp occurred in a coal mine at West Leisenring in said county, which resulted in the death of nineteen men. As soon after the explosion as the circumstances would permit,"the bodies of the deceased were removed from said mine to their' respective homes or late boarding places in the adjoining village of West Leisenring. In two of the houses two bodies were left in the same room; in two other'houses, two bodies were placed in each house, but each body in a separate room. The eleven remaining bodies were each taken to different houses. The plaintiff was then notified, and going upon the ground where the accident occurred he summoned a jury of six men, and proceeded from house to house, qualified the jury over each body, called a ’witness to identify the respective bodies, and after in this manner viewing each separate body he adjourned the hearing to the Market House in Uniontown, where they again met and examined a number of witnesses as to the cause of the explosion, &amp;c., making in all thirty-nine witnesses qualified and examined by the plaintiff. After the examination of witnesses the inquest then returned a separate finding in each case. The plaintiff alleges that it was necessary to swear the jury in each case and hold a view upon each separate body, and that for these services he is entitled to the following fees, to wit: — •</p>

Tbe coroner could not by having Ms jury view one body, report upon tbe deaths, of nineteen, for tMs only could be done <em>super visum corporum. </em>Since tbe bodies bad been removed to different bouses tMoughout tbe village, be was obliged to take tbe jury from place to place and have them sworn in tbe presence of each body, and in this manner performed precisely tbe same services in each case as though a single body bad been found. It is argued by counsel for plaintiff in error, that because tbe coroner knew upon bolding tbe first inquest that all bad come to their death by tbe same explosion, it was unnecessary to bold but tbe one inquisition. If tbe purpose of tbe inquisition was simply <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>to ascertain if there had been an explosion, there might be some force in this argument, but if his knowing from general rumor before an inquest had been held at all that an explosion had occurred and that it was the cause of the deaths of these men, proves that it was necessary to hold but one inquest, the same reasoning must go farther and prove that it was unnecessary to hold an inquest at all. But since the object of the coroner’s inquiry was not simply to ascertain if there had been an explosion and men had lost their lives in consequence, but also to ascertain what had been the cause of the explosion, since it might have been caused by negligence on the part of the owners, or gross negligence or even criminality on the part of the operators, or laborers, or both; and all may have been to blame, or the cause may have been beyond the control of any, and consequently a calamity for which none should be censured; the findings of the coroner’s jury could therefore scarcely fail of being followed by suits for heavy damages, or criminal prosecutions as they should show the facts in the case. It was, therefore, highly important that the fullest investigation of the whole matter should have been made by thg coroner, and from the number of witnesses examined, and the propriety of which is not disputed, he is shown to have made such an investigation.</p>
