The testator here used the word share in his will as referring to the residuary estate, and no doubt intended it to have the same meaning in the codicil. The codicil also authorizes a sale by the executors, and continues, “ the proceeds of which sale, as respects the <em>share and portion </em>herein-before given to my daughter.....shall be held in trust .....” That is equivalent to saying that the “share and portion” is to be derived from the “proceeds of sale.” The special bequest to Mrs. Lewis was largely of money, and it can hardly be contended that the testator meant to provide for the sale of money.</p>

In this codicil the testator so far modifies it as to change the ,use ■ of “ the share and portion ” of his estate, which he had previously bequeathed to Mrs. Lewis. He makes no reference to the character, value or items of the property Which hé had given her. ’ The language.is as broad and comprehensive as if it read “all the property” he had given her. It was-all the.share -or .portion orpartof his estate, which she was to receive,, as distinguished from the, shares and portions given to the other .devisees. The .main thought in the mind of the testator was to throw some safeguards around all the property which he intended, to devise and bequeath for the <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>use of 'Mrs. • Lewis during, her life; to protect her in the .interest and income therefrom, and- on her death, to pass the <em>corpus </em>over to his grandchildren. . .</p>
    <p id="b153-4" data-blocks='[["BL_153.5",153,[183,533,1174,685]]]'>The several words, share, part, portion, are very frequently rised as synonymous. When applied to property acquired from one’s ancestor, the word “ portion ” is the most comprehensive that can be used. It is broad enough to ipclude, and. is intended to cover all the property or estate thus received. Thus “portion” is defined in Bouv. Law Dictionary 350, to be that part of a parent’s estate, or of the estate of one standing in the place of a parent-which is given to a child. The language of the codicil imposes the trust on all that portion of the testator’s <em>estate </em>in which he intended Mrs. Lewis to have any interest. The word estate in a will is broad enough to carry everything, unless restrained by particular expressions : 1 Term Rep. 411; 2 Id. 656; Turbett <em>v. </em>Turbett <em>et al. </em><a href="/yeates/3/0186-02" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Yeates 187" data-case-ids="6772688" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0186-02">3 Yeates 187</a>.

    <p id="b153-6" data-blocks='[["BL_153.7",153,[182,1400,1173,519]]]'>We cannot give weight to the fact that the word “share” had previously been applied to the. residuary estate. We have shown it to be synonymous with the word “ portion.” If this be incorrect, then the word portion was intended to refer to other property than the residuary estate. This is just as damaging to the claim of the appellant as if the words were synonymous. If the word share was intended to apply to the residuary estate only, and the words have not the same meaning, then the word portion, which had not been applied to that particular estate, was intended for, other property,’ and if so was necessarily designed to cover the other estate or property which had been bequeathed to her.</p>

In applying this rule it is sufficient that the subsequent words indicate the testator’s intention to cut it down with reasonable certainty, and it is not necessary to institute a comparison between the two clauses as to lucidity: 1 Williams on Ex’rs 185. It cannot be cut down by any doubtful expressions in the codicil. The language of the .latter must be such as to clearly establish the modification claimed before such effect can be given to it. We concede these to be the settled rules of construe<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>tion.
