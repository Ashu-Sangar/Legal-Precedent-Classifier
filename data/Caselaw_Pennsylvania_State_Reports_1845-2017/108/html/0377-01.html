It is necessary for him to join in the conveyance of her real estate, because.it is so enacted in the Act of 1770. But that Act does not include personal property, and in the absence of statutory enactment, what principle of law or equity is there that will prevent her from disposing of her property with his consent, even if he does not formally sign the transfer ? It is true that Keen <em>v. </em>City, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%2049" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Phila. 49">8 Phila., 49</a>, does apparently decide that a transfer of stock signed by a married woman passes no title, but the facts of that case are not given, and it does not appear that the husband did, in fact, give his consent. Moreover, this case falls within the exception there stated, namely, that the wife can give her husband a power of attorney, and that was precisely what she did in this case. In any event it is opposed to the principle of the later cases of Brown’s Appeal, 13 Norris, 362, and Powell’s Appeal, 10 W. &amp; O., 485......</p>

There is no testimony before the Master as to what took place between husband and wife at the time the power of attorney was signed. Straub testifies as to the manner in which they came into Green’s possession as follows: “ Mr. Leiper’s margin was exhausted; nearly exhausted. He was called upon for more to protect certain transactions in stocks, and I believe he sort of objected to going to bank to borrow moneys, and I think I said to him, ‘Jim, there is no need for you to borrow money on these stocks, we can use them just as well as they are,’ and he assented to that and thought he would like it much better that waju” And again, “Mr. Leiper brought these shares down to the office and said that he did not want them signed on the back; demanded blank powers of attorney; I gave him, I think, three, which he brought down signed. I pinned one on each respectively, and filled in the number of shares and the name of the stock in the power. I don’t know whether he said anything about his wife or not.”</p>

They further concede that Green’s rights passed to his assignees and that they would be entitled to the benefit of the security if indebtedness by Leiper to Green still existed. But they deny that Green’s transferees who claim to have taken the stock from him on the faith of his ownership, have any other title than was vested in Green, which title expired by the extinction of the indebtedness. They rest their case mainly on the point that the transfers signed by Mrs. Leiper, on their face, failed to clothe Green with apparent ownership of the stock, and therefore his pledgees were put upon inquiry respecting his title.</p>

Of the correctness of this there can be no doubt. Numerous statutes have been enacted authorizing married women to make executory contracts, releases, and sales and transfers, in particular cases. For instance, the Act of March 18th, 1875, empowers a married woman owning loans of this Commonwealth, or of the city of Philadelphia, or any of the loans or shares of the capital stock of any corporation created by or under the laws of this Commonwealth, to sell and transfer the same as if she was unmarried. From such statutory provisions there is no inference that she has authority, without her husband’s assent, to sell and transfer her shares of the stock of any corporation created by or under the laws of another state, or of the United States.</p>

His right depended on oral and written evidence. Without oral testimony of Leiper’s assent, the writing of his wife passed nothing. They did not confer upon Green by a written transfer, all the indicia of ownership of the stock — the written ‘assent of the husband was wanting. Just here this case differs from Wood’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/92/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="92 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="490980" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0379-01">92 Pa.

The fact that Mary B. Leiper alone signed the powers was enough to warn purchasers or pledgees to ascertain whether she made the transfers with her husband’s assent. Of whom would they inquire ? Not of Green, who was offering to pledge the stock, but of him whose assent was essential to the validity of Green’s title. Green, if fraudulently endeavoring to effect a sale or pledge, would likely say <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>nothing to defeat it, but assert whatever would advance his purpose. The husband, if called upon, would not only answer that he gave consent, but also state that the stock was transferred to Green to hold as collateral security for a debt. In the natural order of inquiry they would ascertain the actual terms of the transfer, and take the stock subject to those terms.</p>

In fact, Leiper and his wife pledged the stock to Green as securitjn Aside from the rights of the pledgee, she continued absolute owner. In no instance did Leiper claim to own the stock.
