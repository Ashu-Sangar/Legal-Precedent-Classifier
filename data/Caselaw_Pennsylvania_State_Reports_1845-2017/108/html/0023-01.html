The only apparent exception is Demmy’s Appeal, 7 Wr. 168. That was an exceptional case and the decision pronounced therein was especially predicated by Judge Strong on its own peculiar facts. It stands without the current of the authorities and can only be cited as authority for a case between similar parties and containing the same state of facts. It did not overrule Robb <em>v. </em>Mann, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20300" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Jones 300">1 Jones 300</a>, which was expressly approved in Farmers Mut.

We admit that there are cases, and Demmy’s Appeal was such an one, which decide that upon any judicial sale a purchaser may be relieved by the court having control of the process on which the sale was made, if injury to the premises occurs between the day of sale and the confirmation thereof. Especially where delay has been occasioned by one side and the decree of confirmation postponed beyond the ordinary course of <em>practice; </em>in such case the court may in the exercise of its equity powers either refuse to confirm the sale, or confirm it, dependent upon whether the purchaser was or was not the cause of the delajn</p>

The purchaser at the Orphans’ Court sale is not here complaining of any loss or injury to him that occurred between the date of sale and confirmation. The party here complaining is the vendee of the purchaser at the Orphans’ Court sale, who bought with notice of our judgment lien and no doubt indemnified himself out of the purchase money.</p>

Ihmsen, deceased, under an order of the Orphans’ Court, for the payment of debts. The order was returnable on the 15th of the same month and was then duly returned. On or before that day he paid the whole amount of his bid, some $1,324 thereof in cash, and the residue of the purchase money by giving to the executrix his receipt therefor, as a lien creditor, under the Act of 20th April, 1846, Purd. Dig. 655, pi. 104. Exceptions to the confirmation of the sale were filed by. persons interested therein. A decision thereon was delayed until the 5th June, 1880.

They claim such a sale partakes of the characteristics of a sale made by a Master in chancery. It is true it has been held in a sale made by a Master the purchase is not complete before confirmation of his report, and that a loss by fire after report of sale and before confirmation, must fall on the vendor: Minor Ex parte, 11 Vesey Jr. 559. Admitting that a bidder before the Master has no certain interest in, and is not conclusively fixed with any responsibility with respect to the subject of purchase, yet in foot notes to same case it is said “ it would rather seem from the cases of Davy <em>v. </em>Barber, 2 Atk. 490, and of Blount <em>v. </em>Blount, 3 Id. 638, if the report be ultimately confirmed, it will have relation back to the time of purchase, whatever contingencies may have occurred in the interim, either increasing or diminishing the value.” That such is the effect of the confirmation is declared in Esdaile <em>v. </em>Stephenson, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 123; Paine <em>v. </em>Meller, 6 Ves.

It is so stated there, in the opinion of Mr. Justice Strong, and he does not assent to some of the remarks of Mr. Justice Rogers in Robb <em>v. </em>Mann, supra. Much <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>that was.said in-Demmy’s Appeal was predicated of the facts of the case. The purchase money had not been paid, except the sum required on the property being struck down. No right of a lien creditor of the vendee was involved. It was solely a question between the purchaser on the one side, and the widow and heirs of the decedent on the other. The confirmation of the sale had been delayed at the instance of the widow and heirs, until after a loss by fire occurred, destroying more than one half of the value of the property. The purchaser had been prevented from taking possession of the property at the time fixed in the order and in the conditions of sale. After the fire they, desired the sale to be confirmed. The court held, under the facts, it would be inequitable to force the purchaser to take the property.</p>

After the sale, but before the return day of the order of sale, the buildings were burned. It was held the action on the policy was rightly brought in the name of the administrator of the former owner to the use of the vendee, and that the latter had sufScient interest to give notice of the loss. The sale was confirmed six weeks after the fire. By the terms of the sale the purchase money was not payable until a certain day, which in fact, was forty days after the confirmation. The deed was made nearly sixty days after the loss. This was a distinct recognition of some interest in the purchaser before any confirmation of the sale, and before the payment of any of the purchase money.</p>
