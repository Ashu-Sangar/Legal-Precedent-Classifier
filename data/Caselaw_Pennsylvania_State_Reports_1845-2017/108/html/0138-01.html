The latter mortgage was foreclosed in the United States Circuit Court, and at a marshal’s sale in pursuance thereof the property was bought by C — testator’s administrator c. t. a. — to whom a marshal’s deed was made. Afterwards B. foreclosed his mortgage and bought in the property at the sheriff’s sale in pursuance thereof, and received a sheriff’s deed. The fund produced by the marshal’s sale was distributed by the United States Court, and at that distribution the judgment upon which the sheriff’s sale to B. was afterwards made, was presented and the fund claimed thereon, on the ground that the lien of the legacies had been divested because there was originally sufficient personal property to pay them.

On that distribution, the judgment on which the sheriff’s sale has been made, was presented and the fund claimed thereon on the allegation that the lien of the legacies had been divested by reason of a sufficiency of personal estate to have paid them. The court decided against this view, holding the lien was not thereby divested. Thus the very matter now set up was then passed upon and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction. The fund was in that court. The parties were before it. The decree of distribution which it made has never been disturbed. It became final. If we thought it wrong, we would not now review its correctness. We discover no error in the admission of evidence.
