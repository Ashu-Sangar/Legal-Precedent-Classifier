Justice Sergeant, in his opinion, remarking that the distinction in the recording of sheriffs’ deeds and other deeds has existed in ■Pennsylvania ever since the passage of the Act of 1705, relative to executions, and the Act of 1715 establishing a Recorder’s office, and sheriffs’ deeds have, it is believed, been rarely recorded in the latter.</p>

We do not understand that it has ever become a custom to record sheriffs’ deeds in the Recorder of Deeds office in any part of this state, and to hold that such was necessary, as contended for by plaintiff’s counsel, would be to divest titles and unsettle estates to an enormous and uncertain extent. In the administration of.the law such wreck and ruin cannot be contemplated unless the legislature by an express enactment so decrees. Within the view of the law as it existed prior to 1878, if it was so intended by the law making power, language directly applicable to the special subjects, and admitting of no doubt, could have been used to effect the object contended for. It has not been so enacted, and we see no reason to deduce a ruinous inference from language which, although plain in itself, has already had a judicial interpretation which has been unquestioned for so long a period.

I concur in the opinion just read, and would add that there.is no Act of Assembly which directs that a sheriff’s deed shall be recorded at length in the Prothonotary’s office, nor is there any statute which makes a certified copy of the record of a sheriff’s deed which has been recorded in the Prothonotary’s office since 1846 as good evidence as the origi<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>nal deed apart from the rest of the record.

If purchasers at sheriffs’ sales wish to get the benefit of that part of the recording Acts which makes certified copies of their deeds evidence in the absence of the original, they should record them in the office of the Recorder of Deeds and not in the Prothonotary’s office. The better practice would be to have a short minute of the deed made in the Prothonotary’s office, as was formerly the practice, and to record it at length in the office of the Recorder of Deeds.</p>

We contend such is the effect of the Act of May 25th, 1878 (P. L. 151).

A purchaser at sheriff’s sale is affected with notice of prior sheriff’s sales, but is not concerned with subsequent sheriff’s sales founded upon extinct liens which had been discharged bjr prior sheriff’s sales. The objection that defendant’s sheriff’s deed, though prior in time, is postponed to the plaintiff’s because not recorded in the Recorder’s office, is groundless. The Act of 1878 merely re-enacted (as to Philadelphia) the old Act of 1775, omitting the proviso allowing .six months within which to recordideeds.

So, when the laud was sold by the sheriff to Millard, the lien for the arrears of ground rent, the foundation of the action in covenant, already existed, and thereafter it could not affect the purchaser.
