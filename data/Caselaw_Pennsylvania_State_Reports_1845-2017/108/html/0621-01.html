In 1870 the company leased its entire road to the P. R. R. Co., the lease reciting that the E. &amp; P. R. R. Co. do “ assign and transfer to said second party all the contracts of the first party made prior to March 1st, 1870,” and that the P. R. R. Co. are to “have and hold'the said railroad properly, real, personal and -mixed, with the appurtenances and corporate rights and franchises as aforesaid, etc. The same to be free and clear (except the bonds of the first party secured by mortgage) from all debts, dues, claims and liabilities incurred or owing by the first party prior to March 1st, 1870,” in consideration of which the P. R. R. Co. agreed to “keep and fulfil all and singular the obligations and covenants of said contracts, and which the first party could be required to fulfil and perform.” In 1878 the P. R. R. Co. assigned this lease with the rights it secured to the P. Co., “ subject, nevertheless, to all covenants in the said indenture of lease contained, which on the part of theP.R.R.Co. are tobe kept and performed.” The P. R.R. Co. andthe P. Co. continued to issue passes to A, B and C for three years after the original lease, and then refused to do so any longer. Suits were brought thereupon by A, B and C against the E. &amp; P. R. R. Co. on account of such refusal and breach of contract, and damages were recovered which were paid by the E. &amp; P. R. R. Co. The P. Co. had notice of these suits, and took part in the defence. An amicable action with waiver of trial by jury having been brought by the E. <em>&amp; </em>P. R. R. Co. against the P. Co. to try the liability of the defendant to pay the plaintiff the amount of these judgments:</p>

A careful study of the lease and contract between the parties indicated to. me that the law of the case is with the plaintiff. The agreement between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Pennsylvania Company, of the 1st of April, 1873, whereby the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company’s lease was assigned to the Pennsylvania Company, provides that the latter company will at all times truly keep and perform the covenants and agreements in the said lease to be kept and performed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company; and they acquired their title to the lease, and to the railroad thereto, <em>under and </em>subject, as stated in the agreement, to all covenants in said indenture of lease contained, and which on the part of the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company were to be kept and performed.</p>

Moreover, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, or rather the Pennsylvania Company, having accepted the burthen of the former’s contract, were required to keep, perform and fulfil all the obligations and covenants of the contracts made by the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company, and made corn cerning their railroad and right of way. The suits were brought and damages recovered for the breach by the Pennsylvania Company of the contract made by the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company, yet the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company broke no contract, although under the peculiar exigencies of the facts and the law they were mulcted in damages by reason of the breach of the contracts on the part of this defendant company. The Pennsylvania Company broke the contracts for which the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company suffered.

It might well. be that if the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company had originally paid for the right of way the money value of these several passes, such sum so paid would have been added to the cost of the road, and therefore to the capital stock, or the bonded debt of the company, in which event, according to the terms of the <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>lease, the lessees would have been compelled to pay so much more annual rental, being the interest on the capital stock, and upon the outstanding mortgage bonds of the company.

Although these releases expressed but a nominal consideration, it appears that at the time they were taken the company verbally agreed to issue to each of the persons named, annually during his lifetime a pass which would entitle him and the members of his family to a Nee passage over the line of the road. This parol agreement was in each case the consideration of the contract to release the right of way, but no such consideration was written in the release. The Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Company, until the execution of the lease, complied with the terms of their agreement, and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Pennsylvania Company, while operating the road under the lease, continued to issue the passes until the first day of January, 1874, when officers of the Pennsylvania Company having, as they alleged, consulted their contract and acquainted themselves with the nature of the claim of the landowners, declined to give passes after that date. Thereupon, three several actions were brought by the said William Gibson, James McMasters and William Douthett against the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company, in the Common Pleas of Crawford County, to recover damages for the breach of the parol agreement.

We are informed that “ the matter to be tried is the liability of the defendant to the plaintiff for the amount of three certain judgments recovered in the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County,” particularly mentioned, “under a certain lease and contract made between the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company of the one part and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company of the other part, dated the 24th March, 1870, and assigned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to the defendant, under which contract and assignment the defendant operates the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad.” No express contract relation is alleged to subsist between the parties; the plaintiffs say that they have been obliged by law to pay these judgments, and that the payment was in relief of the defendant ; we therefore assume that the action is in assnmpsit for money by the plaintiff paid out and expended for the defendant’s use.</p>
    <p id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.6",644,[259,1618,1171,433]]]'>That the payment was not voluntary is admitted, but whether it was made in relief of the defendant is the matter to be determined. The whole question turns upon the proper construction of the original lease or contract of 24th March, 1870, between the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.- By the express words of the-assignment the Pennsylvania Company-held “under and subject to all the covenants in the said indenture of lease contained, and which on the part of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company are to be kept and performed.”</p>

    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[168,505,1173,129]]]'>. No obligations were assumed by the Pennsylvania Company other than are expressed in the contract between the original contracting parties.</p>
    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.6",645,[166,635,1175,387]]]'>Referring, then, to the original contract we find that after having leased the road, its equipments and effects, together with the rights and franchises of the company, for the term mentioned, the parties of the first part, the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company, “assign and transfer to the said second party all the contracts of the first party made prior to the first day of March, eighteen hundred and seventy, to have and to hold the said.....contracts for and during the term of each thereof respectively.”</p>
    <p id="b645-8" data-blocks='[["BL_645.7",645,[165,1023,1179,1291]]]'>In consideration of the lease and transfer the Pennsylvania Railroad Company agree to work, operate and maintain the road with its equipments, to furnish funds to maintain the corporate organization; to pay interest on the mortgage bonds, taxes, &amp;e.; to pay annually to the lessors as therein stipulated, “ and to keep, perform and fulfil all and singular the obligations and covenants of <em>said </em>contracts, and which the first party could be required to fulfil and perform.” What these contracts were which were to be kept and performed by the lessors, or to what they related we do not know; but we do know from the peculiar phraseology of the contract that they are the same contracts which were assigned, and no other. The releases of the right of way were certainly such contracts as were embraced in the assignment, and it cannot be questioned that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company were bound to perform and fulfil all and singular the obligations and covenants therein, if aiiy remained to be performed; but the parol agreement to provide a pass was no part of the release ; the latter was an executed contract absolute and unconditional in its terms, and a transfer of it in the absence of an express provision to the contrary carried with it - to the transferee no legal responsibility for the former. Each it is true was the consideration of the other, but they were distinct and independent, one secured a right, .whilst the other evidenced a debt, of the company. The contract for the passes was not properly the subject of assignment by the company; an assignment is a transfer by a party of an estate or right which he has, and not of a debt which he owes; the contracts referred to, and which the defendants were to perform were necessarily therefore such as' secured rights or estates to the company.</p>

    <p id="A23" data-blocks='[["BL_646.6",646,[252,810,1171,173]]]'>It cannot bfe doubted that the obligations of the parol agreement must be classed with the “ debts, dues, claims and liabilities ” of the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Company, and from these the assignment was “ to be free and clear.”</p>
    <p id="b646-6" data-blocks='[["BL_646.7",646,[254,982,1171,429]]]'>It is a matter of little consequence, we think, that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Pennsylvania Company for several years issued passes to the land owners, or that they took part in the defence of the actions brought after the refusal to issue them. If there was any ambiguity or uncertainty in the expression of the contract, these acts might and would furnish some evidence as to the construction which the parties themselves put upon it, but we discover no such ambiguity as would render such evidence admissible for this purpose.</p>
