The “triangle” was not conveyed to Pennsylvania by King Charles’s charter: Duke of York’s Book of Laws, 81; but was ceded to the Federal Government by New York and Massachusetts, and conveyed by the United States to Pennsylvania in 1792: 2 Laws U.

In the case of other states the boundary line has been expressly fixed at the middle of the lake: Charters and Constitutions of the United States, vol. 1, 994, 436; vol. 2, 1022: 2021; Carson <em>v. </em>Blazer, 2 Binney, 490.

The former makes net fishing unlawful in all the waters of the state, except Lake Erie, and repeals all Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent therewith. The former Act was therefore repealed by implication, and as Lake Erie is expressly excepted from the provisions of the latter Act, neither apply to this case: John <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>ston’s Estate, 9 Casey, 511; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cromley, 1 Ash., 179; Nusser <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Casey, 126.

The defendant was fishing for sturgeon and in the only possible manner. The rule as to jurisdiction over the high seas does not apply to the great lakes.

But had it been originally within the charter <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>bounds of the state there could be no doubt about its jurisdiction over the adjacent waters of the late. It was only after the Act of Congress of February 26th, 1845, that even an admiralty jurisdiction was claimed for the United States over the waters of the lakes, and the constitutionality of that Act was seriously doubted until it was settled in 1851 by the Supreme Court in the case of the propeller Genesee Chief <em>v. </em>Fitzhugh, <a href="/us/53/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="12 How. 443" data-case-ids="3365982" data-case-paths="/us/53/0443-01">12 How., 443</a>.

It is, therefore, obvious that previous to the Act of 1845 the courts of the states bordering on the great lakes must, <em>ex necessitate, </em>have had jurisdiction over them to the treaty line, for it could not be that they were altogether without law, and that crimes of every character could be committed thereon with impunity.</p>

But the general jurisdiction of these over their adjacent tide waters has never been doubted. There is not now, and never has been, any room for such doubt. The states, immediately before the adoption of the Federal Constitution, were independent sovereignties, and as such had right over the seas of their coasts to the extent of a marine league from the shores. Upon the adoption of that Constitution there was a partial surrender of this right, in that it was provided the judicial power of the Federal courts should extend to all admiralty and maritime cases. Nevertheless, as was said by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in the case of the United States <em>v. </em>Bevans, <a href="/us/16/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Wheat. 336" data-case-ids="1443470" data-case-paths="/us/16/0336-01">3 Wheat., 336</a>, “The general jurisdiction over the place, subject to this grant of power, adheres to the territory as a portion of sovereignty not yet given away.”</p>

As an illustration of the power of a state to enforce its laws over its tide waters, notwithstanding the maritime jurisdiction of the United States, the learned Chief Justice asks the question: If two citizens of Massachusetts should step into shallow water, when the tide flows, and fight a duel, are they not within the <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>jurisdiction and punishable by the laws of that state ? There can, of course, be but one answer to a question of this kind. Yet this question may be just as pertinently put with reference to the waters of Lake Erie. In support of this same hue of argument may be cited the language of Mr. Chief Justice Tanby, in the case of Martin et al. <em>v. </em>The Lessee of Waddell, <a href="/us/41/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="16 Pet. 367" data-case-ids="102719" data-case-paths="/us/41/0367-01">16 Pet., 367</a>, that when the Revolution took place the states themselves became sovereign, and as such possessed the absolute right over all their navigable waters, and the soils under thorn, and that they are, even now, so held subject to the rights surrendered by the Constitution to the general government. The case of Dunham <em>v. </em>Lamphere, <a href="/mass/69/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Gray 268" data-case-ids="2077081" data-case-paths="/mass/69/0268-01">3 Gray, 268</a>, though not of equal authority as the cases above cited, is undoubtedly sound law, and is directly in point. It was there held that an Act regulating the time and manner of taking fish in the sea, within a mile of the shore, is within the authority of the State Legislature, and binding on citizens of other states, and on vessels enrolled and licensed as fishing vessels under the laws of the United States. One of the authorities cited in support of this ruling is Bennett <em>v. </em>Boggs, Bald., 60, where it was held that a law of Delaware prohibiting the use of a gil ling net in tide waters within the limits of the state, was valid, and that the legislature had power to regulate the fisheries in the Delaware by- the prohibition of a common law right.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[231,1438,1174,590]]]'>Thus, from what has been shown, it follows: (1) By the Act of cession the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania over the waters of Lake Erie, adjacent to the ceded territory, is the same as though that territory had been embraced in the original charter to William Penn. (2) That the legislative powers of this Commonwealth over these waters are absolute, except so far as they may be restrained by Congress for the purpose of carrying into effect the admiralty and maritime laws of the United States; and (3), The consequent of the above-stated proposi tions, the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth to regulate fisheries in these waters, in the absence of auy Act of the Federal Legislature abridging it, is plenary, and cannot be called in question by any other power short of the Government of the United States.</p>
