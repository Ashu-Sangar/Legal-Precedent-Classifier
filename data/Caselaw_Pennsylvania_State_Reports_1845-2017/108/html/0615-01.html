L Richmond, Jr., Esq.) were as follows: In 1870, a copartnership under the name of the Producers and Manufacturers Bank, was formed for the purpose of doing a banking business in the City of Titusville, with a capital of $100,000, divided into shares of $100. The articles of association and by-laws provided that the business of the bank should be managed by a board of seven directors, and that no stock should be transferred without the consent of a majority of the directors, or the written consent of three fourths of the stockholders. The bank continued in business till November 6th, 1876, when it closed its doors. A number of its shares had been transferred, but generally to other members of the association, and little attention was given to the mode of transfer prescribed by the by-laws. At a meeting of the shareholders held November 9th, 1876, it was resolved to make an assessment of 100 per cent, on the capital standing in the name of each shareholder, including some whose shares had been transferred, but without recognition on the part of the directors or other shareholders. Among this number were W. B. Sterrett, who had fifty-five shares, and David Emory, who had twenty-five shares. This assessment was paid, and a committee was appointed to wind up the affairs of the bank, with R. E. Hopkins as chairman, afterwards made trustee. On January 11th, 1877, the shareholders passed a resolution to procure from their number 'a loan of $50 per share on the capital, and to issue certificates <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>therefor, bearing interest — to be repaid ■ before any dividend was made to the shareholders who had paid the assessment of November 9th, 1876. On March 13th, 1877, a similar resolution was passed for a' second loan. With the amount realized in this way, the depositors were paid in full. In 1877 a bill in equity was filed by Lewis Emery, Jr., one of the shareholders, to restrain the bank from collecting certain judgments that had been entered against him. A decree having been made March 25th, 1878, that an account be taken, and Wm. S. Morris, Esq., having been appointed Master, an agreement was entered into, by which the entire business of the copartnership was to be settled, and the rights of the shareholders adjudged by the Master. Hopkins, the trustee, was appointed by the Court receiver. The report of the latter- showed a fund after expenses paid of $22,098.75, to be distributed by the Master.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[243,1098,1181,335]]]'>David Emery paid the assessment of $2,500.00 and contributed $1,250 on each of the loans, making $5,000. W. B. Sterrett paid $5,500, the amount of the assessment, and he and Emery claimed before the Master that they should severally be repaid these amounts with interest thereon out of the fund in Receiver’s hands before any part of said fund was paid to the other stockholders, who had paid assessments or made loans to the trustee.</p>

He was present between January 25th, and August 23d, 1881, in all eighteen different days; sometimes for a few minutes, and at others from two to six hours. The case was argued before the Master, August 22d, and 23d, 1881, and the Master’s report was filed June 24th, 1882, awarding to Emery $6,621.65, and to Sterrett $7,326.91, the amounts claimed by them respectively, and to which report exceptions were filed, but after argument overruled by the court and the report confirmed. An appeal was taken by some of the shareholders December 29th, 1882, which was never prosecuted.</p>

On May 14th, 1883, when the paper settling the case -was filed, motions were made ■on the part of McKelvy and others by counsel, other than Neill, -to take the fund out of court. Neill thereupon moved to have $1,500 of the money assigned to McKelvy inpounded for his fees. An application was presented by him to the court, asking to have an Auditor appointed to fix the amount of his fees. H. L. Richmond, Jr., Esq., was appointed Auditor, arid at the first meeting before him a protest was entered by Sterrett’s counsel against that method of determining Neill’s compensation. On January 2d, 1884, a petition was presented by Sterrett to the Auditor, who in turn presented it to the court, asking for an issue and trial by jury. Tins the court refused.</p>

I am also constrained to abide by his report in the belief that both parties may acquiesce in the present adjustment of the controversy.

It is the enforcement of a lien that the law gives the attorney on his client’s monéy when he collects it.

    <p id="b635-7" data-blocks='[["BL_635.10",635,[155,1310,1175,561]]]'>The issue asked for was properly denied. A Court of Equity has little need to call in the aid of a jury to fix the compensation of an attorney for professional services. In Daly v. Maitland, 7 Norris, 384, it was decided that where a mortgage contamed an agreement for an attorney fee, it was the province of the court to decide whether the amount claimed was reasonable. The same rule was followed in Imler v. Imler, 13 Norris, 372, and other later cases. The claim here was upon a fund raised in a Court of Equity, and within its actual control. It was for services connected with that fund. The learned judge was certainly competent to fix the value of those services; in no event could a jury render him any assistance or enlighten his judgment.</p>
    <p id="b635-8" data-blocks='[["BL_635.11",635,[158,1871,1175,518]],["BL_636.1",636,[270,416,1167,76]]]'>With the result reached by the court below we are entirely satisfied. But while we affirm the decree we do not do so upon the ground that the appellee had a lien upon the fund in court. As a general rule an attorney has a lien for his services only upon what he has m his possession. If he has papers, he may retain them until paid for his services in regard to the particular case to wMch they belong. If he has money m his hands which he had collected he may deduct Ms fees in that particular collection and pay over the balance. Yet according to Dubois’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20231" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Wright 231">2 Wright, 231</a>, tMs right is one of defalcation rather than lien. The word “lien” is sometimes used without due regard to its legal meaning, and we <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>must be careful to avoid tbe consequences of such misapplication.</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[269,502,1169,1277]]]'>The decree below, however, may be affirmed upon solid grounds. The fact is found by the Auditor and the court that the appellee was to look to thiá fund for his compensation. Its existence is due in great measure to his professional services. To the extent of the value of those services, then, the fund belonged to him; that is to say, he was the equitable owner thereof to the amount of his fee. When, therefore, it was discovered that the appellant was endeavoring to take the fund out of court by the aid of other counsel, thus ignoring the appellees claim, the court below did right in laying its hand upon such a proceeding. It was acting as a Court of Equity; it was administering a fund within its actual grasp, and it was entirely competent to dispose of every question connected with that fund. It had been in the hands of a receiver but .the receiver had paid it into court. The allowance of counsel fees touching a fund in equity has always been under the control of a chancellor. As was said by Justice Shauswood in Freeman <em>v. </em>Shreve., 5 Norris, 135: “ It is true that a chancellor will, out of a fund for distribution, order compensation to the counsel engaged in his sound discretion, according to his estimate of what they reasonably deserve to have. He will' often order such compensation to the counsel of a losing party who is decreed to have no interest, on the equitable ground that being a necessary party he was compelled to litigate, or had sufficient reason. It is a charge which the fund ought in equity and good conscience to bear.” The compensation allowed the appellee was reasonable, regard being had to the character of Ms services and the result obtained, and Ms right to be paid out of the fund is clear.</p>
    <p id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.6",636,[531,1789,903,87]]]'>The decree is affirmed and the appeals dismissed at the costs of the respective appellants.</p>
