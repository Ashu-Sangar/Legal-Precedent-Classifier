A. being engaged in erecting a higb building, B. proposed in writing to him to put in a patent passenger elevator, of novel construction, “warranted satisfactory in every respect,” and A. accepted the offer. When the elevator was substantially erected, but before final completion and adjustment, and before it was tendered by B. as completed, A. requested permission to use it in the work of completion of the building. After such use for about two months, A. alleged that it was not satisfactory to him, and after notice to B. to take it out at once, A. dismantled the elevator and machinery connected therewith, and stored the same. In an action by B. against A., in which tire narr. averred that A. prevented the completion of tire work, the court below charged the jury that if they were of opinion, under the evidence that the elevator'was reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was intended, and that the defendant ought to have been satisfied with it, the verdict might be for the plaintiff. The jury found for the plaintiff. <em>Held,</em>

Then it should satisfactorily perform the work of such an elevator as the defendant ordered. It does not resemble at all the case of a sale of goods on approval. If you buy an article at a store upon approval and it is sent to you, if upon further examination you do not approve it you may return it and will not be bound to pay for it. This contract does not resemble such a purchase. The building of such an elevator in the defendant’s building was a work involving a large outlay of money and the consumption • of much time in the construction. The pump which he furnished for it cost him alone $850. It is not to be supposed that the plaintiff would incur the great expense necessarily attending upon the erection of such a machine, and that the defendant should then be permitted to reject it at his own caprice and not pay for it. The contract does not say that it shall be satisfactory-to him, but that it is “warranted satisfactory in every respect;” that is, that it shall perform its functions in a satisfactory man■ner, but it was not intended that the defendant should be the exclusive judge of that. When such a machine is ordered to be constructed there is always an implied contract that the work shall be done in a workmanlike manner, and that the machine shall be reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>intended to be used; that it shall accomplish the object for which it is erected in a satisfactory manner. Such an implied warranty would have existed in this case if nothing had been said about it in the contract, and the contract expresses no more than would have been implied under such circumstances.</p>

On the other hand the plaintiff testified that these defects, if they existed, could have been remedied very speedily, and at slight cost, if he had been allowed an opportunity to do it; that at the time the defendant rejected the elevator it had not been completely finished and adjusted. If this is so, if you believe that when the defendant repudiated the machine it had not been finished or adjusted, and that such defects as existed might have been remedied by the plaintiff, if he had been allowed to complete it, and if he was not allowed to complete it by the defendant, then you ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff. ,</p>

If so, the verdict should be for the plaintiff. If, on the contrary, the machine did not answer in a satisfactory manner the purposes for which it was intended, or if such defects as existed could not have been remedied by the plaintiff, or if the plaintiff was not deprived of the opportunity to remedy them and failed .to do so, and if the defects were of a character to render the elevator unsatisfactory and unfit to perform the purpose for which it was erected, in a satisfactory manner and with a reasonable degree of perfection, then your verdict should be for the defendant.”</p>

    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[225,889,1173,677]]]'>But even if opportunity to complete the elevator had been afforded, the expression in the contract “ warranted satisfactory in every respect,” did not authorize the defendant’s acts.

The case differs widely from a sale of goods on trial, for if the trial is unsatisfactory then the goods can be returned uninjured. Nor is the case similar to a warranty that it should be approved by the defendant or some other named person, as in the cases cited by plaintiff in error. The ease of Hartman <em>v. </em>Blackburn, 7 Pitts. Leg.

This was a fact which the contract gave him the right to decide. He was the person negotiating for its purchase. He was the person who was to test it, and to use it. No other persons could intelligently determine whether in every respect he was satisfied therewith.</p>

It must not be merely capricious. It is declared in 1 Parsons on Contracts, 542, if A. agrees to make something for B. to meet the approval of B. or with any similar language,' B. may reject it for any objection which is made in good faith and is not merely capricious. Andrews v. Belfield, 2 C. B., N. S., 779, is cited to support this view. That case arose on a written agreement to build a carriage in a manner which should meet the approval of the person for whom it was to be made not only on the score of workmanship, but also that of convenience and taste. It was held that his rejection made M good faith was conclusive.</p>

They are usually suspended from a wire or rope cable which may be operated either by water or by steam. This is supported by a single upright iron column made in sections wlrich run into each other like the sections of a telescope. It stands under the center of the car. When the sections are folded closely together the car is at its lowest position. On the water being forced into the sections by a steam pump, the pressure of the water within the column causes the sections to draw out, thereby forcing .the car upward and so sustainmg it. When a valve is opened the water escapes. Then the weight of the car and the weight of the upper sections of the column cause the sections to run into each other, and the car descends.</p>

We will refer to some. John Doris testified that he ra»n tMs elevator about a month; that he would take it Mom the first to the sixth floor; it would almost drop from the sixth to the tMrd floor, and then it would almost stop, and then go slowly down; it acted the same whether the steam pressure was great or small; it would start and jump in getting up to where we wanted to go; almost every trip it would drop suddenly from the sixth to the third floor; if we put on a load it would jump all the way up. John Norris who rode on it four or five times says “ it was jerky and every little period it gave a little jerk, causing your stomach to rise.” Albert Merritt <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>testified lie had ridden on them; but they were so unsatisfactory and uncertain that’ be preferred to walk up stairs; they would stick both going up and coining down. He had one of the same kind which he says was not entirely completed although two or three months were occupied in trying to put it in order; he “ considers them the biggest frauds he ever saw in the elevator line.” S. Lloyd Wiegand a mechanical engineer of twenty-eight years experience testifies that “a building of moderate height can use -them very well; it don’t work well in a tall building.” Hale the architect of the building rode on it and saw it often. He says it did not run smoothly; at the end of every section it would give a jerk and a click. He examined this and others of the same kind to report to plaintiff in error, and “ came to the conclusion that it would never do as a passenger elevator on which ladies were to ride.” He informed the agent of the contractor that the elevator was a failure. Plaintiff in error also testified to its jerking and irregular motion being such as to scare him, and Ms fear of an accident; of notice to the agent that it was unsatisfactory; and of Ms offer to give $500 if he would take it out.</p>

Having however entered into a contract whereby he did run this risk, his legal rights are to be determined thereby : McCarren <em>v. </em>McNulty et al. <em>supra: </em>In Nelson <em>v. </em>Von Bonnhorst, 5 Casey, 352, one gave a written instrument under seal admittmg an indebtedness to another in' a specific sum which he agreed “to pay whenever in my opinion, my circumstances will enable me to do so.” It was held that the instrument imposed no legal obligation which could be enforced by action, as the maker was the sole judge of his ability. In that case there was an unquestioned indebtedness to be discharged by the payment of money. Every other person might swear the circumstances of the debtor made him abundantly able to pay, yet that did not determine his legal liability.</p>
