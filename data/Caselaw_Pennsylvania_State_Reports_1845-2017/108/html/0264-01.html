On the morning of the ninth, just after a severe storm had abated and the passengers were beginning to-move about the ship and go on deck, the plaintiff crossed the saloon, into which her stateroom opened, to visit a Mrs. Davids, who occupied a room on the other side. Not finding her friend, the plaintiff started toward the companion-way, intending' to go up to the social hall, when the ship gave a sudden and violent lurch which threw her down and broke' her wrist. During the storm water had come down into the saloon, necessitating the removal of the carpet, which left the floor wet and slippery. At the place where the accident occurred there was a smooth panel along the side of the saloon, leaving nothing to catch hold of. Upon this second trial the testimony relied on to show what took place at the time of the accident was that of the plaintiff herself, and was substantially as follows: “ Wasn’t there a tremendous sea running at that moment? No, sir; there was hot, because how could I have quietly walked across? There was no high sea running then. As I say, there were long intervals of quiet.The lurches, when they' came, were severe......The storm had very much abated. The gale had very much abated, and the lurches were very much less frequent. -It was very much quieter indeed than it had been. The ladies were on the deck, winch they had not been for several days. . . The storm had very decidedly abated. The ladies' hadn’t been up stairs for several days, and this morning they were in the social hall. Did the dampness of the floor- bring .about this accident? Not at all. Or the - slippiness of the floor? No; the floor was wet. Did you slip on the floor? No, sir; I was Swayed with thé lurch. • I don’t think the floor had anything to do with it.”</p>

As a rail is the more usual protection against danger on a ship, evidence, was given for the purpose of showing had there been one at the place where she was walking, the injury would not have been sustained. There was evidence that many other ships had similar places protected by a rail, and that soon after this injury one was put in that place in this ship. As there was neither rail nor any other object in lieu thereof affording adequate protection against injury in case of a sudden, and at the time, unexpected lurch, the question of negligence in omitting to provide against what must frequently occur was for the jury.
