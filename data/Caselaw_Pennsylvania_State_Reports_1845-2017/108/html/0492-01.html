In February, 1882, the Provident &amp;e. Company increased their capital from $500,000 to $1,000,000, and also increased the par value of their stock from $50 to $100, giving to their stockholders the option to subscribe before December 15th, 1888, at par for an amount equal to their holdings. The testator accepted this privilege, surrendered her certificate for 81 shares, received a new certificate for 41 shares of the new par value, paying $50 cash for the extra half share, and <em>on June </em>2d, 1882 paid for the amount of her new subscription, which by its terms was to draw interest until December 15th, 1883, when new certificates were to be issued. Before that time, on August 13th, 1883, the testatrix died having made no change in her will. The Act of June 4th, 1879, (P. L., 88, sec. 1) provides “ Every will shall be construed with reference to the real estate and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.”</p>

Here the question is, which of two legatees is entitled to certain shares of stock, undoubtedly passing under the will. It is a question first of <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>the intention of the testatrix, and second of the identity of the gift. The bequest is certainly a specific one. It is of stocks described as standing in her name. Had it been <em>simply </em>of stocks ‘standing’ in her name, it would, under the statute and under the authorities cited, not have been limited to stocks owned when the will was written, but would have included all stocks owned at the time of her death. But the stocks intended are specifically designated. They are described as ‘ <em>eighty-one shares </em>of the Provident Life and Trust Company <em>now </em>standing in my name on the books of the said Company,’ expressly excluding (under the maxim <em>expressio </em>unius, etc.) such as by possibility might afterwards be acquired, and everything but those precise shares; thus bringing the case within the proviso of the statute excluding from its operation cases in which a ‘ contrary intention ’ is shown by the will, and making it clear that as to this particular gift she did <em>not </em>intend that her will should speak as of a time immediately preceding her death.</p>

Nothing else was given. She certainly did not give the forty shares of the par value of one hundred dollars <em>not </em>then owned, but after-wards purchased, and which consequently, under the will, passed to the residuary legatee. It is simply a coincidence that, after the consolidation of the shares specifically given, new shares were subscribed for (although not actually acquired) making up a <em>number </em>identical with the number originally held, though of double the value. The question is not one of identity of number, but of the identity of the subject of the gift. Had the eighty-one shares standing in' the name of the testatrix upon the books of the Company when the will was made remained in their original shape, and had she after-wards purchased or subscribed for eighty-one additional shares, it would not have been pretended that the latter passed to the specific legatee so as to give one hundred and sixty-two shares instead of eighty-one. How does that case differ from this ?</p>

Thus while in Goodlad <em>v. </em>Burnett, 1 K. &amp; J., 341, (cited by Mr. Gest), Vice Chancellor Wood expressed-<a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>the opinion that since the enactment of the Wills’ Act it required some plainer indication of contrary intention than the mere circumstance that the testator has described stock by the words ‘ my stock ’ to take the case out of the statutory rule, that the will shall speak as if it had been executed immediately before his death, the same judge, in Douglas <em>v. </em>Douglas, Kay, 400, 405, was of opinion that a gift of ‘all my stock which I <em>have purchased'1 </em>must be confined to stock actually purchased at the date of the will; and he proceeded to decide that in a will made since the statute, and containing the words, ‘I hereby exonerate my sister from all claims in respect of money laid out by me in improvements of the estates in Scotland and which money has, according to the laws of Scotland, been charged thereon,’ the exoneration only applied to moneys so charged at the date of the will, and not to money afterwards laid out and charged, nor even to money then laid out but afterwards charged.

But if it were ‘ all shares which T now own in such a bank ’ or ‘ all cattle and horses now on my farm,’ it would describe specific shares and particular cattle and horses and could not extend to the others.” See also, Gold <em>v. </em>Judson, <a href="/conn/21/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 Conn. 616" data-case-ids="12132509" data-case-paths="/conn/21/0616-01">21 Conn., 616</a>, 622, 623; Wetmore <em>v. </em>Parker, 52 N.

    <p id="b515-7" data-blocks='[["BL_515.7",515,[180,1070,1181,865]]]'>The general rule of the common law was, that a will of realty was construed to speak from its date; real estate which the testator did not have at the time of the making of his will, but which he subsequently acquired, would not pass under it, however express, comprehensive and general the words of the will, or however manifest the intention of the testator. A will of personalty, however, was not referable to the state of the property, at the time of the making of the will, but was construed to take effect from the date of the testator’s death, unless there were expressions in the will showing it was intended to describe the property with reference to the former and not to the latter date. By sec. 10 of our act of April 10th, 1833, Purd. Dig., 1476, pi. 11, it was provided “that the real estate acquired by a testator, after making his will, shall pass by a general devise, unless a contrary intention be manifest on the face of the will.” It will be seen that this section placed wills of realty and personalty on the same footing in part only, and the first section of the act of 4th June, 1879, above referred to, was enacted to complete what had only been partially effected by the act of 1833.</p>

If at the testatrix’s death these shares had not been found the legacy would have been adeemed, and, in case of deficiency of assets, it would not have been subject to abatement with general legacies. But a specific bequest may be of a particular thing, in existence and constituting part of the estate of a testator at the time of the making of his will, or it may be of a particular thing, of which he was not then pos<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>sessed, but of wbicb he was possessed, at his death.

Bothamley <em>v. </em>Sherson, L. R., 20 Eq., 304. That the legacy is specific is not, therefore, necessarily decisive of the question under consideration. It is in the application of the rule of the statute to specific legacies that we meet with most difficulty. No case in this court has been called to our attention which involves a construction of the act of 1879, or which defines the different measure of proof, which may be required to establish a contrary intention under the statute from that which was adjudged sufficient before its passage.

Thus, where before the statute the testator had bequeathed the whole of some one genus of his property, by the description of all his property of a ■ particular kind, as, “ all debts due to me on bond,” or “ all my stock,” or “my share,” the courts had determined that he intended only so much as he had at the date of his will: Douglas <em>v. </em>Douglas, Kay, 404; but, after the passage of the Wills Act, it was held in Goodlad <em>v. </em>Burnett, 1 K. &amp; J., 341, that the. effect of that enactment was to require some plainer indication of contrary intention, and that, therefore, where a testatrix in 1850 bequeathed “ my new three and. a quarter per cent, annuities,” the bequest comprised all at her death.</p>

In Hepburn <em>v. </em>Skirving, 4 Jur. N.

To all cases of this character this construction of the act has without doubt been uniformly applied; indeed it would appear that they were in the contemplation of the law-making power when the Wills Act was passed. “ The applicability of the new enactment to the case of a renewed lease,” says Mr. Jarman in his Treatise on Wills, page 606, “ cannot be questioned, and its application has been extended to cases where, after making his will disposing of the demised property, the lessee has bought the reversion in fee; the newly-acquired interest passes by the will, notwithstanding a reference (commonly found in such cases) to the term for which the property is at the time held; this being considered only a' mode of describing the property, and not as equivalent to saying, “I give my present interest and nothing else.” The same principle hag been applied to a devise of land. Thus in Strevens <em>v. </em>Bayley, 8 Ir. Com. Rep., L., 410; where the testatrix devised to the plaintiff “the lands of Curramore,” and devised all the residue of her real estate to the defendant. The townland of Curramore had originally been held in undivided moieties, and there had been a partition under which the testatrix was, at the date of her will, entitled to one portion in severalty; and after the daté of her will she purchased the other portion. It was held that the whole townland passed to the plaintiff. Monahan, C. J., who delivered the judgment of the court, considered that the description comprised the whole townland, and, consequently, included all in the townland of which the testatrix was seised at her death.</p>

Carman is not of the whole of any class of 'her property — a specific gift of an undefined amount — as of “all my shares in the Provident Life” &amp;c., it is of “eighty-one shares,” “nowstanding in my name on the books of the company.” The words employed are used in no merely generic sense; the property is particularly specified by number and name. She had at the time of the making of her will, just that particular number of shares, and when she speaks of them as she did, she manifestly refers to an actually existing state of things; her language therefore must be taken as referential to the time of the writing of her will. The adverb “now,” if used in a <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>bequest of “all her shares,” or “her shares standing” &amp;c., under the authority of the eases cited, would not perhaps have been sufficient to establish any “ contrary intention,” as, in that connection, it would with equal propriety be referable to the date of the will or of the testatrix’s decease. But when the bequest is of a certain number of actually existing shares, <em>“now </em>standing on the books of the company,” we may readily conclude that the testatrix intended to limit the bequest to the identical shares she then had; if she so intended, then nothing else was given; if she referred to an existing state of things she certainly did not give the forty shares not then owned by her. It is true, that the eighty-one shares were afterwards changed to forty and one half shares, but the question is not one of identity in number, but of the identity 'of the subject of the gift. 0</p>
