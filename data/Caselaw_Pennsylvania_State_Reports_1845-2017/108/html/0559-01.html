L. 233) directing contracts for supplies to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, the word “ responsible ” does not refer to pecuniary ability only. The Act calls for an exercise of discretionary powers on the part of the city officers; and if they act in good faith, although erroneously or indiscreetly, mandamus will not lie to compel them to change their decision. They may be ordered by mandamus to proceed to do their duty of deciding and acting according to their best judgment, but the court will not direct them in what manner to decide.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b575-12" data-blocks='[["BL_575.10",575,[188,1552,1181,348]]]'>2. The County Commissioners advertised for proposals for supplies for certain county offices. A. put in a bid to furnish them, which the. Commissioners refused to consider, chiefly on the ground that A. had previously defrauded the city by furnishing supplies inferior to those he had contracted to furnish. A., thereupon, filed a bill praying for a mandamus commanding the commissioners not only to schedule, examine and consider lfis proposal, but, if he should be found the lowest bidder, to award him the contract. A demurrer, filed to this bill by the Commissioners, was overruled by the court, and the mandamus granted. Upon writ of error:</p>

That the relator bid for some of the said supplies, and under the law is entitled to have his proposal scheduled with the proposals of the other bidders, to have it considered and examined, and if it shall appear that he is the lowest bidder for any of said supplies, then it is the duty of said County Commissioners to award to him, and he is entitled to have awarded to him a contract to furnish said supplies; that relator is regularly engaged in the business of maldng and supplying the articles for which he bid, and is so known to the respondents, they having in 1883 awarded a contract to him.

The Act of May 23d, 1874 (P. L. 233), regulates the award of contracts for municipal work and supplies. It requires that the contract be awarded to the “ lowest responsible bidder under such regulations as Councils may prescribe.” In 1876 this court in the cases of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 1 N., 343, and Findley <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, 1 N., 357, gave judicial interpretation to the meaning of the words “lowest responsible bidder.” It was decided that the words did not mean pecuniary ability, but that they necessarily vested in the party awarding the contract, powers “ deliberative and discretionary.” These decisions have been followed in the Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, in the case of Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Hackett <em>v. </em>The Guardians of the Poor, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Leg.%20Int.%201883" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Leg.

In each it was held that the word “responsible,” as used in the Act, applies not to pecuniary ability only, but also to judgment and skill. The duties thereby imposed on the city authorities are not merely ministerial, limited to ascertaining whose bid was the lowest, and the pecuniary responsibility of the bidder and his sureties. The Act calls for an exercise of duties and powers which are deliberate and discretionary. If the authorities act in good faith, although erroneously or indiscreetly, mandamus will not lie to compel them to modify or change their decision; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 1 Norris, 343; Findley <em>v. </em>City of Pittsburgh, Id., 351.</p>

In the demurrer to the writ of alternative mandamus, the reasons stated <em>inter alia </em>are that the petition discloses that in rejecting the relator’s bid and deciding him not to be a responsible person, the respondents exercised a discretion vested in them by law, and which the Court could not coerce, and that the petition does not allege that the respondents had acted dishonestly or fraudulently in deciding the relator was not a responsible person. The Court overruled the demurrer and entered judgment thereon for the Commonwealth. In the judgment awarding the peremptory writ the Court affirmed the position assumed by the relator, and ordered the respondents to proceed to perform the duties relating to the subject matter in dispute and specified in the petition for the mandamus. The petition <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>prayed for a writ commanding the respondents not only to schedule, examine and consider the proposal of the relator-, but if he should be found to be the lowest bidder, that they thereupon award him a contract. This judgment is a denial of the exercise of those deliberate powers and sound discretion, which the statute wisely gives to the respondents in the allotment of a contract. We do not think it necessary that the relator must have been judicially convicted of having defrauded the city under a previous contract. If in fact he did so act in a fraudulent manner, or if the respondents on evidence which they in good faith deemed satisfactory, believed he had, their discretionary power to reject his bid should not be restrained by mandamus. The learned judge therefore erred in not sustaining the demurrer, and in not quashing the writ of alternative mandamus.</p>
