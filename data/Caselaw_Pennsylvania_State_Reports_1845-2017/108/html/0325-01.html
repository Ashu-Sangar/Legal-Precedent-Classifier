Smith (the plaintiff) and S. J. Christian were also stockholders in the building association and in the early part of 1879 withdrew their stock, each receiving an order from the association dated April 3d, 1879, Nos. 300 and 301 for $2498. The orders were not paid and Smith threatening to bring suit for himself and Christian, unless payment was made or secured, the association on July 1st, 1880 assigned to Smith «as security the mortgage in question, with others. Smith executed an agreement with the association, under date of July 12th, 1880, in which it was stipulated that the assignment “ although absolute is made upon the conditions ...... that all the income derived from said four mortgages together with one half of all the income derived from any other source shall be applied ” to the payment of said orders on or before May 6th, 1881; the mortgages to be re-assigned upon such payment and the treasurer of the association to furnish monthly statements to Smith of receipts and disbursements, in order to shoAV how the agreement was being carried .out. Smith did not place the assignment on record until May 12th, 1881. Upon January 6th, 1881, Quein the defendant was elected treasurer of the association as appeared from the minutes offered in evidence. Upon February 7th, 1881, a meeting of the board was held at which Quein, as shown by the minutes, expressed his desire of paying off his loan. On motion, it was agreed to “and as the mortgages were held by Smith the secretary was directed to give Mr. Quein a copy of the statement of his account signed by the secretary and with the seal of the association affixed, to be held by them until the society could get the mortgages released and satisfy the same.” The settlement was made by Quein and he paid off the mortgage with what stock he already had and other stock he had purchased three months previously at a discount of 25 per cent. A certificate of this payment was given, dated February 7th, 1881.</p>

All who spoke to me about the assignment said at the same time it was good for nothing. I did not say that I heard it that night. I heard of it about six months after it was assigned.

Christian placed his order in the hands of Smith for collection. After Smith had threatened to sue unless secured, the board of directors agreed to accede to his demand, and on May 10th, 1880, the association assigned to him as collateral security four mortgages, including the one in suit, and stipulated that all the income derived from said four mortgages, together with one half of all the income derived from any other source, should be wholly applied to the liquidation of orders prior in date to those held by Smith until all should be paid, and then to the liquidation of those he held until fully paid; and that the treasurer of said association should furnish monthly statements showing in detail the receipts and disbursements, and how the agreement was being carried out.</p>

The assignee was entitled to monthly statements from the mortgagee showing how the agreement was being performed. It is immaterial whether Smith placed the assignment on record, or caused notice thereof to be given to the defendant. If the defendant had knowledge of it, he knew of its conditions and stipulations. The assignee did not notify him to stop payments to the mortgagee, and he is entitled to credit for whatever payments that were properly made.

Before Iris attempted settlement and satisfaction of the mortgage he knew it was assigned to Smith. He was a director and was present, March 11th, 1881, when the board resolved that it would best serve the interests of all parties for the affairs of the Association to pass into the- hands of a Receiver. Three months before the settlement he bought stock at twenty-five per centum less than par. When he applied to pay the mortgage with stock he knew there were a number of withdrawing stockholders who had not been paid, that orders were outstanding, and that Smith’s turn had not come. In <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>the minutes and Quein’s own testimony is ample evidence that he knew the Association was insolvent, and the court committed no error in the answer to the plaintiff’s fifth point. Under such circumstances an officer could not discharge his indebtedness to the Association with stock for which he had subscribed, nor with stock he had bought from others at a discount. When the officers learned that the Association was rvithout sufficient means for payment of its debts, they could not lawfully appropriate its property to themselves to the prejudice of creditors. The fact as to Quein’s knowledge of the insolvency was rightly submitted to the jury with proper instruction.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[170,919,1176,861]]]'>This action is for recovery of the mortgage debt. The receiver was a witness and knows of the proceeding. If the assignee is not entitled to the money by virtue of the assignment, by a proper proceeding the suit can be marked for use of the party entitled. This is not the case of an absolute sale or transfer of a mortgage or other evidence of debt. Such an assignment as this, if not a safe security for the assignee, is prima facie valid, for it is to secure an existing debt, and upon conditions not prejudicial to the Association or to other persons. On its face the assignee is entitled to no money until prior orders are fully paid. We are not convinced that the court erred in refusing to charge that the assignment was invalid. A solvent building association may appropriate the proceeds of a debt owing to itself in payment of a debt it owes. The Act of 1859 provided that at no time should more than half of the funds in the treasury be applicable to 'the demands of Avithdrawing stockholders without consent of the board of directors. In this proceeding it need not be determined whether the assent of the board was illegally given to the assignment.</p>
