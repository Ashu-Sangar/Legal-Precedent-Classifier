The charter provided that all ordinances of the borough should be recorded in another public office. A general plan for the location of streets was adopted by a resolution of the town council on September 11th, 1872, but the resolution was not recorded. Subsequently, in 1873, an Act of Assembly was passed authorizing said town council of Yerona to open by ordinance any street “ included in the general plan of said borough <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>approved by councils September 11th, 1872,” provided, “that damages which might be assessed to any person through whose property any street is opened.....shall be paid within one year;.....ancl in default of the payment thereof the said general plan.....and .....said street or streets.....shall be vacated and declared to be abandoned,” and the ordinances authorizing the same should be null and void. Town council subsequently passed an ordinance locating a new street according to said general plan, and instructing the street commissioner to cause said street to be opened “immediately after this ordinance goes into effect.” No damages having been assessed or paid to A., an owner of property thrbugh which the street ran, he filed a bill to restrain tire opening thereof.</p>

The Act of 1873 does not lessen the number of these requisites. Although the Act of 1873 was offered in evidence by the counsel for complainant the counsel for respondent relies upon it greatly. He has offered in evidence, to show.a compliance with its terms, an ordinance of councils, approved September 29th, 1873, which enacts: ‘That C street is hereby located from the Allegheny river to the eastern side of- the borough, according to the plan in the recording regulator’s office. Section 2d, that the street commissioner be and is hereby instructed to cause the said street to be opened from the Allegheny river to the eastern side of the borough, immediately after this ordinance goes into effect, and that the said street be taken, and be allowed to be a public highway, for the same use and purpose as the other streets, lanes and alleys of said borough.’ This was objected to because no evidence has been introduced showing that C street was laid out, and that it is of itself incompetent. With the rejection of the general plan this ordinance itself becomes dependent. Before it will authorize the opening of C street it must show a compliance with all the requirements of the Act of 1848. While it recites that C street ‘ is hereby located,’ that seems to be merely a formal promise, the ordinance being entitled‘an ordinance for the opening of C street.’ If the words ‘ according to the plan in the regulator’s office,’ with the fact that the general plan was at the time in the regulator’s office, would do away with the necessity of depositing a new plan in' the recording regulator’s office, still a re-advertisement would be necessary to notify the citizens under the Act. The ordinance allows no time nor opportunity to apply ‘ at the next term ’ of the Quarter Sessions, for the street commissioner is instructed to cause <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>the said street to be opened ‘ immediately after the ordinance goes into effect.’ The Master rules against the admission of the ordinance for the reasons given,.....and concludes that complainant is entitled to have the prayer of his bill granted.”</p>

It has not been denied that the legislature had power to validate a plan of streets for the borough. The Act authorizes the passing of all ordinances that may be necessary for opening any part or parts of any street included in a described plan. On its face appears no intent that it shall operate retrospectively; it recognizes the plan and confers so large powers with reference thereto that practically it is made the general plan of the borough. Without surmise as to the words which should be read in the place of “and do,”’ it is clear that it is not the intendment that the plan and all ordinances for opening streets shall be void in default of payment of damages, as required, which <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>may result from the opening of a part or the whole of any particular street.

Nor is it necessary to consider whether owners of land on the lines of the streets, lanes and alleys included in said plan, would have lost their right to recover damages by suffering' the term of court to pass without application, had the ordinance, merely approving the plan, been recorded.</p>

It was contemplated by the Act of 1873 that there would be no immediate necessity for opening all the streets included in the plan, and power was conferred to pass an ordinance for opening part or parts of any street. In case of an ordinance providing for the opening, where the owner of land on the line of the street, or part thereof to be opened, had not already proceeded for settlement of damages, or had not done some act that would bar his recovery, he is entitled to notice of the ordinance and may demand damages in the mode provided by the statute. By the terms of the Act of 1848, the “ council, so soon as they shall have caused payment of the damages assessed to be made to the persons entitled to receive the same, according to the report of the viewers, returned to said court and confirmed by the same, may proceed to cause such street, lane or alley to be opened forthwith.” Moreover, since January, 1874, a municipal corporation, invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use, shall make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction of highways, which compensation shall be paid or secured before such taking, injury or destruction.</p>

The Act erecting the town of Verona into a borough vests the power to enact ordinances in the town council, the burgess cannot veto, and he is not directed to sign ordinances. Ordinances authorized by the Act of 1873, we think, may be passed in the usual mode, by the council. After the enactment the duty of the burgess begins. We are not convinced that the ordinance, approved September 27th, 1873, was without the powers of the council, except so much as directs the street commissioner to immediately open the street.
