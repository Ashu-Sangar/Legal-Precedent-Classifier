He testified that by reason of A.’s default, he was unable to fill orders he had on hand at the time of the breach. In an action by A. against B. to recover the price of the foods actually delivered, the court instructed the jury (1) that the efendant was entitled to set off the excess paid by him over the contract price for a portion of the deficient bottles which he purchased in the market, and (2) as to so much of the deficient quantity as he was unable to purchase in the market, he was entitled to set off his actual loss sustained by not having such quantity furnished to him, viz., the difference between the contract price of the bottles he was to pay his vendor, and what loss he sustained in his own manufacture by not receiving the advance on the contract price upon any contracts he had himself made in reliance upon the fulfilment of the contract by the vendor:</p>

In submitting the case to the jury, the learned judge assumed there had been a breach of the contract by plaintiff below in failing to furnish, a considerable portion of the bottles called for by the contract; and that defendant was entitled to set off the damages fie had sustained thereby. As to the measure of damages, the instructions were quite as favorable to defendant as he could reasonably ask, and no exception to the charge was taken by either party. .The only' question of fact involved in the case was <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>fairly submitted' to the jury.
