Plea, payment, etc. and a special plea of sefroff that plaintiff’s intestate was indebted to defendant in a larger sum than that claimed in this suit, and defendant claimed a certificate in his favor for the balance due him. The claim of set-off was set forth substantially as follows: — The firm of J. M. Lupfer &amp; Co., tanners, was composed of Joseph M. Lupfer, plaintiff’s intestate, and James W. Lupfer; the defendant as commission merchant, received from said firm certain leather on sale, and made to said firm certain advances: the firm was dissolved, by the death of Joseph M. Lupfer, on February 19th, 1875, on which date the balance due defendant by said firm, after deducting all credits for leather sold and on hand, amounted to $73,000. The said James W. Lupfer was at the time of the said dissolution of the firm insolvent, and since 1878 has not resided or been in this 'state. Replication denying the payment etc.; rejoinder, <em>de injuria.</em>

Under tbe pleadings, bis claim arose as a set-off, and tbe settlement of plaintiff’s claim voluntarily extinguished bis right to recover under tbe plea of set-off so far as this action is concerned. If tbe defendant bad any right to proceed in tbe cause after tbe extinguishment of plaintiff’s claim, then manifestly it was, under the pleadings, for a certificate for amount in excess of plaintiff’s claim by way of <em>set-off. </em>It has long been tbe settled law of this state that in an action by A against B, tbe defendant cannot set off an account for goods sold to A and another as partners: McDowell <em>v. </em>Tyson, 14 S. &amp; R., 300; Archer <em>v. </em>Dunn, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20361" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 361">2 W. &amp; S., 361</a>; Jackson <em>v. </em>Clymer, <a href="/pa/43/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="43 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="483221" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0079-01">43 Pa.

In that case as here, Walker was a non-resident, bad subsequently died, and bis estate was insolvent, all of which was urged in support of tbe claim, but it was" held that tbe claim of Eytb was bis separate estate, and be bad a right to appropriate to bis separate creditors. To allow set-off in this case would permit defendant to defeat plaintiff’s claim by a claim against tbe partnership and thereby compel the other partners to pay the debt of tbe member of tbe firm out of tbe partnership funds to tbe prejudice of tbe others. Tbe administrator would also be concluded by the judgment on this verdict, and defendant permitted to participate in tbe distribution of the estate of plaintiff’s intestate as a separate creditor.

It follows that in an action by Joseph M. Lupfer, in bis lifetime, against Wood, tbe latter under tbe defalcation Act could have set off Ms claim against Lupfer’s firm. Although tbe decisions in Pennsylvania are not in harmony on this question, tbe latest case is directly to tbe point as just stated: Domestic Sewing Machine Co. <em>v. </em>Saylor, 5 Norris, 287. TMs case undoubtedly overrules tliree of the five cases cited by plaintiff <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>in error, namely: McDowell <em>v. </em>Tyson, Archer <em>v. </em>Dunn aud Milliken <em>v. </em>Gardner. The' last of them was cited to the court in the Sewing Machine Case, and the other two seem to have been overlooked. Justice Paxson, after reviewing many of the cases, concludes : “ That such indebtedness may be set off is too plain for argument.” The only subject for regret is that this court did not explicitly overrule Milliken <em>v. </em>Gardner, and other similar cases, which remain (as is shown by the brief of the plaintiff in error) as pit-falls to entrap the unwary.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[252,800,1170,329]]]'>Wood also could have recovered in equity, on his firm debt, against the administrator of Joseph M.

It follows that in this action of assumpsit, by Jos. M. Lupfer’s administrator against Wood, the latter may set off his claim against the firm of which Jos. M. Lupfer was a member.</p>
    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[251,1140,1173,1247]]]'>But whatever may have been the common law or equity doctrine, the question has .been definitely settled by the Act of April 11th, 1848, (P. L., 536) section 4 of which provides “ In any suit or suits which may hereafter be brought against the executors or administrators of a deceased co-partner for the debt of the firm, it shall not be necessary to aver on the record or prove on the trial that the surviving partner or partners is or are insolvent, to enable the plaintiff to recover.” And it has been decided that the effect of the Act is to render a deceased partner’s estate liable in the first instance, whether the survivor be solvent or insolvent — and with good reason; for though the surviving partner be solvent he may not be within reach of the creditor: Brewster’s adm’r <em>v. </em>Sterrett, 8 Cas., 118; Moore’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/34/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="34 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="417973" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0411-01">34 Pa. St., 411</a>; Ferguson <em>v. </em>Wright, 61 Id., 258; Lewis <em>v. </em>Cuthbertson, 11 S. &amp; R., 49. A plea- in abatement by Blair to Wood’s set-off, averring nonjoinder of the surviving partner would not have availed him (or Lupfer, if the action or set-off had been against him in his life time) under the provisions of section 5, of the above Act of April 11th, 1848. It will be observed that this verdict does not in any way establish the right of Wood to obtain the assets belonging to the estate of Joseph M. Lupfer. No execution can issue on the judgment to be entered upon this verdict against the administrator. Wood’s only remedy is in the Orphans’ Court of Huntingdon County where Lupfer was domiciled, and the only object of obtaining this judgment is to enable Mm to prove his claim satisfactorily before the Auditor in that county. The judgment does not affect the claims of other creditors of Lupfer if any, firm or separate.</p>

For the purpose of action against the representative, the debt is treated as if it was the individual debt of the decedent: Brewster’s Adm’r <em>v. </em>Sterrett, 8 Casey, 115. The estate of the decedent becomes liable for the whole debt of the firm of which he was a member : Moore’s Appeals, 10 Id., 411. In the class of cases to which this Act applies, its purpose is to make the indebtedness several, which was joint before: Miller <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 Id., 244.
