The Act of <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>March certainly provided for stockholders’ tickets, which were to be transferable. And it is just as certain that the transferable character of such tickets was taken away by the Act of May. First, the word “transferable” is omitted, and instead of the said seat or seats to be located in any part of the house the said stockholders may “ choose,” we have in the later Act the words “ and the directors shall set apart for the exclusive use of persons holding such number of shares, a portion of the house which the said directors shall deem sufficient for the-convenient accommodation of such holders.” The contest here is, who are .entitled to the privilege of seats in the portion set apart by the directors? It must be conceded that this proviso confines it to holders of shares, but the difficulty is in determining who are holders of shares within the meaning of the charter.</p>

The regulations of the Academy permit the issue of annual tickets to the persons whose names are on the stock-book as the owners of five shares each. The other defendants, owning many shares, transfer their stock in lots of five shares, and procure annual tickets in the names of their respective transferees. They take from the transferees, powers of attorney to transfer the stock, and deliver to them the annual tickets. Often the transferees do not see the certificates of stock and never have possession of them; they pay a consideration, but it is in no wise adequate for the stock, and it is simply a payment for a stockholder’s seat or privilege to a seat. The transaction between the defendant and the transferees, stripped bare, is simply the sale of a seat. The transfer of stock is simply to give to such sale the similitude of a real transfer, so as to apparently comply with the law and regulation in order to procure the issue of a stockholder’s ticket to the purchaser of a seat, without that purchaser becoming the owner of stock.</p>

Each says, “I am the absolute owner of one huudred and twenty shares (this is Mr. Barge’s answer; in Mr. Baker’s answer the number is fixed at four hundred and twenty) of the stock of the corporation defendant, which is <em>clear and free of all incumbrance </em>whatever, some of ■ which is temporarily in the names of various holders, and I own all of them.for all the purposes and rights to which I am entitled under its charter.” If this is so it is difficult to see to what the transferees have a right. Indeed the continuance of the privilege for which they have paid is only because of the grace of the defendants. Section 6 of the Act of 24th March, 1852 requires the transfer of .stock upon power of attorney, and gives to the trans<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>ferees the privileges of the former holders. It seems that this section would require the issue of a ticket to the transferee, notwithstanding there was a ticket outstanding. It is clear that the right to a seat could be destroyed by the exercise of the power, and it is probable that it could be conferred upon another.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[145,667,1179,1038]]]'>Notwithstanding all this, it is contended the stock book is the only and conclusive evidence as to who are the .holders of the stock. It does not seem proper that cases which relate only to the commercial aspect, of the status, the rights and liabilities of stockholders, should control here. For most purposes those cases establish that the stock book is the proper test as to who are stockholders. Before following such cases, we should inquire if there is anything in the nature and history of this corporation, and in the nature and reason of the privilege now in controversy, that will aid us. The proof establishes that the company was organized to provide a more convenient place for operatic and dramatic performances than then existed in the city; that the enterprise was not expected to be pecuniarily profitable, and that in fact it has not been. It is apparent that the object of the two provisos was to give something to those who invested their money independently of the remote chance of a dividend. It was one of the only two advantages that could accrue to stockholders beyond other citizens which could induce the investment of money, and if the original stocMiolders were gifted with prescience it was the only inducement. It was thus annexed to a substantial share in the enterprise. The exercise of such a privilege in a building is more consistent with the character of an owner than with any other.</p>

This repeal should be held a prohibition of anything that is in substance a mere transfer. To say that the transfers in question are sufficient to carry the privilege, would authorize weekly or daily transfers, carrying with them the rights to tickets, and precisely the state of affairs foreseen and provided against in the repeals would occur; that is, the admission of persons not interested in the enterprise and the crowding of the house. To provide adequate room for all such <em>stockholder^, </em>if the practice became general, would make the Academy most undesirable to managers, and probably be fatal to its continuance as a place of amusement.</p>

This ordinarily would be fatal to the bill; but it is here complained that the corporation defendant is violating its charter in permitting the other defendants to make colorable transfers of stock as a cover to the sale of stockholders’ privilege.

    <p id="b534-9" data-blocks='[["BL_534.12",534,[274,1232,1183,777]]]'>.The learned counsel for the appellants have with much candor propounded the question for decision, as one which includes in it the fact of an understanding at the time of the transfer of the stock in question, that the same stock should be re-transferred at the close of the season, and that this was enforced by a delivery of the stock by the transferee to the transferer, together with an irrevocable power of attorney to make sucia transfer. It is as well, perhaps, to add, what is quite undisputed, that the ticket of admissioia for the season was to be delivered to the transferee, and retained by him, while the stock certificate was to be retained by the transferer from the beginning, in other words during the whole life of the contract. And on the other hand the stock was to stand ostensibly upon the books of .the corporation in the name of the transferee. These considerations relieve the case of any inquiry as to the intent of the parties in making the transaction. The intent lies upon the surface and is practically averred in the statement of the question.</p>

But when the legal or equitable rights of others are affected, and the intervention of the courts is solicited, the question <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>arises how are they to treat the transaction. According to its real or its seeming character ? According to the actual, or according to the apparent facts only, of the situation? There are, it is true, exceptional times and occasions when even the tribunals adopt and act upon fictions. But these are for benign and innocent purposes, rendered necessary by the due administration of justice. In all other circumstances courts, whether of law or equity, must base their action upon the actual facts of the cases which come before them, so nearly as these can be ascertained. In the case now before us there was perhaps a sufficiency of facts and of probable legal right to warrant the appellants in undertaking their transactions. The peculiar character of the privilege which they sought to utilize was such that they might with perfect propriety avail themselves of it with pecuniary advantage, if practicable, without the least imputation of moral or social delinquency. We see no occasion for the slightest intimation or belief of any dishonorable or fraudulent purpose on the part of the appellants in these transactions. But we must deal with these according to their real facts. It cannot be doubted that both at law and in equity the title to the shares in question was in the transferrers at all times. They held the certificates of stock and they held also the executed powers of attorney for its transfer. • The transferees had not purchased the stock. No money was to be paid to them when the re-transfer was made upon the books. They were to do nothing in order to complete the re-transfer. That which they did buy, to wit, tickets of admission, they received, held and used. They have no right, and did not and could not, under the contract, claim any right, to anything more than this. They could not assert any ownership of any kind, legal or equitable, to the stock which the certificates represented. Why then shall we treat them as ■owners or holders? Because it is said the stock stood in their names on the books of the corporation. But the whole effect of that fact is evidentiary only. It is some evidence, <em>prima facie </em>evidence, of ownership. But this <em>prima facies </em>sives way instantly to proof of the actual ownership. As a mere technical fact it is of no avail against an opposing possession of the certificate, together with an executed power of attorney for its transfer. The force of the fact of registry disappears, therefore, and is nugatory in the face of the other facts. Of course there are circumstances in which the registered title is sufficient for certain purposes. Upon it votes may be cast and dividends paid, and in special situations innocent purchasers may be protected. But these cases are exceptional and do not in any degree affect the present. Nor do we see how the understanding that the re-transfer shall not be made till the <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>end of the season can change the question of ownership. It is but a postponement of the time when the holder of the certificate may change the registered title from another to himself. It does not affect the actual title conferred by the real ownership of the stock,by the possession of the certificate, and by the executed and delivered power of attorney. It is but an agreement that the one <em>prima facie </em>fact of registry shall remain as it is, to wit, a <em>prima facie </em>fact only, during the stipulated period. After all has been said, and all theories exhibited and exhausted, we must fall back to the inquiry, who is the real, actual owner and holder of the stock, and to that question there can be but the one answer. For by the terms of the law which authorizes the issue of tbe tickets they can only be given to <em>holders </em>of stock. How can we possibly say that this means persons who seem to be holders, or who are apparently holders, or who possess one <em>indicium </em>of holdership ? How can a court, construing the law, say it means anything else than actual, real, true holders ? It is not possible in any view of the case. We are not dealing with a shadow but with a substance. This is not a controversy over possible rights acquired innocently under a deceptive appearance of title, or in spite of facts which an opposing party is estopped from asserting. On the contrary the parties dealt at arms length with their eyes open, and virtually attempted to create a position by means of which they could defeat the substance of a statute by a nominal adherence to its letter. Between themselves this might avail, and equity might refuse to hear either complaining of the other. But between them and others, strangers whose rights become implicated, the question is entirely different. These latter may stand upon their strictest rights, and may set up whatever obstacles are within their reach against interference with them. It seems to us that is this case. The plaintiffs are co-stockholders with the defendants of whose acts they complain. The Master has found, upon sufficient testimony, the fact of the injury in the manner described in the bill. It is not an injury which can be compensated in damages, it is continuing in its character, and it is the invasion, in fact at times the practical deprivation of a right. These considerations bring the case within equitable cognizance under well established rules. We quite agree with the Master and the learned court as to the propriety of the decree awarded, and therefore affirm it.</p>

It is true the practice of issuing tickets of admission in similiar circumstances had long prevailed. But as it worked no practical injury to the plaintiffs <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>they were scarcely subjected to a duty to litigate for their rights. The practice only prevailed to an extent sufficient to affect the rights of the plaintiffs for two or three years before suit brought, and we do not think a delay during such a period of entering into litigation which most persons wisely dread, can be called laches. On the other hand the two principal defendants might well say that they did but follow an example which had been set and followed for a number of years without objection. Of course they might nevertheless incur the penalty of costs, but the discretion of the court below has imposed them upon the corporation, which at least sanctioned and participated in the objectionable practice, and we do not feel warranted in interfering with that discretion.</p>
