It was not the lien of the claim that was revived, but the judgment given by, the court upon the scire facias sur claim, after due service by posting and advertising. Since the subject of revival of January 20th, 1883, was the lien of a judgment and not the lien of a claim, the Acts of 16th of April, 1845, and 16th of June, 1836, cited by plaintiff in error, have no application to this case.

The Act then goes on, “ shall continue a lien on the real estate of the defendant for the term of five years from the day of entry or revival thereof; <em>and no judgment shall continue a lien on such real estate for a longer period than five years </em>from the day on which such judgment shall be entered or revived, unless revived within that period, etc., etc.”</p>

They were then discussing the interpretation of the above words as they appeared in the Act of April 4th, 1798, which the Act of 1827 supplemented and re-enacted. In delivering the opinion of the court, Huston, J., said: “No judgment shall continue a lien, etc., then has no relation to the defendant in the judgment; it ■ leaves the rights of plaintiff, as to him, precisely as they were before 1798; but it limits the right of a creditor (unless he revives his judgment according to the Act and its supplement) to five years, as respects those who purchase or acquire subsequent liens on lands bound by the judgment.”</p>

The creditor might have execution of it in the hands of his debtor at any indefinite period, while the judgment remained unpaid. Thus stood the law in Pennsylvania till the statute of 1798 restrained the lien of a judgment to a period of five years; but only in favor of purchasers from the debtor, and judgment creditors in his life-time; it left it without bound or limit against every one else.” See also Brown’s Appeal, 10 Norris, 485; Hinds <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2019" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Jones 19">1 Jones, 19</a>; Irvine <em>v. </em>Nixon, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20419" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Jones 419">1 Jones, 419</a>. In Hinds <em>v. </em>Scott (1849), a review is made by Mr. Justice Bell of the cases prior to that time, in which the above doctrine is laid down, and he expresses his surprise that any difference of opinion could exist with reference to the matter. These decisions have been re-affirmed in the late case of McCahan <em>v. </em>Elliott, 7 Out., 637, Chief Justice Meuour delivering the opinion of the court, and saying: “The lien of a judgment, so far as concerns purchasers or intervening incumbrances, expires at the end of five years, yet <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>such is not the case with the defendant in the judgment.

And as the lien was never lost, the sci. fa. to revive issued after the five years had expired, was properly issued. It was properly a sci. fa. quaere executionem non, its office being to give warning to defendant, before an execution could issue, and only necessary for that purpose, as the lien had never been lost.</p>

This is shown by the fact that the cases cited by plaintiff refer to the revival of the lien of the claim, and not to the revival of the lien of the judgment obtained by the due prosecution by scire facias upon that claim. Had plaintiff in error comprehended the distinction between these writs, we believe that this case would never have reached this court, nor would the attempt have been made by a Christian church to evade the payment of a just debt, to which there is no defence, by means of a technicality.</p>

A scire facias to revive in the ordinary form is properly issued after the judgment is obtained. It appears, then, that municipal claims are to be “ revived by scire facias in the manner provided by law in the case of mechanics’ claims,” and mechanics’ claims are to be “revived by scire facias in the manner provided by law in the case of a judgment.” The method of procedure is thus defined, but although revival is effected in the same form, the lien of the claim, either before or after judgment thereon, is of a widely different nature from that of an ordinary judgment.</p>

There is still a subsisting liability on the part of the defendant which will sustain an action, and scire facias is the form of action prescribed by law. But a mechanics’ or municipal lien does not purport to be for the debt of the defendant; it is a proceeding against the property for the debt of the property; it involves no personal obligation whatever ;.the proceeding for its enforcement is purely <em>in rem; </em>it is a specific property lien, and when that lien is lost against the property it is a lien against nothing, whilst it -is for the personal debt of no one. No action in the form of scire facias, therefore, can be sustained upon it. We are thus enabled to appreciate the full force and meaning of the phrase “ and so from one such period to another,” employed in the 24th section of the Act of 1836. • It is in that section provided that in case the lien of the debt or claim shall have been revived, as a judgment is revived, within five years by writ of scire facias, “such lien shall continue in like manner for another period of five years, <em>and so from one such period to another </em>unless such lien be satisfied,” &amp;c.
