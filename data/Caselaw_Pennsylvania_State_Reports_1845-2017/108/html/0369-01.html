The party stopped, looked and listened, hut neither saw nor heard any approaching train. Thereupon they started across, the women a little ahead, carrying an umbrella. When the women got on the fourth track they saw a passenger train approaching close upon them. They hurried over and were uninjured. A., just behind them, was struck by the engine and killed. The track was straight for some distance each side of the crossing. There was a freight train standing just alcove the crossing, on the fifth track, with an engine attached, from which were issuing smoke and steam. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the bell was rung or whistle blown on the passenger engine. In an action by A.’s wife against the company for damages:</p>

    <p id="b388-6" data-blocks='[["BL_388.8",388,[223,709,1185,1027]]]'>Neither assignment of error is sustained. Under the evidence the question of contributory negligence was' properly for the jury. At the place where Garvey attempted to cross there were five tracks. There is evidence that on coming to the railroad, with 1ns wife and another woman, they stopped, looked and listened, and saw rip sign of an approaching train and heard no locomotive. They started across the tracks, the women a little ahead of Garvey, the women crossing safely. In crossing the fourth 'track just behind'them, he was struck by a passing train and killed. It cannot be declared as a rule of law that he must stop, look and listen between the different tracks lying close to each other. Indeed to so stop instead of hastening to cross all of them, might have been evidence of negligence. He did not stop the second time to listen. Whether it was less dangerous to move continuously across the tracks, than to loiter between them was a question for the jury. Naturally solicitous for the safety of his wife, who was a little in advance of him, and intent on getting her out of danger, he may not have given as much thought to protecting himself from the rapidly approaching train as he otherwise could have done. If so however it cannot be held to be negligence in. law. The jury to which the case was submitted is the proper tribunal to determine whether it was negligence in fact.</p>
