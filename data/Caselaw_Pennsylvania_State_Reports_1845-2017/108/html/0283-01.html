    <p class="summary" id="b301-8" data-blocks='[["BL_301.8",301,[191,1041,1180,1035]]]'>The law is so well settled in Pennsylvania that it is within the power of the legislature to remove the taint of illegitimacy and to enable a bastard to take, transmit and inherit property, as if he had been born in lawful wedlock, that it is not necessary to discuss the question. It will be sufficient to refer to the cases of Killam <em>v. </em>Killam, 3 Wr., 120; Miller’s Appeal, 2 P. F. S., 113; McGunnigle <em>v. </em>McKee, 27 Id., 81. Nor does this power seem unjust or unreasonable when it is •considered that by the Act of legitimation, the legislature is not conferring upon the bastard a right which by nature he did not have, but it is only singling out an individual and bestowing upon 1dm that of which for the public good of the state, it has seen fit to deprive generally the class .to which he belongs. The transmission of property by will or otherwise, and the taking by inheritance not being of natural right, but existing only under the law, and this privilege having been restricted in the. case of those born outside of what the law holds as lawful wedlock, it is of course within the power of the legislative body to remove the restriction which the law imposes, and confer upon any one all the privileges which but for that restriction he would have had. To this power of the legislative body to remove the legal taint of blood there is in Pennsylvania but one exception, namely, that in so doing they shall not divest any rights which have once vested.</p>

Wistar, within the terms of the original deed of trust, and, second, whether the property conveyed and granted by Elizabeth Wistar, the original settlor, had so vested in any one prior to the date of the act of legitimation, that to award it to Thomas M. Wistar would be a violation of the constitutional provision.</p>

      <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>It will be proper to consider the second of these first, as being the more readily answered. Elizabeth Wistar by the deed of trust, upon the termination of the life estate given her son R. M. Wistar, granted the property in question to his lawfully begotten children or grandchildren. Until the death therefore of the said R. M. Wistar, the person or persons who were to take upon the termination of the life estate remained indeterminate. Up to that period it was always possible by the marriage of the life tenant and his death, leaving issue, that the remainder should vest in some one or more of that class provided for by the deed of trust, and until that event no resulting trust could arise from failure of a proper person to take the remainder; nor as a matter of fact was there any one at the time the Act of legitimation was passed in existence, whose rights would be invaded by placing Thomas M. Wistar in the position of a full legitimate son of Richard M. Wistar. If then the claimant is not excluded by the terms of the deed of trust, his claim to the property in question is made out. -</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[228,1159,1171,981]]]'>But it was urged in the argument that whatever other rights the Act of legitimation might give to Thomas M. Wistar, he was excluded by the very words of the original deed of trust from making any claim upon the funds therein granted. The words used and upon which counsel mainly rested his case, are “ and in case he shall die leaving lawfully begotten children or grandchildren,” and it was said that by the use of these words the settlor clearly intended to exclude those who were not actually born in wedlock. But it seems to the Auditor these words “ lawfully begotten ” cannot be distinguished from those other expressions such as “heir” or “lawful issue,” which have been held to include those who have been legitimated ; for as the disqualifications of bastardy are of civil institution only and do not intrinsically weaken the natural ties of kindred, by the words “lawfully begotten,” can only be meant begotten in accordance with the law, that is to say in the manner that the law prescribes, and although it may be true that at the actual time of begetting or of the birth the forms prescribed by law had not been complied with yet, since these forms are but the creatures of the law, it is in the power of the legislative body to declare them unnecessary and to validate that which but for the law would have been good and valid without these forms.</p>

He must be presumed to have known the legislative power to declare who should be an heir. He therefore intended to subject the property devised to legislative discretion, to enact within constitutional limits whether Thomas had issue capable of inheriting.” Equally must Elizabeth Wistar, the original settlor, be presumed to have known the legislative power to remove the legal taint of blood and to declare the legitimacy as if it never had been, just as in the case of a reversal of an attainder for treason.</p>

How can we impeach the union between the parents whatever it was since the legislature has made it lawful? ” What difference is there between this and the case in hand ? How do we know that Thomas M.

If the intention of the settlor is clearly expressed in the deed, and if that intention was a lawful one at the date of the deed, it must be .followed. If she has given property to A. and A. is competent to take it, no Act of the legislature can give it to B. The settlor in her deed defined the capacity to take, among the possible children of her son Richard, and said that those of his children who should take her estate must be “ lawfully begotten.” There can not be any doubt as to the meaning of these words. They have been used in wills, deeds and other legal instruments from time immemorial, and never with any but the one signification. They mean that the person or persons whom. they describe must be conceived in lawful wedlock. The Auditor has found as a fact that the appellee was not so born, and, therefore was outside of the limitations of the deed, but by a process of reasoning, which is very much like a trick of legerdemain, he has succeeded in reaching the conclusion that the appellee ought to have the estafe.

The efficiency of the Act to accomplish its purpose, he being the veritable son of Richard, makes his conception as lawful as his birth; to both were then imparted a quality of lawfulness in relation to the rest of society which had been withheld by restrictive legislation .at. the time of their actual occurrence, and in the legal exercise of its discretion the supreme power removed its own restriction.

The argument that the Act, if given the effect we claim for it, would divest vested rights, is unsound, because no resulting trust could arise at the date of the trust deed, nor until there is default of persons to take under its limitations. If Thomas M. Wistar had been born in lawful wedlock on the date of the Act, his title to take would not be disputed, yet the same argument would apply. Shaffer <em>v. </em>Eneu, cited by plaintiff in error, does not apply, as adopted children have not identity of blood with the adopting parent, nor does the Act relating to adoptions attempt the impossibility of making them children by blood. Here there is identity of blood; the law which places a disability upon a bastard, may remove the disability with the same effect as if it never existed: Johnson’s Appeal, 7 Norris, 346.</p>

Morris in trust. The ultimate benefi-' ciaries of the fee are there described as “ lawfully begotten children or grandchildren ” of Richard M. Wistar, who was the son of Elizabeth Wistar and the <em>cestui que trust </em>for life of the property which produced the fund in court. The question is whether the appellee Thomas M. Wistar is a “lawfully begotten ” child of Richard M. Wistar. He is the illegitimate son of Richard M. Wistar and was legitimated by an Act of Assembly passed in April 1858. There is no doubt that by force of this Act he became the heir of Richard M. Wistar and would be capable of inheriting from him to the same extent as if he had been born in lawful wedlock. Under several of our decisions he could take under the description of “issue,” “lawful issue,” “heir,” or “person entitled under the intes<a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>tate laws ” : Killam <em>v. </em>Killam, 3 Wr. 120; Miller’s Appeal, 2 P. F. S. 113; McGunnigle <em>v. </em>McKee, 27 Id., 81; Johnson’s Appeal, 7 Norr. 346. But the persons who take this fund do not take title from Richard M. Wistar. They must found their title upon the deed from Elizabeth Wistar to Israel W. Morris. It was she who created the estate and by the deed in question. She gave the property to Morris in trust for her son Richard M. Wistar during his life, and after his death to his “ lawfully begotten” children or grandchildren. We must regard this language as <em>descriptio personarum. </em>It describes the fact which shall characterize the ultimate beneficiaries. They must be “lawfully begotten.” It is not enough that they have a legal status, that they may have inheritable blood from their father, that they may be his “ heirs,” or Iris “ lawful issue.” Unless they are lawfully begotten children they do not fill the essential requirement of the deed of trust. It is undoubtedly true that Thomas M. Wister was not “ lawfully begotten ” by his father. It is equally true that it is not possible for any legislature to make that a fact which is not a fact. Legislation can confer legitimacy upon illegitimates, but it can not alter the facts of nature. In Schafer <em>v. </em>Eneu, 4 P. F. S. 304, we applied this doctrine strictly, holding that a devise over to “ children,” after a life estate to their mother, would not embrace children who were adopted by the life tenant. We see no difference in principle between that ease and this. Both are governed by the same idea. The ultimate takers of the estate do not derive their title by descent from their parent, but by purchase from the original grantor. In view of that consideration they must correspond to the description contained in the deed. Where that description defines merely a legal status it includes all who hold the status, but where it defines a fact, those only can claim its inclusion who conform to the fact. Thomas M. Wistar is not within that category in this case, and therefore is not entitled to the fund.</p>
