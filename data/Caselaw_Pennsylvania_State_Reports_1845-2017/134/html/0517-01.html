It does not appear that, in any of the negotiations, the fact that the defendant was acting as trustee or executor was mentioned. It is not uncommon for an agent to bind himself personally, looking to his principal for indemnity; and, in this case, the defendant had a personal interest, aside from his interest as trustee and executor, and this was a sufficient motive, as well as a sufficient consider<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>ation for making a personal promise. The assignment, it is true, was made to him as trustee. The terms of the trust upon which the land was devised to the defendant have already been quoted, and we think it apparent without argument that they did not give the defendant power to bind the other beneficiaries by a promise of this nature. A trustee can be held personally for materials ordered by him for the trust estate and on contracts made by him in its behalf, unless there be a special agreement to look only to the trust, and this is a question of fact: Perry on Trusts, 437; 1 Parsons on Cont., 102; Ell v.

The express powers given to these executors, although broad, are not unlimited.

Was this necessary or convenient in the execution of the will of the testator? We think not. Annexed to the contract was a confession of judgment, which gave them the means of recovering the land itself, or the balance of the purchase money by a sale of the land, notwithstanding the mechanics’ lien. On the face of the case, then, it is plain that it was neither necessary nor convenient for the executors to agree to pay this debt, in order to avoid tedious and expensive litigation, or for any other purpose.</p>

If such was the fact, and if that fact would of itself discharge the defendant from personal liability to the plaintiff, it was the defendant’s duty to show it.

The mere fact of want of authority in a trustee to bind the estate, will not make him personally liable in cases of executory contract where the facts show that no such liability was intended by either of the parties : Perry on Trusts, 437. The fact relied on by the defendant is that the assignment was made to him as trustee, and if he had authority under the will, as executor to bind the estate generally, or as trustee to bind the other beneficiaries, this fact might possibly justify the inference that both parties understood that he made the promise in one or the other of those capacities, but as he did not have such authority we do not think it necessary to <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>infer an intention to contract otherwise than according to the terms of the promise; namely, personally.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[259,472,1167,1217]]]'>The third question raised by the exceptions is whether the contract is within the statute of frauds ? The plaintiffs’ counsel suggests that the statute does not apply, because the promise was not made to the creditor and the suit stands in the name of Fehlinger, the promisee. The English rule is thus stated: “ The promise must be made to the creditor; i. e. to the person to whom another is already or is thereafter to become liable: ” DeColyar on Guaranties, 110. This was first decided in Eastwood v. Kenyon, 11 A. &amp; E. 445L_) “ Another important exception to the statute of frauds,” says an American writer, “ is the ease of a promise to pay another’s debt, made, not to the creditor, but to that other; this engagement, both in England and America, is, with little dissent, regarded as not being a guaranty within the terms of the statute: ” 1 Refid on Stat. of Frauds, §76. In King v. Shoemaker, 1 Pears. 206, Judge Pearson cites a large number of cases to show that this is the American rule. The promise was to the debtor, but the suit was brought in the name of the creditor. The Supreme Court in reversing the judgment said: “The decided weight of authority and of reason declares that though such a contract is valid between the immediate parties to it, it is void as a contract in favor of the creditors of one of them, unless they as part of the arrangement give up their original claims and accept the new contract: Shoemaker v.

But this proposition, like most others relating to the statute of frauds, has not gone without question, and we cannot say that it is settled in Pennsylvania that the mere fact that the promise was made to the debtor is, of itself, decisive. See American notes to Birkmyr v. Darnell, 1 Sm. L. C. 458-499. Be' that as it may, we think it entirely safe to say, that where there is a transfer of a fund to the promisor for the payment of the debt, he is liable on his verbal promise made to the owner of the fund; or, if property charged with the payment of the debt be transferred to him on his promise to the vendor to pay the debt, he is liable: Townsend v.

Where the leading object of the promisor is to sub-serve some interest or purpose of his own, notwithstanding the effect is to pay or discharge the debt of another, his promise is not within the statute: Nugent v.

    <p class="summary" id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.4",549,[214,580,1159,401]]]'>It is suggested that this case is not governed by the principles above stated, because the equitable title of Fehlinger was assigned to him as trustee, and not personally. We do not think this a valid ground for distinguishing the case, for the reason that he held the legal title in trust for himself and his brothers and sisters; he was a joint owner with them, and therefore had a personal interest and purpose to serve in procuring a surrender of the plaintiff’s title.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[215,989,1162,1314]]]'>We have thus far considered the case with reference to that clause of the statute relating to parol guaranties; it may be proper to add a word regarding the effect of the clause relating to promises by executors and administrators. It cannot be contended that the statute applies to every promise aliunde made by one who happened to be an executor or administrator, and the question has been discussed whether it applies to an executor’s promise to pay a debt of the estate incurred by him. The better opinion is that it may. One writer has stated the rule thus: “ The statute of frauds includes all liabilities resting upon the executor or administrator strictly in his representative character, and which, but for the promise, he would have been liable to discharge only in the due course of the administration of the estate; but not those which were originally incurred by him in consequence of some act of his own, although it was an official act:” Throop, Validity of Verbal Agreements, § 39. Another has suggested that this is the rule: “ All engagements of an administrator for the benefit of the estate he represents are within the statute, except for liabilities incurred fraudulently or carelessly by the administrator; for matters arising since the death of the decedent; or, generally, where he is only primarily liable, having a right to ultimate reimbursement out of the estate: ” 1 Reed on Stat. of Frauds, §§ 164-171. According to either statement of the rule, we think it results from what has heretofore been said that the defendant’s promise is not within the statute.</p>
