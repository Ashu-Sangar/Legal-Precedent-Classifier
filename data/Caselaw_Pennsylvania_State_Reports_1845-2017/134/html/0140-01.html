John F. Clark and Annie M. Shaffer, two of the children and devisees, were appointed executors of said will, with power and authority at their discretion to sell any or all the real estate of the testator at public or private sale. Under said will certain specific legacies are to be paid to the children of Michael S. Clark, deceased, and the share of Thomas N. Clark, one of the children of said testator, is to be conveyed and delivered to a trustee to be appointed by the Orphans’ Court of Clearfield county, Pennsylvania, who shall hold and invest said share and pay over or use the proceeds of the same, or so much of the principal thereof as the said Orphans’ Court may direct, for the sole benefit of said Thomas N.

The indebtedness of the estate is considerable, while the personal property is of small value. Over $8,000 of the indebtedness will have to be paid out of the proceeds of the real estate, but the executors, <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>who are desirous of making an application to sell the unseated lands in Clearfield and Cambria counties for the payment of the debts of testator, cannot conveniently do so until the litigation upon a certain judgment shall have been determined.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[268,543,1166,548]]]'>On September 3,1889, a little more than a month after the death of the testator, Thomas N. Clark, whose share as above stated was to be conveyed and delivered to a trustee, to be appointed by the Orphans’ Court of Clearfield county, made an application to the Orphans’ Court of Lycoming county for a writ of partition to divide the real estate of said testator. The writ was awarded by said court, without any notice to the devisees or executors mentioned in said last will and testament. No trustee had, at the time of said application, been appointed for said Thomas N. Clark, nor has any such trustee been since appointed.</p>

Shaffer, two of the children and the executors appointed by said testator, presented a petition to the Orphans’ Court of Lycoming county, setting forth the facts above stated and asking that the petition of said Thomas N. Clark for inquest to make partition,- and the proceedings thereon, be dismissed. The petition of the executors also denies that any notice of inquisition was ever given to the petitioners. No answer has been filed by said Thomas N. Clark, denying any of the facts alleged in the petition of the executors, and there seems to be no dispute as to any of the facts therein alleged. The question, therefore, to be determined is, whether the facts, as stated in the petition of the executors, are sufficient to justify us in dismissing the partition proceedings.</p>

It is the plain intention of the testator that Thomas N. Clark was to have no control whatever over his share of the estate. It is to be conveyed and delivered to a trustee to be appointed by the Orphans’ Court, and then the trustee is to act under the direction of said Orphans’ Court of Clearfield county in paying said Clark any part of the principal. Besides this, no time has been given the executors to take the necessary steps to administer the estate and adjust and liquidate the indebtedness. The proceedings, if continued, will burden the estate with un<a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>necessary expense, and cannot result in any benefit to tbe devisees and parties interested.
