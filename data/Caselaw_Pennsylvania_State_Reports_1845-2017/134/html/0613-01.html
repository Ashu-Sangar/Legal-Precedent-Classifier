J., the plaintiff proved his claim under the mortgage, dated April 4, 1882, for $4,000, with interest from October 4, 1887, and arrears of interest due prior to the date last mentioned. The defendant proved a tender of $4,226.05 on November 20,1888, and maintained, claiming that the $70 of interest, the only subject of controversy, was -not due to the plaintiff. In the testimony submitted it was made to appear that in March, 1882, the defendant was the owner of real estate subject to a mortgage for $3,300 held by F. Rumpflf &amp; Brother. Wishing to pay off this mortgage and for $700 himself, he called upon one John Ruhl, a conveyancer, who had an office at 512 Walnut street and was also a clerk to George Emlen, the agent of the Sepviva estate, to obtain a loan. Ruhl informed the defend<a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>ant that he could obtain the loan from said estate, and drew the new mortgage and bond, which was executed and delivered to the plaintiff, who paid to Ruhl the $4,000. Ruhl paid to the defendant $700, and was to apply $3,300 to the discharge of the old mortgage. The defendant paid Ruhl for drawing the bond and mortgage. On August 22, 1888, Rumpff &amp; Brother, having discovered that Ruhl had the money to be applied to their mortgage, demanded and received it from him and satisfied their mortgage. On February 21, 1883, the defendant paid six months interest due October 4, 1882, on the mortgage in suit, $100. On account of interest due April 4, 1883, he paid, May 15, 1883, $50, and June 19, 1883, $30, leaving $20 unpaid. On October 4, 1883, he owed $120, on account of which he paid $50, leaving due, as was claimed, $70, the subject of contention. Payments were made after that time, which were credited, leaving the disputed $70 remaining. The defendant testified that in 1882 or 1883, when he discovered that the Rumpff &amp; Brother mortgage had not been satisfied when it should have been, he claimed of Mr. Ruhl a deduction of $70 interest on the new mortgage, for the detention of the money by Ruhl, and that the latter said he “ would make it right,” and the defendant had all along claimed this allowance as due to him.</p>

There was some evidence, we think, to support this finding. It was certainly very slight; perhaps, however, it was sufficient to justify a submission to the jury. But, assuming the fact found by the jury, how does it appear that Aberle was injured? The loan was $4,000. Of this, Aberle received $700, at such times as he demanded it; and $3,300 was applied, according to his own directions, in satisfaction of the Rumpff mortgage. Aherle has thus received the whole of the money. He complains, however, that the loan from the Sepviva estate was effected by, and the money placed in the hands of Ruhl in March, and the Rumpff mortgage was not paid until August. But what of that ? The mortgage debt to Rumpff was $3,300, and the mortgage is satisfied. Aberle paid no part of it. He is not now responsible for any part of it. The mortgage is paid, and Ruhl paid it. It was Ruhl’s duty, doubtless, to have paid the money over to Rumpff in April, but if Rumpff was willing to forgive the fault and to accept the face of the mortgage in satisfaction of it in August, how was Aberle injured? The delay cost him nothing, and he is in no condition to complain. Ruhl promised to “ make it right,” and he did make it right with Rumpff. As the matter stands, Aberle appears to have gotten the full benefit of his loan, and he should be held to pay it in full, with interest.</p>
