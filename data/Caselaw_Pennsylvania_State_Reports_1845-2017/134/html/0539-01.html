Nicholson. </em>On the hearing, the defendants justified under a contract with the plaintiff authorizing them to enter and cut timber trees of certain sizes. The referee found, as facts, that part of the timber cut and converted by the defendants they were entitled to under the contract, but that other timber cut and removed by the defendants, the value of which was found, was not covered by the contract and belonged to the plaintiff. As matter of law, however, the referee found that, as the defendants had the right to enter and cut timber which belonged to them un<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>der the contract, trespass did not lie for the cutting and removal of that which belonged to the plaintiff, and this ruling was sustained by the court below. On writ of error to this court, at No. 47 January Term 1889, Sup. Ct., the conclusion of law reported by the referee and affirmed by the court below was reversed, with a procedendo: Shifter v.
