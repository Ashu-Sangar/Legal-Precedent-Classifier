Merriman had as cestui que trust, holding that the evidence of the plaintiff goes to the destruction of the trust, and hence the husband is incompetent as a witness against his wife. But the wife is not a party to this controversy, although interested in the result. Both the act of 1869, and § 5, (c), act of May 23,1887, P. L. 158 declares: “ Nor shall husband and wife be competent to testify against each other.” What does this mean — “testify against each other?” In <em>á </em>suit.between A. and B. a witness -who' is the wife of C., not a party, may prove a fact, and her husband could be called to disprove the same fact.

That a wife or husband cannot prove the adultery of each other, is to prevent bastardizing the issue. When this plaintiff is called to testify, he does so in his own behalf. His Avife is not a witness nor a party to the suit, but is affected by the result, simply because the declaration of trust gives her an interest. She is not a purchaser of her interest for value. She has no standing to complain of a revocation of the trust, because as held in Frederick’s App., <a href="/pa/52/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="52 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1002226" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0338-01">52 Pa. 338</a>, “ as to the children named in the grant, the deed being founded on no consideration from the trustees, was nudum pactum.” And, as the wife is not of the blood of the husband, and the children are, it follows that she cannot resist revocation of the deed; and when the husband is admitted to testify he in no wise antagonizes the interest of the wife, because she has no rights which the law is bound to respect. It is said in Gleghorne v. Gleghorne, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20395" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="118 Pa. 395">118 Pa. 395</a>, where the bill was filed by the wife against the husband, that the bill could not be sustained at all unless she was admitted to testify. But in that case she was not competent because she was plaintiff; but here she is not a party. The plaintiff here was competent to testify against the trustee defendant, as he did; but the master rejected his evidence in making up his report and in drawing his conclusions.

He says and swears that he was to have $50 per Aveek for his own and family’s support. If this was true, and omitted from the declaration of trust, equity would reform the trust by a decree giving him $50 per week; and in view of an apparent hardship we would be glad to do this. But his two brothers both swear, along with the defendant, that no such proposition was mentioned or agreed upon, and their testimony seems more reasonable, because it is manifest that the main purpose of the trust was to prevent the plaintiff from squandering his patri<a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>mony in the future, as he had so inconsiderately done in the past, in fancy horses and vehicles, and Florida land stocks. A man who had spent $ 67,000 and more, in less than three years, with so little to show for the money, would have regarded $50 per week as mere pocket money, and could not be trusted to apply it to the support of his family. Indeed, it is evident that this deed was -intended to create a spendthrift trust, except that his wife was made the recipient of the income.</p>

They were under no obligation to relieve him, and had the right to prescribe terms, not for their own benefit, but his family’s. Neither they nor the trustee-defendant had anything to gain by the convejmnce, in the sense of interest; that is, nothing is given to them as their own by the deed; merely the compensation to the trustee himself, which is under the control of the court.</p>

The declaration of trust in this case is in favor of the plaintiff’s wife and children, the wife to receive the income for the benefit of the family; and, although plaintiff has reserved nothing for himself, yet as a member of the family he participates in the income so long as he chooses to live with his wife and family, and thus he is himself benefited. Had the income been payable to himself, his improvident habits would soon have subjected it to attachment for debts, and thus his family would have suffered.</p>

And the proof by these witnesses, as against the plaintiff’s own testimony alone, shows that the power of revocation was purposély and knowingly surrendered by the plaintiff, in order to guard against his own inability to control or administer his property; and hence the omission of the power of revocation from his deed to the defendant is not only accounted for, but was a necessity, and repels' any suspicion of mistake or misapprehension on the part of the plaintiff in executing the deed of trust. Had the plaintiff been an habitual drunkard, mismanaging and wasting his estate, as he did, an inquest would have been prompt to declare him incompetent.

If so, equity will relieve him: Story’s Eq. J., §§ 232, 233, 245; Perry on Trusts, § 192. The facts plainly indicate, also, that there was collusion between the defendant and H. A. and D. H. Merriman to obtain the deed from the plaintiff; that Clarence Merriman was made use of as an instrument to effect that purpose; and that his fears of a criminal prosecution were worked in to bring about the result aimed at. The explanations by the defendant of the nature of the trust deed, if he made any, were general and not specific. He did not inform the plaintiff that such deeds can be, and usually are made re<a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>vocable; that this deed would effectually cut off his support out of the estate transferred; nor that, in the event of the plaintiff’s surviving his wife and children, the property would become vested in the defendant.

And if the defendant did execute the deed understandingly and intentionally, equity will set it aside if that intention was procured by misrepresentation, imposition, overreaching and collusion : Perry on Trusts, § 192; Story’s Eq.

There is an alternative proposition in this case, viz., that if this deed be decreed to stand, it becomes the law of the parties and cannot include property not mentioned in it. The Elmira street property was not included in the deed, but the mortgage thereon was a debt to be paid out of the estate conveyed to the defendant; and as the defendant suffered the property to go to pay the mortgage against it, he owes that sum to the plaintiff. By the same rule the defendant must account for the shares of stock, and the personal goods, that were never delivered to him by the plaintiff: Bond v.

It is a mistake to suppose, as was argued by the learned counsel for the appellant, that the latter takes no benefit under the deed of trust. On the contrary, he has the benefit of a house and a support so long as his conduct is such that he may properly reside with his wife and children. If this bill had alleged that he had been improperly and without cause excluded from the house occupied by them, and from the benefits and comforts thereof, we would have had an entirely different question before us. But the object of the bill was to strike down the trust upon the ground of fraud. Of this there was no evidence. The deed was his own act, to save him frqjn the results of his folly and extravagance. It was a spendthrift trust, executed by a spendthrift. To have inserted a clause of revocation in such a trust would have been an act of extreme folly, as it would have rendered it of no value for the protection of his estate. That it conveyed what was practically the whole of his estate does not invalidate the trust. He was not stripping himself of his property for the benefit of strangers, but was preserving it for the support of his wife and family, and incidentally his own. In this respect the case bears no analogy to those which hold that when a man makes a voluntary conveyance of his whole estate for the benefit of a stranger, without consideration, and without reserving a power of revocation, equity will relieve against it. The execution of this deed of trust was probably the <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>wisest business transaction tbe plaintiff ever performed. It is perhaps natural that, after the removal of the pressure of the financial troubles which induced the act complained of, he should regret having placed his estate heyond his control. Any spendthrift would.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[265,598,1169,502]]]'>A word as to the alternative proposition, as it was termed by plaintiff’s counsel. The learned master has found that, as to the personal property embraced therein, it was the understanding and agreement that it should be included in the trust, and it was transferred to the trustee at the time, so far as it could then be delivered; that the Fourth street house belonged to the plaintiff’s wife; and that the Elmira street house was omitted from the trust because it was admittedly encumbered to its full value. We find nothing which calls for relief in this branch of the plaintiff’s case.</p>

It appears to us, however, that the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>good sense of all the parties in interest ought to render this course unnecessary.</p>
