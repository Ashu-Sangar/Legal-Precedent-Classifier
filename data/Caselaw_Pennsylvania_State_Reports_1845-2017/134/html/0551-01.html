      <em>Mr. IT. Legrand Fnsign </em>and <em>Mr. Frank T. </em>Lloyd, for the petitioner:</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[196,450,1182,717]]]'>1. The facts of this case differ in no essential respect from those in Prospect Brewing Co.’s Petition, <a href="/pa/127/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="127 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="565753" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0523-01">127 Pa. 523</a>, and Pollard’s Petition, <a href="/pa/127/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="127 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="565764" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0507-01">127 Pa. 507</a>, notwithstanding that a paper styled a remonstrance was filed. That paper contained an averment that the petitioner was not of good moral character, as the signer, one Karker, was informed. The averment was not sworn to, nor did it even state as a fact the absence of good moral character, but simply that the remonstrant was so informed. It can hardly be considered as putting the petitioner’s moral character in issue, notwithstanding the modern tendency to loose pleading. There should be reasonable certainty in an allegation; and if an averment be made on information, there should be a statement of an expectation to prove the facts, or a supporting oath.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[197,1175,1184,871]]]'>2. If the remonstrance he considered good, it raised an issue to be decided upon the evidence, and should have been sustained by testimony : Prospect Brewing Co.’s Petition, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20Pa.%20585" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="127 Pa. 585">127 Pa. 585</a>. That decision is in accord with the constitutional guaranty of due process of law. No witness was called in this case to impeach the applicant’s character. On the contrary, the letter of Karker, put on file, destroyed the only possible legal objection to granting the license. If it he said that the letter was not evidence, no more was the unsworn statement in the remonstrance. The sales on Sunday, years before, by the applicant’s employee, without his knowledge, could hardly involve him in a charge of moral turpitude. That part of the remonstrance alleging that the “proposed saloon” was not needed and was in the neighborhood of educational institutions, requires no notice, as a saloon license was not applied for, and in the cases already cited such objections were expressly held inadmissible.</p>
