The said ordinance of May 26, 1886, recited, further, that such notice had been duly advertised, and then enacted that in pursuance of the act of April 14, 1881, P. L. 10, the city should issue its bonds, to be known as che Funded Loan of the City of Altoona, to the amount of $409,000, bearing interest at 4 per cent per annum payable semi-annually; the said bonds to conform in all respects with the provisions of said act, and the proceeds of the whole of said loan to be applied to the payment of the maturing bonds. A notice was at once published notifying the holders of the old bonds that, in order to secure the rights accorded them under the statute, they were to notify the finance committee of councils, on or before June 10, 1886, of their acceptance of the new 4 per cent loan. On June 7, 1886, John Lloyd notified the said committee in writing that he represented the holders of $108,600 of the old bonds, and that he accepted the new four per cent loan and desired to exchange for bonds thereof to a like amount. On June 11,1886, a reso<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>lution was passed by councils accepting the bid oí one Gilbough of New York, and directing the finance committee to deliver to said Gilbough, at his bid of 100-^, all said new bonds, except such as would be accepted by the holders of the old bonds, and providing that holders of the old bonds should pay the premium of fk Per cent- On July 1, 1886, John Lloyd presented his bonds to the amount of $108,600, but, to receive a like amount of the new bonds, he was obliged to pay to the city the sum of $328.75, as evidenced by the following receipt:</p>

As all the outstanding bonds were at a much higher rate of interest than <em>money </em>was worth — some of them being 7fa per cent — it was highly proper to refund these loans by one bearing a lower rate of interest. The city resolved to make a new loan and secure it by bonds bearing four per cent interest. Under authority of the act of assembly of April 14, 1881, P. L. 10, without which the new loan could not have been contracted, the city council, by ordinance following strictly the provisions of the act, invoked the benefits it was designed to confer, k refer to the ordinance of May 26,1886, and called Ordinance 102.
