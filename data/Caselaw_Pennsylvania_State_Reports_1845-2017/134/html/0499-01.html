The same view is held in England: Lecaan v. Kirk man, 6 Jur., N. S., 17. It must be presumed that the plaintiff was' familiar with the law merchant, and knew that this irregular indorsement implied no liability. The conclusion is therefore inevitable that it was discounted on the strength of the payees’ indorsement alone. Any other principle would lead to uncertainty in the law of negotiable instruments.</p>

    <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[228,1296,1162,855]]]'>1. It is assumed by the defendant that his indorsement is of like character with that passed upon in Schafer v. Bank, <a href="/pa/59/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="59 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="426972" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0144-01">59 Pa. 144</a>, and the cases which have followed it. But the contrary is the fact. About forty-four years ago there were conflicting decisions in England upon the question whether a note to the order of the maker was negotiable under the statute 3 &amp; 4 Anne, cap. 9; Flight v. Maclean, 16 M. &amp; W. 51; Wood v. Mytton, 59 E. C. L. 805. But it is now settled that such a note, when indorsed by the payee, becomes a note payable to bearer, and is then governed by the law applicable to negotiable instruments: Hooper v. Williams, 2 Exch. 13; Guy Lauder and Brown v. DeWinton, 60 E. C. L. 336; Miller v. Weeks, <a href="/pa/22/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="22 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="413776" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0089-01">22 Pa. 89</a>. The paper signed by Jones &amp; Eaton required their indorsement before it had any effect at all. When so indorsed it was simply a promissory ndte payable to bearer, and upon its becoming that, Dreydoppel’s previous signature became a legal indorsement.</p>
    <p id="b525-8" data-blocks='[["BL_525.7",525,[230,2159,1159,247]],["BL_526.1",526,[257,370,1169,553]]]'>2. The reason for the decision in Schafer v. Bank, and other cases, that an indorsement made by a stranger to a note, before it has been indorsed by the payee, does not bind him under the law merchant, unless the payee assumes the position of first indorser, is, that his presumed intent is to secure to himself a <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>right of action, against the payee in the event of being called on himself to pay the note; and, to deprive him of this, by placing the indorsement of the payee second to his, would be in the nature of a fraud. But, as Jones &amp; Eaton were the makers of this note, Dreydoppel has a perfect right of action against them, and his rights as a party to the paper were not diminished by their signing below his signature, and would not have been increased had they signed above it, whether they are to be sued in the character of indorsers, or in that of makers, being a matter of indifference to him, as in either case the recovery will be the same.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[266,928,1162,704]]]'>3. The affidavit avers that the indorsement was made in Philadelphia, and therefore the defendant’s liability is to be determined by Pennsylvania law: Lennig v. Ralston, <a href="/pa/23/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="23 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="974037" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0137-01">23 Pa. 137</a>. But were it to be determined by the law of Massachusetts, where the note was made, he could not escape liability, but would be held a joint and several promisor with Jones &amp; Eaton: Union Bank v. Eaton, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Metc.%20504" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="8 Metc. 504">8 Metc. 504</a>. The case of Stoddard v.

The allegation in the defendant’s affidavit that he believed the bank was in collusion with Jones &amp; Eaton and had brought suit on the note for their benefit, was insufficient, without a further statement of the facts upon which the belief was grounded, so that the court might judge whether the belief was warranted or not.</p>

This constituted what is known as an irregular indorsément; and the defendant claims that by reason thereof he is not liable to the plaintiff, who is the holder. The responsibility of such an indorser, however much it may have been doubted at one time, is now well understood. “ Nobody ever doubted,” said Justice Shakswood in Eilbert v. Finkbeiner, <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a><a href="/citations/?q=68%20Pa.%20247" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="68 Pa. 247">68 Pa. 247</a>, “ that, when a man puts his name on the back of negotiable paper before the payee has indorsed it, he means to pledge, in some shape, his responsibility for the payment of it..... This court finally settled that in the absence of legal evidence of any different contract, he assumes the position of a second indorser; and that, to render his engagement binding as to any holder of the note, the implied condition that the payee shall indorse before him must be complied with, so as to give him recourse against such payee; ” citing Schafer v. F. &amp; M. Bank, <a href="/pa/59/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="59 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="426972" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0144-01">59 Pa. 144</a>. It will be seen that the reason of the rule, laid down in the line of cases of which those cited form a part, is that, unless the payee is the first indorser, there can be no recourse against him. In the case in hand the reason of the rule does not apply, because the payees are also the makers of the note; hence the defendant, although entitled to the position of second indorser, is deprived of no valuable rights, as he can sue the payees as makers of the note. Their responsibility to him is precisely the same as if they had indorsed the note as payees before he placed his indorsement upon it. We are of opinion that the defence set up in the affidavit is insufficient, and that the judgment was properly entered.</p>
