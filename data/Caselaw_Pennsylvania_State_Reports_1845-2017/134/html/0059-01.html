I thought that one word that crept into your letter was quite unwarranted. Although I admit that it was wrote by a more scholarly hand than yours. However I have not wrote this to scold or to be sarcastic, but only to ask you if the so-called widow has been WOMAN enough to be giving you 50 packages for one dollar the same as she has and IS giving the men who sell for her here.

    <p id="b87-9" data-blocks='[["BL_87.7",87,[222,1065,1164,761]]]'>1. The only witness to prove the defendant’s handwriting was the plaintiff, Catharine Aspell, and, as she had never seen him write, that is, never overlooked in the operation, although she had seen him while in the act of writing, and had never seen any letters or other papers purporting to be in his handwriting and afterwards communicated with him concerning them or acted upon them, she had not sufficient knowledge to make the letter admissible on the strength of her opinion that the defendant wrote it: 1 Greenl. Ev., § 577. It may be argued that the error in admitting it was cured by the defendant’s testimony that he wrote it. But the defendant was put upon a defence to which he ought not to have been subjected. The plaintiff must prove her case, and the admission of improper evidence is not cured by after testimony. The same argument applies to the envelope containing the letter.</p>
    <p id="b87-10" data-blocks='[["BL_87.8",87,[223,1834,1166,550]],["BL_88.1",88,[276,343,1162,197]]]'>2. The only words alleged to be libelous are those referring to the plaintiff as “Daisy,” and the “so-called widow,” and the statement that “if she does, it will be the first and only honorable act of her life,” etc. The testimony shows that Smith had often called Mrs. Aspell, Daisy, which is a nickname, much oftener used as a name of endearment than anything else, and it is also a proper name. It has no such meaning as alleged by the plaintiffs, and there was no evidence that it was so intended. The defendant did not write that Mrs. Aspell never did an honorable act, but simply said: “ If she does, it will be the first and only honorable act of her life I ever knew <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>her to perform; ” and he justifies this statement as the truth. It must be remembered that the letter was written to a man who had been a customer of Smith, and who was induced by Mrs. Aspell to leave him and come to her with his trade.</p>
    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[277,546,1165,759]]]'>8, Mrs. Aspell advertised and sold cough drops as the widow of George Lewis and continued to do so after she married Aspell. Advertising herself as a widow, when she was the wife of Aspell, and using an alleged widowhood <em>as </em>a means of destroying the defendant’s business, why should she complain of his referring to her as the so-called widow ? Even if she liad not re-married, those words are not actionable per se, and are without a single element of libel. She was a so-called widow, so called by herself Avhen she was not a widow. There is no evidence that Smith intended the slightest disrespect to her, either by the word Daisy or by the phrase “the so-called Avidow; ” nor is there evidence that she sustained any actual damage from this letter, and, as the words used are not libelous per se, she cannot recover without proof of actual damage. The verdict was clearly against the law and the evidence.</p>

    <p id="b88-7" data-blocks='[["BL_88.6",88,[279,1414,1165,761]]]'>1. The appellant’s counsel have forgotten the distinction between libel and slander. A libel need not charge a person with the commission of a crime or cause special damage ; it is sufficient if it be injurious to the character of another and necessarily injures his reputation: McCorkle v.

Where, either in themselves or taken in connection Avitli the surrounding circumstances, the meaning of the Avords is doubtful, the plaintiff may aver their meaning by innuendo, and it is for the jury to say Avhether they were used in the defamatory sense: Hays v.

When the words, in themselves, or with the innuendo, are libelous, substantial damage is inferred and need not be proved: Odgers on L. &amp; S., 290, 308; Newell on Defamation, 839, 856; Neeb v. Hope, <a href="/pa/111/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="111 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="545487" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0145-01">111 Pa. 145</a>. In the present case'the <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>whole letter was claimed to be libelous, although three phrases were specially complained of. The natural and ordinary meaning of the words “so-called widow” is, that while the plaintiff was called a widow she was not so in reality, and when that phrase is applied to a woman who had been living in apparent marital relations with a man for many years before his death, and had children by him, it could only mean, in the common acceptation of the language, that she had been his mistress and therefore was not his widow. It must be remembered that at the time the letter was written the plaintiff had not married again, and was still bearing the name of her deceased husband.</p>
    <p id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[218,960,1163,953]]]'>3. Even if there had been no innuendo, it would have been the duty of the court, either to say that the words “ so-called widow ” were libelous, as injurious to the social character of the plaintiff and as tending to degrade her character, or, at best, to say that they were ambiguous, and leave it to the jury in what sense they were used. But there was an innuendo, the truth of which was for the jury, and the repetition and emphasis of the words, in connection with the general tone and evident purpose of the letter, sufficiently showed that the words were used in a derogatory sense. But little need be said as to the word “ Daisy.” It certainly was not a word of plain meaning. There was an innuendo, which, if true, made it libelous, and its meaning was for the jury. Moreover, any ordinary reader would have inferred from the clause referring to the “ first and only honorable act of her life,” etc., that the plaintiff was habitually dishonest in her business dealings, and such a letter as this, written to one of her customers, was clearly actionable. The assignment to the charge does not comply with the Rule of Court.</p>
