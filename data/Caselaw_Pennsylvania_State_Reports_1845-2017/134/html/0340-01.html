The defendant was the principal of a rival school, located at 1223 Chestnut street. These were the only schools in Philadelphia in which the Haven system of short-hand writing was then taught. The defendant, with full knowledge of these facts, <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>published certain certificates, over the signature of Curtis Haven, author of Haven’s short-hand system, in which it was ■stated that the only authorized Haven College in Philadelphia was at 1223 Chestnut street, of which the defendant was the principal; that he could recommend her teaching, but not that of another teacher, who was using his name without authority, and for whose teaching he' would not be responsible. The defendant also published a circular over her own signature, in which it was stated that there were other teachers of Haven’s short-hand in Philadelphia, and that one of them was using the name, Haven College, without authority. The declaration contains verbatim copies of these publications, and alleges that they charge, and were intended to charge, that the plaintiff was incompetent to teach the Haven system of short-hand, and that she was using the name Haven College without authority, and that by means of these accusations, falsely and maliciously made, she has been greatly prejudiced in her reputation and business, and has sustained great loss therein. It specifically describes the injuries inflicted on her business, by the publication recited in it, and lays her damages at $5,000.</p>
