    <p id="b369-8" data-blocks='[["BL_369.8",369,[238,1693,1178,548]]]'>1. Under the agreement, the profit or loss upon the sale of the land was to be paid to or by Hentz in the proportion of one fourth. The difference between its cost, $4,500, and what it sold for, was profit, and of this Hentz was entitled to one fourth as soon as realized. The revenue arising from the land, while it remained unsold, is treated separately in the agreement, and is the subject of a separate account. The net income is the fund upon which the right to profit accrues, so far as the revenue is concerned, and, as an accountant would run interest on debits and credits to ascertain net income, the third method of calculation submitted to the court is accurate.</p>

But Hentz would not owe Van Syckel anything until the sale was made, nor would Van Syckel owe Hentz. There was therefore no detention of payment.</p>

    <p id="b370-7" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[246,875,1176,297]]]'>1. Hentz has no right to be credited with interest upon the receipts, until they amount to enough to reimburse the outlays. In any case, Van Syckel was entitled to appropriate the receipts, as they came in, to repaying what he had expended. Until the sale in April, 1887, the receipts were insufficient to reimburse him, and no interest account ran in Hentz’s favor.</p>
    <p id="b370-8" data-blocks='[["BL_370.6",370,[244,1184,1177,351]]]'>2. Profits cannot be ascertained without a calculation of interest. Would a person who, in 1856 invested $4,500 in the purchase of a lot, and in 1887 sold it for $4,600, realize a profit ? Is there any person who would say that he had done so ? There was no profit, in this case, till principal and interest had been reimbursed; and there is no pretence that Van Syckel unduly delayed the sale.</p>

What, then, were the profits thus realized by Van Syckel, or by his estate ? The land was bought <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>in 1856 for #4.500 and sold more than 30 years afterwards for #7,793.75. The interest on the price paid for it in 1856 exceeded the sum for which it was sold in 1887. If no income had been derived from the land during this period, the owner would have sustained a loss on the sale of it greater than the amount originally expended in its purchase. There are no profits in a land speculation which does not return to the investor his purchase money with interest upon it. In estimating the cost of unproductive land to a purchaser who held it for thirty years, we must include interest on the price he paid for it; and, if the sum for which he sells it does not exceed the purchase money and interest thereon, he does not realize a profit on the investment. In this case, it is conceded that, in ascertaining the profits derived from the use of the land, interest on advances made after the agreement of February 19,1856, should be computed, but it is contended that the difference between the price paid for the land in 1856 and the sum received for it in 1887 represents profits arising from the purchase and sale of it. We cannot so construe the agreement under which the appellant claims. It was one fourth of the profits which Van Syckel should realize on his investment, that he agreed to pay over to Hentz. There was no separation of profits realized by a sale of the land from profits arising from its use. The appellant is entitled to one fourth of the profits realized by Van Syckel and his estate, by the use and sale of this land, and for it he obtained judgment in the court below. With this he ought to and must be content.</p>
    <p id="b371-5" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[991,1733,356,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
