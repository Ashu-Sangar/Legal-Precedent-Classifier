The rule of the court below requires that the statement of claim “ shall contain a specific averment of facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action.” This, clearly, the statement does not do, as it does not show what the alleged services were. This must be shown, not only because the plaintiff must prove a consideration, but also because a judgment in this case would be no bar to another suit for another $1,000 for “certain services,” there being nothing upon the record by which the identity of the. services, sued for in the second action, with those embraced in the first suit, could be made to appear. This is no mere technical point; but, in view of the change of management and the ignorance of the present officers respecting the facts, it is especially proper that the plaintiff be compelled to inform them what he did for the company, and whether the services were within the scope of his duties as an officer of it.</p>

Corporations are not liable on a quantum meruit for services performed by their officers, and there must be an express contract for compensation : Kilpatrick v. Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/49/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="49 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="998410" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0118-01">49 Pa. 118</a>; Commonwealth Ins. Co. v.

The court be<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>low thought that, as the promise to pay was not denied, the consideration was immaterial; but the cases cited show that such a promise is against public policy and void.</p>

      <em>Mr. Wendell P. </em>Bowman, for the appellee :</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[224,607,1169,816]]]'>1. The statement of claim avers that the services were rendered at the special instance and request of the defendant, and that it agreed to pay him therefor $1,000. From time immemorial such a form of statement has been regarded as sufficient. Work and services are always sufficient consideration for a promise, if rendered at the request of the promisor : 1 Parsons on Cont., *446. Such a consideration is sufficient, whether the contract be express or implied. Considering that one of the objects of the Procedure Act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, was simplicity in pleading, it is proper to have all statements of claim, not covered by the old affidavit of defence law, to conform simply to the old, well-settled rules as to declarations in assumpsit; otherwise, the whole system would be in confusion. The promise upon an executed consideration is well stated, in this case, according to the ancient and established practice: 1 Chitty on Pleading, 16 Am. ed., 302.</p>
    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.6",375,[224,1430,1167,712]]]'>2. Purely technical objections to a statement are not favored - Brooks v. Merchants N. Bank, <a href="/pa/125/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="125 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="563990" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0394-01">125 Pa. 394</a>. The defendant complains that the plaintiff has not anticipated and met in his statement the points of defence which it sets up ; but it is neither incumbent upon, nor proper for a plaintiff so to do: Griffith v. Sitgreaves, 2 W. N. 707. The alleged illegality of the contract is matter of defence, which it is for the defendant to show. Again ; when a defendant undertakes to be sworn that he has a full defence to the whole of the plaintiff’s claim, he should not merely allege defects in the affidavit of claim. To the objection that if another suit were brought the record of the present one would not show the identity of the services, it is answered that the defendant will have as much protection as if it had given a promissory note for services.</p>
    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.7",375,[222,2150,1166,248]],["BL_376.1",376,[242,343,1169,753]]]'>3. The affidavits of defence are evasive and argumentative. They neither deny the making of the contract nor aver the facts showing any illegality. It is not shown what services are incidental to the offices of president and director, and it is not illegal to employ a director in services outside the scope of <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>his official duty: Chandler v. Bank, 1 Green 255. Nor is an express promise to pay therefor necessary, when the nature of the services implies an intent and obligation to pay: 2 Waterman on Corp., 374; Angell &amp; Ames on Corp., § 317. Such intent and obligation are implied by the request to render the services. Moreover, for all that appears, such extra compensation may be authorized by the organic law of this corporation. On account of their evasiveness and argumentativeness, the affidavits were insufficient to prevent judgment. And also because their averments are in a disjunctive or alternative form : Boston N. Bank v. Bartholomew, 2 W. N. 445; Black v. Halstead, <a href="/pa/39/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="39 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="996333" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0064-01">39 Pa. 64</a>. As the facts are not clearly and plainly set forth, all doubts must be resolved against the defendant: Selden v.

The affidavits of defence allege that the plaintiff was duly elected president’of the defendant corporation on April 21, 1888, and that his salary was then fixed at $1,800 per annum; that on the 14th of May following he resigned the office of president, and that during his incumbency of it he attended but three meetings of the company; that the only services rendered by him to the company for which any compensation was agreed at any time to be paid were as president during the twenty-four days he held that office.</p>

It may be that for services, as president, he can recover on the basis of the salary attached to that office; but a salary of #1,800 per annum would not yield #1,000 for twenty-four days of service.
