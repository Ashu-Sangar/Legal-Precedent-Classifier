She refused to do this, and said personalty was sold by the administrator, realizing some $400 or more, which fund would go to the general creditors under the law; and, if the $300 is to be taken from the real estate proceeds, this exceptant would be defrauded to that extent, as his is the first judgment, and the property did not realize within several hundred dollars as much as is claimed.

Our courts have, however, uniformly held, from the time of passage of the act to this time, that the statute does not affect mortgages and such other <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>rights and estates in hands as are paramount to the titles themselves.</p>

But every other case that has been cited, or that has come under my observation upon this point, decided that she may, as the statutes enact, elect to take either real or personal property at her pleasure. Spencer’s App., <a href="/pa/27/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="27 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="979451" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0218-01">27 Pa. 218</a>, decides, that a widow may elect to take real estate, on account of her exemption, against the interest of a judgment creditor of her late husband, and that notwithstanding the waiver of the exemption laws by the husband.</p>

Whether any of the debts were judgment liens, is not disclosed, either in the statement or the opinion. But presumably they were, else the intention had been objectless.

It would be folly to interpret the act so as to give the widow the sole power to direct how her husband’s estate shall be settled, and to toy with the rights of creditors as may suit her whim or fancy. As remarked by Pearson, P. J., in Witmer’s Est., 2 Pears. 473, the courts have already greatly wrested the law from its true meaning to gratify widows. The question here presented has never been decided by this court.. No real estate had been ordered to be sold when this exemption was claimed, and by analogy to the debtor’s exemption under act of April 9, 1849, P. L. 533, the personal property, which was amply sufficient to meet the widow’s demand, should have been resorted to: Scott’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phila.%20135" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Phila. 135">2 Phila. 135</a>.</p>
