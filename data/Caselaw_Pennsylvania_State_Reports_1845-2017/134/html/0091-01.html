In 1869, the heirs made partition among themselves of all the lands bound by the lien of the judgment in controversy, except the homestead. The judgment then amounted to |5,000, and it was agreed between them that each of the five heirs should pay $1,000 of it. On November 11, 1875, Mary C. Griswold received from James Wood a conveyance of the undivided one fifth interest in the homestead, which was the interest of Louisa, devised to James Wood by the will of his wife, who was then dead; and on May 6, 1876, she acquired the one fifth interest of Geo. P. Cash by its purchase at sheriff sale.</p>

She claimed, also, that her said interest as heir was again released by an arrangement made when she purchased the interest of Geo. P. Cash at sheriff’s sale in 1876; that under this arrangement the interest had first been bought by Wood, and that in consideration of her agreement to take the property off his hands and become the purchaser of it herself, he released her said interest from the lien of said judgment.
