Upon the lots of the defendants were privies, used by the occupants of the respective premises, for which there was a common cess-pool.

Mrs. Wunder testified that she first complained of the nuisance in 1886. Testimony for the defendants tended to show that her first complaint was in 1888, after the storm mentioned; that soon after its occurrence, Mr. McLean, in consequence of a notice from the board of health, had the cess-pool cleaned out and its walls examined, when they were found to be in good condition; that they were not cemented, as the cleaning out was thought to be sufficient; and that after that cleaning the cellar of the plaintiffs was in good condition.

Both sides agreeing that such should be done, the case was adjourned till Monday, October 14,1889, at which time testimony was adduced to the effect that, during the interval, a laborer in the employ of the board of health had dug down between the cess-pool and the plaintiffs’ house, and had <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>ascertained that the filth came from that cess-pool.

Primarily the tenant is always liable for such damages arising from a bad state of repair of premises of which he has possession: Bears v.

Without a provision in the lease that he shall make repairs, the landlord is under no obligation to do so: Moore v. Weber, <a href="/pa/71/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="71 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1031245" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0432-01">71 Pa. 432</a>; Hazlett v.

The cases that are most similar to the present one, in their facts and circumstances, are the following, which hold that, although the landlord is liable, if the premises are so constructed, or in such a condition at the date of the lease, that their continued use by the tenant must result to the injury of a third person, yet the .landlord is not liable, where the tenant has been negligent in the use of the premises, for not making repairs necessary to abate the nuisance: Knauss v. Brua, <a href="/pa/107/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="107 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="8856340" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0085-01">107 Pa. 85</a>; Somers’s App., 6 W. N. 441; Fow v.

Every circumstance of law and fact, in the present case, operates to relieve the landlord from liability. He had made no covenant to repair, and the tenant was bound to make repairs; though, even if there had been such a covenant, the primary liability to third persons would be on the tenant. The remedying of the nuisance is clearly within the meaning of repairs, and it was not shown that the cess-pool was in bad condition when the lease was made. No defect of construction was shown, nor can such properly be inferred. But, in any case, the question whether the landlord or the tenant was liable, should have been left to the jury.</p>

The action is brought to recover damages alleged to have arisen from leakage from the cess-pool used in common for the privies on Nos. 139 and 141 into the plaintiffs’ cellar. Mrs. Craven, one of the defendants, owned and occupied No. 139. No. 141 was owned by McLean, but was, and for several years had been, occupied by Rooney as a tenant. The plaintiffs’ right to recover depended <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>on whether the leakage existed as alleged, and, as to McLean, on whether such leakage was due to improper construction, or defective condition when the lease was made, for which the landlord would be answerable, or to negligent use by the tenant, for which he alone should be held responsible.</p>

This one is not within the prohibited distance, and its location may be regarded as a lawful one. If it was properly built, and in good repair when the tenants took possession, the landlord ought not to be held responsible for the consequences of his tenant’s neglect. On the other hand, if the cess-pool was defectively built, or was oug of repair when the tenant was put in possession, the mere fact of the tenant’s occupancy, when the injury arises, will not relieve the landlord from the consequences of his own negligence. He is liable because of the defective construction or condition at and before the tenancy began, and this liability continues notwithstanding the possession of the tenant. He cannot escape liability for an existing nuisance by leasing the property to a tenant, and putting him in possession: Knauss v. Brua, <a href="/pa/107/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="107 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="8856340" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0085-01">107 Pa. 85</a>. The tenant who should use the defective cess-pool would be liable because of his use, but such liability would not take the place of, or in any manner affect, that of the landlord.

In that case, the plaintiff was nonsuited in the court below, the court being of opinion that the plaintiff’s action should have been brought against the tenant who was in possession during the time when the alleged injury was sustained. This court, however, held that, inasmuch as the cess-pool was maintained by the landlord within the prohibited distance, in violation of the city ordinance, and the testimony showed that, as often as the contents of the pool rose to a level with the bottom of the plaintiff’s cellar, they began to find their way into the cellar, the plaintiff should have been allowed to go to the jury on the question of the landlord’s defective construction.</p>
