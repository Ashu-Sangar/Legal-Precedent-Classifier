If it was occasioned by the mere inadequacy of the culvert, as constructed by the borough, or by Simon Kemerer for the borough, she would have no right to recover. Mere inadequacy of capacity in a sewer or drain to carry off the accumulated surface water, and by reason of which property is injured or destroyed, confers no right upon the party suffering the injury to recover damages for it from the municipality. If, in the construction of a culvert, or sewer, the municipal authorities err in judgment as <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>to its proper size for the purpose of its construction, and in consequence of such error of judgment injury is sustained, there can be no recovery in damages from the municipality for such injury. If, however, such culvert or sewer is negligently or faultily constructed, and the injury is a consequence, not of the plan adopted by the municipality for carrying off the water, but of the negligent carrying out of the plan, in constructing the culvert or sewer, then the party injured thereby is entitled to recover in damages for whatever injury he suffers. Suppose, for example, and as an illustration easily to be understood, that the borough of Bethlehem, or the borough of South Bethlehem, should decide to construct a sewer for the purpose of carrying off water, of the dimensions of three feet by two feet, and it should prove inadequate and insufficient in capacity to carry off the water accumulating in the locality which it was designed for and which it was intended to carry off, and that property owners were damaged because of the insufficiency of the sewer to carry off the • water, yet they could not recover.
