This judgment is founded upon a note which is dated April 17, 1877, and apparently he was thereby a creditor of his father to the extent of several thousand dollars at that time. The defendants claim title under M. W. Wheelock, who entered judgment against Benjamin Ball in 1875 for some $10,000, and had a sheriff’s sale upon that judgment, and purchased the property September 7, 1877. The claim here on the part of the plaintiff has been that this sheriff’s sale was fraudulent and void as to him, he at that time, in September, 1877, being a creditor of his father to the amount of some $3,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b629-6" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[216,954,1165,863]]]'>If he could establish that fact, and the controversy were between him and Mr. Wheelock, then Mr. Wheelock would acquire no title, because fraud voids anything which is tainted by it. There is an old statute passed in the time of Queen Elizabeth in England, that provides for avoiding any fraudulent conveyances. And if any fraudulent arrangement was entered into, to divest the title to one’s property in fraud' of creditors, that arrangement would be void at common law. The plaintiff had the burden upon himself to establish that fact, and if Mr. Wheelock was the defendant here, under the view that I have taken so far in the ease, and under which I admitted Benjamin Ball’s deposition, I might have to submit to you the question of whether there was a fraudulent arrangement between Benjamin Ball and Mr. Wheelock, under which this sheriff’s sale took place, whereby Mr. Wheelock dissuaded creditors from coming in and buying, in order that he might take the title to the property for the benefit of Benjamin Ball.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b629-7" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[217,1823,1164,607]]]'>But the controversy here has gone beyond that. We have in evidence conveyances of this same property from Mr. Wheeloelc to N. C. Harris, and one to Mr. Teed, the last witness on the stand, and from these parties we have other deeds carrying the property still further. [These are all upon an apparently good and valuable consideration; and, inasmuch as the property had passed from Mr. Wheelock before any steps were taken on the part of John B. Ball to call in question the validity of that sheriff’s sale, he must, in order to recover now, affect these parties with notice of this fraudulent arrangement, otherwise his efforts must fail. Therefore, in that view of the case, I direct you to render a verdict in favor of the defendants.] 2</p>

Such receipt. is prima facie evidence against the grantor and those claiming under him, but against others it is no evidence at all: Lloyd v.

A careful examination <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>fails to show any evidence in the present case which should permit a jury to find the alleged fraud. The principal evidence, the deposition of Benjamin Ball, and the notes of Hulett’s testimony in another case, seems to us to have been admitted without sufficient ground laid for that kind of evidence ; but, taking it as it stands, all that it proves is that Wheelock, an unquestioned creditor to a large amount, desired to take the land as security for his claim, and that Ball agreed to the sale as a means of passing the title for that purpose. No intent is shown to defraud other creditors, nor any knowledge that there were any such creditors. Nor is it even now alleged that in fact there were any other creditors except the present plaintiff with his secret note, not claimed to have been- due at the time of the transaction between his father and Wheelock, not entered up till four years after it was apparently due and seven years after the sale to Wheelock, and not made known in the meantime, though the circumstances were such that, if it had been an honest debt, it is scarcely conceivable that it should not have been asserted at the time of the ejectment by Wheelock, to which not only his father, but plaintiff himself, was a party. The conduct of Wheelock subsequent to the sheriff’s sale is equally clear of any evidence of fraud. The testimony of Hulett, and Wheelock’s own letter, show that he admitted holding title subject to redemption by Ball; that he waited beyond the agreed time; and that “ he hoped it would be redeemed,” so that he would get his money. In all this there was nothing beyond the legitimate efforts of a creditor to obtain payment of his debt.</p>
