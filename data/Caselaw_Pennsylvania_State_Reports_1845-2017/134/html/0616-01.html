By the act of April 5, 1870, P.

The act of 1870 authorized the borough authorities to sell the “ Old Graveyard ” in lots, but by the fifth section required that, before any sale of lots could be made to others, the borough should convey a lot not less than thirty feet in front on Washington street, and one hundred feet deep to the defendant, “ for the erection of a hall for the society.”</p>

In some cities the maintenance of cemeteries has been made a municipal duty: Dillon on JVIun. Corp., §§ 305, 306. But all property of a municipal corporation is in a general sense public, whatever may be its use, though it may sometimes be spoken of as the private property of the corporation. As to the citizens it is public; as against all other corporate or governmental authority it is private; not to be diverted from the municipal ownership, possession or use to other non-municipal, even though public, uses without compensation; not to be given by the power of the legislature, without the consent of the municipality, over into the hands of private owners for private purposes even for compensation. And this principle <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>will furnish the touchstone by which we may ascertain whether the act of April 5, 1870, is constitutional or not.</p>

Nowhere has the legal prim ciple been more plainly expressed. While the cases in which the question has been before the court for adjudication have been those in which the rights of individuals and of private corporations were concerned, there would appear to be no good reason why it should not apply to protect the title of a municipal corporation against arbitrary confiscation by the legislature.</p>

The act of April 5,-1870, § 5, will, by this rule, be found to be constitutional. It did not of itself convey the land to the defendant, nor did it take the land out of the control of the owner by creating a trustee, who, whether the owner consented or not, was directed to sell the land, a method that had been condemned in the cases, Kneass’s App., <a href="/pa/81/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="81 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1044114" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0090-01">81 Pa. 90</a>, and Ervine’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%20264" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="16 Pa. 264">16 Pa. 264</a>. Here the legislature directed that before the owner should have the benefit of the special statute, he should first make a conveyance of a portion of the land affected by the statute. The requirement may have been arbitrary and open to criticism, but we need not say that it was necessarily so. In fact, the presumption is that the act of 1870 was passed not only by consent of, but at the active instance of the borough of Wilkes-Barre. “ The respect which is due to the legislative department of the government justifies the presumption that an act authorizing a sale of land and directing the proceeds to be distributed among parties, is passed at their instance. Hence a conveyance under such authority is prima facie evidence of a good title in the vendee, against all persons claiming under the persons for whose benefit the sale purports to be <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>made : Estep v.

No authority is cited to sustain the position, but it is suggested that “ the mere statement of the proposition is an establishment of it.” The borough, it is said, is simply at most a trustee, with power to sell and apply the proceeds for the benefit and purposes of the municipality composed of the incorporators. Therefore, when the municipality attempts to donate or give away land belonging to it, it acts ultra vires and no title passes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b645-6" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[225,947,1164,1016]]]'>It has been said by the most eminent writer on the law of municipal corporations that the incidental right to alienate or dispose of the property, real or personal, of the corporation, of a private nature, is possessed, unless restrained by charter or statute; they cannot of course dispose of the property of a public nature, in violation of the trusts upon which it is held; nor of public squares, streets and commons: Dillon on Mun. Corp., § 445. Having this implied power, the consideration by which the corporation is moved to make a conveyance might very naturally be one to be weighed in the discretion of its governing bodies, but not to be measured or fettered by some judicial tribunal. Like all power that depends for its exercise on the discretion of the men in whom confidence has been lawfully reposed, it may be unwisely exercised. But we need not go so far in this case as to assert that a conveyance may (without express authority, but upon implication only) be made by a municipal corporation for no consideration. Here we may assume that if the power to make a gift has not been expressly granted by legislation, the proposition for which the plaintiff contends may be the legal rule.</p>

The legislature by the act of 1870 authorized the borough, not its officers, to make this deed. It was for the borough in its corporate capacity to decide whether it would consent to the act of 1870. In fact as we have already seen, the power to dissent from the requirement of the fifth section, was necessary to give it constitutionality and validity. True, unless the borough consented, it could not reap the benefits of the remaining provisions of that statute, but whether they were of sufficient value to be accepted at the expenses imposed by the fifth section, was the very thing to be ascertained by the action of the council; and only the council could direct the deed to be made to the defendant.</p>

An ejectment has in Pennsylvania been more than once declared to be an equitable action, and it would be in strict accord with the principles of existing practice, as well as in the interest of speedy justice, to treat the deed as reformed. In the litigation now before the court, the effect upon the defendant’s case would be exactly the same, in view of the referee’s final conclusion of law, whether the deed is declared null, because executed ultra vires, or whether it is reformed to incorporate a condition that must defeat the grant.</p>

Without it, the defendant could never have set up a claim to 46, or to any other specific lot. That the land was conveyed in a manner unauthorized by the borough was as much the negligence of the defendant who ac<a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>cepted, as it was the wrong of the borough officers who made the deed. Certainly the negligence of the defendant cannot result in a reward to the defendant, nor can the wrong doing of its officers be visited on the head of the borough which was neither negligent nor in the wrong.

It was not an unreasonable construction of the statute when the borough council undertook to compel the defendant to erect the hall which the legislature contemplated. Obedience to the statute was the duty of the borough if it desired the advantages of the law; obedience to the statute was none the less the duty of the defendant. While the statute contained no direct injunction on the defendant to erect the building, there is no conceivable reason why the defendant should be excused from erecting it. It is necessarily implied that if the society accepts as a gratuity from the public, land “ to erect a hall for the society’s use,” it will in good faith carry out the object of the gift. While, as we have seen, a gift in these words alone would not operate as a condition, it cannot be said that the same technical rule would be applied in construing a statute which authorizes the gift to mean thereby to prohibit a conveyance in apt words calculated to enforce the legislative intent. When the legislature directed that the land which then belonged to Wilkes-Barre should be conveyed to the defendant for the purpose expressed, it was undoubtedly because the erection of a building devoted to historical and geological research would confer a commensurate benefit on the community whose property was affected. There is nothing in the language of the statute to indicate that the legislature intended to pour a sum of money into the society’s treasury <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>from the public’s possessions without any return for the beneficence. In addition to all this, attention should be called to the fact that, at the time, the defendant deemed the condition authorized by the resolution to be just and reasonable; for the deed recites, after setting forth the action of the borough at length, that the said proposition was duly accepted by the party of the second part, by a resolution passed at a meeting of said society held on January 22, 1871.</p>

In ratifying the borough’s title to the old graveyard, and providing a mode for its alienation, by the act of April 5, 1870, P. L. 891, the legislature had power to make the giving of a portion of the land to this society a condition precedent to the enjoyment of the privileges conferred upon the borough, and having accepted it, the borough must be held to have assented to the condition. Its title was doubtful prior to that act, or, at least, the land was inalienable, because devoted to the purpose of a park or square by the act of April 13, 1867, P. L. 1236, and the ratification of the title, and the making of it alienable constituted sufficient consideration to sustain the requirement to convey.</p>
    <p id="b652-7" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[269,1076,1159,797]]]'>2. But, even conceding lack of power in the legislature to compel the conveyance, the defect is cured by the borough’s deed. The objection that the deed, as a gift, is ultra vires, is not tenable, because the general borough act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320, gives power to convey without restriction, and because a borough may receive power from the legislature to make a gift, and this gift, if such it was, is expressly authorized by the act of 1870. The deed did not convey an estate upon condition in lot No. 46. If a condition exists, it was created either by the statute, the resolution of council, or the deed. The statute did not impose any. The statement therein that the lot was for the erection of a hall, merely set forth the motive prompting the grant, and did not operate as a condition, or to reduce the estate to a base fee: Packard v.

Assuming that the statute is constitutional, the council had no power to impose upon the minimum required to be conveyed the condition recited in the resolution; because the statute authorized no condition whatever, and because a condition that an educational society, without capital, should erect in two years a building costing $40,000, is unreasonable. There is no evidence that the society accepted the resolution, and the referee does not so find. The recital in the deed that it had been accepted, is not competent evidence against the society. It ac<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>eepted the deed, not the resolution. The construction of the resolution, however, should not be such as to impute an intention to exceed tbe power conferred by the statute and disregard its directions; and, without violence to its terms, it may be construed as imposing the condition only upon the excess of land over and above the minimum of 30 feet, precisely as the officers who drafted and executed the deed did construe itl</p>
    <p id="b653-4" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[243,775,1167,850]]]'>4. The deed expressly exempts lot No. 46 from the condition. It is true, it does not contain the words, successors of assigns, but as neither is necessary to vest a fee in a corporation, their absence cannot create a condition. The statute, however, is sufficient to sustain the defendant’s title, without any assistance from either the resolution or' the deed, the borough having accepted the benefits of the act, and exercised the power of sale conferred by it. Tbe referee assumes that the defendant’s title is incomplete without the deed, because the statute employs the word “ convey ” and does not individuate the particular land to be conveyed. But this position would enable the borough to take advantage of its own wrong in neglecting to make a valid conveyance. Law, not less than equity, will in this ease regard that as done which ought to be done, and, by selling other lots, the borough has sufficiently individuated lot 46 as the one to which the defendant is entitled.</p>

But we find ourselves unable to agree that the defendant’s title is void for breach of condition. The deed from the burgess and town council of the borough of Wilkes-Barre to the defendant is the deed of the corporation itself, and not of its officers, executed under the corporate seal and with all due formalities, and it passed to the defendant the fee-simple title to the land in question, if the corporation had <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>the lawful power to convey such a title. The omission of the words, successors and assigns, does not defeat the title.

The previous sections of the act had conferred upon the borough power to make sale of lots in the old graveyard, and convey the same in fee-simple, upon a vote of the people to that effect; and then, in the fifth section, the act provided that, “ before any sale of the lots provided for by this act shall be made, a lot not less than thirty feet in front on Washington street,, and one hundred feet deep from said street, shall be set off and conveyed by the burgess and town council of the borough of W ilkesBarre to the Wyoming Historical and Geological Society, for the erection of a hall for the use of said Wyoming.

The powers conferred by this legislation were exercised by the parties, and the borough, in execution of the condition imposed by the fifth section, passed a resolution on January 21, 1871, to convey to the defendant not merely a .lot of thirty feet by one hundred, but a lot of one. hundred feet in front and one hundred and eight and one half feet in depth, consisting of lots number 46, 47, 48, and part of 49, but upon condition that the defendant should erect thereon within two years .a building to cost not less than forty <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>thousand, dollars.

By the terms of the deed, it does not. By the terms of the act, the lot was to be conveyed without consideration, and as the borough accepted the benefits of the law, it must be held to have agreed to perform its conditions. It was not at liberty, therefore, to impose any more onerous conditions or terms upon the grantee than such as were authorized' by the act. There was no authority conferred by the act upon the borough to exact the erection of a building to cost forty thousand dollars, and doubtless the borough authorities so understood, because they granted three times as much land as the act directed, and annexed the condition to the whole grant. The resolution of the council does not say explicitly that it was intended to subject the lot No. 46 to the performance of this condition, though the generality of the language used would require such a construction to be placed upon it. But. the necessity for holding such a construction is dispelled by their deliberate act in conveying the land only one week later, in pursuance of their statutory obligation. It is perfectly manifest that it was their intention to convey the lot No. 46 free of the condition, because they expressly say so, and say that the-lot No. 46 represents the minimum quantity required to be conveyed by the act. There was no intention to violate the terms of the resolution, and there was no evidence of any such purpose. They were best competent to interpret their own resolution, and, as a fair reading of it is entirely consistent with all the terms of the deed, they cannot be considered as at all in conflict.</p>

They certainly did not intend to impose any condition applicable to lot No. 46 more onerous than was authorized by the act, and <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>the best proof of the absence of any such intention is found in the language of the deed executed and delivered almost immediately afterwards. The language of the deed would properly be much more formal and ceremonious than the language of the resolution, and, as there is ho essential conflict of meaning between the two, and they can be easily reconciled, it is the dutj1- of the courts to read them as the parties undoubtedly intended them. We therefore hold that the terms of the deed are not in conflict with the true meaning of the resolution, but were intended to be used as a literal compliance with it.</p>
    <p id="b657-3" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[215,871,1182,1529]],["BL_658.1",658,[256,354,1170,1269]]]'>As to the use of the lot expressed in the fifth section of the act, it is only necessary to say that it is not restrictive of the grant, and that the title is not dependent upon a literal compliance with the use expressed. The act simply says that the lot shall be conveyed to the defendant “ for the erection of a hall for the use of said Wyoming Historical and Geological Society.” No condition of any kind was imposed. The passage of the title was not made to depend upon the performance of any terms. No direction was given that a hall should be erected, and no penalty of any kind was established, whether by way of a reverter of the estate or in any other manner whatever, for the non-erection of the hall. In these circumstances, the authorities are uniform and very clear that no conditional estate is given, and the land can be held in fee-simple without performance of the consideration or purpose expressed. A very full treatment of this subject, and quite a full collection of the authorities, will be found in the opinion of this court in the case of Methodist Church v. Public Ground Co., <a href="/pa/103/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="103 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="449133" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0608-01">103 Pa. 608</a>. Mr. Chief Justice Mercur, in delivering the opinion, said: “A mere recital in the deed that it is made upon a certain consideration will not raise a condition. Where a deed set forth that the estate thereby .conveyed was given to the commissioners of a county, in consideration of a county-seat’having been located on the premises, it was held that no condition was thereby created that the county-seat should be kept there: Harris v. Shaw, <a href="/ill/13/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="13 Ill. 456" data-case-ids="2583962" data-case-paths="/ill/13/0456-01">13 Ill. 456</a>. In Cook v. Trimble, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%2015" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="9 W. 15">9 W. 15</a>, it was held that the words ‘in consideration of §160 and a comfortable living to be given to the said grantor, his wife and his daughter, during their natural lives,’ by the vendee, might create a covenant, but not a condition. In Kerlin v. <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>Campbell, 3 Har. 500, a conveyance of land for a valuable consideration, in trust for the use of the inhabitants of the county of Delaware, to accommodate the public service of said county, was held not to be defeated on a sale and conveyance by the vendees, whereby the use for the public service ceased. Seebold v. Shitler, 10 Cas. 133, was the case of a conveyance to the commissioners of a county and their successors in office in fee-simple, for the purpose of erecting thereon a court-house, jail, and county offices. The county was subsequently divided, the seat of justice removed therefrom, the land sold and used for other purposes, and the proceeds thereof divided between the two counties. It was held that the title did not revert to the heirs of the original owners,” etc. Referring to the writing in the principal case, the Chief Justice proceeded to say: “No restraint was imposed on an alienation of the land. No construction of a reservoir, nor any work on the ground, was required to precede the right to demand a deed. No clause provided for a forfeiture or termination of the estate, in case the land ceased to be used as a reservoir. No right of re-entry was reserved by the grantor on any contingency. No technical word to create a condition was used. No other words were used equivalent thereto, or proper to create a condition. The authorities show that the recital of the consideration, and a statement of the purpose for which the land is to be used, are wholly insufficient to create a conditional estate.”</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.4",658,[258,1633,1166,542]]]'>All of the foregoing reflections are applicable to the present case, and they control its decision. We are clearly of opinion that no condition was annexed to the grant of the land which the borough was directed to make to the defendant, and the latter was guilty of no breach which would forfeit its estate. Therefore, if it were true that the borough had really imposed a condition when they made the grant, it would have been void for want of authority. But we are equally clear that the borough had no such purpose, so far as the lot No. 46 was concerned, and therefore they are not entitled to recover the land.</p>
