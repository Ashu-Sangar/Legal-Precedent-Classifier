Hicks, widow and administratrix of William Hicks, deceased, it was found that the decedent, who died on November 24, 1888, had left a will, duly admitted to probate, and fully copied in the opinion of the court below, directing that after his just debts were paid his property should be equally divided “between” his wife Martha R. Hicks and his daughters Ida Bell and Ella Billmayer, if living at his death. The auditing judge, Ferguson, J., divided the balance for distribution, to wit, .$1,291.52, into three equal shares, giving one third to the widow and one third to each of the two daughters.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b531-12" data-blocks='[["BL_531.12",531,[262,2099,1169,300]]]'>The intention of testator is the guide toward a proper understanding of his will. It is not so much the meaning of the words used, as what he meant by the use of those words. This we are to discover. Testator himself wrote his will. It is very brief, and the language and spelling indicate he possessed but an ordinary education. It is in these words:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[233,717,1170,850]]]'>It is now contended by the widow that her late husband intended his estate to be divided into two equal shares, she being entitled to one share, and that remaining to be equally divided between his two daughters; and that such was his intention is shown by the use of the preposition “ between,” which can only be properly construed by giving it its correct and accurate signification; and, as it applies properly only to the case of two parties, two objects, two points, or two classes, we must conclude that testator’s meaning was thus to divide his estate between his wife and daughters, the former taking one share and the latter another share. But we do not think such was his intention. If testator had used the common preposition “ among ” or “ amongst,” it is conceded there would be no room for argument. And it needs no illustration to show the frequent and familiar use of the word “between,” even by well-educated and otherwise accurate linguists, when “ among” is intended.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-6" data-blocks='[["BL_532.6",532,[232,1586,1165,500]]]'>In this will there is nothing to show testator’s wish to give his wife one half of his estate, but there is sufficient to indicate his wish that it should be divided equally among the three persons uamed by him, his wife and daughters. Our conclusion is, testator used the word “between” with the meaning of its frequent synonym “among,” and his intention, therefore, was to divide his estate into three equal shares. We are not aware of any authority which supports the position taken by the widow. But numerous cases were cited to show it is wholly misconceived.</p>

Warrington, 2 Hare 154, the words were: “ The residue of my estate I leave equally between my brother Thornhill Warrington and my sister Ann Van C., my nephew William Henry Warrington, and Emma, his wife.” It was claimed that this estate should be divided into three parts, treating the husband and wife as one person. The court di <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>vided it into four, giving the husband and wife each a fourth, instead of a third, between them.

But the court held that each child and the two Strattons all took a fifth each.</p>
