The road which was opened in Jackson township was no part of the road which was laid out in that township by the viewers. It did not extend to the terminal point of that end of the road, and it ran in a different direction from that portion of the road as laid out by the viewers. It is true that the supervisor of Jackson, of the previous year, Chester Brown, did commence the opening of the part of the road in Jackson, on the route as finally completed by the present defendants. But he testifies expressly that he did not finish it, and that it was in fact finished in 1887 by the defendants.

There were no such facts here. Doubtless it was unnecessary to have two bridges in such close proximity as would result from building the new one required by the view, but that is a difficulty which could only be remedied by proceedings in the Quarter Sessions to vacate that portion of the road as laid out by the viewers. It would never do to permit supervisors to exercise such authority, and practically override the order of the court confirming a road as laid out by a report of viewers.</p>

It would not follow from the fact of such indebtedness that the township was unable to build the bridge. If it was intended to show such financial inability, the offer of proof should have been broader, and embraced facts necessary to that purpose. But as the township might have had assets sufficient for the payment of the debt, or taxable property enough to raise the amount necessary to build the bridge, the offer to prove the mere fact of the indebtedness was too narrow.</p>
