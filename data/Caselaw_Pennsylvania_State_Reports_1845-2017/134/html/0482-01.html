Watts &amp; Co. during 1886 and 1887, amounting to $719.57. The defendants, Farrel, Brinton and Ditman, admitted a liability as partners with H. C. Watts from and after February 10,1885, but denied such liability prior to that date. Mr. Righter, having testified in proof of the plaintiffs’ account, admitted, on cross-examination hy the defendants, that payments had been made on account of H. C. Watts &amp; Co. in 1886 and 1887, aggregating $825.64, but testified that all said payments were applied upon older accounts against H. C. Watts &amp; Co., which had begun in 1882 and had been running ever since that date. To establish the partnership relation of the defendants prior to 1882, plaintiffs put in evidence an agreement under seal dated July 16, 1877, and executed by the defendants and H. C. Watts, which set forth:</p>

It is contended on behalf of defendants that the payments received by the plaintiffs from October, 1886, to May, 1887, should be credited against the account for which suit is brought. This plaintiff has testified that when he received these payments he appropriated them to the items of an account previously contracted. His right to do so is questioned by the defendants, but [under the contract of July 16, 1877, they were made partners and have continued so ever since that date, so as to be liable for the whole account due to the plaintiffs.] 33 I therefore direct you to find a verdict for the amount claimed.”</p>
