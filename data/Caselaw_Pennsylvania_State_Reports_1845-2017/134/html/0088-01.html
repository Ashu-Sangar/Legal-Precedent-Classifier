Noyes, with this note in them, whether that is sufficient to overcome the testimony of Mr. Holohan as to the circumstances under which he gave this note to Col. Noyes. The fact that this note was not indorsed, is also a circumstance to be considered by the jury in determining how it went into the possession of Col. Noyes, whether as claimed here by Mr. Holohan, or as claimed by the administrator. It is claimed that if this note was to be discounted it would have been indorsed.

Noyes received this note under the circumstances, claimed here by the administrator, as collateral security for his having gone bail for stay of execution; or, whether, as claimed by Mr. Holohan, that he gave it for discount. If, as claimed by Mr. Holohan, that it was passed over to Col. Noyes for discount, then of course the estate cannot ask Mr. Mix to pay that note. If, however, you come to the conclusion, under all the evidence in the case, that Col. Noyes received this note as collateral security, then he is entitled to recover the amount of the 'note with interest from the date of its maturity. As you determine this question of fact, so your verdict should be either for the plaintiff or the defendant. If you find the note was given as claimed by Mr. Holohan, then you find for the defendant. If, however, under all the facts and circumstances, you come to the conclusion that Col. Noyes received the note as collateral security, then render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the note with interest.] s</p>

The second, alleges error in the charge of the court. We think the charge was in entire accord with the manner in which the case was tried below. It was fairly left to the jury to find whether the note in controversy came into the hands of the administrator of A. C. Noyes, under the circumstances claimed by him, or whether it had been given to Noyes by Holohan for tire purpose of discount. The jury were distinctly told that if so given, there could be no recovery. It is also proper to say that no question was made as to the time when the note came into the hands of Noyes. It is evident the jury did not believe Holohan. It is not for us to say whether they were right or wrong in this. It is their province to judge of the credibility of witnesses, and, if they make a mistake in this respect, it is not our duty to correct it. Our province is. to correct errors of law committed on the trial, and as nolle such appears in this case,</p>
