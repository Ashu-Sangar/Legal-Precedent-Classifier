It would not be reasonable to expect it; it is not to be expected and not necessary; but, if it was used by even a few of those who are located in that community or vicinity, who reside there and who had occasion to use it; if it was necessary for them to use it, and if they did use it; then it was a sufficient use and acceptance by the public. These are questions entirely for you under the evidence, whether it was used at all, and whether it was dedicated by the original owner at the time, or at any time, during its existence as a village or a borough, and was accepted, or if it was used for a period of twenty-one years; we say, in either case that Third street would be a public highway. [If that land was dedicated to the public use as a public street by the owners of the land when the village was laid out, or the town plot made; and if their lands were divided into lots, and the lots run off and sold to the line of this Third street, and it was used by the public to any extent, then it would be a* public highway.] 4.....</p>

They moved there, I believe, in 1846 and put these buildings there subsequently. But, if this street was dedicated to the public a single day previously to that time, and was used by them, the dedication was complete; and their user of it for a period of more than twenty-one years will give them no right or rights as against the public.

You have nothing to do with the law or with the severity or unseverity of the sentence. Some comment has been made on both sides about what the result may be. It is usual in such cases that the court, in giving sentence, should specify particular compliance with these several rules, directing the defendant to remove the obstructions sufficiently to permit the public to pass and repass as they ought and have been accustomed to do as of right. It is not necessary, in such a town as the village of Washington ville, that a thoroughfare fifty feet wide should be open and fit for travel throughout its entire breadth from sidewalk to sidewalk, or that it should be paved and smooth walks made, but it should be open so that convenient passage if necessary may be made. In our country roads on our hillsides or our high precipices and in our deep ravines in Pennsylvania, we may have some roads that are only <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>required to be opened eight feet wide, wide enough for the passage of pedestrians and of a single vehicle in some places. In that place in Washingtonville, no doubt the removal of all the buildings on the street, except the addition to the dwelling-house, would be amply sufficient, permitting .all parties to use it, to pass and repass with convenience and pleasure, and the sentence of the court would be under our discretion and governed accordingly.] 7 [You have nothing to do with the result, the judgment of law, as it is called. It is your duty, if you believe that the evidence warrants a conviction, if you believe that this street was a public street, was intended for the good of that town and of the people in that locality; if you believe that it Avas devoted to public use, it is your place to say so by pronouncing the defendant guilty. If it was not, then you are to return a verdict of not guilty. It is entirely a question of fact for you, gentlemen, and Ave place it in your hands with what we consider sufficient instructions.] 8</p>

If he did observe its erection and did not dissent; if he saw that being erected in that street and did not dissent, he would be liable; he would be held under the law to have assented; and, if the parties who-erected it had any arrangement with the defendant, under such a situation of facts he could be made to pay for the erection. You will judge whether he is proved to have consented to the erection of these buildings. If he has, he would be guilty equally with the women who have testified that, they did it.] 9</p>

This was undertaken upon the two grounds of user and dedication. The village of Washington-ville had existed for three quarters of a century or more, with streets, among which, as the commonwealth claimed, was East or Third street. But the village was not incorporated until 1870, and the official map was not approved by the borough council until 1887. This map, when offered in evidence, contained a recital that it was a draught of the borough as originally laid out in 1818, together with such alterations as had been legally made, and also a draught of the several streets as established by the town council from suiyeys made in 1872, etc.., ..The map was not proved by -the surveyor who made it, ' ñor was the original draught of 1818 produced, or any reason given for the failure to produce it. There was therefore no evidence at all that this map was even a correct copy of the old one, and yet it went to the jury with the weight of its recital of the fact that the streets upon it, including the one in dispute, had been public highways since 1818. This, to the untrained mind of the jury, might well have seemed conclusive of the title by prescription, and therefore of the first requisite <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>step in. the proof of defendant’s guilt. The assignments of error which depend upon the admission and use of this map must be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[226,520,1177,858]]]'>The ninth assignment must also be sustained. In criminal cases the commonwealth must prove that the defendant himself did the act charged. There are, it is true, some exceptional cases where it is sufficient to prove the act of an agent, but no case goes so far as to convict a landlord for the act of his tenant, even though he knew of it, and did not dissent. The facts of the case were peculiar in this regard, and the jury might well have found, under the evidence, that the landlord, being a boarder in the tenants’ house, was a joint occupant of the demised premises, and equally responsible for the act of obstruction. No doubt this was in the learned judge’s mind; but the case having been given to the jury, as it appears from the 'opening of the charge, under some pressure for time, at the close of the day, the jury were instructed in such terms as might lead them to believe that the landlord would be criminally responsible for the separate act of the tenants, if he knew of it and did not dissent.</p>
    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[230,1397,1177,510]]]'>The same circumstances of the trial probably led to the unfortunate putting before the jury of the probable result of a verdict of guilty. It was no doubt inadvertently done, as both sides apparently had commented on the matter, and the judge almost immediately rectified the mistake by explicit directions that the jury had nothing to do with the result, but should decide according to the evidence. But a jury might be apt to understand it as in some degree a subject for their consideration, and in that aspect it was a dangerous error, which can hardly be considered cured by the subsequent directions.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.6",413,[235,1914,1169,96]]]'>The other assignments are so largly dependent on the points already discussed that they need not be separately considered.</p>
