Until that event, the purchaser cannot commence proceedings to obtain possession under the act of 1849, neither can he make a lawful entry upon the land. The tenant of the heir, although in possession, has no power to sacrifice his landlord’s rights. He owes him fealty and is bound to hold under him and for him until tire landlord’s title expires. The tenant of the heir, therefore, cannot shield himself from an obligation to pay rent, which falls due before the delivery of the purchaser’s deed, by showing that he has paid it to the purchaser. He should have paid it to his landlord. The rule in this case is discharged.</p>

Those cases, however, do not militate against the principle that, after final confirmation, the purchaser has an equitable title, and the interest of the heirs is simply a right to receive the purchase money at the hands of the court. The court has charge of the property, the sale is made by the court, and is similar, in nature and effect, to a sale under a decree in equity : Demmy’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20169" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="43 Pa. 169">43 Pa. 169</a>; Johnson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Pa.%20139" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="114 Pa. 139">114 Pa. 139</a>.

In this state, the reception of the acknowledgment of a sheriff’s deed is in the nature of a judgment of confirmation, and prior thereto there is no judicial act concern<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>ing the sale: Bellas v.

In several of the states, where sheriff’s sales are otherwise confirmed, it is held that the deed is merely evidence that the title has passed: Jones v.

A sheriff’s deed is acknowledged on a day fixed, in open court, and hence a bidder at the sale knows that he will be entitled to the rent from a certain day. If the rule be as we contend, in the case of an Orphans’ Court sale, he would have the same certainty; otherwise not.</p>

Moreover, the date of confirmation of a sale for payment of debts, determines the rights of creditors: Kier’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pitts%20L.J.%20129" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="27 Pitts L.J. 129">27 Pittsb.

Hence the purchase money is on that date applied to the debts, and the estate receives the benefit of it, whether it is then paid down or is secured with interest. In this case the purchaser was to pay interest from confirmation on one half of the purchase money. It is not alleged that the failure to pay the second instalment until the deed was delivered was due to any laches on his part. The delay of the administrator in tendering a deed cannot affect the decree of the court: Fish’s Est., 14 W. N. 566; Jacobs’ App., <a href="/pa/23/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="23 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="973983" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0477-01">23 Pa. 477</a>; Breil’s App., <a href="/pa/24/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="24 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="9505223" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0511-01">24 Pa. 511</a>.
