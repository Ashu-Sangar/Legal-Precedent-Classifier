J., in discussing this exception, said: “The point, then, is reduced to this, shall this court quash the proceedings because the jury have not expressly said that they found no damage had been sustained by any persons but the heirs of Baker ? To establish such a principle might do mischief, because on search of precedents we find many cases-where the jury have heen silent as to all persons who, in their opinion, had sustained no damage. These reports or findings by freeholders, appointed to inquire into damages, are not scanned with such critical nicety in this court as proceedings at common law, removed by writ of error.” The proceedings were accordingly affirmed. A careful research on our part, has failed to find any authority for the doctrine, that viewers or reviewers are bound to say expressly in their report, that they find no damages in favor of any party claiming to be injured by the location of the road. In other words, a report regular on its face and in favor of the road as necessary for the public convenience, with no award of damages to any one, will be construed to mean that, in the opinion of the viewers no damage has been suffered, and that the road should be laid out.</p>

And having taken into consideration the advantages tó be derived from the road passing through their lands, we have assessed no damage.” The report of the viewers seems in all respects to conform to the strictest view of the requirements of the law, while the finding of the reviewers in reference to the prospective injury to the railroad company, might be reason<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>ably considered as beyond their proper jurisdiction, and as contrary to the principle stated in the case of the Germantown &amp; Perkiomen Turnp.

In the case of Passayunk Ave., 2 Pa. C. C. R. 271, Judge Fin-letter said: “ In considering the disadvantages, if any, incident to the opening of the avenue or street, the viewers have no right to receive evidence as to the estimated cost of possible future street improvements, or to consider the same, nor the suggestion that any railway company may ask for or obtain permission to lay tracks upon the highway.

Both the viewers and the reviewers find that the proposed road is necessary for public convenience, and it does not seem to us that the assumption by the reviewers of a possible future liability to the railroad company, in the manner suggested, has any proper place in the consideration of the case.

    <p id="b440-9" data-blocks='[["BL_440.9",440,[266,1164,1157,146]]]'>The facts of this case are very fully 'stated in the opinion of the learned judge of the Quarter Sessions. The questions arising upon those facts were rightly disposed of.</p>
    <p id="b440-10" data-blocks='[["BL_440.10",440,[264,1317,1159,550]]]'>The reports of the viewers, reviewers, and supplemental report of the latter, together with the testimony taken on the exceptions thereto, were all before the court when the former was confirmed. By necessary implication, the final order confirming the report of the viewers disposed of the reports of reviewers and all the exceptions, as fully as if the court, in express terms, had set aside the reports of the reviewers and dismissed all the exceptions. Whether the exceptions to the report of the viewers were previously abandoned or not, is now of no consequence. If not abandoned, they were, in effect, dismissed by the order confirming the report.</p>
    <p id="b440-11" data-blocks='[["BL_440.11",440,[263,1876,1156,93]]]'>There appears to be no error in the record that calls for either a reversal or modification of the order complained of.</p>
