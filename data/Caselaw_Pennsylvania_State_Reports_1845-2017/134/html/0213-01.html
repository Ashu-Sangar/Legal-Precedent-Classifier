In October, 1886, he was regularly employed as a creeler, at |4 per week. The duties of a “ creeler ” were to wipe the “ fly ” or waste off the roller-beam of the “mule” or “jenny.” There was testimony tending to show that the employment was not dangerous. When the time came to “ wipe down,” the creeler would signal the spinner, who would throw off the belt, and stop the mule; but the creelers were in the habit of wiping the beam when the mule was in motion. About a week after the plaintiff last went into the mill, when cleaning the roller-beam with his <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>hands, while the mule was in motion, his arm was caught by the centre band and badly fractured and mangled.</p>

J.: This case was discussed in the court in banc, and we came to the conclusion that the machine itself was not dangerous, and therefore required no special instruction; that the machine, in the manner in which it was to be cleaned, was not of itself dangerous, if the person employed took ordinary care; and therefore, upon the whole case, we came to the conclusion that we would not be satisfied to sustain a verdict in this case upon the evidence; that, inas- ■ much as it was almost impossible to let a case of this kind go to a jury without a verdict being obtained, we have concluded to take the responsibility of entering a nonsuit. At the same time, we are conscious that the Supreme Court may say that ■there is evidence enough in this case to take it to the jury; and while we have to meet that question at some time, we might as well meet it now. I do not think, in any event, we could conscientiously sustain a verdict in this case. It would be continuously setting aside verdicts. The last witness said there is no danger if the boy looks at what he is doing. A minor is required to use his senses ; he is required to look at the machine; he must look at it. This machine was not dangerous, and it could not be prevented, — there was no way, I suppose, really, of preventing a boy putting his fingers into it.</p>
