The judgment was entered upon a scire facias to revive. It is almost unnecessary to say that no appeal lies in such case. The opening of such a judgment rests in the sound discretion of the court below. The act of 1877, allowing appeals from the order of the Common Pleas opening a judgment, applies only to judgments entered by virtue of a warrant of attorney or upon a judgment note. In Jenkintown N. Bank’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=124%20Pa.%20837" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="124 Pa. 837">124 Pa. 837</a>, the execution was not set aside; it was merely stayed.
