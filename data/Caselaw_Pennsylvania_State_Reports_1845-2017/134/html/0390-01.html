The Orphans’ Court decided in favor of the widow, and hence this appeal. 'The question is, who, under the words, “the right heirs of Charles T.

Did the testator intend that, in the contingency that has happened, his two grandsons should take the entire fund to the exclusion of his son’s widow, or did he intend that the fund should be distributed among those who, according to the intestate law, would be his son’s distributees, in case the latter died possessed of the fund and intestate, and, if so, did he intend that they should take per. capita or otherwise?</p>

We are satisfied that it was the intention of the testator in this case to use the word “ heirs ” in that sense, and hence the Orphans’ Court rightly construed the clause in question to mean those entitled under the statute of distributions, viz., the testator’s two grandchildren and his son’s widow; but we think there was error in distributing one half to the widow, and one fourth each to the two grandchildren. The gift is to the “ heirs of him, the said Charles T. Ashton, in equal shares.” Having ascertained that the parties entitled to participate in the distribution are the two nephews of Charles T. Ashton and his widow, there appears to be no good reason why they should not take “ in equal shares,” as the will provides. The two nephews of Charles T. Ashton take, not by representation, but directly under their grandfather’s will, as next of kin of their deceased uncle. The testator appears to have contemplated equality among those entitled to participate. That intent, being lawful and clearly expressed, should be carried out. The fund, less the costs of this appeal, should be equally divided among the three parties named in the decree.</p>
