An attentive consideration of the bill of the complainant ■ shows that the main feature relied upon in the bill itself was that the complainant had obtained from A. C. Hopkins, the owner of the tract of land over which these two branch lines of road are constructed, the right to construct its road, and branch or <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>branches, and that the defendant company had entered upon the same land without having obtained any such right from Mr. Hopkins.
