The affidavit sets forth that “the consideration of the making of this agreement, (February 8,1875,) which completely abrogated and nullified the agreement of October 19, 1872, on which this suit is brought, was the payments already made thereon, amounting to $8,525.90, and the execution and delivery to said J.
