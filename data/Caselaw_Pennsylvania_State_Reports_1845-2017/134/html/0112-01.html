    <p class="summary" id="b137-7" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[235,1108,1158,655]]]'>This act supplies the general law so far as relates to the county of Lycoming, and must govern this case. It was clearly intended by the legislature that no per diem pay was to be allowed the election officers in this county for any service except such as is provided for by said act. The section of the act of 1839 relating to mileage of the return judges is not supplied by the act of 1873, nor are its provisions inconsistent with said section, and therefore mileage is still allowed to the judges for making their returns. But, so far as daily pay of election officers is concerned, there is no act or part of any act of assembly in force in-this county, other than the act of 1873. The daily pay of the judge not being within its provisions, he is not entitled to said pay.</p>

Under the ninety-second section of the act of July 2,1839, the plaintiff would have been <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>entitled to his per diem compensation for returning the election papers to the prothonotary. The local act of March 13, 1873, is very broad in its terms, and supersedes this section of the act of 1839. It provides “that, instead of the pay heretofore received by the election officers in the Gounty of Lycoming, each officer and member of any election board shall hereafter be paid for their services at any special or general election in said county at the rate of $2.50 per day, to be computed from the opening to the closing of the polls, and 25 cents per hour for each additional hour they may be necessarily engaged in counting the votes and making out the returns after the polls shall be closed.” This covers the ground fully as to the per diem compensation. It is expressly given “ instead of the pay heretofore received,” and excludes any other or further compensation for any services performed by such officers. The question of mileage is not before us.</p>
