For if any answer to any of those questions were untrue, the plaintiff cannot recover, although the answer may not have related to any matter or condition of health which caused the dearth of Bernard O’Hara, and although he may have made the answers honestly; so that, you will observe, the question is not one of fraud, but of the truthfulness of the answers, which, as we have said, was warranted by the covenant of the assured.</p>

We say to you that it is incumbent upon the defendant to establish the untruthfulness of the answer. Was the answer true? Or, has it been shown to your satisfaction to be untrue ? The only testimony bearing upon the subject, as I recollect it, is the testimony of John O’Hara, who swears that his father was 59 or 60 years of age, but that he is not positive which. His testimony given upon another trial as to his father’s age has also been put in evidence, and you will remember what that was. It is contended upon the part of the defendant that then John F. O’Hara testified positively that his father was 60 years of age. It is not for us to determine what the effect of that is.] 3 We say to you that it is incumbent upon the defendant to show that his answer in this respect is untrue. If it is shown that fact to your satisfaction, then it would prevent a recovery by the plaintiff here, although it might not make any very material difference whether he was 59 or 60 years of age. It is a question of contract.</p>

Give name and address of the doctor in full. Answer, No.” If Bernard O’Hara had medical attendance within the year prior to the time when this insurance policy was issued, then that answer was untrue, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. The covenant was put into the policy for a very plain purpose; in order that in case the insured had received medical attendance the Insurance Company might inquire of the medical attendant as to the nature of the disease, and as to its effect, upon him as a proper risk to be taken by the company. Now, this is a question of fact to be determined by you from tbe credible testimony in the cause. It is not for us to say what your conclusions shall be from the testimony. It is alleged on the part of the defendant, and Dr. Whitney has so testified, that in the fall and winter of 1880 and 1881, he attended Bernard O’Hara, and it is claimed further, that on September 24, 1880, he gave to Bernard O’Hara a prescription, which has been offered in evidence, for quinine. In determining as to <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>the truth of this testimony, you are to take into consideration everything which would tend to show, in the first place, whether or not the witness is truthful, whether he intends to tell the truth. You will also take into consideration any circumstances which may tend to corroborate him in his testimony. You are also to bear in mind that the materiality of this particular answer relates to and depends upon what took place within the year prior to the time when the application was made. It is not for us to argue the case. We may suggest, however, that it is not impossible that the medical attendant may have been mistaken as to the year, and be entirely truthful as to the fact of his having at some time attended the insured; so that it would not do for us to assume your functions and decide the question of fact, as we have been requested to do by the defendant’s counsel. Was the witness truthful? Does he recollect distinctly and positively ? Is he corroborated by the circumstances ? Is he contradicted in any material particular?- We call your attention to the testimony as to the circumstances under which it is alleged he gave this prescription. If I recollect, he says that Mrs. O’Hara and, he believes, the daughter were present when it was given. You have heard their testimony upon that subject, denying any'recollection, at least, of his having been present and giving any prescription in their presence. I cannot go any further into this subject without intrenching upon the ground which properly belongs to you, and I therefore submit it for your decision.} 1 Did Dr. Whitney, within a year prior to April 22, 1881, attend upon Bernard O’Hara ? If he did, then there could be no recovery in either of these cases. And it is not important, so far as this particular question is concerned, whether the disease for which he was then called was one which subsequently caused the death of the insured or not.....</p>

The policy or certificate of membership contains a provision that if any answer or representation, made by the insured in his application, is in any respect untrue, the policy shall be null and void.

On the trial, evidence tending to sustain these allegations was introduced by the defendant company. To meet this, rebutting evidence was introduced by the plaintiff, and thus questions of fact were presented that were clearly for the jury.
