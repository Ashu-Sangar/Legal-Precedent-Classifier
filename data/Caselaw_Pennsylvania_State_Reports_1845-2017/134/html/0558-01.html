W. H.

Please send it up as soon as possible, and oblige.” In accordance with this instruction the plaintiffs furnished the stove, piping, etc., and the architect attended to having it set up in the other building. In regard to this stove the architect testified that the stove was set up in the centre of the room, and that it was no part of the building; it could be put in anywhere; in a parlor, for instance ; but it must be put in a location where it could be attached to a smoke flue. A phor tograph of the laundry in which the stove was set up was produced by the defendants and identified by the witness Jackson upon cross-examination.

It did not then appear that the work of the plaintiffs was all done for a lumping price, under one contract; nor that the replacement of the hearths was in pursuance of the architect’s arbitrary directions, given without any knowledge as to whether they were properly set-in the first instance. Although the plaintiffs’ bill of particulars gives separate prices for all the items of work and materials, because they could charge no more against the owner of the building than a quantum meruit,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a> the sum to he paid them upon the sub-contract was an entire one, and nothing was recoverable until their work was all completed.</p>

Within six months from completion of the work, in accordance with the architect’s requirements, they filed their lien. The six months could not commence to run before the setting of the hearths on March 9, 1887, because, if the hearths first put in were defective, the contract was not then completed. A supply of defective hearths was equivalent to no supply, and if those originally contracted for had not been supplied till March 9, 1887, there could be no question that a lien might be filed within six months thereafter. Whether the architect, as the owner’s agent, properly or improperly rejected these hearths,' they clearly were supplied as a part of the work originally contracted for, and because the owner claimed to he entitled to them under the contract. The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to recover: McKelvey v. Jarvis, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20Pa.%20417" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="87 Pa. 417">87 Pa. 417</a>.</p>

The laundry stove, supplied in March, 1887, sustains the lien filed within six months thereafter for the entire job. ' The original contract with McNichol provided for the erection of the stove as a part of the building, and its supply was a part" of the work which the plaintiffs contracted to do. It would he gross injustice to them, when they deferred filing their lien until the defendants were ready to receive the stove, if the lien should be defeated because, at the last moment, it was <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>ordered to be put up in another building.

There is no such principle as that contended for by the plaintiffs, viz., that the contractor and the sub-contractor may,N by making a lumping or entire contract between themselves, render the building subject to a lien for furniture or other personal property, not within the mechanics’ lien law.

There is not the slightest suggestion of evidence that any human being touched or saw the hearths first put in, between the time when they were set by the plaintiffs’ workmen and the discovery of their broken condition. No one was produced who saw them safety delivered or set. On the contrary, the actions of the plaintiffs, at the time of the transaction, most unequivocally admitted that the stones had been broken by their workmen. The second set having been furnished to supply a deficiency for which they were thus responsible, the plaintiffs, by entering an additional charge therefor in their ■ account, with a corresponding credit for the first set, cannot sustain their stale claim.

They admit that they made no extra charge against the owner or contractor for the new hearths, and that they were not present when the broken hearths were set; and they failed to show by their workmen who delivered the hearths in place that they were then sound and in good condition. It is obvious, from the appellants’ account of the transaction, that the new hearths were supplied by them gratuitously, to compensate for the defective hearths they had previously furnished. It clearly appears from their testimony that these hearths were broken when first seen and inspected by the architect, and whether their condition was caused by defective materials or defective setting is unimportant. It is true that their bill of particulars contained a charge under date of March 9,1887, of $18.50 for two soapstone hearths, and a credit of like amount for two soapstone hearths, bjit, in view <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>of their explanation of them, these entries are of no consequence.</p>
    <p id="b589-3" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[159,462,1195,591]]]'>It was held in McKelvey v. Jarvis, <a href="/pa/87/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="87 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="1057884" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0414-01">87 Pa. 414</a>, that work done to compensate defective performance of a contract for work and material in the construction of a building will not preserve the lien, but that work substituted for that called for in the contract may do so. In the former case the contract is unchanged, the work is done without charge to the owner or contractor, and to make good the previous default of the mechanic or material-man; in the latter, the work is done under a contract modified by the agreement of all the parties interested in it. This distinction was noted and illustrated by our Brother Clark in Homœopathic Ass’n v. Harrison, 120. Pa. 28.</p>

Jarvis, supra, is not in conflict with the decision on the claim of Brenneman &amp; Ward in Parrish’s App., <a href="/pa/83/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="83 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="1050827" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0111-01">83 Pa. 111</a>. In that case the work done by the claimants was in exact compliance with the terms of their contract with the owner, and the alteration of the mud-drums was made necessary by a mistake in the drawings furnished by the latter. It was not done to compensate a deficiency in the work of the claimants, but was required by the owners to correct their own error, at their own expense.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.6",589,[195,1531,1155,855]]]'>The laundry stove was included in the specifications for the hospital, and in the proposal of the appellants which was accepted by McNichol the contractor. It was placed in the laundry room of a building which was not embraced in McNichol’s contract, and the appellants knew its destination before they delivered it. It was a portable stove constructed for the purpose of heating laundry irons, but it was no more a part of the building than an ordinary parlor or kitchen stove. It was accurately described in the affidavits of defence, as the appellants’ testimony clearly shows. The mere fact that it was furnished under a contract which included materials for the construction of the building, does not entitle the material-men to a lien for it. A contract to build and furnish a dwelling-house according to certain plans and specifications, and for an entire price, would not confer upon the contractor a right to a lien for the portable stoves, the carpets, and other furniture essential to its use as a dwelling.

The last work done and materials furnished by them, for which they could have a lien, was on the 30th of October, 1886, and they did not file their claim until the 25th of June, 1887. As the claim was not filed in time, the nonsuit was rightly entered.</p>
