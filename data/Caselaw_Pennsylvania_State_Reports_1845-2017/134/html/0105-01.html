L. 506, commissioners were appointed to lay out and open a state road in the counties of Cameron and Potter.

The residue of this section authorizes the state road commissioners to levy and assess a tax, not exceeding five mills on the dollar in any one year, on the unseated assessed property in said townships, for the year 1865, and yearly thereafter, until said road is completed, if one half of the road taxes should be deemed insufficient. By the sixth section of the act it is provided that the powers of the original commissioners shall continue until the road is completed, when they shall make out a report, showing the money received and expended by them, with complete description of the road and the average cost per rod of building the same, which report shall be filed of record in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Cameron county; that <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>thereupon the said court shall appoint one commissioner, a resident of Lumber township, and one, a resident of Wharton township, with power to take charge and supervision of said road, and to levy, assess and collect, in the same manner and upon the same property only, as is mentioned and provided for in the third section of this act, a tax not exceeding two and one half mills on the dollar, in any one year, to be used by them in and about the repairing and keeping up of said road.</p>

L. 472, a supplement was passed to the act of March 21, 1865, which in the first section increased the rate of taxation and the number of bonds and the rate of interest. The third section of the supplement prescribes a specific mode for levying, assessing and collecting the taxes for said road. It provides that instead of levying, assessing and collecting the taxes for said road, as prescribed in said act to which it is a supplement, the said road commissioners shall assess, levy and collect the same as follows: In the month of January or February in each and every year, said road commissioners shall meet and agree upon the amount of taxes needed for the year, and thereupon shall make out a certificate signed by at least two of said commissioners in the following form: . . . . and shall file the same in the commissioners’ office in and for the counties of Potter and Cameron, and thereupon the county commissioners shall proceed to levy and collect the same, the same as county taxes are now levied and collected by law on unseated lands.</p>

The act of 1865 expressly provides that one half of said road taxes shall be paid to said road commissioners, for the purpose of constructing said road, “ until said road is completed.” It is admitted in the answer of the county commissioners and conceded on all hands, that said road has been completed for a number of years, and hence the light to any portion of said road taxes levied by the supervisors, is at an end.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[264,713,1170,756]]]'>It is questionable -whether these state road commissioners have authority to assess and collect any tax, until it is shown that they have complied with the provisions of the sixth section of the act of 1865, which requires them to make out a report showing the moneys received and expended by them, with a description of the road and the average cost per rod of building the same, so that it can be ascertained whether the commissioners are entitled to assess and collect any more taxes. But assuming that they are authorized to assess and collect further taxes, it does not follow that they are entitled to receive this sum of $581.07. They must levy and collect the tax, in accordance with the provisions of the act of 1866, and cannot claim any portion of the road taxes levied by the supervisors, as the township is exempt from the payment of road taxes after the road is completed.</p>
