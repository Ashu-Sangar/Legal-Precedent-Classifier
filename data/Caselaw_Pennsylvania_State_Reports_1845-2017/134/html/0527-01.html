To show the cause of the accident, there was testimony that the outside rail was worn away one fourth of an inch, as stated by some witnesses, — three fourths of an inch, as stated by others. Other witnesses for plaintiff testified that the entire curve was in good condition. It was also in evidence that the track was repaired two or three weeks before the accident, but there was no evidence that the trackmen were incapable, or that there was negligence in the manner the work was done. There was also evidence that a new rail or <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>rails was or were put in at the place of the accident a short time after it.</p>
