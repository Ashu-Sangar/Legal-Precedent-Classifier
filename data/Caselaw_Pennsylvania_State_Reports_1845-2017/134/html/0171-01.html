While there are decisions which hold that a state may by contract divest itself of the right of taxation as to a particular subject, it is an improvident and dangerous exercise of power, and the intention thus to grant an irrevocable exemption from the imposition of taxes ought never to be evidenced by mere implication, but should be expressed in the clearest manner.</p>

When, by statutory provision, the property of an existing charitable corporation is exempted from taxation so long as it shall be used for the purposes of the charity, “ any law to the contrary notwithstanding,” the clause quoted cannot be held to apply to subsequent legislation, hut indicates simply that the intention expressed is not to be interfered with by other laws then in existence.</p>

      <em>Mr. A. Sydney Biddle, </em>for the appellant.</p>
    <p id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.6",198,[267,627,1166,797]]]'>1. The acts of March 19, 1816, P. L. 240; March 19, 1845, P. L. 187, and April 18, 1853, P. L. (1854) 834, constitute separate and independent contracts between the state and the defendant, exempting the latter from taxation; and, having been accepted by the corporation, and acted on both by it and by charitable donors to it, no subsequent legislation, constitutional or otherwise, can impair the obligation of the contracts. The successive statutes passed in relation to this corporation, viz., the acts of May 11, 1751, 1 Sm. L. 208; April 11, 1793, 3 Sm. L. 117, and April 4, 1805, P. L. 263, and the later acts already mentioned, show that, although managed as a private institution, it is in a true sense a branch of the state government, chartered to perform a public service in relief of the state. In the performance of this service, it furnishes a consideration ample for the corresponding benefit of exemption from taxation.</p>
    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[267,1439,1160,807]]]'>2. A contract relieving a corporation from taxation is binding on the sovereignty making it: State Bank of Ohio v. Kroup, <a href="/us/57/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 How. 369" data-case-ids="3483716" data-case-paths="/us/57/0369-01">16 How. 369</a>. This has been followed by many other cases. The principle is supported by the reasoning of the opinions of this court in Wagner Free Institute’s App., <a href="/pa/116/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="116 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="554387" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0555-01">116 Pa. 555</a>; s. c. <a href="/pa/132/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="132 Pa. 612" data-case-ids="970653" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0612-01">132 Pa. 612</a>. It will be observed that the act of 1853 provides that the property of the corporation shall be “ and remain ” free from taxation so long as the income and property are used for the relief of the sick and insane poor, “ any law to the contrary notwithstanding.” The last words clearly refer to any future law. The contract was, that the property should remain free, the exemption continuing so long as the charter requirements are fulfilled. Every donor who has given money since the passage of the acts of 1845 and 1853, may properly claim that this contract was a part of the consideration of his gift.</p>

      <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>1. Decisions of the federal court of last resort have established. that a state may contract to exempt a subject from taxation. The only question left is whether the legislation, in the particular case, evinces so palpably an intention to make a contract of this extraordinary character, as to leave no doubt in any reasonable mind. The acts of March 19,1816, P. L. 240, and March 19, 1845, P. L. 187, may at once be dismissed from consideration. Passing the point that the former of these private acts is not averred in the affidavit, it is enough to say that the act of 1816 applies only to property directly occupied for hospital purposes, and the latter act only to property owned at its date. The affidavit avers neither of these things of this property.</p>
    <p id="b199-3" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[254,1028,1162,810]]]'>2. Therefore the act of 1853, alone, is to be considered, and its language contains nothing inconsistent with the more natural interpretation of a simple. allowance of the exemption, without any contractual limitation of the taxing power. The phrase, “ any law to the contrary notwithstanding,” is a time-honored form of expression, indicating a purpose to repeal or limit existing statutes. But the rule, ex nudo pacto, etc., is an impassable barrier in the defendant’s path. And the uses of the property cannot furnish a consideration. If they were obligatory before 1853, they could not be such, and if not obligatory before the act of that year was passed, they are not so now. Nor is there any indication that the exemption was conferred with reference to any subsequent gifts to the hospital; and, besides, the so-called consideration, claimed to have arisen thus, does not move from the corporation, but from a stranger to the alleged contract.</p>

The appellant contends that this is the case; that the state is under formal contract, based upon a sufficient consideration, to forever exempt from taxation all the property which the corporation owned in 1853, if not all it may hereafter purchase for its actual use, or the investment of its funds. In support of this proposition we are referred to a number of <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>acts of assembly, the most important of which are: Act of March 19, 1816, P. L. 240; act of March 19, 1845, P. L. 187; and act of April 18, 1853, P. L. (1854) 834. The only one of said acts to which it is necessary to refer is that of 1853, the seventh section of which provides “ that the estates and property, real and personal, belonging to the contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital, shall be and remain free from the payment of taxes of any kind whatsoever, as long as the income from said estates and property is used for the relief of the sick and insane poor, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>
    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[262,875,1163,904]]]'>While this section is an explicit exemption of the property of the corporation from taxation, there is nothing upon its face to make it a binding contract by the state, by which the hands of another legislature are so bound as to prevent the repeal of the act, or the imposition of subsequent taxation. The closing words of the section, “ any law to the contrary notwithstanding,” cannot, under any recognized rule of construction, be held to apply to subsequent legislation. They evidently refer to laws in existence at the time of the passage of the act, and are a general form of expression to indicate that the legislative will, thus expressed, is not to be interfered with by any other laws in existence, which seemingly conflict therewith. While there are decisions which hold that a state may contract away its power of taxation as to a particular subject, it is a most improvident and dangerous exercise of power, and ought never to be evidenced by mere implication, but should be expressed in the clearest manner. In the case in hand, the want of consideration is a full answer to the appellant’s contention.</p>

The fallacy of this reasoning consists in this : that the contributors referred to are presumed to have known, when they made their gifts, that the legislature had the power to repeal all of the exempting legislation, and might do so at any time. Nor do the uses to which the property is to be applied furnish such consideration. We concede they are a powerful argument, when addressed to the wisdom and discretion of the legislature, but not to its power. The principle contended for by appel<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>lant is of vast importance, and far-reaching in its consequences, and it is not to be sustained except in a case entirely free from doubt.</p>
