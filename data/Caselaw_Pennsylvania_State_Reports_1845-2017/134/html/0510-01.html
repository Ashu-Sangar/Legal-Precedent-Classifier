H. Dankle gave Rothermal &amp; Kauffman, in settlement of a mule deal, his note for $1,065 ; that in March, 1885, this note being unpaid,' Rothermal &amp; Kauffman made information charging A. H. Dankle with obtaining goods by means of false pretences, and had him arrested; that, when Dankle appeared before the committing magistrate, a settlement was agreed upon whereby it was arranged that upon Dankle’s giving his individual note for $200 and another note for $800, with sureties, to the prosecutors, the latter would abandon the prosecution and give the defendant a year in which to pay the indebtedness ; that this arrangement was carried out, the prosecution was abandoned, the old note surrendered and the new notes left with the magistrate and by him sent to the prosecutors ; that in order to procure the signature of Mr. Hughes to the note in ■ suit, Mr. Dankle represented to him that if he would sign it certain other gentlemen known to Mr. Hughes would also sign it, and Mr. Hughes signed it upon condition that it should not be delivered until it had been signed by the other gentlemen, which condition was violated; that to Mr. Hertz, to obtain his signature, Mr. Dankle represented that he was the owner of certain valuable property in Hazleton, which was false. The defendants contended that, the note being a joint note, the release of these two sureties, by reason of the fraud upon them, operated to discharge all. There was no evidence, however, that the prosecutors had knowledge of the alleged fraud upon the sureties.</p>

[This amounted, in our opinion, according to the testimony, to a good accord and satisfaction, — the agreement by the plaintiffs to take a note, with securitj’’, payable a year from date, and Dankle’s individual note in satisfaction of their claims against him; and this, in our judgment, made them bona fide purchasers for value, the. same as if on the faith of this note they had given to him property to the extent of its value.] 6</p>
