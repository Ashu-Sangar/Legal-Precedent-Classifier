Ricketts upon a municipal claim for lien, filed on March 19, 1888, by the city of Wilkes-Barre against a lot of ground on Northampton street, and A. Ricketts, the reputed owner. The writ was returned served, on February 2, 1889. On February 20,1889, S. B. Sturdevant, trustee, Charles Streater and W. P.

The writ was returnable on February 11th, and was served personally on February 2d. The defendant entered his personal appearance but filed no affidavit of defence, and on February 20th the plaintiff entered judgment. On the same day a writ of levari facias issued and the property was advertised for sale. On March 18, 1889, this rule was granted upon the allegations, first, that the judgment was not authorized by any law or rule of court; second, that the defendant had sold all his interest in the land before the commencement of these proceedings. At the same time, Mr. Felts filed an affidavit in which he averred that he was informed and believed that he had “ a just and complete defence to the whole of the claim of the plaintiff in this matter,” without stating the nature and character of the same, and expressed a willingness to be substituted in the place of the defendant named in the writ, provided he could have a reasonable time to present his defence.</p>

L. 841, which conferred upon the municipal authorities power to grade, pave or macadamize any street, to assess the cost and expenses thereon upon the lots fronting thereon pro rata according to frontage, to file a municipal lien for the same, together with, twenty per cent additional, upon the owner’s neglect or refusal to pay within sixty days, and to collect the same in the mode prescribed by the local act of March 25, 1865, P.

The action was a scire facias sur municipal lien. It was alleged that the judgment was not authorized by any law or rule of court; that an affidavit of defence is not required in a case of this description. The learned judge below, however, cites their rule of court in his opinion, which we think is broad enough to include this form of action. We are not disposed to criticise the view taken by the court of its own rules. There was ample opportunity afforded the defendant to put in his defence if he had any; and, as he has not made such affidavit, we may fairly infer that he has no legal defence to the claim of the city.</p>
