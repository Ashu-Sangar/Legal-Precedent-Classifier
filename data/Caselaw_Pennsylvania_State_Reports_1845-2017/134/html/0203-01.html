The only duty of the court is to instruct you upon the law bearing upon them. The first question in the case is, were the defendants guilty of any negligence ? It is argued that they had a right to have the hatchway there. Of course, they had that right, but of course, equally also, it was their duty to guard that hatchway against accidents to strangers entering the store. And if they did not guard it in some proper manner, and if the plaintiff was not guilty of negligence in'going in there, then you should find a verdict for the plaintiff, Mrs. Clopp. Now what was the duty of the defendants ? Was it their duty to put a watch there, to caution people against going in there when the hatchway was open ? Or, to keep the door locked when the hatchway was open, so people could not walk in there and walk into a hole to death or dismemberment? Now, I leave all the evidence to you which relates to that subject, and you are to find whether this accident was caused by the defendants’ negligence. If you find it was, and that no negligence was attributable to her, you are to find a verdict for the plaintiff; otherwise, for the defendants.</p>

    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[273,561,1170,1574]]]'>It appears from the evidence that defendants’ store, on the west side of Second, north of Arch street, had two entrances, which presented the same appearance when the outside doors were closed, as was the case on the day that plaintiff was injured. Between these doors or places of entrance wras a bulk window, in which articles of chinaware, queensware, etc., were displayed. The northerly entrance was intended for purchasers, and when the outside door was open it revealed an inside door, on the side of which was an enameled plate with the word “ push ” painted on it; but, when all the outer doors were closed, as they were on the day plaintiff fell into the hatchway, both entrances were externally alike, as to size, shape, appearance, etc., and about equally inviting to any one, not familiar with the premises, wishing to enter the store. In front of both was a marble slab, forming a step from the sidewalk. Immediately behind the southerly door or entrance, and within a few inches of the door-sill, was a hoistway eight or ten feet square. When not in use, a trap-door, flush with the floor, covered the opening into the cellar, and those connected with the store used it as a passageway and entrance. When the hoistway was in use, the trap-door was up, — not across the entrance, but at right angles thereto. The front door was usually locked; but, on the day of the accident the hoistway had been used, and the men had gone to another part of the store, leaving it open and the- front door unlocked. The plaintiff and her friend, passing the store, saw in the window an article which one of them wished to purchase. Mrs. Clopp opened the southerly door, and, taking the entering step to the store, plunged headlong into the cellar, about twelve feet in depth, and sustained injuries which, as the evidence .tends to show, were of a very serious and permanent character.</p>

In short, there was no error in any of the instructions contained in the very lucid and able charge of the learned president of the court below. It is unnecessary to notice specially any of the assignments of error. Neither of them can be sustained without ignoring principles that have been so long and thoroughly well settled as to admit of no reasonable doubt. The case hinged solely upon questions of fact, which were carefully submitted to the jury, and which they appear to have disposed of according to the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>
