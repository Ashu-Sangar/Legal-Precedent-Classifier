      <em>(a) </em>The only evidence tending to support a claim presented by a widow • against her husband’s estate, for money belonging to her and received • by him, was his declaration that she had given him money, without saying how much, and that if she did not stop scolding he would give it back to her, and she could do as she pleased with it:</p>

      <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>The decedent died intestate about the 1st day of August, 1884, and left to survive^ him a widow, Lucy Heffner, and issue, one son, Franklin D. Heffner. James H. Marx, Esq., presented claim of Lucy Heffner against the estate for $1,000. The claimant is the decedent’s widow. In support of her claim she shows that she had a separate estate from her father of $1,500. Of this sum she received $500 in 1878, and thereafter annually a further sum of $100, and during the lifetime of her husband, prior to August, 1884, she had received $1,000. Franklin D. Heffner, the only son, and contestant of the claim, was called adversely by his mother. His testimony was to the effect that his father had informed him that his mother had given him money, and added that he, witness, did not know how much. After further questioning, he admitted that his father had admitted she had given him her money and that now she always scolded about it, and that unless she discontinued her scolding, he would return it to her to do with it as she pleased.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[242,1270,1163,962]]]'>The witness was an unwilling one, testifying against his own interest, and concluded most of his answers, “but I don’t know how much he received.” His testimony created the impression upon me that he endeavored to be as ■ indefinite as he could. There is no question but that the claimant had this $1,000, and that she received it in the presence of her husband, who, together with the claimant, always gave their joint vouchers for the receipt of the same. The pajrer of this money always left it between them upon the table, and never saw either of them take possession of the several sums paid. He informing his son that he had it, and she scolding about it, must surely tell the true story. Beyond all question, he possessed it, and she was dissatisfied, either because he took charge of it, or because he would not give her any evidence of indebtedness for it. Taking the evidence of Mr. Winks,' who paid the money to them, and that of the son, all doubts are removed. He got the money, else he would not have complained and admitted the receipt thereof to his son, nor would his wife have scolded about something which had no existence.</p>

It is true the conversations are not fixed as to time. If the witness had been anxious to have the exact time when such ■intercourse took place, he might and should have stated it. As it was, he made his testimony as vague as possible. He testified against his will and against his interest. The court has no definite information when they or any of them were had. It takes it, however, that if they had not occurred during the latter years of deceased, this interested witness, and if not, surely his counsel, knew enough to fix the time during the early years of said yearly payments. His counsel, instead of fixing a time when either of said conversations took place, objected to his testimony, and strongly contended that he was aii incompetent witness to prove the conversations. Of his competency there can be no doubt.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[242,1164,1165,744]]]'>It was also further contended that whatever money, if any, the decedent had out of her separate estate, she had given him .as a gift. The act of 1848 made this money her separate estate. The same having gone into his possession, the presumption of law is that he held it as trustee for her: Hamill’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20863" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="88 Pa. 863">88 Pa. 863</a>. It is not claimed that it was a loan; can it under the evidence submitted, have been a gift ? It was strenuously argued that the word given, was used by the father, when he informed his son that she had given it to him as a present or gift. Such interpretation cannot be fairly inferred therefrom. The word “ given ” is equally applicable to a trust, and may be used in loaning. He had the money, and until a gift of it is proven he had it in trust. I find that under all the facts it cannot have been less than $900, and allow her her claim to that extent.</p>

Taking the receipts given to Wink, and the testimony of the accountant, we have adequate elements of clear proof, the claimant receiving $1,000, and the decedent stating that she had given him her money: Hamill’s App., <a href="/pa/88/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="88 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1061152" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0368-01">88 Pa. 368</a>.

Whether a gift or a loan, the amount is not fixed, nor is there anything in the testimony by which it can be ascertained. The declarations do not throw light upon the exact point of controversy or of complaint on the part of the wife. What was the subject of her scolding when her husband grew impatient, and said to his son: “ If she did not stop scolding he would give it back to her, and she could do as she pieased with it? ” Had she loaned him money, and was she demanding a note or bond as security for it? Then the most natural way to appease her would have been to give the note or bond demanded. Had she given him money or intrusted <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>money to his care that she now wanted to take back into her own hands ? Then the direct route to peace lay in the line which her husband’s words indicated when he said he would “ give it back to her, and let her do as she pleased with it.” There was in this no acknowledgment of a debt, no recognition of an obligation to pay, but rather the expression of a purpose to permit his wife to have her own way, and do as she pleased with her money.</p>

In the opinion, the court said: “ The court has no definite information when they or any of them (the talks between the witness and his father) were had. It takes it, however, that if they had not occurred during the latter years of deceased, the interested witness, and if not surely his counsel, knew enough to fix the time during the early years of said yearly payments.” The court found, therefore, that the conversations between the witness and his father “occurred during the latter years of deceased,” and after money enough had been paid on the joint receipts of his wife and himself to make up the sum found due from him. This finding the learned judge admits does not rest on the testimony, but on his estimate of the intelligence of the accountant and his counsel, ahd the kind of defence which, in his opinion, persons of such intelligence would be likely to make if they had it in their power to do so. In the absence of the necessary proof on the part of the claimant, the learned judge set up a presumption, based upon the intelligence of the accountant and his counsel, and allowed this presumption to supply the defect in the claimant’s case. The reasoning seems to be substantially this: “ The claimant alleges a loan of one thousand dollars out of her own money to her husband, and demands it out of his estate. The proof is indefinite and insufficient. It does not show how much of her money came into his hands, or when, or whether it was received as a gift or a loan; but if he did not have at least nine hundred dollars, and did not receive it as a loan, the known intelligence of his administrator and the attorney for the estate would enable them to establish a negative.” Because they did not establish a negative, the <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>learned judge inferred or presumed the affirmative, and accordingly made the decree.</p>
    <p id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[274,447,1169,1171]]]'>The trouble with this method is that it puts the burden of proof on the wrong shoulders. The general rule undoubtedly is that a defendant may wait, before breaking silence, until a case has been made out against him that will justify a verdict or decree; but, under the doctrine applied in this case, such waiting may supply the want of a case against him, and be the ground of the decree. This, it seems, would be the case, at all events, where the court entertained a good opinion of the intelligence of the party and his counsel. We can hardly agree to this method of proof. This claim may be a meritorious one, but it seems never to have been presented to the administrator. More than five years after her husband’s death, after her own second marriage, and in the Orphans’ Court on final distribution, it comes first to the notice of the parties interested in the estate. When, in addition to these circumstances, it is remembered that the administrator is the son of the claimant, living in the same neighborhood, and that they were necessarily brought frequently into contact with each other during the course of administration, in which- the rights of the widow under the intestate laws- had been fully protected, we see no reason for relaxing the rules of evidence in her favor, if we bad the power to do so, or for putting a penalty upon the intelligence of the administrator and his counsel.</p>
