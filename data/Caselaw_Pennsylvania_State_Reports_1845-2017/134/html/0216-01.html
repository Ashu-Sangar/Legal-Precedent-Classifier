He told me to try. I asked Mr. Holtzman, and he said he would sell it to me. Several days afterward Mr. Stier called again, and asked me whether I had succeeded.

Then he came to my house in the evening and said he had found a friend of his, Mr. Yockel, but he would not give $800; he would only give $550. He thought it wasn’t worth more. I said to Mr. Stier, you know I advanced you $800, and that I want from you. Then he said, we will make two notes, one for $550, and the other for $250. I gave him the business.

The receipt which was given contemporaneously with the notes, corroborates the plaintiff in his statement that the subject of the sale to the defendant was “ the stock and fixtures, with ware finished and unfinished.” No one, not even the de<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>fendant, claims that the notes were given for the right to nse a certain process in the business. The defendant does not say that he purchased any such right from the plaintiff. And the letters written to the defendant by the attorney of a third person, should have been rejected as immaterial and irrelevant. The defendant gives as a reason for not paying the notes, merely his being stopped from using a particular process; and the jury were practically instructed that if they believed the defendant stopped the business by reason of receiving these letters, and the plaintiff did nothing in the matter, there could be no recovery.' This instruction was clearly error.</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[222,919,1162,910]]]'>2. The court erred, also, in its construction of the memorandum annexed to the receipt of October 25, 1880. The only purpose of that memorandum was to afford additional security to the plaintiff in case the notes should not be paid at maturity. It was not intended to make void the promissory notes, but simply to give the plaintiff' the right to demand the return of the business, on failure of the defendant to pay them. There is no evidence that he ever made such demand, and the defendant’s testimony, that he surrendered the business means nothing more than that he simply abandoned it, when Yockel refused to advance more money. The plaintiff positively testifies that he never took it back. The agreement must be interpreted according to the understanding of the parties, that it was to afford additional security to the plaintiff; but even if it were a contract permitting the defendant to rescind, he was not in position to exercise the right, as he does not pretend that the business was in the condition in which he received it: Story on Sales, §§ 421 et seq.; Benjamin on Sales; §§ 764 et seq.</p>

The receipt signed by the plaintiff plainly expresses the fact that the business was sold to the defendant, and, as the writer of the receipt testified, the principal value of the thing sold lay in the process for etching. That the jury did not believe the plaintiff’s denial that the business was sold, is not strange, as his testimony is a tissue of contradictions. All these questions ■ of fact have been settled by the verdict. When the business was stopped by notice that it was infringing on a patent, the consideration of the notes failed. The letters of the patentee’s <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>attorney were not hearsay, but were admissible to prove the fact that notice to stop had been served upon the defendant, and were the best evidence of that fact: Greenl. on Ev., §8 100, 101, 124.</p>
    <p id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[261,555,1159,653]]]'>2. The instructions to the jury simply meant that if the consideration of the notes failed there could be no recovery. Failure of consideration was fully established by the testimony for the defence, and the plaintiff, in his testimony in rebuttal, makes neither explanation of, nor reference to the claim of infringement. The process being the consideration of the notes, and the plaintiff having no right to sell it, and making no effort after notice to protect the defendant, the latter, being obliged either to abandon the business or to risk a lawsuit in defence of his purchase, was justified in surrendering the business to the plaintiff and declining to pay the notes. By his long delay to sue, the plaintiff has apparently recognized the force of the defendant’s position.</p>
    <p id="b246-7" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[261,1217,1157,804]]]'>3. The transfer to the defendant was not absolute, as it contemplated and provided for “ other satisfactory arrangements ” than the payment of the notes, and the plaintiff evidently anticipated some difficulty. But, independent of the terms of the receipt, the defendant had a right to rescind, as a vendor selling personal property of which he is in possession, impliedly warrants the title, and if the purchaser does not get that for which he has paid, the consideration fails: Benjamin on Sales, 540; Boyd v.

The defendant having a right thus to surrender, and having done so, as is settled by the verdict, the construction of the concluding clause of the receipt is unimportant.

In other Avords, as the case stood, it was error to receive them. If they had been followed by evidence showing that the party claiming to have a patent for the process had brought suit, and established his right thereto, the case would have been different; but no such offer of evidence was made, in connection with the letters or otherwise.</p>

Referring to the letters, the learned judge said: “ Some time after the purchase by the defendant, a notice was received from a lawyer notifying him to discontinue the process of etching then in use by him ; that he was infringing on a patent. The defendant says he informed Mr. Geist of this notice, but that he did nothing in the matter, and that he could get no satisfaction from him. If Stier’s story is correct, and he was forbidden to carry on the business, and so notified Geist, and he failed to do anything, Stier was not bound to pay. Where a man sells personal property, a horse, merchandise, etc., he is bound to warrant the title. If Mr. Geist undertook to sell this business, he was bound to guarantee the title to what he sold, and, if the title is not good, he is responsible.”</p>
    <p id="b248-6" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[285,1127,1168,647]]]'>Conceding the correctness of the general proposition that a warranty of the seller’s title is implied in every sale of personal property, where there is no understanding to the contrary, it is not applicable to the facts of this case. At most, the defendant’s right to use the process was challenged, and suit threatened; but no suit was brought, nor was the defendant prevented in any way from continuing to use the process. A purchaser of personal property, in full possession thereof, cannot refuse to pay for it because a third party has asserted a superior title and threatened to bring suit for the recovery of the property or its value. The notice and threat to sue, without more, did not absolve the defendant from his liability to pay his notes.</p>
    <p id="b248-7" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[283,1792,1168,400]]]'>We think the learned judge also erred in construing the memorandum appended to the receipt, quoted in the third specification. The only purpose of the provision therein contained was to afford additional security to the plaintiff, in case the note was not paid at maturity. All that was intended by the provision was that if defendant did not pay the note at maturity, etc., the plaintiff should have the right to repossess himself of the business, property, fixtures, etc.</p>

The plaintiff’s version of the transaction is materially different, and should not be ignored in submitting the case to a jury, if it is <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>found necessary to do so. He testified, in substance, that at the instance of the defendant, and as a matter of accommodation to him, he advanced the money and purchased Holtzman’s interest in the business, etc., expressly for defendant, and that the notes in suit were given for the money thus advanced.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[239,661,1169,197]]]'>The last specification is not sustained, for the reason that it does not appear that the court was requested to give any such instruction; nor was the plaintiff entitled to it, if he had made the request.</p>
