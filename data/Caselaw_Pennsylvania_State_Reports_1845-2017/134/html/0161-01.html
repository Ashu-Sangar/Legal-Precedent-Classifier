The contract does not conclude the plaintiffs. In the' first place it provides for exemption from liability for negligence of “ any officer or agent of the company,” but not for the negligence of the company itself ; and there is a very broad distinction between the act of a corporation, and the act of an agent or officer of a corporation; Culver v.

Again; the negligence provided against is that of officers or agents “ in procuring, collecting or communicating said information,” and the information referred to is that “ concerning the responsibility and character of mercantile persons inquired of,” as contra-distinguished from what was contained in the printed volumes. It is too plain for argument that the information “ to be held in strict confidence” and not to be asked for, for the use of other parties, etc., cannot be the contents of these volumes, and grammatical construction requires that the expression, “ said information,” occurring later in the same sentence, shall be taken as referring to the same thing. Duncan v. Dun, 7 W. N. 246, relied on by the court below, was a case where special information was furnished in answer to a particular inquiry.

This defendant was bound to ordinary diligence in publishing its volumes, and was bound to know that injury might result from its negligence: 3 Addison on Contracts, § 401. Ordinary negligence is the absence of reasonable care according to the circumstances, and is a question for the jury: Penna. R. Co. v.

The fact that the same misstatement occurred in prior and subsequent issues, is evidence of negligence: Pullman P. Car Co. v. Gardner, 14 <em>W. </em>N. 17. The explanation that the statement was a typographical error, will not excuse the defendant, nor will the contention that a fire, causing a loss of $15,000, occasioned the total insolvency of the company, negative the averment that the plaintiffs’ loss resulted from the negligence of the defendant.</p>

On the basis of the contract the defendant is not liable. The interpretation on which the plaintiffs seek to confine the exemption to information other than that contained in the printed reports, is not a fair and reasonable one, whether we regard the grammatical construction or the general object of the provision. In the natural course of business the reports must be the chief source of information to the subscriber, and the same reasons exist for applying the stipulation to them, as in the case of special communications.</p>

There is, however, no legal evidence that the report complained of was not true. The special report was not an admission of facts, but merely a statement of the declarations of the refining company’s president, and the note admitting a typographical error was a declaration by a clerk, which,- not being part of the res gestae, was not evidence against the defendant: Wharton on Ev., § 1173, note 1, §§ 1175,1180; Rockwell v.

The Union Refining &amp; Manufacturing Company of Jersey City was therein rated as having $600,000 capital actually paid in, whereas in fact that was the amount of its authorized capital, of which only $20,000 had been paid in. This was explained bj- the Bradstreet Company as a typographical error. The plaintiffs allege that on the faith of the statement contained in the book they sold the Union Refining &amp; Manufacturing Company a bill of merchandise amounting to $1,457.47, which has been wholly lost by reason of the insolvency of said company. The defendants contend that they are protected by the following provision of their contract with the plaintiffs: “That the said company shall not be liable for any loss, or injury caused by the neglect or other act of any officer or agent of the company in procuring, collecting, and communicating said information; that the said company does not guarantee the correctness of the said information,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b193-7" data-blocks='[["BL_193.7",193,[248,1720,1168,654]],["BL_194.1",194,[252,333,1167,1622]]]'>Contracts against liability for negligence are not favored by the law. In some instances, such as common carriers, they are prohibited as against public policy. In all cases, such contracts should be construed strictly, with every intendment against the party seeking their protection. This contract provides for exemption from the negligence of the officers and agents of the company, but not from its own. We think the fair and reasonable construction of it is, that the company should not be liable for the mistakes of those who collect and impart the information. Thus, if the company had been informed by the person who gave them the report as to the Union Refining &amp; Manufacturing Company, that it had $600,000 of paid-up capital, and this statement had been furnished as re<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>ceived, we think the defendants would not have been responsible. Information as to the financial standing of individuals, firms, and corporations is sometimes difficult to procure, and cannot in all instances be entirely accurate. It is a delicate inquiry always, and involves the employment of a large number of agents, scattered over a wide extent of country. In some instances the information furnished may not only be erroneous, but wilfully false, to gratify the private malice of the informant against the subject of the inquiry. The contract referred to was evidently intended to protect the company from the consequence of errors, from whatever cause, in the collection and transmission of such information by its agents. Hence, if the company communicates such information as it was received, it may well claim protection under the contract, even though such information should subsequently appear to have been erroneous. Its duty is to give the information which it receives, in good faith, to its customers, or to those who apply for it. In this case, however, the contention is that the report made to the company by its agent was correct, and that the mistake was the blunder of the company in having it erroneously printed in its July book. This book was certainly issued by the company; it cannot be said to be the act of any particular officer or agent, as would be the sending of information as to the standing of a particular individual, or by the transmission of such information by a clerk, in the course of his routine duties, to a subscriber or customer. The contract was against the negligence of particular officers or agents, not against the negligence of the company as such. It was certainly negligence on the part of the company to issue a book containing such a gross error; not the error of the agent who furnished the information, for he furnished it truly, but of the company in sending it out falsely.</p>

We need not discuss this proposition, in view of the evidence that the refining company is insolvent.</p>
