    "head_matter": "H. G. RIGHTER ET AL. v. W. E. FARREL ET AL.\nAPPEAL BY DEFENDANTS FROM THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS NO. 1 OF PHILADELPHIA COUNTY.\nArgued April 8, 1890\nDecided May 5, 1890.\nWhere an agreement is executed whereby a debtor transfers to his creditors all his assets and business interests, and is employed by them at a salary to manage the \"business for them, the creditors thereby become copartners in the business, although the agreement provides expressly that they shall not be involved in any partnership liability therein.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 199 January Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 300 September Term 1887, C. P. No. 1.\nOn October 14, 1887, Henry G. Righter and George Gibson, trading as Righter & Gibson, to use of J. L. Shoemaker and Owen Shoemaker, trading as J. L. Shoemaker & Co., brought assumpsit against H. C. Watts, D. G. Brinton, J. G. Ditman and W. E. Farrel, copartners, trading as H. C. Watts & Co. Issue.\nAt the trial on October 22,1889, the plaintiffs proved a book-account showing charges against H. C. Watts & Co. during 1886 and 1887, amounting to $719.57. The defendants, Farrel, Brinton and Ditman, admitted a liability as partners with H. C. Watts from and after February 10,1885, but denied such liability prior to that date. Mr. Righter, having testified in proof of the plaintiffs\u2019 account, admitted, on cross-examination hy the defendants, that payments had been made on account of H. C. Watts & Co. in 1886 and 1887, aggregating $825.64, but testified that all said payments were applied upon older accounts against H. C. Watts & Co., which had begun in 1882 and had been running ever since that date. To establish the partnership relation of the defendants prior to 1882, plaintiffs put in evidence an agreement under seal dated July 16, 1877, and executed by the defendants and H. C. Watts, which set forth:\n\u201cWe the undersigned creditors of H. C. Watts, doing business as H. C. Watts & Co., do agree with him and between ourselves as follows : \u201d\n\u2014The agreement then provided, in substance, that upon the transfer to \u201c us \u201d of all the assets and all unfilled orders and business interests of H. C. Watts & Co., the same were accepted as a settlement and compromise of seventy-five per cent of \u201c our \u201d claims as creditors, whether said assets, etc., realized said per cent or not; that H. C. Watts was to devote his whole attention to the realization of the assets and the management of said business until December 31,1877, for $10 per week, to be paid out of the proceeds of said business, and said Watts was not to incur any indebtedness \u201c beyond that involved in the manufacture and selling books, without the assent of the committee of creditors; \u201d that said committee, named in the agreement, was instructed to pay monthty, first, the rent of the store; second, royalties ; third, the cost of manufacturing books ; and fourth, the salary of Mr. Watts and other expenses. The agreement then concluded:\n\u201c It is mutually understood and agreed that nothing in this agreement is intended or shall be construed to involve any partnership liability on the part of the said committee of creditors, either as between themselves or the public.\u201d\nThe defendants, after testimony adduced to support their contention that no partnership relation existed until February 10, 1885, and that the payments made after that date should have been applied upon the account in suit, put in evidence a definite copartnership agreement between them executed on that date, and rested.\nThe court, Biddle, J., charged the jury as follows :\n\u201c In this case, the only question involved is a question of an alleged payment. It is contended on behalf of defendants that the payments received by the plaintiffs from October, 1886, to May, 1887, should be credited against the account for which suit is brought. This plaintiff has testified that when he received these payments he appropriated them to the items of an account previously contracted. His right to do so is questioned by the defendants, but [under the contract of July 16, 1877, they were made partners and have continued so ever since that date, so as to be liable for the whole account due to the plaintiffs.] 33 I therefore direct you to find a verdict for the amount claimed.\u201d\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for $841.85. A rule for a new trial having been discharged, judgment was entered on the verdict, when the defendants took this appeal, assigning for error, inter alia :\n2. The portion of the charge embraced in [ ] 3\n3. The instruction to find for the plaintiffs.3\n\u25a0 Mr. Oharles L. Smyth (with him Mr. J. M. West), for the appellants:\nThat the agreement of July 16,1877, did not constitute a partnership, counsel cited: Lindley on Partnership, 10; Hart v.
