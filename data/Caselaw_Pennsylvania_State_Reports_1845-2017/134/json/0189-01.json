The act of 1877, allowing appeals from the order of the Common Pleas opening a judgment, applies only to judgments entered by virtue of a warrant of attorney or upon a judgment note. In Jenkintown N. Bank\u2019s App., 124 Pa. 837, the execution was not set aside; it was merely stayed. The authorities cited in regard to the setting aside of an execution do not apply.\nOrder affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.",
