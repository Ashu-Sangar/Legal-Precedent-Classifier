        "text": "Opinion,\nMr. Justice Sterrett :\nAfter making provision for the payment of debts, etc., the testator, in and by his last will and testament, directed his executor therein named to convert all his estate, real and personal, into money, and gave the proceeds thereof, \u201ctogether with all other my monies from whatever source,\u201d to his said executor, in trust, to invest one third thereof in real-estate security, and pay the interest and income thereof to his widow during her natufal life; and directed that, immediately after her decease, the said one third should go to his three children, Margaret Ellen, Charles T., and Francis Ashton, subject to the same trusts and limitations as are thereinafter particularly set forth and declared with respect to their respective shares of his estate. He then gave one third of the residue to his said executor, in trust to invest the same as aforesaid, pay the interest and income thereof to his daughter, Margaret Ellen Ashton, during life, etc. Another third of said residue he gave to his said executor, in trust \u201c to invest the same upon good and sufficient land security, and the interest and income thereof to pay unto my said son Charles Theodore Ashton during all the term of his natural life, and from and immediately after his decease, then in trust to and for the only proper use and behoof of all and every the child or children he may leave, or the lawful issue of any of them who maj^ then be deceased leaving such issue, and in default of such issue, or of any grandchild or grandchildren, the issue of any deceased child of him the said Charles T. Ashton, then in trust to and for the use of the right heirs of him, the said Charles T. Ashton, in equal shares.\u201d In like manner, he gave the remaining third of said residue to his said executor in trust to invest and pay the income to his son Francis Ashton for life, etc.\nTestator\u2019s daughter married, survived her husband, and died in June, 1873, leaving to survive her two children, William A. Ford and John A. Ford, the appellants. His son Francis died in November, 1886, intestate, unmarried, and without issue. Testator\u2019s widow, Mary Ashton, died in September, 1887; and his remaining son, Charles T. Ashton, who never had any issue, died June 14, 1889, leaving to survive him his widow, Bridget Ashton, the appellee.\nThe fund for distribution is undoubtedly personal property, the proceeds of real estate which the testator directed his executor to sell. In itself, this was an out and out conversion, but in addition to that the real estate was actually sold and converted into money. The claimants on the fund were the two' nephews of Charles T. Ashton, William A. and John A. Ford, and his widow, Bridget Ashton. The former, as sole \u201cheirs\u201d of their uncle, claimed the whole, while his widow claimed one half of the fund. The Orphans\u2019 Court decided in favor of the widow, and hence this appeal. 'The question is, who, under the words, \u201cthe right heirs of Charles T. Ashton in equal shares,\u201d are entitled to participate in the distribution, and in what proportion ? Did the testator intend that, in the contingency that has happened, his two grandsons should take the entire fund to the exclusion of his son\u2019s widow, or did he intend that the fund should be distributed among those who, according to the intestate law, would be his son\u2019s distributees, in case the latter died possessed of the fund and intestate, and, if so, did he intend that they should take per. capita or otherwise?\nIn its technical sense, the word \u201cheirs,\u201d employed by the testator in this case, is inapplicable to a disposition of personal property, but in its popular meaning the word has a much wider signification. When used in a gift of personalty, it is very frequently employed to denote those who are entitled to take under the statute of distributions, unless there is something in the context to indicate a contrary intention: Eby\u2019s App., 84 Pa. 241; Morton v. Barrett, 22 Me. 257, 264; Mace v. Cushman, 45 Me. 250, 261; Houghton v. Kendall, 7 Allen 72, 77; Sweet v. Dutton, 109 Mass. 589; Tillman v. Davis, 95 N. Y. 17; Newton\u2019s Trusts, L. R. 4 Eq. 171; In re Philps\u2019 Will, L. R. 7 Eq. 151; Finlason v. Tatlock, L. R. 9 Eq. 258; and other cases cited by the court below. We are satisfied that it was the intention of the testator in this case to use the word \u201c heirs \u201d in that sense, and hence the Orphans\u2019 Court rightly construed the clause in question to mean those entitled under the statute of distributions, viz., the testator\u2019s two grandchildren and his son\u2019s widow; but we think there was error in distributing one half to the widow, and one fourth each to the two grandchildren. The gift is to the \u201c heirs of him, the said Charles T. Ashton, in equal shares.\u201d Having ascertained that the parties entitled to participate in the distribution are the two nephews of Charles T. Ashton and his widow, there appears to be no good reason why they should not take \u201c in equal shares,\u201d as the will provides. The two nephews of Charles T. Ashton take, not by representation, but directly under their grandfather\u2019s will, as next of kin of their deceased uncle. The testator appears to have contemplated equality among those entitled to participate. That intent, being lawful and clearly expressed, should be carried out. The fund, less the costs of this appeal, should be equally divided among the three parties named in the decree.\nDecree reversed, and record remitted for correction in accordance with this opinion, costs of this appeal, etc., to be paid out of the fund.",

FROM THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT OF PHILADELPHIA COUNTY.\nArgued April 1,1890\nDecided April 28, 1890.\n(a) A testator' bequeathed personalty in trust to pay the income thereof \u2019 to his son for life, and, on the son\u2019s decease, in trust for the son\u2019s children or the issue of his deceased children, and, in default thereof, \u201c then iu trust to and for the use of the right heirs of him the said\u201d son, \u201cin equal shares.\u201d The son left to survive him a widow and two nephews, grandchildren of the testator:\n1. Though the word \u201cheirs,\u201d in its technical sense, is inapplicable to a disposition of personal property, yet, when used iu a gift of personalty, it is very frequently held to denote those who are entitled to take under the statute of distributions, unless there is something in the context to indicate a contrary intention: Eby\u2019s App., 84 Pa. 241.\n2. In the present ease, the fund being personalty, the two nephews take, not by representation, but directly, under their grandfather\u2019s will, as the next of kin of their uncle; and, the testator contemplating equality among those entitled to participate, the fund was to he distributed to the widow and nephews in equal shares, one third thereof to each.\nBefore Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 147 January Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 169 July Term 1889, O. C.\nOn October 14, 1889, the trustee\u2019s account in the estate of Charles T. Ashton, deceased, was called for audit, when it was made to appear as follows:\nJonathan Ashton, father of Charles T. Ashton, died August 5, 1859, leaving a will dated July 4, 1859, duly admitted to probate, in which after certain particular bequests he provided as follows:\n\u201c I order and direct my executor, hereinafter named, to convert my personal estate into money, and sell and dispose of my real estate, either at public or private sale, within 2 years next after my decease, for the highest and best price that can be gotten for the same, and to grant and convey the same to the purchaser or purchasers thereof, his, her, or their heirs and assigns, without any liability on the part of suob purchaser or purchasers to see to the application of the purchase money therefor; and the moneys arising from such sale or sales thereof, together with all other my monies from whatever source, I give and bequeath unto my executor hereinafter named, his executors and administrators, In Trust for. the uses, intents and purposes following; that is to say, In Trust as to one equal third part thereof to invest the same upon good and sufficient land security, and the interest and income thereof to be paid to my wife Mary Ashton during all the term of her natural life ; and from and immediately after the decease of my said wife Mary Ashton, the said one third part of my estate shall go to my said three children, Margaret Ellen, Charles T. and Francis Ashton, subject to the same trusts and limitations as are hereinafter particularly set forth and declared with respect to their shares of my estate.\n\u201c One equal third part of the residue and remainder of my said estate I give and bequeath unto my said executor hereinafter named, his executors, administrators and assigns, In Trust to invest the same upon good and sufficient land security, and the interest and income thereof to pay to my said daughter' Margaret Ellen Ashton during all the term of her natural life,\u201d etc., [ut infra.]\n\u201c One other equal third part of the said residue and remainder of my said estate I give and bequeath unto my said executor hereinafter named, his executors and administrators, In Trust to invest the same upon good and sufficient land security, and the interest and income thereof to pay unto my said son Charles Theodore Ashton during all the term of his natural life, and from and immediately after his decease, then In Trust to and for the only proper use and behoof of all and every the child or children he may leave, or \u2022 the lawful issue of any of them who may then be deceased leaving such issue, and in default of such issue, or of any grandchild or grandchildren, the issue of any deceased child of him the said Charles T. Ashton, then In Trust to and for the use of the right heirs of him the said Charles T. Ashton in equal shares.\n\u201c And the other and remaining equal third part of the said residue and remainder of my said estate I give and bequeath unto my said executor hereinafter named, his executors and administrators, In Trust to invest the same upon good and sufficient land security, and the interest and income thereof to pay unto niy said son Francis Ashton during all the term of his natural life,\u201d etc. [ut supra.]\nThe testator left surviving him a widow, Mary Ashton, and three unmarried children, Margaret Ellen, Charles T., and Francis A. Margaret Ellen married, survived her husband, and died in June, 1873, leaving two children, William A. Ford and John A. Ford. Francis died in 1886, intestate, unmarried and without issue. Mary Ashton, the widow, died in 1887. Charles T. Ashton married in 1888, and died on June 14, 1889, leaving a widow, Bridget Ashton, but no issue.\nThe fund for distribution was the proceeds of real estate sold under the provisions of the will, and the one half thereof was awarded by the auditing judge to Bridget Ashton, widow of the decedent, and the other half in equal shares to William A. and John A. Ford, the decedent\u2019s nephews.\nExceptions to the adjudication being filed by William A. and John A. Ford, and argued before the court in banc, on November 23, 1889, the following opinion was filed, Pen-rose, J.: ,\nThe distribution directed by the adjudication is entirely in accordance with the authorities. Where the subject of the gift is personalty, the word \u201cheirs,\u201d in a limitation to the heirs of a first taker, either substitutionally or by way of succession, is understood as meaning the persons entitled under the statute of distributions in case of intestacy, including therefore, a widow: Jacobs v. Jacobs, 16 B. 557; Porter\u2019s Trusts, 4 K. & J. 197; Mounsey v. Blaymire, 4 Russ. 384. It is true that in England such a gift does not include a husband, since he takes the estate of the wife by virtue of his paramount right as husband, and not under the statute: Doody v. Higgins, 2 K. & J. 729; In re Craven, 23 B. 333; but the law is otherwise in Pennsylvania: Patterson v. Hawthorn, 12 S. & R. 112; Gibbons v. Fairlamb, 26 Pa. 217.
