    "head_matter": "ESTATE OF WILLIAM HICKS, DECEASED.\nAPPEAL BY MARTHA R. HICKS FROM THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT OE PHILADELPHIA COUNTY.\nArgued April 10, 1890\nDecided May 5, 1890.\nUnder a will which provided that the testator\u2019s property should be \u201c equally divided between \u201d his wife Martha and his daughters Ida B. and Ella B., each legatee would take one third, the word \u201cbetween\u201d being used as synonymous with the word \u201c among.\u201d\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Steiirett, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 286 January Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, number and term not shown.\nOn November-11, 1889, in the adjudication of the account of Martha R. Hicks, widow and administratrix of William Hicks, deceased, it was found that the decedent, who died on November 24, 1888, had left a will, duly admitted to probate, and fully copied in the opinion of the court below, directing that after his just debts were paid his property should be equally divided \u201cbetween\u201d his wife Martha R. Hicks and his daughters Ida Bell and Ella Billmayer, if living at his death. The auditing judge, Ferguson, J., divided the balance for distribution, to wit, .$1,291.52, into three equal shares, giving one third to the widow and one third to each of the two daughters.\nTo this adjudication, the widow filed exceptions alleging that the auditing judge erred in not awarding her one half the fund for distribution. After argument thereof, the following opinion was filed, Hanna, P. J.:\nThe intention of testator is the guide toward a proper understanding of his will. It is not so much the meaning of the words used, as what he meant by the use of those words. This we are to discover. Testator himself wrote his will. It is very brief, and the language and spelling indicate he possessed but an ordinary education. It is in these words:\n\u201c Philada. Mar. 21, 88. This is to certify that I Wm Hicks desires at my death after my death Just Debts are paid that my property shall be equaly divided between my Wife Martha 11. Hicks and my Dtrgh Daughters Ida Bell and Ella Billmayer if living at my death.\n\u201cIn witness whereof I set my hand & seal this 21st day Marsh 1888.\u201d\nIt is now contended by the widow that her late husband intended his estate to be divided into two equal shares, she being entitled to one share, and that remaining to be equally divided between his two daughters; and that such was his intention is shown by the use of the preposition \u201c between,\u201d which can only be properly construed by giving it its correct and accurate signification; and, as it applies properly only to the case of two parties, two objects, two points, or two classes, we must conclude that testator\u2019s meaning was thus to divide his estate between his wife and daughters, the former taking one share and the latter another share. But we do not think such was his intention. If testator had used the common preposition \u201c among \u201d or \u201c amongst,\u201d it is conceded there would be no room for argument. And it needs no illustration to show the frequent and familiar use of the word \u201cbetween,\u201d even by well-educated and otherwise accurate linguists, when \u201c among\u201d is intended.\nIn this will there is nothing to show testator\u2019s wish to give his wife one half of his estate, but there is sufficient to indicate his wish that it should be divided equally among the three persons uamed by him, his wife and daughters. Our conclusion is, testator used the word \u201cbetween\u201d with the meaning of its frequent synonym \u201camong,\u201d and his intention, therefore, was to divide his estate into three equal shares. We are not aware of any authority which supports the position taken by the widow. But numerous cases were cited to show it is wholly misconceived.\nIn Warrington v. Warrington, 2 Hare 154, the words were: \u201c The residue of my estate I leave equally between my brother Thornhill Warrington and my sister Ann Van C., my nephew William Henry Warrington, and Emma, his wife.\u201d It was claimed that this estate should be divided into three parts, treating the husband and wife as one person. The court di vided it into four, giving the husband and wife each a fourth, instead of a third, between them. The Vice-Chancellor held that \u201c the number of shares into which the rtesidue is divided must be determined by counting the legatees among whom it is equally given.\u201d\nIn Butler v. Stratton, 3 Bro. C. C. 367, the words were: \u201cTo sell and divide the produce equally between Robert Stratton, John Stratton, and the children of Mary Patterson.\u201d Mary had three children, and it was claimed that they together took only one share, a third. But the court held that each child and the two Strattons all took a fifth each.\nIn Brett v. Horton, 4 Beav. 239, the words were \u201cequally between \u201d four persons named. And in our own late case of Rowland\u2019s Est., 46 Leg. Int. 454, the words were \u201c equally .between\u201d five children named, and the issue of the two also named deceased, and it was not supposed or claimed that testator intended to give one half his estate to the five children surviving and the other to the issue of the two deceased. See, also, Fissel\u2019s App., 27 Pa. 55; Risk\u2019s App., 52 Pa. 269; and Yohe v. Barnet, 3 W. & S. 81.\nThe case last cited was an action of account render to recover an alleged balance due by a copartner, and the words of the articles of agreement were : \u201c The profits and losses to be equally divided among the three copartners,\u201d etc. It will be observed, the word \u201c among \u201d is correctly used, instead of \u201cbetween.\u201d And yet, in the opinion of the court by Kennedy, J., we find the learned judge not only misquotes from the agreement, and uses the word \u201c between \u201d instead of \u201c among,\u201d as in the agreement, but says, \u201c that the profits.....were to be divided and shared.....equally between the three; .....and why shall not the losses.....be divided..... in like manner.....between the three ? \u201d But it is clear he means the division should be made among the copartners.\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that testator should inaccurately express his thought and intention as to the disposition of his estate. Without further comment, we think the auditing judge reached a correct conclusion. And.....the exceptions are dismissed and adjudication confirmed.\n\u2014Thereupon the exceptant took this appeal, assigning the dismissal of her exceptions and the confirmation of the adjudication for error.\nMr. John O. Bowman (with him Mr. Ormond Bambo'), for the appellant.\nOther than the cases considered by the court below, counsel cited: Lockwood\u2019s App., 55 Conn. 157; Haskell v. Sargent, 113 Mass. 341; Haxton v. Griffith, 18 Gratt. 576; Schouler on Wills, \u00a7 466; Holcombe v. Lake, 4 Zab. 686; Jarman on Wills, 441.\nMessrs. Valentine & Brown and Mr. William O. Hannis, for the appellees, were not heard.\nIn the brief filed, counsel cited: Fissel\u2019s App., 27 Pa. 55; Risk\u2019s App., 52 Pa. 269; Kean v. Doe, 2 Harr. 103; Gilliam v. Underwood, 3 Jones Eq. 100; Lackland v. Downing, 11 B. Mon. 32; Lockhart v. Lockhart, 3 Jones Eq. 205; Mander v. Harris, L. R. 24 Ch. D. 222."
