        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nClaimant Diana A. Burger was a certified nurses\u2019 aide at Garvey Manor, a nursing home. After treating her for a workplace injury, her physician sent her employer a bill; an attachment included her medical history, which indicated Claimant regularly used illegally obtained prescription medications and marijuana. When questioned by her employer, Claimant admitted that she used marijuana every evening, but claimed she did not report to work directly after using marijuana; she denied using prescription medications illegally.\nClaimant was fired because of her drug use. She applied for unemployment benefits; the Office of Employment Security (OES) deemed her ineligible under \u00a7 402(e) of the Unemployment Compensation Law. After a hearing, the referee concluded:\nAlthough the claimant\u2019s situation does not fall under the established policy of the employer, it is behavior which an employer should not have to accept from an employee. The policy cited by the employer is a policy which requires that an individual not report to work or work under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or the improper use of prescription medicine, which causes impairment. There is nothing in the record to establish that any of claimant\u2019s admitted drug use, or non-admitted drug use, affected her work performance.\nHowever, the circumstances here do fall within the general definition set forth above [\u00a7 402(e) ]. Based on the record presented, the claimant is ineligible for benefits.\nReferee\u2019s Decision, 2/2/00, at 3 (emphasis added). The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (UCBR) affirmed the referee\u2019s decision.\nOn appeal to the Commonwealth Court, Claimant contested the finding of willfull misconduct, based on the absence of evidence connecting her drug use to her work performance. See Webb v. UCBR, 670 A.2d 1212, 1216 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996) (willful misconduct under \u00a7 402(e) must be connected with claimant\u2019s work). The court considered the record and concluded Claimant\u2019s admissions gave rise to a legitimate concern for Employer:\nThe Court agrees that [Claimant\u2019s] conduct constituted willful misconduct connected to her work. First, [Claimant] admitted to using marijuana at home in the evening every day, and she agreed that she should not be working when she was under its influence \u2014 she denied ever reporting to work in such a condition. In addition, she admitted to having a problem in regard to using painkillers that were not prescribed for her, for which she thought Employer should have given her rehabilitation rather than termination. N.T. at pp. 7, 9. The Court agrees that these admissions gave rise to a perfectly legitimate concern on Employer\u2019s part that [Claimant] might well attempt to work in a sufficiently impaired condition to create safety problems. [Claimant\u2019s] causing this concern was conduct connected to her work in violation of the standards that Employer had a right to expect.\nBurger v. UCBR, 780 A.2d 731, 733 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001). The Commonwealth Court also stated, in the alternative, that Claimant was at fault for her unemployment because her admitted conduct was inconsistent with acceptable standards of behavior:\nIn the present case, although there was no arrest, [Claimant\u2019s] admitted conduct is inconsistent with acceptable standards of behavior. The daily use of illegal drugs involved here, unlike some other forms of criminal activity, does reflect directly upon [Claimant\u2019s] ability to perform her duties.\nId., at 734. Therefore, the court concluded granting unemployment benefits would be contrary to the policy in \u00a7 3 of the statute and affirmed the UCBR\u2019s decision.\nThere is no question Claimant could be fired for her drug use; a responsible nursing home cannot be criticized for this. However, the question of justifiable termination and eligibility for unemployment benefits are two different things; an employee may be fired for completely proper reasons, yet remain eligible for benefits. We accepted allocatur to determine whether this illegal off-duty conduct, which is not shown by the evidence to have actually or potentially affected the employee\u2019s work, may be grounds for denying benefits under the statute. Claimant contends \u00a7 402(e) does not apply because this section does not govern conduct away from work. She also asserts denial under \u00a7 3 was not a matter properly before the Commonwealth Court, as this was not raised by her employer before the referee or the UCBR.\nSections 3 and 402(e) are not parallel legal theories: Section 402(e) is used to disqualify claimant for work-related misconduct. Section 3 is used to disqualify claimants for non-work-related misconduct which is inconsistent with acceptable standards of behavior and which directly affects the claimant\u2019s ability to perform his assigned duties.\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. UCBR, 96 Pa.Cmwlth. 38, 506 A.2d 974, 977 (1986) (emphasis in original; citation omitted). The analysis is different under each section. See Kiehl v. UCBR, 747 A.2d 954, 956 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999) (where claimant has been discharged for off-duty misconduct unrelated to work, eligibility for benefits must be analyzed under \u00a7 3); Martin v. UCBR, 713 A.2d 753, 754 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998). Off-duty misconduct will not support a finding of willful misconduct under \u00a7 402(e) unless it extends to performance on the job; in such case, the misconduct becomes work-related. For example, had Claimant appeared at work under the influence of marijuana ingested off-duty, \u00a7 402(e) would apply. The referee\u2019s statement that Claimant\u2019s off-duty behavior was unacceptable is not sufficient. Behavior that may be unacceptable to an employer does not necessarily equate to \u00a7 402(e) willful misconduct; Navickas, at 290.\nOf course, had the evidence linked the drug usage to Claimant\u2019s performance, a different result might ensue, but this Court is not in position to expand or allow expansion of the record at this stage. The referee specifically found there was nothing in the record to establish Claimant\u2019s drug use affected her work performance. Despite the absence of such findings by the referee, the Commonwealth Court attempted to explain why Claimant\u2019s behavior was not acceptable. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s scope of review in this matter was limited to determining whether there was a violation of Claimant\u2019s constitutional rights, an adjudication contrary to law, a violation of the UCBR\u2019s procedure, or a finding of fact unsupported by substantial evidence. Id., at 288. Neither the referee nor the UCBR made findings that would allow a reviewing court to conclude Claimant\u2019s conduct affected her work. In finding Claimant \u201ccould have harmed patients\u201d and \u201cmight attempt to work in a sufficiently impaired condition,\u201d the Commonwealth Court violated a tenet of appellate review: there is nothing of record to support this conclusion, however inviting it appears. To \u201creflect directly on\u201d her job performance, there must be evidence, not just a vague extrapolation of \u201csafety problems.\u201d Navickas rejected a \u201chigher standard of care\u201d when evaluating whether health care workers\u2019 negligence or inadvertence could be willful misconduct under \u00a7 402(e). Absent a higher standard, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s concerns, unquestionably properly motivated, cannot transform this off-duty conduct into willful misconduct.\nThe conclusion that Claimant\u2019s off-the-job drug use constitutes willful misconduct under \u00a7 402(e) is unsupported. It is not insignificant that absent her admissions, Claimant\u2019s performance was apparently satisfactory. Simply put, Employer failed to establish Claimant\u2019s conduct was work-related, so \u00a7 402 does not provide grounds for denying benefits.\nThe Commonwealth Court went on to perform a \u00a7 3 analysis; the administrative tribunal did not. See Jones v. UCBR, 127 Pa.Cmwlth. 635, 562 A.2d 935, 937 n. 5 (1989) (declining to consider case under \u00a7 3 when UCBR did not). Section 3 may be an independent basis for denying benefits, \u201cwhen an individual is unemployed through his or her own fault due to conduct not connected with work.\u201d Gillins v. UCBR, 534 Pa. 590, 633 A.2d 1150, 1156 (1993) (citing Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, at 976-77). Section 3 provides \u201can independent basis for denying unemployment compensation benefits where claimants were unemployed due to some activity, often wholly unrelated to their work, which nevertheless bore upon their fitness for employment.\u201d Jones v. UCBR, 513 Pa. 45, 518 A.2d 1150, 1151 (1986).\nAs the OES, the referee, and the UCBR only considered \u00a7 402(e) as a basis for denial, assertion of ineligibility under \u00a7 3 has been waived. In Wing v. UCBR, 496 Pa. 113, 436 A.2d 179 (1981), the claimants were denied benefits under the theory they voluntarily quit. (See 43 P.S. 802(b)). The claimants appealed and a hearing was conducted on the voluntary quit theory; the claimants lost, then appealed to the UCBR, which affirmed the referee\u2019s decision. The claimants then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed on the voluntary quit theory but remanded to the UCBR to consider a willful misconduct theory first advanced in the Commonwealth Court. This Court reversed the remand because the right to raise that defense to paying benefits had been waived.\nIn Wing, the UCBR argued an employer does not control the theory of law upon which a case is decided, so an employer should not suffer if the theory is wrong. Id., at 181. While an employer may not control the decision, it still must raise any theory it believes is supportive. \u201c[E]ven if [OES], the [Referee, and the Board all espoused the incorrect theory, the employer must at least propose the allegedly correct theory or waive consideration of it.\u201d Id. The UCBR in Wing also asserted \u201cthe piecemeal adjudication process,\u201d remanding the matter for further proceedings on new theories first raised on appeal, would not prejudice the claimants:\nIt is difficult to imagine what could be more prejudicial to claimants than if, after nearly two years of litigation and appeals, [the claimants] find themselves before the lower tribunal and again forced to litigate issues long since waived, and uncertain if yet other, novel theories will be thrust upon them in another two years.\nId. Thus, we are constrained to reverse the Commonwealth Court because \u00a7 3 was not raised before the UCBR; as a theory for denying Claimant benefits, it is waived.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed. This matter is remanded to the UCBR for computation of benefits only.\nChief Justice ZAPPALA concurs in the result.\n. An employee shall be ineligible for compensation for any week:\n(e) In which his unemployment is due to his discharge or temporary suspension from work for willful misconduct connected with his work, irrespective of whether or not such work is \"employment\u201d as defined in this act.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 802(e). An employer bears the burden of proving a claimant engaged in willful misconduct. Navickas v. UCRB, 567 Pa. 298, 787 A.2d 284, 288 (2001). Although willful misconduct is not statutorily defined, this Court has defined that term as:\na) wanton or willful disregard for an employer's interests; b) deliberate violation of an employer's rules; c) disregard for standards of behavior which an employer can rightfully expect of an employee; or d) negligence indicating an intentional disregard of the employer\u2019s interest or an employee's duties or obligations.\nId. \u201cp?]he conduct that rises to the level, of willful misconduct may vary depending upon an individual employee\u2019s specific occupation or work situation.\u201d Id.\n. Section 3 states:\nDeclaration of Public Policy\n* * *\nThe Legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this Commonwealth require the exercise of the police powers of the Commonwealth in the enactment of this act for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 752. Under \u00a7 3, the employer must demonstrate 1) the claimant\u2019s conduct was contrary to acceptable standards of behavior, and 2) the conduct in question directly reflects upon the claimant\u2019s ability to perform his assigned duties.
