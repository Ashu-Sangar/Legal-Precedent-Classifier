The petition is DENIED in all other respects. The order of the Superior Court is REVERSED and REMANDED to the Common Pleas Court for an evidentiary hearing on the aforementioned issue. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); Commonwealth v. Evans, 511 Pa. 214, 512 A.2d 626 (1986).\nJurisdiction relinquished.",
