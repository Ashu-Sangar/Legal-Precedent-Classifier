The eastern half of the District was subsequently déveloped into “Green Tree Run” and “Green Tree Summit” condominiums pursuant to the 1972 Master Plan. In 1985, a company called Balcorp Corporation wanted to develop the western half of the District, known as “Hunters Pointe,” and make changes to the 1972 Master Plan. N.T., 9/23/98, at 14. Accordingly, Balcorp submitted to the Planning Commission both a proposal for changes to the 1972 Master Plan and an amended plan for the area encompassing Hunters Pointe. Applying its Minor Modification Policy, the Planning Commission reviewed the changes and determined that they did not qualify as minor modifications. Consequently, the Planning Commission formally reviewed the changes and the amended plan, decided that the plan should be approved, and then forwarded its recommendation of approval to City Council. In February 1986, City Council approved the plan, and thus, the 1985 plan submitted by Balcorp became the new Master Plan for Hunters Pointe. The 1985 Master Plan provides for the development of ten buildings to be used as condominiums, 202 dwelling units, 347 parking spaces, a gross floor area of 239,774 square feet, and an impervious coverage of 284,080 feet.</p>

The new owner planned to develop the property but wanted to deviate from what was permitted under the 1985 Master Plan. Thus, in 1995, a request for changes to the 1985 Master Plan and an amended plan was submitted to the Planning Commission on behalf of the new owner by the Cheshire Group, Inc., a development company of which Appellant Kravitz was president. Following its review of the requested changes, the Planning Commission determined that the changes did not amount to minor modifications, because they proposed to relocate buildings closer to the property line, which would negatively impact the environment. N.T., 12/17/97, at 32. Accordingly, the Planning Commission formally reviewed the proposed changes and the amended plan. The Planning Commission decided that the amended plan should be approved and provided City Council with its recommendation of approval.

Therefore, we cannot say that the plain use of the word change in Section 14-226 is so clear and unambiguous that it is not open to interpretation. <em>See Baker v. Retirement Bd. of Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/374/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="374 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1241456" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0165-01">374 Pa. 165</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%20231" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="97 A.2d 231">97 A.2d 231</a>, 234 (1953); <em>see also Envtl.

In determining whether City Council intended the word “change” to include all changes, no matter how minute, or only those changes that notably differ from the Master Plan, we find it instructive to look at the goals of the ordinance and the consequences of various interpretations of the ordinance. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921. The clear purpose behind the creation of a RC 6 Residential district is to encourage planned residential developments on large tracts of open space. <em>See </em>Phila. Zoning Code § 14-226(a). Given this <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>purpose, it seems unlikely that City Council intended such a strict interpretation of the word “change” so that <em>de minimis </em>changes which fail to appreciably divert from a Master Plan, such as the removal of a parking space or the addition of hedges to the side of a building, would have to be presented and formally approved before the Planning Commission and City Council. Clearly, if all <em>de minimis </em>changes had to be approved according to the Amendment Procedure, development would constantly be stalled, which would ultimately discourage developers from building in RC-6 Residential Districts and defeat the very purpose for such Districts. Thus, as even Appellees agree, we may assume that City Council did not intend such an absolutist reading of Section 14-226. <em>See </em>Appellees’ Brief at 11; <em>see also </em>1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1921-22; <em>Moon Township Mun.

In deciding whether or not to approve a development plan as a Master Plan and establish a RC-6 Residential District, both the Planning Commission and City Council undoubtedly attempt to protect the interests of the surrounding community. Indeed, both the Planning Commission and City Council review development plans at hearings open to the public not only to provide the community with notice of possible development in the area but also to garner community input regarding the plan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a>

Moreover, by requiring City Council’s approval of development plans, the ordinance ensures that the interests of citizens affected by the development are represented in the approval process. In light of the consideration given to the community in the approval process, we find that City Council must have intended the word “change” in Section 14-226(2)(a) to apply to any changes that would have more than a <em>de minimis </em>effect on the community, so that the changes are reviewed in a forum where the interests of the community to be affected are represented and given adequate consideration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a>

As demonstrated in the instant case, proposed changes may qualify as minor modifications under the five criteria established by the Planning Commission even though they increase or decrease the number of structures, transform the types of structures to be built, i.e., from a building to a swimming pool, alter the uses for the structures, or completely relocate buildings and access roads. We fail to see how these types of changes can be considered <em>de minimis </em>changes to a Master Plan.

In concluding that the Planning Commission’s Minor Modification Policy was reasonable, the trial court adopted the reasoning of Stephanie L.

In late August or early September 1997, Councilman Nutter sought an opinion from Ms. Franklin Súber about whether the Planning Commission's Minor Modification Policy was proper under Section 14-226. After reviewing the facts and applicable law, Ms. Franklin Súber made the following conclusion:</p>
