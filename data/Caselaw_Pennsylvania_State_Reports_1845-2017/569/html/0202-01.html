The original shareholders were Helen Dupre and her three children: Herman Dupre, Phillip Dupre and Luitgarde Dupre Sujansky.

The focus of the dispute is on the meaning of the phrase “no Stockholder ... shall transfer, assign, sell, pledge, hypothecate, mortgage, alienate or in any other way encumber or dispose of all or any part of his stock in the Corporation.” Croker contends that the phrase covers the contemplated merger, which, in her view, is nothing more than a thinly veiled Stockholder’s sale of stock. Seven Springs, on the other hand, takes the position that the merger is a corporate act, not a “Stockholder” act, and that, in any event, the “conversion” of shares that is to be accomplished with the merger does not constitute a “sale” or other “disposition” of stock.</p>

Among the types of mergers contemplated is a cash-for-stock merger, in which shares are converted into, or exchanged for, cash, and the certificates evidencing the shares are surrendered. 15 Pa.C.S. § 1922(a)(3). To accomplish such a merger, the statute requires that a plan of merger be prepared. 15 Pa.C.S. § 1922(a).
