Duquesne Univ. of the Holy Ghost, </em><a href="/pa/565/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="565 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="124733" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0571-01">565 Pa. 571</a>, <a href="/a2d/777/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="777 A.2d 418" data-case-ids="11079601,124733" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0418-01,/pa/565/0571-01">777 A.2d 418</a>, 429 (2001). Appellant’s claims arise from two separate medical procedures performed upon her brother, Lope Valles (“Valles”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On November 14, 1992, Valles, a diabetic, was admitted to AEMC for a suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>. An aortogram<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> was scheduled to study the location of the aneurysm. Muriel Gordon, M.D., a radiology resident at AEMC, obtained Valles’ written consent to undergo the procedure scheduled to be performed by Steven Allen, M.D. (“Allen”), a radiologist at AEMC. While the written consent does not disclose the risk of renal damage or alternatives to the procedure, Allen indicated that it was his custom to inform a <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>patient undergoing this procedure that the dye from the aortagram might damage the kidneys. After the procedure was performed on November 19,1992, Valles’ kidney functions worsened. Surgery to repair the aneurysm was postponed and Valles was discharged on November 24,1992. On December 8, 1992, Valles was again admitted to AEMC suffering from renal failure. On December 17, 1992, the aneurysm was successfully repaired.</p>
    <p id="b676-4" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[255,764,1160,731]]]'>Given Valles’ need for extended dialysis and prior complications with a short-term catheter, doctors recommended placement of a different catheter (the “Permacath”), which was suitable for longer periods of dialysis. Morros was scheduled to perform the surgical placement of the Permacath. On January 6, 1993, Alan Wladis, M.D., a surgical resident at AEMC, obtained Valles’ written consent for the procedure. Wladis advised Valles of certain risks involved in the insertion of the Permacath, including bleeding, infection, collapsing of a lung and death. While the Permacath can be placed at several sites, including the jugular (neck) veins, the subclavian (chest) veins, or the femoral (groin) veins, Wladlis did not know at which site the catheter would be inserted and did not advise Valles as to where the catheter would be placed.</p>
    <p id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.5",676,[254,1521,1158,256]]]'>On January 7, 1993, Morros attempted to insert the Permacath into Valles’ right subclavian vein. During the procedure, Valles suffered a hemopneumothorax<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and cardiac arrest. Thereafter, Valles remained comatose and subsequently died on January 16,1993.</p>

The claim against AEMC was premised, <em>inter alia, </em>upon a theory of vicarious liability for the battery committed by Allen due to his failure to obtain informed consent prior to performing the aortogram. Appellant contends that Valles was not properly advised of the risks of the use of contrast dye and alternatives to the aortogram. In support of this claim, Appellant’s expert opined that there were alternatives to the <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>aortogram; that the risks to Valles of contrast-induced renal failure were significant (10-20%) and that Valles’ renal failure was caused by the aortogram.</p>
    <p id="b677-4" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[202,500,1156,521]]]'>The claim against Morros was also based on a lack of informed consent to the catheter procedure Morros performed. Appellant claims that Valles was not advised of the alternative placement sites for the Permacath and risks relative to those sites. Appellant’s expert opined that use of the alternative sites would have lessened or eliminated the risks of the complication that developed during the attempted insertion of the Permacath. The expert further indicated that the attempted placement of the catheter in the right subclavian vein resulted in the complications that led to Valles’ death.</p>
    <p id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.5",677,[202,1047,1153,359]]]'>AEMC moved for summary judgment. Morros filed a motion in limine in which he sought to preclude Appellant from pursuing any claims relating to informed consent. The trial court granted AEMC’s motion but denied Morros’ motion, leaving Morros as the only remaining defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Prior to jury selection, Morros renewed his motion, which a different trial judge granted and thereafter dismissed the claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Following reargument, a divided en banc panel affirmed. <em>Valles v. Albert Einstein Medical Center et al., </em><a href="/a2d/758/1238-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="758 A.2d 1238" data-case-ids="11197708" data-case-paths="/a2d/758/1238-01">758 A.2d 1238</a> (Pa.Super.2000). With regard to the aortogram performed by Allen, a majority of the <em>en banc </em>panel concluded that AEMC could not be held vicariously liable for Allen’s failure to obtain informed consent. The court determined that nothing in the record indicated that AEMC exercised control over the manner in which Allen was to perform radiology work. The court relied on <em>Kelly v. Methodist Hospital, </em><a href="/pa-super/444/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="444 Pa.

The court in <em>Kelly </em>reasoned that the .surgeon was in the best position to advise' each patient of such risks, and it would be unworkable to have the hospital draft the forms imparting the substantive information relative to each procedure. <em><a href="/pa-super/444/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="664 A.2d 148" data-case-ids="724016,7862816" data-case-paths="/pa-super/444/0427-01,/a2d/664/0148-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa-super/444/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="664 A.2d 148" data-case-ids="724016,7862816" data-case-paths="/pa-super/444/0427-01,/a2d/664/0148-01">at 151</a>. Similarly, in this case, the Superior Court reasoned that oversight of a highly specialized procedure such as an aortogram would improperly inject the hospital into the physician-patient relationship and would be unworkable.</p>

Judge Del Sole asserted that AEMC could be held vicariously liable as Allen was its employee. As to the claim against Morros, Judge Del Sole agreed with the majority that the informed consent doctrine encompasses the method and manner of surgery, but he determined that there was a disputed issue of fact regarding the alternate viable sites. Judge Musmanno filed a concurring and dissenting opinion. He agreed with the majority that the hospital could not be held vicariously liable, but joined the dissenting opinion of Judge Del Sole with respect to the informed consent claim against Morros.</p>

Appellant asserts under principles of respondeat superior, a hospital may be vicariously liable for its employee-physician’s intentional torts, including the failure to obtain informed consent. Because a hospital has an obligation to oversee all persons who practice medicine within its walls, Appellant maintains that the hospital as an employer and health care provider in its own right maintains a right of control in the relationship sufficient to justify the imposition of liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

As the Superior Court noted, Appellant has not presented any employment agreement between Dr. Allen and AEMC. Instead, Appellant generally cites the control that a hospital maintains when it employs a physician, including: its provision of the instrumentalities, place to work, support staff, patient base and wages; its right to require the employee’s presence at a particular time and to terminate employment; its retention of revenues for the employee’s professional services; and its use of departmental organization, peer review, rules and regulations, credentialing and privileging practices. Appellant asserts, without citation to the record, that Allen’s exercise of independent medical judgment was subject to AEMC’s right of control because: his work may not be delegated to others, except as the hospital’s rules permit; his medical findings must be reported in a manner and within a time frame set by hospital policy; and he must perform the requested study according to departmental protocols and schedule. Appellant also relies on Dr. Allen’s testimony that he surmised that there was a hospital and departmental regulation requiring him to obtain Valles’ consent to the procedure.

We reach this conclusion since we find that a battery which results from a lack of informed consent is not the type of action that occurs within the scope of employment. In our view, a medical facility cannot maintain control over this aspect of the physician-patient relationship. Our lower courts have recognized that the duty to obtain informed consent belongs solely to the physician. <em>See, e.g., Kelly; Friter. </em>Informed consent flows from the discussions each patient has with his physician, based on the facts and circumstances each case presents. We decline to interject an element of a hospital’s control into this highly individualized and dynamic relationship. We agree with the lower court that to do so would be both improvident and unworkable. Thus, we hold that as a matter of law, a medical facility lacks the control over the manner in which the physician performs his duty to obtain informed consent so as to render the facility vicariously liable.</p>

Appellant argues that her expert opined that the femoral vein was a viable alternative site of placement which did not carry the risks which attended the subclavian vein site. This alternative was not disclosed to Valles. As she adduced sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact, Appellant maintains that the question should have been submitted to a jury. In affirming the dismissal of the case, the Superior Court improperly relied on Morros’ oral testimony only, and ignored her expert’s testimony, in violation of the rule that the defendant’s oral testimony cannot be the basis for summary judgment in his favor. <em>See Borough of Nanty-Glo v.

He argues that the informed consent doctrine requires the physician to advise the patient only as to the risks of the surgery proposed, and not the alternative methods or means of performing a surgical procedure.

In light of this limited scope, we find that the manner or method in which the surgeon performs the proposed procedure is not encompassed within the purview of the informed consent doctrine. Although there were several <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>methods of performing the particular surgery, there was only one surgery proposed: the insertion of a Permacath. Appellant does not dispute that Valles was adequately informed of the risks attending the surgery:, bleeding, lung collapse, and death. That the subclavian vein may not have been the optimum site is not an issue of informed consent, but of negligence in the physician’s decision to place the Permacath at that site. Thus, the trial court properly entered judgment in favor of Morros on the informed consent claim, and the decision of the Superior Court is affirmed, albeit on other grounds. <em>Moorhead v.

The surgery on the patient is clearly the kind of work the hospital hired the physician-employee to perform. The physician-employee performs the surgery during working hours, inside the hospital’s walls, and in order to serve the hospital’s purpose of caring for sick and injured patients. <em>See e.g., Thompson, </em><a href="/pa/527/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="527 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="1827759" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0330-01">591 A.2d at 707</a>. Finally, in hiring the physician to perform surgeries on its patients, the hospital undoubtedly expects • the physician-employee to physically touch its patients. Therefore, a physician-employee’s performance of a surgical procedure is an act within the scope of the physician’s relationship with the hospital and the hospital may be vicariously liable when the physician fails to properly perform a surgery. Moreover, a physician’s duty to obtain a patient’s informed consent before the surgery is an integral part of the performance of the surgery. <em>See Morgan, </em>704 A.2d at 619 (it is well-established under the law that as a prerequisite to performing any surgical procedure, the physician performing the surgery must obtain the informed consent of the patient undergoing the surgery). In my view, therefore, the physician’s duty to obtain a patient’s informed consent before performing the surgery is included within the scope of the physician’s employment relationship with the hospital. <em>Com</em>

Given this evidence, along with the evidence showing that AEMC employed Dr. Allen to perform radiological work, including the aortogram performed on Valles, I believe that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Dr. Allen failed to properly obtain Valles’s informed consent and if so, whether AEMC was vicariously liable for that failure.
