The analysis is different under each section. <em>See Kiehl v. UCBR, </em><a href="/a2d/747/0954-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="747 A.2d 954" data-case-ids="11477324" data-case-paths="/a2d/747/0954-01">747 A.2d 954</a>, 956 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999) (where claimant has been discharged for off-duty misconduct <em>unrelated </em>to work, eligibility for benefits must be analyzed under § 3); <em>Martin v.

Off-duty misconduct will not support a finding of willful misconduct under § 402(e) unless it extends to performance on the job; in such case, the misconduct becomes work-related. For example, had Claimant appeared at work under the influence of marijuana ingested off-duty, § 402(e) would apply. The referee’s statement that Claim<a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>ant’s off-duty behavior was unacceptable is not sufficient. Behavior that may be unacceptable to an employer does not necessarily equate to § 402(e) willful misconduct; <em>Navickas, </em>at 290.</p>

The referee specifically found there was nothing in the record to establish Claimant’s drug use affected her work performance. Despite the absence of such findings by the referee, the Commonwealth Court attempted to explain why Claimant’s behavior was not acceptable. The Commonwealth Court’s scope of review in this matter was limited to determining whether there was a violation of Claimant’s constitutional rights, an adjudication contrary to law, a violation of the UCBR’s procedure, or a finding of fact unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Id., </em>at 288. Neither the referee nor the UCBR made findings that would allow a reviewing court to conclude Claimant’s conduct affected her work. In finding Claimant “could have harmed patients” and “might attempt to work in a sufficiently impaired condition,” the Commonwealth Court violated a tenet of appellate review: there is nothing of record to support this conclusion, however inviting it appears. To “reflect directly on” her job performance, there must be evidence, not just a vague extrapolation of “safety problems.” <em>Navickas </em>rejected a “higher standard of care” when evaluating whether health care workers’ negligence or inadvertence could be willful misconduct under § 402(e). Absent a higher standard, the Commonwealth Court’s concerns, unquestionably properly motivated, cannot transform this off-duty conduct into willful misconduct.</p>
