Appellant neither pleads nor proves any of the matters required by the PCRA, nor could he, for the fruits of the allegedly illegal interceptions were never introduced at trial and the truth-determining process, therefore, could not have been undermined.</p>

    <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.4",549,[204,464,1154,853]]]'>Appellant contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present impeachment evidence to discredit the testimony of Margaret Cobaugh, who said that appellant attempted to rape her in the early morning hours of May 6, 1992 and that appellant then made reference to the Knaze homicide which had not yet been discovered. Specifically, it is alleged that counsel should have introduced testimony of Dorothy Knisel, Cobaugh’s next-door neighbor, to contradict Cobaugh’s testimony that at the time of the sexual assault she was returning home from a visit with Knisel who had called her for assistance in repairing an oxygen tank. Cobaugh testified that she had been unable to fix the tank and that she called an ambulance company which came to the scene and fixed the tank. Knisel allegedly could have testified that Cobaugh did not visit her at that time, and that Knisel had not requested Cobaugh’s assistance with the tank.</p>

Specifically, appellant has not referred, in relative fashion, to the other evidence upon which his conviction was based. It is impossible, therefore, to assess whether further impeachment of Cobaugh would have had any effect in the face of all the other incriminating evidence. Hence, relief must be denied.</p>
    <p id="b549-7" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[202,1832,1151,528]]]'>Next, appellant asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce evidence of an alleged tacit admission by Cobaugh that she had not been subjected to a sexual battery by appellant. The asserted admission arises from the fact that when defense investigators tried to interview her about the sexual battery, she immediately began yelling at them to leave. In the midst of her screaming, her husband told her to tell the truth, but she did not respond. She was in an agitated and nervous state, waving her arms and screaming that she did not want to talk to the investigators.</p>

Specifically, in his discussion of this issue, appellant has not described the other evidence upon which his conviction was based. This makes it impossible to assess whether the impeachment of Cobaugh, if such were possible on the ground of tacit admission, would have had any effect in the face of the other incriminating evidence.

They are, in essence, claims of constitutional malpractice, <em>i.e., </em>claims that counsel was so incompetent as to have effectively deprived the defendant of his or her constitutional right to counsel.

The items suppressed by the prosecution include: 1) recordings of post-arrest electronic surveillance of multiple conversations between Appellant and his girlfriend, who acted as a Commonwealth agent in terms of questioning Appellant regarding the case and recording his answers, and ultimately testified as a Commonwealth witness at trial; 2) forensic reports concerning physical samples taken from two crime scenes, the murder scene and the scene of a subsequent sexual assault which, according to the Commonwealth’s theory of the case, was perpetrated by the killer; and 3) evidence that the victim of the latter crime was unable to identify Appellant from a mug book shortly after the assault.</p>
