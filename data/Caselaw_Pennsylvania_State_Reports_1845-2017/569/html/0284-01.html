Scher was the only other individual present when Dillon died. How Dillon died, and whether that death was an accident or an intentional act of murder, is a story that evolved in fits and starts in the intervening two decades, culminating in murder charges being filed against Scher in 1996 and his conviction for first degree murder following a six-week jury trial in 1997. Resolution of this appeal requires an understanding of how the scene where Dillon lay dead appeared in 1976; what the investigators initially concluded concerning Dillon’s death and how that investigation was conducted; what a succession of prosecutors did with respect to this suspicious death; why the Susquehanna County District Attorney’s Office finally decided to reopen the case; and, most important, how the lies that Scher related to investigators and his staging of the scene to make it appear that Dillon died accidentally impacted the investigation.</p>

Scher appeared upset but was not crying. Russin did not know whom to call, so Scher made the telephone call himself. The two proceeded to Gun-smoke, each in his own vehicle, while Russin’s son stood by the entrance of the road that leads to Gunsmoke to direct the ambulance and the police when they arrived. After the two arrived at Gunsmoke and parked near the Dillons’ trailer, Scher led Russin to the path towards the skeet shooting area, where Russin saw Dillon’s body. Russin testified that Dillon’s chest was saturated in blood and that he placed a blanket over Dillon’s body. Russin then watched as Scher picked up the gun that was lying near Dillon’s body and smashed it against a tree, breaking the barrel from the stock.</p>

Trooper Zanin observed Dillon’s body lying on its back with its arms outstretched. Dillon was wearing eight-inch high boots that had round eyelets for the laces to pass through except at the top, where the laces would pass through three hooks. Trooper Zanin noticed that although the laces at the top of the right-foot boot were untied, the rest of the laces remained pulled tightly against the leg. He also noticed that Dillon’s pant leg was pulled up higher than the boot. There were blood droplets on Dillon’s boots and face, on the shooting goggles and protective eyewear that lay nearby, and on the tree stump that was approximately five-and-a-half to six feet from Dillon’s body. Trooper Zanin observed, however, that there were no blood droplets immediately around Dillon’s eyes and ears where the goggles and earmuffs would have been had Dillon been wearing them when he was shot. The barrel of the shattered sixteen-gauge shotgun lay close to Dillon’s body, but a subsequent examination of the outside and inside of the shotgun barrel showed no evidence of blood. Inside the chamber of the broken sixteen-gauge shotgun was a dis<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>charged number four load high brass magnum shell — a variety not commonly used in skeet shooting.

    <p id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[259,569,1160,1607]]]'>On June 4,1976, at 11:30 a.m., two days after his statement to Trooper Hairston, Scher came to the District Attorney’s Office at the Susquehanna County Courthouse in Montrose, at the request of the investigators, and gave a statement. At the interview were Williard Collier, the detective for the Susquehanna County District Attorney’s office, Troopers John Salinkas and John Fekette of the Pennsylvania State Police, and a secretary from the Susquehanna County District Attorney’s office. At the commencement of questioning, Trooper Fekette advised Scher of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which Scher waived and agreed to be questioned without a lawyer present.- During this interrogation, Scher repeated essentially the same story that he had related in his June 2, 1976 statement to Trooper Hairston. Scher explained that he and Dillon had gone to Gunsmoke to go skeet shooting, that they were returning to the trailer to get cigarettes, that Dillon thought he saw a porcupine and ran up the path to pursue it, and that Scher heard the shot and followed after, where he found Dillon lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the chest. One noteworthy difference between this second statement and the June 2,1976 statement was that Scher said that he had placed the sixteen-gauge shotgun against a tree, whereas his June 2, 1976 statement indicated that he had placed the loaded shotgun on the metal gun stand. When asked whether he and Dillon had any disagreements, Scher said, “No. We were talking about this rumor. I told him I was thinking of leaving town. It was rough on him. He sat and told me I was just a quitter and chicken — ‘don’t run away .. it was just small people talking.’ ” After giving this answer, Scher became angry, terminated the interview, and left the room.</p>

Dr. James Grace, a general practitioner who conducted an autopsy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of Dillon on June 3, 1976, had issued a report that explained, “[h]istory given of [Dillon’s death] having been involved in a hunting accident,” and listed the cause of death as “gunshot wound of the chest,” but made no determination whether the death was the result of a homicide. Coroner Conarton,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> who was present when Scher gave his June 2, 1976 statement to Trooper Hairston, had determined that Dillon’s death was accidental and had listed this as the manner of death on Dillon’s death certificate. Although Detective Collier had a strong belief that Dillon’s death may have been a murder rather than an accident, and expressed this opinion in a June 9, 1976 report<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> to Little, Scher was not arrested. Little explained that he, too, was not convinced that Dillon’s death was an accident and requested that Coroner Conarton delay issuance of the death certificate in order to allow additional time to conduct the investigation. Little testified, however, that he never brought charges against Scher because he felt that there was insufficient evidence of murder to prosecute the case successfully.</p>

In 1989, District Attorney Snyder received a telephone call from Al Riemel, a social acquaintance of the Snyder family and the brother-in-law of Martin Dillon, requesting a meeting at the home of Lawrence Dillon, the father of Martin Dillon. Prior to this telephone call, Snyder had not conducted any review of the Dillon case, but had the District Attorney’s Office investigative file retrieved from storage in order to review the matter. District Attorney Snyder reviewed the Dillon file, but found that it contained “little to no information” and decided to meet with the state police to discuss the status of the case. At the behest of Lawrence Dillon, Snyder arranged meetings with the original Pennsylvania State Police investigators, Troopers John Salinkas and John Fekette, and reviewed the state police investigative file. District Attorney Snyder agreed to have the facts as developed by the investigation to that point presented to a panel of medical experts who were holding a conference at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. In May of 1989, Snyder went to the conference to “get some consensus from those in the forensic field” about whether Dillon died by accident or was murdered. The conference attendees consisted of medical examiners, pathologists, and coroners. Three members of the Pennsylvania State Police accompanied Snyder to the conference, along with Dr. Isadore Mihalikis, a forensic pathologist who actually presented the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>case to the conference attendees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Following this presentation, a significant majority of the conference members opined that a self-inflicted gunshot wound, either accidental or intentional, caused Dillon’s death. Snyder viewed this vote as “an overwhelming defeat for the prosecution” and concluded that no successful prosecution could be mounted at that time. Although the investigation remained open, the Susquehanna County District Attorney’s Office took no substantial steps to advance the investigation for the next five years.</p>

At that time, Snyder felt that the efforts of the Dillon family were counterproductive to a successful resumption of the investigation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> However, in 1994, again at the urging of the Dillon family, two Pennsylvania State Police officers who had no previous involvement in the case were brought in to reexamine the evidence, conduct interviews with witnesses, and, in Snyder’s words, “winnow out the rumor, the innuendo, that in my opinion riddled much of the material that was already on file.” The “rumor” referred to by Snyder was the report that Scher and Dillon’s wife, Patricia,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> had been having an affair before Dillon’s death. These rumors were known to investigators at the time of the incident but, for reasons that do not appear in the record, were not pursued. The officers who were placed in charge of the state police investigation in 1994 reinterviewed witnesses and interviewed additional witnesses who had not been questioned in 1976. Based on this renewed investigation, the Commonwealth finally developed evidence of a motive for Scher to murder Dillon that had not been developed in the earlier investigation: namely, that Scher and Patricia had been having an extramarital affair prior to Dillon’s death. In 1995, the Commonwealth successfully peti<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>tioned, in spite of the objection of Patricia Scher,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> to have Dillon’s body exhumed for a second autopsy. Following this second autopsy in April of 1995, the Commonwealth obtained support from its expert forensic pathologist, Dr. Mihalikis, for the position that the physical evidence of Dillon’s gunshot wound was not consistent with an accidental discharge of a dropped shotgun. The Commonwealth<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> concluded that it possessed sufficient evidence to prosecute murder charges successfully and charged Scher with first-degree murder in June of 1996.</p>

However, despite the degree of actual prejudice, for a judgment in favor of dismissal, there must be some culpability on the government’s part either in the form of intentional misconduct or negligence.</blockquote>

Sneed, </em><a href="/pa/514/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="514 Pa. 597" data-case-ids="1804503" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0597-01">514 Pa. 597</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="514 Pa. 597" data-case-ids="1804503" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0597-01">526 A.2d 749</a>, 752 (1987). We have not elucidated the meaning of “actual prejudice”; however, numerous federal appellate courts have refined the concept. In order for a defendant to show actual prejudice, he or she must show that he or she was meaningfully impaired in his or her ability to defend against the state’s charges to such an extent that the disposition of the criminal proceedings was likely affected. <em>Jones v. Angelone, </em><a href="/f3d/94/0900-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="94 F.3d 900" data-case-ids="11336754" data-case-paths="/f3d/94/0900-01">94 F.3d 900</a>, 907 (4th Cir.1996).

Further, Scher argues that the loss or destruction of other evidence, such as: the ejector mechanism from the sixteen-gauge shotgun; the audio recording of the June 1976 autopsy; certain photographs taken of the scene; the unused shotgun ammunition, and; any bloodstains on the inside of the shotgun, impaired his ability to show that the shooting was accidental and not a premeditated act of murder.</p>

With respect to some of the items that Scher claims were lost or destroyed, the delay in filing charges clearly had no role in causing these items to be lost or destroyed. First, Scher contends that by the time charges were filed against him, the shotgun had been fired numerous times, thus eliminating any bloodstains that may have been inside the barrel, which would have tended to prove a close range of fire consistent with Scher’s story that the shooting was an accident. However, one of Scher’s experts, George Fassnacht, a forensic firearms consultant, testified that the repeated firing of the shotgun in 1976 by the police during testing of the weapon would have removed any bloodstains from inside the barrel. Accordingly, the loss of this evidence cannot be attributed to the delay in indicting Scher for murder, as the bloodstains would have been eliminated and hence unavailable for his defense even if the Commonwealth had filed charges in 1976. Additionally, Scher asserts that the fact that Dillon’s body was washed and embalmed before the June 3, 1976 autopsy prejudiced him because it affected his ability to determine whether there was any gunpowder residue on the skin around the wound that would have indicated the <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>range of fire. This claim of prejudice also fails because the loss of this evidence cannot be attributed to the delay in indicting Scher. Indeed, Dillon’s body had been washed and embalmed within a day of his death, and, therefore, would have been in this condition even if the Commonwealth had filed charges immediately. Finally, Scher points to the investigators’ failure to preserve the unused ammunition from the scene and claims prejudice because the type of ammunition that was present but unused could have supported his claim of accident and negated the Commonwealth’s position that the killing was intentional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> The Commonwealth, however, never collected the unused ammunition from the scene, which, therefore, would not have been available to Scher regardless of the delay in filing charges.

With respect to the ejector mechanism from the shotgun, Fassnacht testified that a police report concerning the weapon prepared in 1976 contained no notation that the ejector mechanism was missing at that time. However, a police report prepared in April of 1996 noted that the ejector was missing, which Fassnacht testified would only occur if the gun had been disassembled and the ejector removed. Fassnacht testified on direct examination that the ejector mechanism allows the weapon to be fired in a “normal manner” and that its subsequent absence showed that it was not in its original condition when the police tested it in 1996. On cross-examination, however, Fassnacht conceded that the ejector mechanism does not affect the firing of the gun. Indeed, in response to the question, “So the ejector tore [sic] really has nothing to do with whether or not the gun will go off by pulling the trigger or otherwise, does it?”, Fassnacht answered, “That’s correct.” Because Scher’s expert admitted that the absence of the ejector mechanism has no bearing on whether the gun would discharge accidentally, his claim of prejudice from the loss of this evidence cannot be sustained.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a>

At trial, Scher’s defense was that the shooting occurred accidentally. His claim of prejudice from the deaths of Collier, Salinkas, and Conarton is based on the assumption that because these individuals never pressed for the filing of murder charges against Scher, they must have agreed that Dillon’s death was an accident. Specifically with regards to Coroner Conarton, Scher notes that Dillon’s death certificate, completed by Conarton, lists the cause of Dillon’s death as accidental. Scher contends that he was prejudiced when he lost the opportunity to have Conarton explain why he believed Dillon’s death was accidental. What Scher ignores, however, is that in the section of the death certificate that asks, “How did injury occur?”, Coroner Conarton wrote, “Running with gun, fell, gun went off.” As Scher admitted in his trial testimony, this is not how Dillon died, and his stories to Conarton, Collier, and the other investigating officers to this effect were lies. Conarton was present when Scher gave his statement to Trooper Hairston at the scene, which related the <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>false story of how Dillon tripped while running with the shotgun. The record strongly suggests that Conarton formed his opinion as to the cause of Dillon’s death based mainly on Scher’s false statement and a cursory review of the scene where Dillon’s body lay positioned in a manner, with shoelaces untied, that Scher deliberately set to make it appear that Dillon tripped and fell while carrying the shotgun.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> When Scher finally testified that the shooting did not occur from Dillon tripping and falling, as he had repeatedly told the investigators and the public, he substantially undermined the importance of any investigatory conclusions that relied on this false scenario.

Evidence of the angle of Dillon’s chest wound, the presence or absence of “scalloping”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a>, the presence or absence of gunpowder around <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>the wound, and the size of the wound were relevant to the determination of whether Dillon was shot from a close range, consistent with a struggle, or a more distant range that could not have been caused by an accidental discharge during a struggle.</p>
    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[197,580,1160,1418]]]'>In support of his defense theory, Scher presented a number of expert witnesses. John Shane, M.D., a pathologist, reviewed, among other evidentiary items: twenty-seven black and white photographs of the scene; the clothes worn by Dillon, the photographs taken during Dr. Grace’s autopsy; photographs taken during the second autopsy in 1995; forty-three microscopic slides of tissue taken from Dillon’s body; Dr. Grace’s autopsy report; and the shot cup retrieved from Dillon’s body. Dr. Shane observed that Dr. Grace did not note scalloping around the margins of Dillon’s chest wound in his June 3,1976 autopsy report, and that his own review of the photographs from that autopsy indicated no scalloping. Based on his review of the autopsy photographs and Dr. Grace’s report, Dr. Shane opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that there was no scalloping around the margins of Dillon’s chest wound and that this indicated a close range of discharge — within twelve inches. Dr. Shane also noted that the June 3, 1976 autopsy report showed “what was apparently powder burns” in the wound tract, and his examination of the slides from the 1995 autopsy indicated the presence of carbon that Dr. Shane identified as gunpowder residue. Dr. Shane testified that the presence of gunpowder residue in the wound tract signaled that the range of fire would have been within eighteen inches, due to the limited distance that gunpowder travels from the barrel when a firearm is discharged. Finally, at the close of direct examination, Scher’s counsel asked Dr. Shane the following:</p>

Dr. Wecht concluded that, based on his examination of the autopsy photographs and the absence of any notation of scalloping in Dr. Grace’s autopsy report, there was no scalloping around the edges of Dillon’s chest wound, which indicated that the shotgun was fired at close range. Based on his examination of the slides prepared from tissue extracted from Dillon’s body, Dr. Wecht concluded that gunpowder residue was present in Dillon’s chest wound. Concerning whether the physical evidence was inconsistent with an accidental discharge during a struggle, Dr. Wecht opined that there was no evidence that was inconsistent with that scenario, and that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the range of fire was less than one foot.

Dr. Baden testified that carbonaceous material present in the slides prepared from tissue extracted from the wound tract indicated the presence of gunpowder. Further, Dr. Baden reviewed the photographs from the scene and the initial autopsy and concluded, as had Drs. Shane and Wecht, that there was no scalloping present on the margin of the gunshot wound. Similar to Drs. Shane and Wecht, Dr. Baden opined that the distance between the muzzle of the shotgun and the skin was within a few inches, up to one foot.

Despite the absence of Dr. Grace’s direct testimony concerning his observations from the autopsy and the audio tapes of that autopsy, there was sufficient evidence, including photographs and Dr. Grace’s report, for Scher’s experts to offer specific opinions concerning the presence of gunpowder in the wound tract, the range of fire, and whether the physical evidence was consistent with a struggle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a> Further, Scher claims prejudice from the removal of the “wound of entry” from Dillon’s chest during the 1995 autopsy performed by Dr. Mihalakis, who later testified as an expert for the Commonwealth, which Scher’s experts were unable to examine when they (Dr. Baden, Dr. Shane, and Dr. Wecht) performed a third autopsy in 1996. Scher’s experts, however, utilized the slides prepared by Dr. Mihalakis from tissue removed during the 1995 autopsy in forming their opinions regarding the presence of carbonaceous material in the wound tract. In the pretrial hearings, Dr. Wecht conceded that he had given opinions in other eases where he was unable to do the autopsy personally or directly observe the body and therefore relied on “reports, photographs, microscopic slides, crime lab reports, [and] investigative reports by police” in forming his conclusions. We find, therefore, that Scher did not suffer actual prejudice due to the death of Dr. Grace, the loss of audio tapes from the first autopsy, and the extraction of the wound of entry during the 1995 autopsy, where the remaining evidence was of sufficient quality to enable three highly-qualified pathologists to offer <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>expert testimony on specific matters in dispute and to render opinions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the physical evidence was consistent with an accidental, close-range discharge during a struggle.</p>

Preliminarily, we note that the difficulty of witnesses to recall precisely what happened years ago is likely to be present in any murder case where charges are filed many years after the crime occurred. Our legislature, however, has chosen to place no statute of limitations on murder prosecutions and has made a policy determination that punishment of the most serious crime should outweigh the difficulties otherwise incurred in the prosecution of “stale” charges. A defendant who claims actual prejudice from the faded memories of witnesses, therefore, must show in concrete terms how the loss of memory has deprived him or her of the ability to defend against the charges; general allegations of prejudice are not sufficient. Here, Scher offers only one specific example of the faded memory of a witness to sustain this claim of prejudice: the testimony of Jocelyn Richards.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a> Richards testified that, during a conversation at the hospital where they worked together prior to Dillon’s death, Scher had told her that “if he wanted something, he would get it one way or another.” In his testimony, Scher contracted this, denying that he ever made such a statement. Contrary to Scher’s claim, this is not an instance of a witness’ memory fading. Richards recalled Scher making this statement and so testified — Scher simply disputes that he said it. Hence, this claim of prejudice fails. At the pretrial hearings, Scher proffered the testimony of Richard Fischbein, M.D., who explained that he was unable to offer an opinion as to Dillon’s psychological state at the time of his death because the passage of time made it impossible for him to obtain the necessary data. When asked to make an offer of proof concerning the relevance of a psychological autopsy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_26" id="ref_footnote_1_26">26</a>, Scher’s counsel explained <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>that “[tjhere is the possibility that this victim may have committed suicide. I believe it goes ... to that issue.” N.T. 7/18/97 p. 175. This testimony, of course, took place before the trial testimony of Scher, when the fabricated story of Dillon shooting himself while running with the shotgun was still at issue. The admission by Scher that Dillon was shot while the two engaged in a struggle with the weapon eliminated whatever marginal relevance the opinions of Dr. Fischbein would have had regarding potential suicidal tendencies by Dillon.</p>

We have stated that, in order for there to be a violation of due process, the Commonwealth’s behavior must be more than merely negligent in causing the delay. Only where the Commonwealth has intentionally delayed in order to gain a tactical advantage or acted recklessly to such a degree as to shock one’s conscience and offend one’s sense of justice will we find a deprivation of due process. We do not find the Commonwealth’s behavior in this case to be so outrageous as to meet that standard. There has been no allegation that the Commonwealth intentionally delayed indicting Scher in order to gain a tactical advantage over him, and the record contains credible denials from a succession of <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>Susquehanna County District Attorneys that they ever intentionally employed delay tactics. Furthermore, we cannot accept the Superior Court’s conclusion that the Commonwealth’s actions were “grossly negligent.” Astonishingly, the Superior Court’s opinion makes no mention of the watershed moment in this case: when Scher admitted that he had lied to investigators about how Dillon’s death occurred and that, for the past twenty years, he lied when he denied having had an affair with Patricia prior to the incident at Gunsmoke. Rather than exercise his constitutional right to say nothing, which would, in all likelihood, have heightened the suspicion against him and possibly resulted in an investigation that would have resulted in immediate charges, he instead staged the scene and fabricated a story that gained some credence with investigators. Perhaps, as Scher argues, those investigators should have been more circumspect in accepting his tale and pursued their suspicions more thoroughly, but we cannot find the Commonwealth’s actions towards Scher so egregious when, in a small town, in a rural part of Pennsylvania with a part-time District Attorney, those responsible for enforcing the law would find it difficult to disbelieve the word of a respected physician. Nor can we ignore the benefit that Scher gained by lying to authorities rather than remaining silent: he enjoyed his liberty for twenty years. In these circumstances, we cannot find that the Commonwealth’s failure to charge Scher with murder sooner violated his right to due process of law.</p>

While we do not follow those circuits that recognize a pre-arrest due process claim <em>only </em>when the defendant shows that the prosecution intentionally delayed indictment or arrest in order to gain a tactical advantage at trial over the defendant, nevertheless we believe that the standard we adopt here, requiring a showing that the Commonwealth acted intentionally, in bad faith or recklessly in delaying indictment, accommodates the principle that due process violations based on pre-arrest delay will only occur in the rarest cases where the Commonwealth’s conduct shocks the conscience and offends one’s sense of justice.</p>

The Commonwealth argued that this kind of shell would not be used in skeet or trap shooting and that its presence in the sixteen-gauge shotgun evidenced the intent of Scher to murder Dillon. Scher contends that they had a mix of ammunition with them and bought whatever was on sale, and therefore the presence of other number four shells in the unused ammunition would have shown that there was nothing unusual for him and Dillon to utilize number four shells for skeet or trap shooting.</p>

Moreover, the only connection Fassnacht ever made between the absence of the ejector mechanism and a determination of whether the gun could discharge accidentally was when he testified that "I don't know that the process used to remove the ejector didn't dislodge any detritus which may cause a shock or drop failure of the mechanism.” N.T. 10/9/97 p. 27. Fassnacht explained that he observed grease and dirt inside the weapon that would have also been present in 1976, which could have been responsible for an accidental firing, but that he was unable to get the weapon to discharge without pulling the trigger when he tested it in 1997. Nevertheless, despite the absence of the ejector mechanism and the inability to duplicate an accidental firing when he tested the weapon in 1997, Fassnacht opined that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty based on his examination of the weapon, the shotgun could have fired accidentally during a struggle between Dillon and Scher. <em>Id. </em>p. 20.</p>

As an instance of Collier’s potential usefulness as a witness, Scher points to the Polaroid photographs allegedly in Collier’s possession that were never recovered.

We have previously held, however, that the absence of those photographs cannot support Scher's claims of prejudice in light of the numerous other photographs of Dillon's body taken at the scene that were relied on by Scher's experts.

As an example of how Dr. Grace’s testimony would have been helpful to his case, Scher relies on the testimony of his experts, who stated that some conclusions, such as whether gunpowder is present and whether there is scalloping along the edges of the wound, are best made by the individual who first examined the body — in this case, Dr. Grace. However, Scher used the fact that Dr. Grace’s report indicated the presence of gunpowder in the wound tract and did not note scalloping along the margins of the wound to his advantage, which left the burden on the Commonwealth to explain the inconsistencies between Dr. Grace’s conclusions and its position that Scher murdered Dillon. Moreover, it is far from certain that Dr. Grace would have testified in support of Scher's theory of an accidental shooting. A police report of an October 10, 1994 interview indicated that Grace had formed no opinion as to whether the manner of Dillon’s death was homicide, suicide, or accidental.

A critical issue at trial was the distance at which the fatal shot was fired, since Appellant maintained at trial that the gun accidentally discharged during a struggle, <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>and that the wound was consistent with the shot having been fired at close range. In contrast, the Commonwealth asserted that the gunshot wound was consistent with a medium-to-long-range firing, indicative of murder. Toward this end, the Commonwealth challenged the qualifications and findings of Dr. Grace. While the initial autopsy report contained findings consistent with a close-range shooting, Appellant was unable to present testimony from Dr. Grace concerning his qualifications and experience and explaining his findings. Furthermore, the absence of testimony from the coroner, who assisted in the autopsy and determined that the cause of death was accidental, constituted actual prejudice.</p>

In this regard, the ability of a defendant to mount a defense is not controlling. For example, in <em>Snyder, </em>although the defendant was able to offer testimony, including expert opinions from a pathologist and a toxicologist, consistent with his theory of defense (suicide), he was unable to present expert testimony in the form of a psychiatric autopsy that would have bolstered such theory. <em>See Snyder, </em><a href="/pa/552/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="256" data-cite="552 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="559422" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0044-01">552 Pa. at 48, 57-58</a>, 713 A.2d at 597-98, 602-03.</p>

The Commonwealth premised its theory on the testimony of expert witnesses following an autopsy conducted 18 years after Dillon’s death. The expert testimony sought to contradict the findings made by Dr. James Grace based upon the autopsy he conducted immediately after Dillon’s death.
