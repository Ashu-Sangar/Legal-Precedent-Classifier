However, although mining is not a nuisance <em>per se, </em>pollution of public waterways is. The key to protecting our water is to prevent pollution from occurring. The General Assembly has expressly stated that not only is its desire to restore polluted waters but “[i]t is the objective of the Clean Streams Law ... to prevent further pollution of the waters of the Commonwealth.” 35 P.S. § 691.4(3) (emphasis added). It is beyond dispute that the resources needed to correct pollution once it has occurred are far greater than those needed to prevent it. While it is true that mining <em>per se </em>is not a nuisance, experts need not wait until acid mine water flows out of mines in the UFM area to predict the likely results of mining this land. If the Property Owners are correct that additional mining would not pollute the Watershed, then there is no nuisance. Then again, if the Commonwealth can prove that mining the UFM area would pollute Goss Run, the cause of the nuisance can be prohibited. We see no reason to require the Commonwealth to prove that the alleged pollution is practically certain to occur. It is enough if the Commonwealth can prove what its technical study found, that further mining in the UFM area had a “high potential to cause increases in dissolved solid and metal concentrations in Goss Run that would adversely affect the use of <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>the stream as an auxiliary water supply” or had <em>“a </em>significant potential to disrupt the hydrologic balance causing decreases in the net alkalinity of discharges ... and destroying the habitat for wild trout populations.” <em>Machipongo VI, </em><a href="/a2d/719/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="719 A.2d 19" data-case-ids="11669310" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0019-01">719 A.2d at 21</a>.</p>
