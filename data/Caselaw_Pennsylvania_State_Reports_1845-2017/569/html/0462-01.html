    <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[249,634,1164,568]]]'>In April 1994, the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County entered a judgment of approximately $80,000.00 against Chalkey pursuant to an action brought by her brother’s estate seeking liquidation of a property interest that her brother shared with her. Attorney Rex W. McQuaide represented Chalkey in that action. McQuaide also assisted Chalkey in trying to secure the money to satisfy the judgment she owed to her brother’s estate. When Chalkey failed to satisfy the judgment by late 1995, a judgment creditor scheduled a sheriffs sale on December 8, 1995 for a large parcel of property owned by Chalkey.</p>

Roush, acting on behalf of Chalkey, filed a motion for a stay of the sale, and on December 4, 1995, the trial court held a hearing on the motion. Following the hearing, the trial court denied the motion for a stay. Later that day, however, Chalkey entered into a contract of sale with Roush for the large parcel of land scheduled to be sold in exchange for $76,000.00, the amount remaining under the judgment against her.</p>

At the close of the trial, the court incorporated the evidence from the previous proceedings, including the lengthy October 10th trial concerning the permanent injunction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <em>See, </em>n. 2, <em>supra. </em>On August 11, 1998, the trial court issued an opinion containing findings of fact and conclusions of law. Specifically, the trial court determined that a confidential relationship existed between Roush and Chalkey and that Roush took unfair advantage of that relationship in order to obtain the property from Chalkey for less than its value. The trial court therefore found that the contract for the sale of the property should be voided based on the theory of undue influence<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and the parties should be returned to the positions they occupied before the transfer of the property. Accordingly, the trial court entered an order in which it declared the sale of the property void, instructed Roush to transfer the property back to Chalkey, and directed Roush to pay Chalkey the sums he received from an agreement to sell timber that was located on the property.</p>

We disagree. In <em>Wickett, </em>a declaratory judgment action pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 7532, this Court found that a trial court order sustaining preliminary objections and dismissing certain defendants was an order declaring the rights of the parties, and thus, was a final and immediately appealable order. <a href="/a2d/763/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="763 A.2d 813" data-case-ids="11173759,1366977" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0813-01,/pa/563/0595-01">763 A.2d at 818</a>. In concluding as such, we relied upon the Declaratory Judgment Act, which states that court declarations regarding the rights, status, and other legal relations of parties in an action "shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 7532. Justice Saylor contends that consistent application of this statute would require us to find that the order of the trial court in the instant case, which declared the contract between Chalkey and Roush void, is final and immediately appealable as well. However, in <em>Wickett, </em>the trial court's order was made based upon preliminary objections, whereas here, the trial court entered its opinion and order following a trial on the merits of Chalkey's complaint. While the Declaratory Judgment Act states that court declarations made under the Act shall have the force of a final order, the Act also states that where issues of fact must be determined in an action seeking declaratory judgment, those issues must be determined as in other civil actions. 42 Pa.C.S. § 7539; <em>see also </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1601. Therefore, where a trial court enters a declaratory order following a trial, parties must file post-trial motions from that order, as they would in any other civil proceeding, before the order may be deemed a final order for purposes of an appeal. On the other hand, where the trial court enters a declaratory order based on a pre-trial motion, as in <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>

While <em>Wickett </em>involved summary disposition of claims against less than all parties, its reasoning was tied to the character of the proceedings, and the issuance of orders actually declaring the substantive rights of parties. <em>See Wickett, </em><a href="/pa/563/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="563 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="1366977" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0595-01">563 Pa. at 603</a>, <a href="/a2d/763/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="763 A.2d 813" data-case-ids="11173759,1366977" data-case-paths="/a2d/763/0813-01,/pa/563/0595-01">763 A.2d at 818</a>. Therefore, for present purposes, I do not view the some versus all parties distinction as a reasonable basis for distinguishing the present case from <em>Wickett. </em>Additionally, although <em>Wickett </em>was styled as a declaratory judgment proceeding, whereas the present action is framed more generally as an action in equity, Section 7532 applies in either paradigm. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 7532 (prescribing the jurisdiction of the courts over declaratory relief "whether or not further relief is or could be claimed”).</p>

I recognize that the issuance of the order was improper in the procedural posture of the case, as the rules require the making of an adjudication prior to the entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 1517. Nevertheless, it seems to me that if the prevailing judicial interpretation of Section 7532 as derived from <em>Wickett </em>were to be applied consistently, in actions in which declaratory relief is affirmatively granted by a court <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>of equity, even out of turn, the court’s judgment as rendered would be afforded the effect of a final order.</p>
      <p id="b603-7" data-blocks='[["BL_603.3",603,[234,1182,1126,898]]]'>Respectfully, I disagree with the majority’s position that Section 7532 of the Judicial Code, perforce, yields the contrary conclusion. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 496 n. 13. Section 7539 merely provides that, when a proceeding involves determination of factual questions, they may be tried and determined in the same manner as such issues are resolved in other civil actions. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 7539. The difficulty arising in the present line of cases, however, stems from the fact that issues have not been determined in the same manner as other civil actions, since the common pleas court has omitted a procedural step (the adjudication) and entered what appears on its face (and, under <em>Wickett, </em>on the face of the Declaratory Judgment Act) to be a final order. Moreover, reliance on Section 7539 as a basis for distinction would seem to undermine the uniform rule that the Court announces, since that provision does not address cases in which there are no factual disputes, for example, where an equitable decree is rendered on stipulated facts. <em>See, e.g., State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Craley, </em><a href="/a2d/784/0781-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="784 A.2d 781" data-case-ids="9464729" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0781-01">784 A.2d 781</a>, 786-788 (Pa.Super.2001) (following <em>Wickett </em>to determine that an order declaring rights on stipulated facts was immediately appealable and post-trial motions were ineffective to toll the period allowed for appeal, with the observation that ‘‘[w]e find no authority that restricts the application of the Declaratory Judgment Act to cases involving preliminary objections”), <em>appeal granted, </em><a href="/citations/?q=568%20Pa.%20704" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="568 Pa. 704">568 Pa. 704</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=796%20A.2d%20985" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="796 A.2d 985">796 A.2d 985</a> (2002).</p>
