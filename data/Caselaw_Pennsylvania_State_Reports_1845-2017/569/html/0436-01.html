First, it determined that Act 105 violated the non-delegation provision of Article III, Section 31 of the Pennsylvania Constitution because it improperly delegated legislative power to a board of arbitration. The court based this conclusion on several factors. It held that Act 105 provided for both mandatory and binding arbitration without limitation, as opposed to binding arbitration undertaken pursuant to an agreement between the parties. The court ruled that the power delegated by Act 105 is legislative in character, not only because it may require legislation or taxes to effectuate the arbitrator’s decision, but also because it infringes upon the ability of local and state legislative bodies to make decisions regarding the organization of the school district and the implementation of its policies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

It based this conclusion on the Act’s broad mandate that enabled the Association to submit to collective bargaining and binding arbitration various policy disputes of a supervisory nature that extended beyond the issues of wages and benefits.</p>

The trial court further noted that "[b]y excepting decisions that are 'legislative' in character from binding arbitration, the constitutional pitfalls <em>could have </em>been eliminated.” Trial court opinion at 22 (emphasis added).

The Commonwealth Court’s decisions in these cases do not appear to conflict with <em>Mikell. </em>There, a taxpayer challenged a statute that imposed a personal property tax upon the residents of a first class school district. The taxpayer alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the revenue-raising measure originated in the Senate as opposed to the House of Representatives and therefore violated Article III, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This Court held that the statute was not a revenue-raising measure and therefore did not violate the constitution. The Court went on to address the taxpayer’s claim that one need not go behind the statute to determine its origin because the Report of the Committee of Conference on the bill was placed in the record by stipulation of counsel. Applying a strict application of the enrolled bill doctrine, we stated, "in order to show that Act No. 319 was introduced in the General Assembly as a Senate bill, evidence <em>aliunde </em>is necessary for which purpose legislative journals, records and reports are not competent.” <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20339" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="58 A.2d 339">58 A.2d at 345</a>.
