Lashawn, standing across the street, witnessed the shootings. Although initially reluctant to cooperate with the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>police, Lashawn eventually gave a formal statement identifying Paddy as one of the two men who had done the shooting. Lashawn knew Paddy from her neighborhood and also identified him in a photo array. Explaining her initial unwillingness to identify Paddy as the shooter, Lashawn asserted in her statement to the police, given on May 15, 1991, that “I knew it was him from the beginning, but I was scared. I still am.” An arrest warrant was issued for Paddy on June 11, 1991, and he turned himself in to the police several weeks later.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[197,805,1158,744]]]'>Lashawn was issued a subpoena to testify at Paddy’s trial, scheduled to begin on September 14,1992. On that date, trial was continued until Monday, September 21, at the request of the defense, and a new subpoena was issued for Lashawn. Lashawn’s statement, which had been the subject of a protective order, was disclosed to the defense several days later. When a detective contacted Lashawn over the weekend to remind her of the upcoming trial, Lashawn informed him that she would not attend, adding, “You can tell Judge O’Keefe he can kiss my ass.” On September 21, Lashawn failed to appear. As jury selection proceeded, the police searched unsuccessfully for her. On September 24, with jury selection completed and Lashawn still at large, the Commonwealth was forced to nolle pros the charges against Paddy.</p>

Numerous telephone calls were made from their room at the motel to persons in Philadelphia, including Stephen Blount, another of Paddy’s friends. Blount attended the aborted trial and apparently kept those in Maryland abreast of developments, as Lashawn and her companions returned to Philadelphia immediately after the charges had been nolle prossed. Lashawn explained to the police that she had left the state because she was afraid that Paddy or his friends would harm her or her family if she testified against him. Nevertheless, <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>she again agreed to testify, the charges against Paddy were reinstated, and trial was scheduled to begin on November 5.</p>

On the basis of information suggesting that Paddy had fled to Maryland, a federal fugitive warrant was issued charging him with flight to avoid prosecution, and the joint fugitive task force of the Philadelphia police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an intensive manhunt. Although Paddy could not be located, it became apparent that he had not left Philadelphia. At one point investigators spotted Paddy driving a white 1988 Ford Mustang, which was later determined to have been titled to a fictitious name. Freddy Murphy, Lashawn’s cousin, encountered Paddy on the street, where Paddy told him that Lashawn had been “running her f-----mouth” about him and “saying things she shouldn’t say.” Paddy informed Murphy that someone should warn Lashawn “before somebody rides up on her and puts some holes in her.” In a later encounter, Paddy asked Murphy if he had conveyed a warning to Lashawn; Murphy admitted that he had not. On April 26,'1993, while in the Trism Trail Bar, Paddy told his cousin, Shawn Roussaw, that if Lashawn would not “cooperate,” she “would have to go.” On that occasion, according to Roussaw, Paddy was disguised as a woman, wearing a long wig, a dress, and a beige coat.</p>

Although he did not recognize the driver of the car, Roussaw, who had known Paddy all his life, recognized him as the passenger, wearing a wig, sunglasses, and tan overcoat. As the car went past the playground, Paddy looked at Roussaw and smiled. The car matched the description of a vehicle that Sharon Whaley had seen parked near her home the previous two days. On both occasions, she had recognized the driver as a man she had dated named Kevin Green; the <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>passenger was, she thought, a woman with long hair, wearing a baseball cap.</p>

As she was leaving, Lashawn was heard by her sister Rochelle telling her mother “that if anything happened to her, she loved her.” As the blue car was driven past Roussaw and toward Sharon’s home, Lashawn and several relatives, including her sister Tara and Sharon, were standing outside the house. The car stopped a short distance away, and, as the driver of the car shouted, “Get the f— out, do it, do it,” Paddy — described by witnesses as wearing a wig, dress, coat, baseball cap, and dark glasses, and holding a paper towel over his face from chin to nose — got out of the car, aimed a handgun at Lashawn, and fired repeatedly. One shot narrowly missed Tara; six other shots, including one that lodged just beneath the eye, struck and fatally injured Lashawn.</p>

Both Sharon and Tara identified the car as the one from which the shooter had emerged. A thumbprint and palm print on the car’s exterior were determined to be Paddy’s, and crime-scene personnel found, on the passenger side of the vehicle, four long strands of synthetic fiber of the type used to make wigs. Paddy was arrested on May 14, 1993, and charged with Lashawn’s murder.</p>

Prior to trial, the trial court (Savitt, J.), in response to defense counsel’s motion <em>in limine, </em>ruled that Lashawn’s statement to the police identifying Paddy as the perpetrator of the Panati Playground homicides would be admitted, as redacted, for the sole purpose of showing that Lashawn was killed because she had witnessed a crime. The trial court specifically stated that Lashawn’s statements concerning threats made to her were inadmissible, being hearsay not within any exception. Alibi witnesses testified on Paddy’s behalf, as did three witnesses — Melvin Robinson, Zachary Kemp, and Efim Collins — who refuted various aspects of <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>Shawn Roussaw’s testimony. The proceeding ended in a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[251,416,1162,942]]]'>Later that year, Paddy went to trial again, this time for Lashawn’s murder only. Although the trial court (Latrone, J.) ruled prior to trial that Paddy could present alibi evidence for the Panati Playground shootings, Paddy chose not to do so. Also decided prior to trial was the admissibility of Lashawn’s statement to police concerning those shootings. Paddy’s attorney, Janis Smarro, Esq. (“trial counsel”), asked the trial court to admit the statement only to the extent necessary to establish that Lashawn had witnessed the event, been interviewed by police, and identified Paddy as the shooter. Trial counsel was not concerned about Lashawn’s statements expressing her fear of Paddy, which counsel acknowledged were admissible, but about Lashawn’s detailed description of the shootings, which, if admitted, would put counsel “in the position of defending the underlying [Panati Playground] homicides.” The court granted trial counsel’s request to the extent of excluding Lashawn’s naming of other -witnesses to the shootings.</p>

On cross-examination, Murphy conceded that, at the <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>time of the trip to Maryland, he was using numerous drugs, including “cocaine, dope, dust, weed, drinking a little bit, [cough] syrup, various drugs”; when the police took his statement, he was in prison awaiting trial on charges that included robbery and aggravated assault; he was subsequently allowed to plead guilty to simple assault; he was never arrested in connection with Lashawris flight to Maryland; he was awaiting sentence on probation violation charges; and there was pending against him a drug case in which he hoped to receive probation. When defense counsel posed the question “Everything in your statement isn’t true, is it?” Murphy conceded that that might be so. While insisting that his entire testimony had not been untruthful, and that he and Sadeeq had in fact taken Lashawn out of state on Paddy’s behalf, Murphy admitted that he had lied when he asserted that Paddy had given money to his sister, Caroline Murphy, to give to him. He also acknowledged that Lashawn had never explicitly told him that Paddy had threatened her. The next day, while not denying trial counsel’s assertion that the favorable treatment that he had expected from the Commonwealth would be unlikely to materialize if he refused to “go along with the program,” Murphy insisted that his testimony regarding his encounters with Paddy had been truthful.</p>

At the penalty phase, the Commonwealth presented three aggravating circumstances: that the victim was a prosecution witness and was killed to prevent her testimony, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5); knowing creation of a grave risk of death to another, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7); and a previous conviction of murder, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll). To prove the first aggravator, the Commonwealth introduced relevant evidence from the guilt phase of trial. To prove the second, it relied upon the guilt-phase testimony of Tara Whaley recounting that she had felt a bullet go by her ear, as well as the testimony of Sharon Whaley describing the location of Lashawris relatives on the porch during the shooting. Finally, the Commonwealth introduced evidence, including the testimony of a homicide investí<a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>gator, showing that in May of 1994 Paddy had been convicted by a jury of first-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting of Wilbur “Little Man” Thomas, which had occurred in 1989, and that he was formally sentenced to life imprisonment for that murder on February 27, 1995.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In mitigation, the defense offered the catchall circumstance, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Although he had not testified at trial, Paddy testified at the penalty phase and, in addition, called several character witnesses, including relatives. The jury found the three aggravating circumstances presented by the Commonwealth and no mitigating circumstances, and, accordingly, sentenced Paddy to death.</p>

    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[199,559,1157,1498]]]'>The testimony of Lashawn’s sister, Tara Whaley, and cousin, Sharon Whaley, established that Lashawn was killed by a person dressed as a woman, who had just exited the passenger side of a small blue car. Sharon Whaley also testified that she had seen such a person, in such a car, near her home on the days immediately preceding the shooting. Shawn Roussaw, Paddy’s lifelong acquaintance, identified Paddy as the passenger in the blue car who was dressed as a woman; in addition, Roussaw had encountered Paddy just days earlier, similarly dressed and threatening to harm Lashawn if she refused to cooperate. Forensic evidence, consisting of a fingerprint, palm print, and synthetic fibers used in a wig, further linked Paddy to the car. The Commonwealth also furnished ample evidence that Paddy had a motive to silence Lashawn (she planned to testify against him in connection with the Panati Playground murders), had acted on that motive in the past (by engineering Lashawn’s timely disappearance to prevent her from testifying), and had expressed an intention to act on it in the future (as shown by his statements to Shawn Roussaw and Freddy Murphy concerning the consequences to Lashawn if she failed to remain silent). <em>See United States v.

Paddy maintains that, although Judge Savitt had ordered the Commonwealth in April of 1995 to disclose all exculpatory information to the defense, the Commonwealth never informed the defense of the existence of another potential suspect; the defense learned of his existence in 1999, without the Commonwealth’s assistance; and, although the Commonwealth has still not disclosed any of its evidence concerning the January 14, 1995, homicide, the defense has obtained discovery pertaining thereto, including witness statements. According to Paddy, this alleged <em>Brady </em>violation warrants a new trial or, at the least, a remand to allow the claim to be litigated.

In connection with the latter argument, Paddy asserts that when he was first tried for Lashawn’s murder, the only portions of the above statement that were admitted, pursuant to Judge Savitt’s ruling, were Lashawn’s acknowledgment that she remembered having been interviewed and her statement that “I saw Donny riding around the playground right before the shooting.

Subsequent statements resolved any uncertainty as to Lashawn’s meaning, however. When the assistant district attorney assigned to the Panati Playground homicides was asked how Lashawn had explained her failure to appear for trial, he replied that she had expressed fear of Paddy, described being taken to Maryland and kept there by some of Paddy’s associates, and voiced the belief that if she were to testify, Paddy or his associates would harm her or her family. At this juncture, however, trial counsel objected (albeit unsuccessfully) to each of the questions that led to the disclosure of this evidence. Then, prior to the testimony of Detective Leon Lubiejewski, who had been assigned to locate Lashawn after her failure to appear for trial, trial counsel objected “to any further hearsay statements from the victim regarding where she was or fears she might have had.” This objection, like those that preceded it, was overruled, and Detective Lubiejewski was permitted to recount Lashawn’s assertion that she had been afraid not to go to Maryland with Paddy’s friends. As trial counsel did precisely what Paddy contends she should have done, this allegation of ineffectiveness lacks arguable merit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Because preliminary hearing counsel lacked such vital impeachment evidence, Paddy maintains, his cross-examination of Roussaw was insufficient to protect Paddy’s state and federal constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. <em>See id. </em>at 585, 614 A.2d at 685. Paddy acknowledges that the jury eventually learned of Roussaw’s criminal record by means of a stipulation agreed to by the Commonwealth and trial counsel, but asserts that that mode of proof was inadequate to protect his right to confrontation because <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>preliminary hearing counsel never had the opportunity to use the criminal record information for impeachment purposes.</p>

Rejecting the Commonwealth’s contention that the mere “opportunity” to cross-examine was sufficient, this Court reasoned that any such opportunity, to be constitutionally adequate, must be “full and fair,” and that such standard could not be met where, as in that case, defense counsel had been denied access to vital impeachment evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 588-90, 614 A.2d at 687-88.</p>

During his cross-examination of Roussaw, which occupies 19 pages of transcript, preliminary hearing counsel elicited the following information: At the time of the preliminary hearing, Roussaw was incarcerated while awaiting trial on an assault charge. Despite the complainant’s assertion that he had used a firearm in committing the offense, Roussaw insisted that the charge was simple rather than aggravated assault. Roussaw also admitted being charged with car theft and a drug offense; asked whether he was charged with felony distribution of cocaine, the witness replied, “I don’t know what I’m charged with. I just know I <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>got caught with cocaine.” Although he denied any expectation of help from the authorities in return for his testimony against Paddy, Roussaw conceded that he did not contact the police immediately after Lashawn’s murder, but only began to cooperate after he was jailed on the assault charge and the police learned that he and Paddy were cousins. He also acknowledged that he was using cocaine when he saw Paddy on the day in question, that he had been a cocaine user for “quite awhile,” and that, despite their familial relationship, he and Paddy were then on “bad, bad” terms owing to a dispute concerning a girlfriend.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

If trial counsel had done so, Paddy maintains, the Commonwealth’s purported strategy of linking him to the earlier homicides would have been effectively undermined. Second, Paddy faults trial counsel for failing to rebut Shawn Roussaw’s testimony by calling Zachary Kemp, Kim Collins, and Melvin Robinson. According to Paddy, Kemp and Collins would have denied that they had been at the Trism Trail Bar with Roussaw when Roussaw encountered Paddy dressed as a woman, and Robinson would have denied that he had been playing basketball with Roussaw at the playground at 22nd and Lippincott Streets on the day of Lashawn’s murder.</p>

If trial counsel had called the alibi witnesses and the Commonwealth had successfully impeached them, the trial court continued, Paddy could then have argued that trial counsel was ineffective for unduly focusing the jury’s attention on the earlier murders. Because there was a reasonable basis for trial counsel’s decision not to <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>call alibi witnesses, the trial court concluded, her assistance was not ineffective.</p>

The court also suggested, with respect to Collins and Kemp, that their testimony would not actually have been exculpatory, as they could not have proved that Roussaw was not in the Trism Trail Bar with Paddy two days before Lashawn’s murder, but only that they were not there at the time Roussaw said they were.</p>

As previously discussed, <em>see supra </em>Section II.B.l, the statement in which Lashawn described witnessing the earlier murders was properly admitted as some evidence of Paddy’s motive for shooting Lashawn. It is also undisputed that attempts by a defendant to suppress evidence are admissible to demonstrate his or her consciousness of guilt. <em>See Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/542/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="542 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="458722" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0384-01">542 Pa. 384</a>, 403-04, <a href="/pa/542/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="668 A.2d 97" data-case-ids="458722,7860557" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0384-01,/a2d/668/0097-01">668 A.2d 97</a>, 106 (1995). It appears, however, that, in the discussion quoted above, the prosecutor and the trial court confused these concepts. The evidence that Paddy attempted to suppress (that is, Lashawn’s testimony) concerned his involvement in the Panati Playground murders. Assertions that Paddy tried to suppress Lashawn’s testimony by paying her, <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>threatening her, and sending her out of town could serve as evidence of Paddy’s motive to silence Lashawn, and thus of his guilt in Lashawn’s murder. The same facts cannot serve as evidence of Paddy’s <em>consciousness </em>of guilt in Lashawn’s murder, however, because, at the time Paddy was attempting to suppress evidence, the murder had not yet occurred. The attempted suppression of Lashawn’s testimony would obviously serve as evidence of Paddy’s consciousness of guilt of the Panati Playground murders, but, as trial counsel pointed out, Paddy was not on trial for those murders.</p>

Furthermore, the trial court’s comment that “motive is perfectly proper as to the first two [murders],” while not phrased as clearly as it might have been, would have served to remind the jury that references to the earlier murders were relevant only insofar as they served to reveal a motive for Lashawn’s murder; as no evidence had been adduced concerning the motives that led to the Panati Playground murders, there is insufficient reason to assume that the jury would have inferred any other meaning from the instruction.

As for the prosecutor’s embellishments, the trial court’s instructions limited their context to the argument that Paddy (and no one else) had a motive to murder Lashawn. Given the substantial amount of evidence offered by the Commonwealth to prove Paddy’s motive, the challenged references, regardless of the admissibility <em>vel non </em>of the statements referred to, could not have prejudiced Paddy.

    <p id="b224-8" data-blocks='[["BL_224.7",224,[255,1168,1163,1168]]]'>The sequence of pertinent events indicates that there is arguable merit to this claim of ineffectiveness. The Panati Playground murders occurred on January 15, 1991. Paddy was charged with the murders, and he surrendered on those charges several weeks after an arrest warrant issued on June 11, 1991. On September 24, 1992, Lashawn having failed to appear at trial, the charges against Paddy were nolle prossed, and he was released from prison. Immediately thereafter, according to the jury instruction, Paddy was seen around his neighborhood. After Lashawn returned to Philadelphia and agreed to testify, the charges were reinstated and trial was scheduled to begin on November 5, 1992. Subsequently Paddy could not be found. Lashawn was murdered on April 28, 1993. Paddy remained at large until his arrest on May 14, 1993. Thus, of the flight referred to by the trial court, only the sixteen-day period in April and May of 1993 occurred after Lashawn’s murder. As for the earlier period during which Paddy could not be found, if, as the trial court instructed the jury, an individual’s flight suggests that he “thinks he is or may be accused of committing [the crime that has occurred],” such crime could only have been the Panati Playground murders.</p>
    <p id="b225-4" data-blocks='[["BL_225.3",225,[209,291,1154,911]]]'>
      <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>The Commonwealth argues against a “strained” interpretation of the trial court’s instruction by asserting that Paddy’s flight following his release from prison in 1992 could be viewed as circumstantial evidence of his guilt for Lashawn’s murder. While that may be so — for example, it could be asserted that Paddy’s willingness to flee showed that he would go to any length, including the murder of a witness, to avoid prosecution for the 1991 murders — the Commonwealth’s argument does not accurately reflect the wording of the instruction. Throughout the instruction, the trial court referred to flight as possible evidence of a defendant’s <em>consciousness </em>of guilt. As with suppression of evidence, <em>see supra </em>Section XI.B.3, a defendant cannot be conscious of guilt regarding a crime which has not yet been committed. In summary, the trial court erred in giving the challenged instruction, and we can envision no reasonable basis for trial counsel’s failure to object thereto.</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[205,1267,1158,903]]]'>The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether Paddy was prejudiced by trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. At no point in its charge did the trial court suggest that Paddy’s perceived guilt or innocence of the Panati Playground murders should influence the jury’s deliberations in the present case. Moreover, the trial court had instructed the jury at the commencement of testimony and during closing argument that those murders were not, in themselves, at issue. Further, the court’s instruction emphasized that the inference which could be drawn from flight was permissive rather than mandatory: “[A]n innocent man, when placed by circumstances in a condition of suspicion and danger, may resort to deception or flight.... The innocent often do flee.” In light of these factors, as well as the evidence — motive, identification, and physical — linking Paddy to Lashawn’s murder, it is not reasonably probable that this erroneous instruction led the jury to convict Paddy when it would not otherwise have done so.</p>

Although such a claim is not devoid of merit, <em>see Commonwealth v.

As noted earlier, <em>see supra </em>Section 1, the crux of Paddy’s defense was that he was not the person who murdered Lashawn. Indeed, trial counsel emphasized during closing that “the fact that this woman was brutally murdered” was undisputed, and that “[t]he issue ... is whether this man did the shooting and what have they given you to show that he has?” Given the defense theory of the case, there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial turned on the trial court’s instruction on malice.

That means the defendant acted knowingly at the time he committed the offense, that is, that he was aware and fully conscious that his conduct was of such a nature that it was probably certain to create a grave risk of death to someone other than the deceased.</blockquote>

    <p id="b229-6" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[209,1200,1153,794]]]'>Viewed in a narrowly technical manner, Paddy’s claim is not without merit. The Crimes Code explains that “[a] person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when ... if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is <em>practically certain </em>that his conduct will cause such a result.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(b)(2)(ii) (emphasis added). Arguably the phrase “probably certain” connotes a less demanding standard of knowledge than does “practically certain.” It must be emphasized, however, that the jury found three aggravating circumstances; even if the “grave risk” aggravator is discounted, two others remain, and, as no mitigating circumstance was found, the death penalty is still required. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). Thus, Paddy has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to object to the relevant instruction.</p>

According to Paddy, both cases were investigated by the same detectives, prosecuted by the same member of the District Attorney’s Office, and featured the preliminary hearing testimony of Shawn Roussaw, and therefore the claims of police and prosecutorial misconduct and perjury by Roussaw that were raised in his PCRA petition in the Thomas matter are pertinent to the present case as well.

Furthermore, it remains to be decided whether, under Pa.R.E. 804(b)(6), the absent witness’s testimony shall be admitted only as evidence pertaining to the events about which the witness would have testified if he or she had not been prevented from doing so, or whether, as is the prevailing federal view, such testimony should also be admitted at the defendant’s trial for murdering the witness. <em>See Dhinsa, </em><a href="/f3d/243/0635-01" class="citation" data-index="175" data-cite="243 F.3d 635" data-case-ids="11124472" data-case-paths="/f3d/243/0635-01">243 F.3d at 653</a>. While there is no need for us to address the parameters of Rule 804(b)(6) here, we note that, as to trials conducted after its effective date (including a retrial in the present case, if one were granted), the rule appears to negate the traditional hearsay challenge to statements having the same character and context as Lashawn's.</p>

The only inconsistency specifically cited by Paddy does not concern a prior statement, but rather Roussaw’s testimony that the blue car approached Sharon Whaley’s residence from a direction different from that noted by other witnesses. As with any other inconsistencies in testimony among various witnesses, this was a matter to be weighed by the jury as finder of fact.</p>

Moreover, when the stipulation concerning Roussaw’s criminal record was subsequently read to the jury, it revealed the following: Roussaw was also known as Shawn Poindexter. At the time of Paddy’s preliminary hearing, three sets of charges were pending against him: unauthorized use of an automobile and receiving stolen property; possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver the same; and aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, possession of an instrument of crime, and criminal conspiracy. On October 4, 1993, three months after Paddy's preliminary hearing, Roussaw entered a guilty plea to the drug charges, in return for which the Commonwealth informed the court that it wished to “demanditorize" the charges. On January 27, 1994, the date set for sentencing, the Commonwealth asked for a continuance because Roussaw was cooperating in the case against Paddy. A second continuance was granted for the same reason. Roussaw died before being sentenced on the drug charges, and before being tried on the theft charges. As for the third set of offenses, the charge of aggravated assault was dismissed following the preliminary hearing, and the remaining charges were withdrawn when the victim failed to appear for trial. Further, Assistant District Attorney Joel Rosen, who had originally been assigned to the Lashawn Whaley homicide, confirmed that after Roussaw had testified at Paddy's preliminary hearing, an agreement was reached pursuant to which the Commonwealth would "demanditorize” the drug charge in return for Roussaw’s future testimony in the present case.</p>

Paddy also asserts, but does not develop the argument that, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor likened the defense to a three-card monte game and attempted to link Lashawn’s murder to the earlier homicides by arguing that both events occurred at 4 p.m. The former comment was not so extreme as to cause the degree of prejudice necessary for relief, and the record reveals that trial counsel did object to the latter.</p>
