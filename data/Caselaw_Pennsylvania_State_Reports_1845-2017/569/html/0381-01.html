The sales tax is collected by the seller of “tangible personal property or services” from the purchaser. 72 P.S. § 7202(a). Similarly, subsection (b) imposes a tax on the use of “tangible personal property” and services “purchased at retail.” The person who uses the property is liable for the use tax.

The Commonwealth Court correctly followed these precedents of this Court. Its holding that the exclusion is only available for facilities used exclusively by public utilities was consistent with our Opinions. <em>Public Constructors, </em><a href="/pa/432/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="432 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1919696" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0589-01">432 Pa. 589</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%2029" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="248 A.2d 29">248 A.2d 29</a>, 31.

We held in <em>Erie Excavating </em>that a party need not be a public utility to satisfy the requirements of the exclusion. The claims in <em>Erie Excavating </em>arose when the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) retained Erie Excavating (“Erie”) to build a railroad bed to replace the one that the Corps intended to flood to expand a nearby reservoir. Erie built the new railroad bed and the Commonwealth assessed use tax liability against Erie. Erie argued that because it built the railroad bed for the railroad, which is a public utility, it should not have to pay the tax. The Commonwealth contended that because Erie was not a public utility, it should not benefit from the exclusion. This Court agreed with Erie and held that Erie need not be a public utility to satisfy the requirements of the exclusion. The Court explained that:</p>

However, we determined that the General Assembly could not mean what it said because application of the exclusion to all situations in which a public utility benefited from construction might leave the Commonwealth without income from other sources, specifically from sales and use taxes relating to highway and bridge construction, which we deemed an absurd result. We also explained that the purpose of the exclusion was to save the public the expense of a tax, which in all likelihood would be passed entirely on to it. If the exclusion were to be allowed to apply in situations in which a public utility was not the exclusive beneficiary of the facility, we reasoned that the state would lose tax money and the public would not get the full benefit of the exclusion.</p>

Doing so permitted the Commonwealth to collect a tax in a manner in which the General Assembly expressly prohibited.

The statutes at issue here are clear; a sale or use of tangible personal property is taxable unless the taxpayer demonstrates that the predominant purpose of the sale or use is excluded. The General Assembly could have set forth an exclusive purpose test, but it did not do so. Here the predominant users and beneficiaries of the facilities built by the contractors are public utilities and the predominant purpose of those facilities is to serve public utilities. Therefore, the exclusion should apply.</p>

In <em>Public Constructors, </em>we explained that there should be an exclusivity requirement because: (1) application of any other rule would yield an absurd result; and (2) the purpose of the exclusion — to make sure that the proceeds of the exclusion are passed on to the public at large — would not be served by any other rule. We address these reasons in turn. First, we do not believe that application of the predominant purpose test would yield an absurd result. The Court in <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>
      <em>Public Constructors </em>was concerned that application of any test other than one of exclusive use would prevent the Commonwealth from collecting sales and use taxes attributable to sales of materials used for highway and bridge construction. However, there is no evidence that the predominant user of highways and bridges are public utilities. In fact, the Commonwealth admits that the opposite is true. The Commonwealth stipulated that eighty-seven percent of the traffic on the Pennsylvania Turnpike is composed of passenger car traffic and that less than thirteen percent is by public utilities. Stipulation ¶¶ 20-21. The Commonwealth also admitted that, “substantially less than thirty percent of traffic on Pennsylvania highways consists of vehicles operated by public utilities.” Stipulation ¶ 22 (citing Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Planning and Research, <em>Pennsylvania Highway Statistics </em>(1999 and 2000)). Accordingly, if we apply the statute by its terms, the Commonwealth does not appear to be at risk to lose sales and use taxes relating to public utility use of highways.</p>

This assumption is understandable given that the railroad company owned the tracks and the railroad bed that Erie Excavating constructed. However, when we consider the use of a railroad, we note that not every car that rides the railroad is operated by a public utility. Amtrak permits its trains to be chartered (http:/Avww. amtrak.com/services/charter.html) and the website for the American Association of Private Railroad Car Owners lists fifty different private rail cars, which it claims are available for use most places that Amtrak trains go. (http://www.aaprco. com/car/car_index_intro.html (last visited May 2002)). Accordingly, although this Court assumed that the railroad bed that Erie Excavating built was constructed “solely for use in a public utility service[,]” the facts may have been otherwise. <em>Erie Excavating, </em><a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20191" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="248 A.2d 191">248 A.2d at 193</a>.

By the express terms of the statute, the public utility exclusion applies whether the railroad bed was used exclusively by a public utility ■ or predominantly by a public utility. Such a result makes sense, is not absurd and, most importantly, is consistent with the applicable statutes.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[245,589,1165,795]]]'>The second reason the <em>Public Constructors </em>Court cited in favor of the exclusivity requirement was that the purpose of the exclusion, which was “obviously” to pass the proceeds of the exclusion on to the public at large, would not be served by any other rule. <em>Public Constructors, </em><a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%2029" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="248 A.2d 29">248 A.2d at 31</a>. Although this policy is a reasonable explanation for the public policy exclusion, the Court did not state how it identified this purpose nor did it cite any authority for it. Additionally, as the dissent in <em>Erie Excavating </em>pointed out, the policy of passing all of the proceeds of the exclusion on to the public was not served in that case. Indeed, because the Corps paid Erie to perform the work, any money that Erie saved through the exclusion was <em>not </em>passed on to the riders of the railroad. <em>Erie Excavating, </em><a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20191" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="248 A.2d 191">248 A.2d at 193-194</a>.
