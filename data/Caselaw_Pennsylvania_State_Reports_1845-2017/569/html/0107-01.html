Significant to the instant controversy, the 1994 Act precluded the building of a convention center where one already existed in the subject county. On November 3, 1999, a new Third Class County Convention Center Authority Act (1999 Act) was promulgated, effectively repealing the 1994 Act, for the stated purpose of consolidating <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>and clarifying existing law. The 1999 Act expressly states that it does not apply to a county which has an existing convention center owned or operated by an existing authority or the Commonwealth which covers an area of more than forty thousand square feet. 16 P.S. § 2399.2(c)(1). This amendment, referred to as the “Armstrong Amendment,” made clear that the Act did not prohibit the building of a public convention center in a county where a private convention center already existed.</p>

Additionally, the County enacted Ordinance No. 45 imposing a hotel room rental tax of 3.9% and Ordinance No. 46 imposing a hotel excise tax of 1.1%, both of which went into effect on January 1, 2000. Ordinance No. 45 provides that 80% of the revenues from the hotel room rental tax are to be used by the Authority to fund development, construction and operation of a convention center in downtown Lancaster and the remaining 20% is to be used by the Pennsylvania Dutch Convention and Visitors Bureau (Visitors Bureau) to promote Lancaster County tourism.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

However, the court also found that the supply of hotel rooms in the County grew by 4.1% since 1999, and that occupancy rates had been on the decline since 1998. Additionally, the court found that the Lancaster County hotel market sold more rooms than ever through October 2000, at higher rates than ever, resulting in greater room revenues than in any prior year during the same time of year. A further finding was made that the County’s average room rate, Rev Par (an industry standard statistic reflecting certain elements of profitability by combining occupancy and revenue), room demand, and overall room revenue were at a five-year high as of October 2000, as compared to the same period of months, January through October, from 1994 through 2000. Significantly, however, the trial court found that most of the hotels acknowledged that they had no evidence of losing any business directly as a result of the tax. Instead, they noted several other factors, such as increased competition in the market, massive road reconstruction, increased gasoline prices, and the failure of local attractions to change their programs from previous years, as having contributed to the loss in business. Findings of Fact, Nos. 37-48.</p>

The court found that events held at the proposed convention center could reasonably be expected to generate 20,000 to 30,000 hotel room nights annually. Approximately 45% of those rooms are expected to be booked by the proposed new hotel, leaving 11,000 to 16,000 room nights per year to spill over to existing convention-quality hotels. Indeed, the court found that most of the hotels acknowledged that the proposed convention center and spillover from the adjoining hotel would result in additional room nights for the hotel market. Findings of Fact, Nos. 64, 67, 71, 73. The court further found that the <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>construction project itself will provide a one-time spending directly to the Lancaster County hotels of between $162,000 to $183,000 and that convention center operations will provide additional spending on those same hotels of $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 annually. The convention center was found likely to provide a revitalization to the <em>economy </em>and infrastructure of downtown Lancaster, making Lancaster County a more vibrant tourist destination and creating additional overnight tourist stays. Additionally, the trial court found that while construction of a new hotel would increase competition in an already competitive hotel market in Lancaster County, it could also generate new business for the County by drawing a class of clientele who might otherwise choose to stay elsewhere. Findings of Fact, Nos. 73-78.</p>
    <p id="b244-4" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[250,1050,1161,954]]]'>The trial court also found that the expenditure of the additional revenues already had and will continue to result in substantial benefits for Lancaster County hotels. Most of the Appellee hotels and many of the hotels in the County are members of the Bureau and the Appellees generally acknowledged at trial that they receive a direct benefit from their membership in the Bureau. According to the trial court’s findings, the portions of the revenues generated by the tax that is to go directly to the Bureau will more than double its marketing budget. As a result of the additional revenue already generated, the Bureau has been able to hire additional staff members and more aggressively market the County’s tourism business. Further, the trial court found that the expenditure of these additional revenues, together with the new marketing strategies the tax allows for, will generate a 1% to 12% increase in annual demand for overnight stays in the County hotels, resulting in an increase of 16,000 to 187,000 room nights annually.

The Commonwealth Court agreed. More specifically, the court faulted the trial court for concluding that any potential increased competition resulting from the proposed new hotel was irrelevant and for not rendering any findings respecting when the proposed convention center would generate any revenue to those subject to the tax. Upon concluding that such findings were necessary to effectuate a proper benefit and burden analysis, the Commonwealth Court remanded the matter to the trial court with direction to make the necessary findings and to perform a proper benefit and burden analysis. Given its holding, the court declined to address the remaining issues raised by Appellees. Appellants then filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal with our Court and also a Petition for Exercise of Plenary Jurisdiction alleging that they are operating under a construction deadline and that an expedited resolution of this matter is necessary so that the issuing of bonds may proceed. On April 23, 2002, this Court entered an order granting allowance of appeal and directing that the matter be submitted on briefs and an expedited briefing schedule established. We entered a second order that same date dismissing the Petition for Exercise of Plenary Jurisdiction as moot.</p>

Appellants maintain that in so concluding, the Commonwealth Court exceeded its scope of review by not deferring to the trial court’s amply supported findings that Appellees had not met their burden of establishing either lost profits or any other burden sufficient to render the tax constitutionally infirm.

This, however, is not the Court’s position, which was better articulated during the oral argument on this issue. The Court is satisfied that the connection between the convention center and the adjoining hotel is so <em>quid pro quo </em>that each must be considered in the benefit/burden analysis. However, the hotel is only relevant to the extent that it takes away any benefit from the plaintiffs that would be derived from the convention center. In other words, the convention center will not be built without the hotel, and vice-versa. If the hotel were to take any and all benefit from the convention center leaving nothing for the other Lancaster County hoteliers, that would appear to be a funding of competition in that a benefit would be created for one, through a tax on all. <em>See generally, Allegheny County v. Monzo, </em><a href="/pa/509/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="509 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1795257" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0026-01">509 Pa. 26</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="509 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1795257" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0026-01">500 A.2d 1096</a> (1985). To the extent that there are room nights put back into the market above and beyond this absorption of the convention center business, <em>that </em>is merely capitalism at work. Even though the hotel will not come without the convention center, the hotel is not to be funded with public monies. Thus, the plaintiffs are not funding the hotel that will adjoin the proposed convention center. The added competition to the market as a whole is not a concern of the Court, and neither is it relevant to this issue, as the addition of rooms to the market is no different than if any private hotel were to be built in downtown Lancaster. The only relevant burden this hotel will have is the extent to which it takes away the benefits of the convention center from the other Lancaster County hotels.</blockquote>

Thus, contrary to what the Commonwealth Court implies, the trial court did, indeed, consider the impact of the new hotel, at least with respect to the extent that the new hotel would absorb a <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>portion of the new hotel business that would be generated by the convention center. As noted above, the court found that 45% of additional room nights that would be generated from the construction of the convention center would be absorbed by the new hotel. However, the trial court also found that the convention center events would benefit not only the proposed new hotel, but also a majority of the hotels in the County. Thus, the facts presented here are distinguishable from those presented in <em>Allegheny County v. Monzo, </em><a href="/pa/509/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="509 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1795257" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0026-01">509 Pa. 26</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="509 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1795257" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0026-01">500 A.2d 1096</a> (1985), where we found a similar hotel tax unconstitutional.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[213,898,1155,947]]]'>In <em>Monzo, </em>the owner of a hotel located in Monroeville, a municipality of Allegheny County, challenged the constitutionality of a similar hotel room tax enacted for purpose of funding a convention center in downtown Pittsburgh. The facts there, however, established that the imposition of the tax actually caused hotels in Allegheny County that were located outside the downtown Pittsburgh area to lose patrons and to finance their competitors in Pittsburgh. In affirming the trial court’s determination that the Allegheny County tax was unconstitutional, we noted that “[a]n examination of the incidence of this tax and its effects establishes that a substantial portion (perhaps a majority) of the class taxed are afforded no benefits whatsoever, while being significantly burdened.” <em>Monzo, </em><a href="/pa/509/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="509 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1795257" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0026-01">500 A.2d at 1104</a>. In the instant matter, however, the trial court’s findings, which are supported by the evidence, indicate that a majority of the hotels in the County will, indeed, benefit from the convention center, and thus, benefit from the tax and that room demand for those hotels will not be lost as a result.</p>

However, they presented no evidence respecting how much money they would lose to the adjoining hotel each year, which is the precise finding that the Commonwealth Court directed to be made. Indeed, the only evidence presented on the issue of increased competition came from Mr. Chiccarine who essentially testified that the existing hotel market in Lancaster County was already highly competí<a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>tive and that adding yet another hotel to the market would only make it more competitive. Thus, even assuming the issue of increased competition was relevant, to permit a remand would, in effect, provide Appellees a second chance to prove their case.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[251,610,1162,370]]]'>Similarly, the Commonwealth Court’s further conclusion, that the trial court erred in not finding the tax to be a burden <em>per se </em>is not supported in law, but rather simply represents that court’s view that certain additional evidence should have been presented. Moreover, a portion of the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning directly contradicts credibility determinations made by the trial court and supported by the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[251,1022,1164,971]]]'>In order to properly address this issue, a review of the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning on this issue is necessary. In support of its conclusion that the burden imposed by the imposition of 3.9% room tax is a “given,” the Commonwealth Court recited testimony of Appellees which indicated that because of the tax, some of the existing hotels were unable to raise their room rates and some of them opted to absorb completely the cost of the tax to retain business paid for prior to the imposition of the tax. Based upon that conclusion, that the burden from the tax is a “given,” the Commonwealth Court concluded that it was therefore error on the part of the trial court not to consider any potential lost profits caused by the tax. The court ultimately concluded its analysis by holding that it is thus necessary to remand for findings respecting when and to what extent the convention center operations will generate revenue to the existing hotels that are collecting the tax. Not only is this reasoning disjointed, it also is without support in the record and has no basis in the'law.</p>
    <p id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[251,2035,1160,313]]]'>First, the trial court did not find that the tax was not a burden; rather it determined, based on the evidence presented, that Appellees had failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the benefits and burdens were disproportionate. Such an analysis is in complete conformity with this Court’s prior decisions in <em>Torbik, supra </em>and <em>Leventhal, <a href="/pa/518/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="518 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1811595" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0233-01">supra.</a></em>

Specifically, the court noted that there was testimony that the hotels were unable to raise rates due to the imposition of the tax and that some hotels even chose to lower their rates to better compete, thus it was error for the court not to consider lost profits. Contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion, the trial court did not neglect to consider the issue of lost profits. Rather, the trial court found that Appellees had failed to present sufficient evidence to establish any lost profits resulting from the imposition of the tax. See Findings of Fact, Nos. 36-39, 42-45. In response to Appellees’ claim, the trial court, in its opinion, explained those findings and the court’s conclusion respecting the issue of lost profits as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[256,1167,1115,1010]]]'>First, the Court is satisfied that the proof of lost profits caused by the supposed inability to raise rates was too nebulous for consideration. The only evidence which was available on the issue was [Appellees’] own self-serving testimony that they were unable to raise rates. This evidence also flew in the face of the Smith Travel Reports, which indicated that through October of 2000, Lancaster County hotels were charging the highest rates ever over the same period. Regardless, there was no solid proof that more could have been charged by [Appellees] or that they indeed intended to charge more than the current rates, which were the highest average rates ever. Second, the Court did not dismiss this evidence based on the fact that lost profits are not fundamental property rights. Rather, the Court noted this as going to the weight of such evidence. In other words, not only was it nebulous, but as a general proposition, it was not a constitutionally protected loss. The Court found that both facts seriously undercut the weight of such evidence.</blockquote>

Our prior case law does not set forth a checklist of criteria that must be considered in each instance. Rather, as noted above, the trial court is put to the task of weighing the evidence presented to determine whether the benefits and burdens imposed by the tax are disproportionate. <em>Torbik, supra; Leventhal, <a href="/pa/518/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="518 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1811595" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0233-01">supra.</a> </em>We have never held that precise calculations and projections are necessary, nor have we held that the timing of the benefits to be reaped by the imposition of the tax is of critical import. Nor have we quantified and/or qualified the evidence necessary to render a proper benefit and burdens analysis. Instead, we have simply reviewed the findings rendered by the fact finder regarding the harms occasioned by the tax and the benefits to be reaped thereby and determined if those findings are supported by the evidence. Since Appellees did not produce evidence in the first instance as to what projected revenues would be once the convention center operations were underway and when the hotels could expect to receive such revenues, to allow the Commonwealth Court’s resolution here to stand would effectively give Appellees further opportunity to establish their claim.</p>
