The term of incarceration, though significantly less than the ten-to-twenty year statutory maximum, fell above the standard range of the sentencing guidelines. The trial court noted that an aggravated range guidelines sentence was warranted because appellant had selected a particularly vulnerable disabled victim and had violated a position of trust by raping her. At the time of sentencing appellant was advised of his post-sentencing rights, including his right to file post-sentencing motions, his right to appeal, and his continuing right to counsel. Appellant also signed a document which explained his post-sentencing rights, specifically acknowledging that he understood them. Appellant did not seek to withdraw his plea or to have his sentence reconsidered, nor did he file a direct appeal and thus, by operation of law, his sentence became final thirty days after its imposition, on July 11, 1997. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3) (“a judgment <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>becomes final at the conclusion of direct review ... or at the expiration of time for seeking the review”).</p>

In the Commonwealth’s view, <em>Garcia, Hitchcock </em>and similar cases are simply wrong to the extent they perceive a question of retroactivity. Because all post-conviction remedies are subsumed within the PCRA for claims that may be raised under the PCRA, the Commonwealth reasons, the question of whether relief for such claims may be pursued outside the PCRA’s framework is not one of procedure, but of jurisdiction. Since the courts below lacked authority to devise alternate avenues of post-conviction review for the claim at issue here, the Commonwealth concludes, the denial of extraPCRA review to appellant must be affirmed.</p>
