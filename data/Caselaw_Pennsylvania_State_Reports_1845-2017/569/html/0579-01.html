State Ethics Commission, </em><a href="/pa/555/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="555 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="1701990" data-case-paths="/pa/555/0149-01">555 Pa. 149</a>, <a href="/a2d/723/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="723 A.2d 174" data-case-ids="11754919,1701990" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0174-01,/pa/555/0149-01">723 A.2d 174</a> (1999). They also argue that the definition of “lobbying” contained in the Act does not describe the “practice of law” and, therefore, the Act does not infringe on this Court’s right to regulate the conduct of attorneys. According to Appellant Corrigan, lobbying is an activity in which the fundamental element of judgment concerns the personal, political or economic interest of the party on whose behalf the lobbying is being done whereas the practice of law requires the exercise of legal judgment. He submits that while an attorney may provide legal analysis and judgment to his clients regarding a proposed piece of legislation, such activities do not constitute lobbying. Rather, he submits, it is the communication of such judgment to our legislators that comprises the act of lobbying, which, according to Appellants, is separate and distinct from the exercise of the underlying legal judgment. Appellant State Ethics Commission, similarly argues that “lobbying” does not encompass the practice of law because the activity of lobbying does not require an understanding of legal principles and/or the practiced skill of applying such principles. Appellant Fisher, adds that since a person need not be licensed to practice law to be a lobbyist, lobbying cannot therefore, be considered “the practice of law.”</p>

I certainly have no constitutional quarrel with the General Assembly’s effort to regulate lobbyists. As Mr. Justice Saylor’s opinion accurately points out, the wisdom and necessity of the General Assembly’s effort at illumination through the disclosure requirements contained in the Act, at least as a general matter of policy, is undeniable and, more importantly, a matter for the Assembly itself to determine. Accordingly, I see no valid separation of powers concern arising from the fact that, under the Act, principals are required to file the designated reports and disclose the required lobbying information. In promoting their various causes, principals may hire whomever they please, including Pennsylvania attorneys, and they should be required to report the requested information relevant to their lobbying activity— including the subject matter of the lobbying, the amount of money involved, the names of State officials or employees contacted, and gifts or other items of value distributed by their efforts.</p>

In that respect, the Act inevitably and directly intrudes upon the attorney/client relationship, including the lawyer’s duty to maintain confidentiality.

Mr. Chief Justice Zappala's opinion favoring affirmance would limit PJ.S.'s holding, according to the opinion's quotation of <em>Maunus, </em>to the proposition that “an employer [can] impose workplace regulations on an employee who happens to be an attorney without infringing on [this Court's] constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law so long as those regulations do not conflict with the authority of this Court.” Opinion in Support of Affirmance, <em>op. </em>at 818 (Zappala, C.J.). The difficulties with this position are severalfold.
