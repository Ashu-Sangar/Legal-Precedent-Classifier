Thus, under our workers’ compensation jurisprudence, where there is an aggravation of a pre-existing condition, the inquiry becomes whether the claimant has returned to baseline, i.e., his or her pre-injury medical condition, or whether the aggravation is a substantial contributing factor of the claimant’s current impairment and resulting disability. <em>See Bethlehem Steel Corp. v.

    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[199,1117,1158,517]]]'>The WCJ concluded that Claimant met her burden of demonstrating a work-related injury, but failed to carry her burden to warrant ongoing total disability benefits. The WCJ arrived at this decision based on the work availability doctrine and the two positions proffered by Ballard, Spahr, Andrews &amp; Ingersoll (Employer) in September of 1994. Totally absent from the record is any evidence that Claimant returned to baseline or that she was released by her physician to return to work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Further, the WCJ failed to include a finding that notice was given to Employer or that notice was waived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed the award of partial disability benefits, concluding that the Employer had failed to timely accept responsibility for the work injury and, <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>therefore, the statute barred it from using job availability as an affirmative defense. I find this result troubling for two reasons. First, there was no finding made by the WCJ with regard to when notice was given by Claimant to Employer. Although in its January 17, 1995 answer to Claimant’s claim petition, Employer initially challenged whether Claimant actually provided notice, Employer soon abandoned the issue and notice may be presumed timely for purposes of establishing the rights of Claimant to benefits under her claim petition. However, the exact date that Claimant gave notice to Employer may not be presumed by the Commonwealth Court for the application of its work availability exception. That exception requires a determination of specific dates (1) the date that Claimant gave notice of her work-related injury to the Employer; and (2) the date that the Employer failed to respond, which is required to be within twenty-one days of that notice, with either a Notice of Compensation Payable or a Notice of Compensation Denial pursuant to Section 406.1 of the Act and <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20121.7" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="34 Pa. Code § 121.7">34 Pa. Code § 121.7</a>(b). Notice of the work-relatedness of Claimant’s cardiac problem could have been given during the October 1993 discussion between Claimant, Human Resources personnel and her supervisor. It could just as easily have been provided when Claimant filed her claim petition, in which case the Commonwealth Court’s exception would have been erroneously applied. Therefore, the invocation of this work availability exception, even if it were to exist as a valid exception to the work availability doctrine, is impermissible under these facts. The Commonwealth Court clearly assumed a notice date previous to the filing of the claim petition in January of 1995. In that posture, I feel that the court erred by engaging in fact finding, which is within the exclusive province of the WCJ. <em>Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v.

It also serves to increase litigation in the workers’ compensation arena. Pursuant to the court’s exception, if an employer fails to issue a Notice of Compensation Payable or a Notice of Compensation Denial, it is forced to file a modification, suspension or termination petition following an adjudication determining liability. Moreover, given the often-protracted nature of workers’ compensation proceedings, a claimant may sit idly for years with no obligation to return to any form of employment until that claimant’s case is resolved <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>by the WCJ.

The appropriate penalty, which was always available to the Commonwealth Court, the Board and the WCJ, is a penalty pursuant to Section 435 of the Act or Section 121.27(g) of the Code.

Thus, in the instant matter, the WCJ should have analyzed Claimant’s disability pursuant to established “aggravation” injury jurisprudence, long established in this Commonwealth. Requiring a claimant to prove all the elements of a claim petition; requiring an employer to prove work availability after a claimant is released to return to work or returns to baseline; requiring an employer to take a proactive stance by having a claimant examined by its own physician prior to an offer of employment; or applying penalties pursuant to Section 435 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 991, are not new or revolutionary concepts — they are the law.</p>

Conspicuously absent from the ensuing proceedings is any testimony from Claimant’s physician, Dr. Mason, who was treating her during the time at issue and, by her own testimony, is still treating Claimant. Claimant testified that she discussed the proffered positions with Dr. Mason, but no testimony was introduced at the hearings before the WCJ, either from Claimant or from Dr. Mason, as to whether Claimant could perform either of the positions offered.</p>
