    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[193,871,1159,1178]]]'>This Court granted allowance of appeal to address whether <em>Hatfield </em>contradicts the mandatory language of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5913 (relating to spouses as witnesses against each other). The facts in <em>Hatfield </em>parallel those in the instant case. Elaine Hatfield was beaten by her husband; she sustained a bloody nose, black eye and multiple contusions. Mr. Hatfield was charged, and despite Mrs. Hatfield’s refusal to testify at the preliminary hearing, was held for court based on testimony by other witnesses. A subpoena was issued for Mrs. Hatfield to testify at trial; she filed a motion to quash because of spousal privilege. The trial court quashed the subpoena, relying on the assurances of counsel that the circumstances surrounding the assault were unique and that the Hatfields were in counseling. The Commonwealth appealed; the Superior Court stated: “[w]hether to force the unwilling spouse to give evidence thus becomes a matter for the trial court’s discretion.” <em>Id., </em>at 1276. For this proposition, the court cited <em>Commonwealth v. Hess, </em><a href="/pa-super/270/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="270 Pa.
