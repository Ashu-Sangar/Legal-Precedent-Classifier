After the children were adopted, Appellant J.J.G. and his partner, Appellant J.C.G., lived together with the children as a family. On May 9, 1999, Appellants filed a petition wherein J.C.G. sought to adopt both children.

Appellant J.J.G., the legal parent, had attached a consent form to the adoption petition, but the phrase indicating that he intended to permanently give up his rights to his children was intentionally omitted from the form.

He found that the majority’s strict construction of Section 2711 contravenes the mandate of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1501-1991, and is inconsistent with the Legislature’s purpose in enacting Section 2711. Judge Johnson stated that the principles relied upon by the majority applied only to the involuntary termination of parental rights and that the majority failed to recognize that Section 2901 granted the trial courts discretion to grant the adoptions in the instant cases.

Appellants clarify that they agree with the lower court’s finding that “cause shown” is essentially an explanation as to why the statutory requirements are not met. They submit that the court can exercise its discretion in this regard by first determining the underlying purpose of the statutory requirement that the prospective adoptive parent seeks to excuse. According to Appellants, the court would then determine, upon examination of a factual showing by the petitioner, whether the purpose of the statutory requirement will otherwise be <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>met or is irrelevant to the particular circumstances of the case.</p>

They assert that cause can be demonstrated in the instant cases because, “[h]ere, as in a stepparent adoption, the only means to guarantee family integrity ordinarily achieved through termination of existing legal parent’s rights would be through preservation of that parent’s rights.” Appellants’ Brief at 30 (emphasis supplied).</p>

Upon a showing of cause, the trial court is afforded <em>discretion </em>to determine whether the adoption petition should, nevertheless, be granted. The exercise of such discretion does not open the door to unlimited adoptions by legally unrelated adults. Such decisions will always be confined by a finding of cause and a determination of the best interests of the child in each individual case. Moreover, like other trial court decisions, findings of cause will be reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">11</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">12</a>

When the requisite cause is demonstrated, Section 2901 affords the trial court discretion to decree the adoption without termination of the legal parent’s rights pursuant to Section 2711(d). An examination of Section 2701(7), which was also amended after <em>E.M.A. </em>was decided, comports with our decision as it requires that the necessary consents under Section 2711 be attached to the adoption petition <em>“or the basis upon which such consents are not required.” </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 2701(7) (emphasis added).

For example, the denial of Appellants’ adoption petitions is premised solely upon the lack of unqualified consent by the existing legal parent.
