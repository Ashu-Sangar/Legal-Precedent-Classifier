    <p id="b773-10" data-blocks='[["BL_773.10",773,[188,1223,1157,572]]]'>This appeal presents our court with the difficult issue of whether a school district may, consistent with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, discipline a student for creating at home, and posting on the Internet, a web site that, <em>inter alia, </em>contained derogatory, profane, offensive and threatening statements directed toward one of the student’s teachers and his principal. We find that the school district did not violate the federal constitution by punishing the student for posting the web site in question. Thus, for the reasons stated below, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b773-11" data-blocks='[["BL_773.11",773,[187,1839,1153,408]]]'>In the spring of 1998, Appellant J.S. was an eighth grade student at Nitschmann Middle School, which is part of Appellee Bethlehem Area School District (“School District”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Sometime prior to May of 1998, J.S. created a web site on his home computer and posted it on the Internet. The web site was compiled on his own time. The site was not created as part of a school project and was not sponsored by the School District.</p>

      <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>The site was entitled “Teacher Sux.” It consisted of a number of web pages that made derogatory, profane, offensive and threatening comments, primarily about the student’s algebra teacher, Mrs. Kathleen Fulmer and Nitschmann Middle School principal, Mr. A. Thomas Kartsotis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The comments took the form of written words, pictures, animation, and sound clips.</p>
    <p id="b774-4" data-blocks='[["BL_774.4",774,[249,733,1164,583]]]'>At the outset, the web site contained a disclaimer. The disclaimer stated that “[b]y clicking,” i.e., entering, the site, the visitor agreed that, <em>inter alia, </em>the visitor would not tell any employees of the School District about the site, that the visitor was not a member of the School District’s “Staff,” and that the visitor would not disclose the web site to School District employees or administration, disclose the identity of the web site creator or intend to cause trouble for that individual. The disclaimer, however, did not prevent access to the web site and the site was not protected by a password. Thus, any visitor could access the site.</p>
    <p id="b774-5" data-blocks='[["BL_774.5",774,[250,1356,1161,364]]]'>Within the web site were a number of web pages. As noted above, certain of the web pages made reference to Principal Kartsotis. Among other pages was a web page with the greeting “Welcome to Kartsotis Sux.” Another web page indicated, in profane terms, that Mr. Kartsotis engaged in sexual relations with a Mrs. Derrico, a principal from another school, Asa Packer School.</p>
    <p id="b774-6" data-blocks='[["BL_774.6",774,[248,1761,1163,419]],["BL_775.1",775,[193,317,1155,417]]]'>The web site also contained web pages dedicated to Mrs. Fulmer. One page was entitled ‘Why Fulmer Should be Fired.” This page set forth, again in degrading terms, that because of her physique and her disposition, Mrs. Fulmer should be terminated from her employment. Another animated web page contained a picture of Mrs. Fulmer with images from the cartoon “South Park” with the statement “That’s right Kyle [a South Park character]. She’s a bigger b_ <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>than your mom.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Yet another web page morphed a picture of Mrs. Fulmer’s face into that of Adolph Hitler and stated “The new Fulmer Hitler movie. The similarities astound me.” Furthermore, there was a hand-drawn picture of Mrs. Fulmer in a witch’s costume. There was also a page, with sound, that stated “Mrs. Fulmer Is a B_, In D Minor.” Finally, along with the criticism of Mrs. Fulmer, a web page provided answers for certain math lessons.</p>
    <p id="b775-6" data-blocks='[["BL_775.4",775,[191,786,1157,640]]]'>The most striking web page regarding Mrs. Fulmer, however, was captioned, “Why Should She Die?” Immediately below this heading, the page requested the reader to “Take a look at the diagram and the reasons I gave, then give me $20 to help pay for the hitman.” The diagram consisted of a photograph of Mrs. Fulmer with various physical attributes highlighted to attract the viewers’ attention.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Below the statement questioning why Mrs. Fulmer should die, the page offered “Some Words from the writer” and listed 136 times “F_You Mrs. Fulmer. You Are A B__You Are A Stupid B__” Another page set forth a diminutive drawing of Mrs. Fulmer with her head cut off and blood dripping from her neck.</p>
    <p id="b775-10" data-blocks='[["BL_775.5",775,[190,1467,1156,365]]]'>Ultimately, students, faculty and administrators of the School District viewed the web site. J.S. told other students about the web site and showed it to another student at school. Other students viewed the web site. A Nitschmann Middle School instructor learned of the web site and reported its existence to Mr. Kartsotis. Mr. Kartsotis proceeded to view portions of the web site.</p>
    <p id="b775-11" data-blocks='[["BL_775.6",775,[191,1876,1153,202]]]'>Believing the threats to be serious, Mr. Kartsotis convened a faculty meeting. The members of the faculty were informed that there was a problem at the school. However, the teachers were not told of the specific nature of the situation.</p>
    <p id="b776-3" data-blocks='[["BL_776.3",776,[263,317,1161,258]]]'>
      <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>Furthermore, Mr. Kartsotis contacted local police authorities as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After investigation, both agencies identified J.S. as the creator of the site. However, the law enforcement agencies declined to file charges against J.S.</p>
    <p id="b776-4" data-blocks='[["BL_776.4",776,[261,602,1163,527]]]'>Also upon viewing the web site, Mr. Kartsotis, taking the threats seriously, informed Mrs. Fulmer of the existence of the site. After viewing the site, Mrs. Fulmer testified that she was frightened, fearing someone would try to kill her. Mrs. Fulmer suffered stress, anxiety, loss of appetite, loss of sleep, loss of weight, and a general sense of loss of well being as a result of viewing the web site. She suffered from short-term memory loss and an inability to go out of the house and mingle with crowds. Mrs. Fulmer suffered headaches and was required to take anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication.</p>
    <p id="b776-5" data-blocks='[["BL_776.5",776,[261,1156,1158,358]]]'>Furthermore, Mrs. Fulmer was unable to return to school to finish the school year. She applied for and was granted a medical leave for the 1998-99 school year because of her inability to return to teaching. As a result of Mrs. Fulmer’s inability to return to work, three substitute teachers were required to be utilized which disrupted the educational process of the students.</p>
    <p id="b776-6" data-blocks='[["BL_776.6",776,[260,1549,1160,411]]]'>The web site also had a demoralizing impact on the school community. Mr. Kartsotis explained, <em>inter alia, </em>that the effect of the site on Nitschmann Middle School caused the school to be at a low point that was worse than anything that he had encountered in forty years of education. Furthermore, the effect on the morale of the students and staff at Nitschmann Middle School was comparable to the death of a student or staff member.</p>
    <p id="b776-7" data-blocks='[["BL_776.7",776,[259,1995,1159,367]],["BL_777.1",777,[191,307,1151,147]]]'>During this time, J.S. continued to attend classes and participate in extra-curricular activities, including a band trip. The School District did not request that J.S. remove the site. Evidently, J.S., on his own, removed the web site approximately one week after Mr. Kartsotis became aware of the site. Moreover, the School District took no action to confront or to punish J.S. in any manner during the remainder of the school <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>year. Finally, the School District did not refer J.S. for any type of psychological evaluation and did not request that his parents have any such evaluation conducted.</p>
    <p id="b777-4" data-blocks='[["BL_777.4",777,[190,480,1152,675]]]'>However, after the end of the school year, on July 30, 1998, the School District sent a letter to J.S. and his parents informing them that it was aware of the web site and that it intended to suspend the student for three days. The letter asserted that J.S. violated School District policy through three Level III infractions: threat to a teacher, harassment of a teacher and principal, and disrespect to a teacher and principal, each resulting in actual harm to the health, safety and welfare of the school community. After a hearing on the suspension, the School District opted to extend the suspension to ten days, effective the beginning of the 1998-99 school year. Shortly thereafter, the School District began expulsion proceedings against the student.</p>
    <p id="b777-5" data-blocks='[["BL_777.5",777,[190,1180,1151,252]]]'>The expulsion hearings were conducted on August 19 and 26, 1998. However, by that time, the parents of J.S. had enrolled the student in an out-of-state school for the coming year. Thus, J.S. was unable to attend the August 26, 1998 hearing.</p>
    <p id="b777-6" data-blocks='[["BL_777.6",777,[187,1457,1154,727]]]'>The School District concluded that (1) the student’s statements: “Why Should [Mrs. Fulmer] Die?” and “give me $20 to help pay for the hitman” constituted a threat to a teacher and was perceived by Mrs. Fulmer and others as a threat; (2) the statements regarding Mr. Kartsotis and Mrs. Fulmer constituted harassment of a teacher and a principal; (3) the statements constituted disrespect to a teacher and principal resulting in actual harm to the health, safety, and welfare of the school community; (4) the School District Code of Conduct prohibited such student conduct and engaging in such action could result in expulsion; and (5) the statements caused an actual harm to Mrs. Fulmer, as well as to other students and teachers. As a result of these findings, the School District voted to expel J.S.</p>

The trial court affirmed. Thereafter, J.S. appealed to the Commonwealth Court. A three-member panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b778-4" data-blocks='[["BL_778.4",778,[245,533,1162,788]]]'>Specifically, a two-member majority of the court, in an opinion authored by Judge Jess S. Jiuliante, characterized the issue as whether a student may be disciplined for speech occurring off of school premises and communicated to others via the Internet. The court concluded that courts have permitted school officials to discipline students for conduct occurring off school premises where the conduct materially and substantially interferes with the educational process. The court pointed to the damaging effects on Mrs. Fulmer, Mr. Kartsotis and the school community and concluded that the school district did not violate J.S.’s First Amendment rights. Moreover, the majority noted that in this day and age where school violence is becoming more commonplace, school officials are justified in taking threats against faculty and students seriously.</p>
    <p id="b778-5" data-blocks='[["BL_778.5",778,[245,1346,1162,310]]]'>Judge Rochelle Friedman dissented. She concluded that the web site did not constitute a “true threat.” Furthermore, because in her opinion the web site only affected Mrs. Fulmer personally, there was no evidence of a material disruption of class work or substantial disorder as to place the speech “outside the protections of the First Amendment.”</p>
    <p id="b778-6" data-blocks='[["BL_778.6",778,[245,1689,1164,247]]]'>J.S. appealed to our court.

This diagram contains a picture of Mrs. Fulmer with lines drawn to various parts of the picture of her face. The diagram lists: hideous smile, a zit, puke green eyes, and asks if her hair is “a rug, or God’s Mistake?” Furthermore, immediately after asking why Mrs. Fulmer should die, the site lists “F_You Mrs. Fulmer. You Are A B__You Are A Stupid B___” 136 times on approximately two pages. The request for $20 to help pay for the hitman contains no address to which individuals should forward the funds.</p>

Mrs. Fulmer suffered severe mental and physical harm from viewing the site. Mrs. Fulmer was unable to finish the school year and took medical leave the next year.

The site made one viewer, “laugh” and made another viewer, “crack up.” Administrators from the school also responded to the web site. Mr. Kartsotis treated the site as a threat. Authorities were called, although no charges were filed. The School District did not segregate J.S. from the school population and permitted J.S. to go on an out-of town overnight school-<a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>sponsored band trip.

Rather, the statements regarding solicitation of a hitman and the questions as to why Mrs. Fulmer should die were stated unconditionally and unequivocally.

On the contrary, it appears that the disclaimer evidenced an intent that school faculty should not view the web site. Furthermore, there is no evidence that J.S. had made similar statements to Mrs. Fulmer on other occasions.

We believe that the web site, taken as a whole, was a sophomoric, crude, highly offensive and perhaps misguided attempt at humor or parody. However, it did not reflect a serious expression of intent to inflict harm. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the web site focused primarily on Mrs. Fulmer’s physique and disposition and utilized cartoon characters, hand drawings, song, and a comparison to Adolph Hitler. While Mrs. Fulmer was offended, certain others did not view it as a serious expression of intent to inflict harm. Indeed, the actions, or inaction, by the School District belies its assertion that the web site constituted a true threat. To allow J.S. to attend class and extracurricular activities, even if during an investigation, and to only commence discipline well after the conclusion of the school year, severely undermines the School District’s position that the web site contained a true threat. The lack of immediate steps <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>taken direetly against J.S., and the lack of immediate notification of his parents about the web site, for the extended time period that passed in this case, strongly counters against a conclusion that the statements made in the web site constituted true threats.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Thus, we hold that the web site did not contain true threats, as that term is defined by the prevailing case law.</p>

Des Moines Independent Community School District, </em><a href="/us/393/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="205" data-cite="393 U.S. 503" data-case-ids="11318417" data-case-paths="/us/393/0503-01">393 U.S. 503</a>, <a href="/us/393/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="393 U.S. 503" data-case-ids="11318417" data-case-paths="/us/393/0503-01">89 S.Ct. 733</a>, <a href="/us/393/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="207" data-cite="393 U.S. 503" data-case-ids="11318417" data-case-paths="/us/393/0503-01">21 L.Ed.2d 731</a> (1969)].” Majority op. at 869. I agree with the majority’s application of <em>Tinker </em>and the majority’s ultimate conclusion. However, in the course of reaching this conclusion the majority “hold[s] that where speech that is aimed at a specific school and/or its personnel is brought onto the school campus <em>or accessed at school by its originator, </em>the speech will be considered on-campus speech.” Majority op. at 865 (emphasis added). I believe this holding is overly broad and unnecessary to the resolution of this case.</p>
    <p id="b806-5" data-blocks='[["BL_806.5",806,[251,1682,1162,523]]]'>As the majority aptly points out, J.S. “facilitated the on-campus nature of the speech by accessing the web site on a school computer in a classroom, showing the site to another student, and by informing other students at school of the existence of the web site.” <em>Id. </em>at 865. In my view, these factors alone support the characterization of the speech as on-campus speech. However, the fact that a web site is merely <em>accessed at school by its originator </em>is an insufficient basis upon which to base a characterization of the speech as on-campus speech.</p>

    <p id="b807-4" data-blocks='[["BL_807.5",807,[189,374,1158,1284]]]'>I join the majority opinion. I think the question of whether the communications at issue amounted to a “true threat” is a close one, and one that reasonable jurists might disagree about. In light of the totality of the circumstances, including the targeted, violent and solicitous statements here concerning one particular teacher, there is something to be said for Mr. Chief Justice Zappala’s conclusion that the communications “constituted threatening statements which connote a serious expression of intent to inflict harm” which are entirely beyond First Amendment protection. This question, however, is an intensely factual one and, after much reflection, I am satisfied to join in Mr. Justice Cappy’s view of the matter. I do so because Justice Cappy’s analysis of this important question, as well as the question of whether the School District could otherwise punish J.S. for the communications — including Justice Cappy’s exposition of the constitutional standards and considerations that must govern our review — is analytically comprehensive and legally convincing. I also join in the majority opinion because I believe that it is important for this Court to decide eases by clear majority opinion whenever possible, and particularly where, as here, the case is heard upon discretionary appeal. <em>See U.S. Airways, Inc. v.
