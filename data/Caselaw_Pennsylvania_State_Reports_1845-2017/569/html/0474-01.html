Specifically, Appellant wanted to offer evidence that a week prior to this incident, after a night of drinking, Wright awoke in the middle of the night and asked Michael Hunter, “Did you rape me last night?” Appellant intimated that he wanted to use Wright’s prior rape allegation to discredit her testimony that she trusted Appellant because he was Hunter’s friend, by showing that she actually did not even trust Hunter.

First, the issues in the two actions were sufficiently similar. At both the Gagnon hearing and the criminal trial, Appellant sought to admit the same evidence of Wright’s prior rape allegation. Moreover, the admissibility of the prior rape allegation was sufficiently material given that Appellant sought to introduce the evidence as a means of <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>impeaching Wright’s testimony, which in both proceedings was the sole evidentiary basis presented by the Commonwealth to prove the rape and assault.

Appellant notes that during a criminal trial, the defendant is afforded a presumption of innocence and the prosecution bears the strong burden of proving its case “beyond a reasonable doubt,” whereas in a Gagnon hearing, the prosecution’s burden has been reduced to a mere “preponderance of the evidence.” <em>See Brown, </em><a href="/pa/503/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="503 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1785956" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0514-01">469 A.2d at 1373-74</a>. Thus, Appellant argues that applying an interlocutory ruling in a Gagnon hearing to a subsequent criminal trial lessens the prosecution’s burden at trial by not forcing the prosecution to prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant also asserts that the ultimate issues that the court must determine in Gagnon hearings and criminal trials are distinct. Appellant essentially argues that in a criminal trial, the issue is whether the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, whereas in a probation violation hearing the focus is on whether the conduct of the probationer indicates that probation has proven to be an effective vehicle to accomplish rehabilitation and a sufficient deterrent against future antiso<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>cial conduct. <em>See Commonwealth v.

An independent review of the record reveals that Appellant’s Gagnon hearing was held over the defense’s objection to continue the matter pending resolution of the criminal case on the substantive charges. During a hearing on the pending motion in limine, Appellant argued that he was not given the opportunity at the Gagnon hearing to fully research and articulate his arguments regarding the rape shield issue. Appellant states that "Judge Carpenter made his ruling under Rules 607, 608, and 404 [of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence], whereas the evidence was properly offered under Rule 613,” the rule for the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements. <em>See </em>Hrg.

The case, however, presents a broader and more substantial question of public policy: whether the Commonwealth should ever be authorized to invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel offensively to preclude relitigation of issues by an accused in a criminal trial. The decisions primarily relied upon by the lead are largely of tangential relevance to this question, since each involves the defensive use of issue preclusion by an accused against the Commonwealth, <em>see Commonwealth v.

In this regard, I note that courts which have disapproved such application of the doctrine have generally concluded that a criminal defendant’s constitutionally protected liberty interests outweigh the concerns of efficiency and finality that are typically invoked to support application of issue preclusion in the civil context. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Such departures frequently have consequences that may not be anticipated, not the least of which is the generation of additional litigation to determine the boundaries of the exception that is developed to address the particular situation at hand. This, of course, might be avoided if the issue were to be decided in a case in which a broader range of core concepts could be explored in the first instance. I also question whether it is truly best to preclude a trial court from considering the merits of a prior evidentiary ruling which has not been challenged on appeal in the context of a subsequent criminal trial, while then requiring the appellate courts to do just that. This would seem to have countervailing effects in terms of efficiency and finality that should be considered in their own right. Additional abstractions and incongruities are presented by the focus on the unappealed decision rendered in the prior case rather than upon a present determination of the court whose rulings are directly under consideration in the appeal.
