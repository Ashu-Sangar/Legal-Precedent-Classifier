Niemoezynski’s lease with Groner obligates him to pay real estate taxes on the property. In February 1998, appellees converted the premises from a women’s apparel shop to a brokerage office; renovations of the first floor included removal of dressing rooms, storage rooms, counters, carpeting, lighting, shelving and hanging fixtures, plus rewiring and installation of partition walls to create three offices. The renovations cost about $58,000. Before the renovation, the property’s fair market value was $136,200; its base assessment was $18,000. Alerted by appellees’ building permit, the Monroe County Tax Assessor raised the assessment value to $176,148, and notified appellees that the assessment had increased by 55%. Appellees appealed to the Board, which affirmed the assessor’s determination. Appellees appealed to the trial court, which heard the matter <em>de novo, </em>granted the appeal, and reduced the property’s fair market value and assessment to the prior amounts. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision of the learned trial court.</p>

Appellees counter the renovations were only cosmetic, converting the property from one use to another, but not increasing its value. They further assert the Tax Assessor viewed the grant of a building permit as an open door to investigate the renovations and engage in an illegal spot reassessment based on the value of the business within the property. A spot reassessment is “[t]he reassessment of a property or properties that is not conducted as part of a countywide revised reassessment and which creates, sustains or increases disproportionality among properties’ assessed values.” 72 P.S. § 5342.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
