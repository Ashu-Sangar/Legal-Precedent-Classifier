    <p id="b255-7" data-blocks='[["BL_255.7",255,[217,692,1158,890]]]'>This appeal arises from the denial of a request for expungement, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Child Protective Services Act, 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301, 6341 (hereinafter the “Act”). It presents the question of what standard should apply where a child experiences a serious injury resulting from an incident of corporal punishment and a determination must be made as to whether the injury resulted from abuse or accident. The Department of Public Welfare (hereinafter “DPW”) denied the expungement, applying a foreseeability standard and concluding that the injury resulted from abuse. The Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the DPW, finding that foreseeability alone was an insufficient basis to sustain a conclusion that the injury resulted from abuse rather than an accident. Although we do not endorse the standard articulated by the Commonwealth Court in this case, for the reasons that follow we affirm the decision granting the ex-pungement.</p>

Appellee is the mother of D.N. (Hearing Transcript, hereinafter “H.T.” at 6). On April 16, 1990, Appellee used a belt to administer corporal punishment to D.N. when she found D.N. writing on the walls of the apartment. (H.T. at 52). D.N. was six years of age at the time. D.N. attempted to evade the blows of the belt. As D.N. was running away the belt struck her in the eye. (H.T. at 53). She screamed that her eye hurt and Appellee immediately attended to D.N.’s injury. (H.T. at 60). When asked by the Hearing Examiner what specifically hit her in the eye, D.N. responded: “I don’t know, a belt buckle, I don’t know. I don’t remember.” (H.T. at 54). D.N. described the injury to her eye as follows: “It’s like how you rub your — you rub your finger in your eye. It’s like a burning instant.... Yeah, that’s how it feels like, like after you get finished rubbing it, like it’s itching. And it’s like — it itches, you know.” (H.T. at 55-6)</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[257,1763,1162,410]]]'>In addition to D.N., the only other witness presented at the hearing was Ms. Wilson, a DPW social worker. Ms. Wilson initially investigated the matter and filed the report of indicated abuse. The testimony of Ms. Wilson was limited to reading the reports she had prepared and filed in April and May of 1990, and describing her usual course of action when investigating reports of child abuse. Ms. Wilson had no independent recollection of the facts of this case. (H.T. at 13).</p>

Exhibit 1 contains the initial information <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>obtained by Ms. Wilson when the report of suspected child abuse was made to DPW. Exhibit 2 summarizes the additional information the investigator discovered; it closes with the conclusions and recommendations of Ms. Wilson. The reports reveal that Appellee took D.N. to a clinic three days after the initial incident, when D.N. complained of discomfort in her eye. At some time after the clinic visit, Appellee took D.N. to the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, where surgery was performed to remove blood accumulated in the eye. The diagnosis noted in the report is hypheremia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellee responded with concern for the child. The child believed the injury was an accident and was not afraid of her mother. There were no signs of previous abuse or neglect. The family home was neat, clean and well stocked, and family members were found to interact positively. D.N.’s school indicated appropriate behavior from D.N. in that setting. The report concluded that child abuse was indicated but no further action was anticipated by DPW. An indicated report of child abuse naming Appellee as the perpetrator was filed with the Child Line and Abuse Registry on May 31, 1990. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6338.</p>

In its adjudication, the Hearing Examiner made the predicate determination that, under the applicable section of the Act, a serious injury had occurred. The Act defines <em>Serious physical injury </em>as “[a]n injury that: (1) causes a child severe pain; or (2) significantly impairs a child’s physical functioning, either temporarily or permanently.” 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6303. Despite the testimony of D.N. that the pain was not severe, the Hearing Examiner adduced that D.N. had suffered a serious injury because surgery was required. The Hearing Examiner then turned to the question of whether the injury resulted from an accident or abuse. Although the Hearing Examiner accepted that <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>Appellee did not act intentionally in striking D.N. in the eye with the buckle of the belt, she dismissed the impact of Appellee’s intent. Rather, the Hearing Examiner focused on the foreseeable risk of harm attendant to the use of a belt with the buckle attached when administering corporal punishment. The important factor was the foreseeable risk that the child would take evasive action and injury would result as a natural consequence of that action. The report concludes: “There was a significant risk of serious bodily injury such as the possible loss of the eye when the Appellant [Appellee herein] attempted to administer corporal punishment with a belt bearing the buckle while the subject child was trying to dodge it.” (Adjudication of Hearing Examiner at p. 4). The DPW adopted the Hearing Examiner’s recommendation in toto, on December 26,1997.</p>

Appellants urge this court to reinstate the principle of foreseeability as the critical factor in reviewing child abuse cases where the assertion that the injury was accidental is at issue.

Appellee argues that distinguishing child abuse from accidental injury solely through the use of a foreseeability standard does not comport with the legislative definition of child abuse provided in the Act. Thus, Appellee believes that overruling <em>J.H. </em>was not in error. Alternatively, Appellee argues that if the foreseeability standard is to be followed, the events of this case do not satisfy that standard. Finally, Appellee asserts that the expunction should be sustained as Appellants failed to present substantial evidence to support an indicated report of abuse.</p>

The logical place to begin is with the definition of child abuse provided in the Act. At the time of the incident at issue child abuse was defined in pertinent part as: “Serious physical or mental injury which is not explained by the available medical history as being accidental____” 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6303. The Act, as it relates to this definition section, was amended in 1994, Dec. 16, P.L. 1292, No. 151, § 1, effective July 1, 1995; 1995, March 31, P.L. 985, No. 10 (Spec.Sess.

The amended <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>language states in relevant part: “The term ‘child abuse’ shall mean any of the following: (i) Any recent act or failure to act by a perpetrator which causes nonaccidental serious physical injury to a child under 18 years of age.” 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6303(b)(l)(i). Although this case arose prior to the amendment, we note that the current language of the statute continues to define child abuse in contrast to accident. The Act offers no further definition of accident. As the words of the statute do not offer sufficient clarification of the meaning of accident we must expand the scope of our inquiry.</p>

The need to prevent child abuse and to protect abused children from further injury is critical. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6302(a). The legislature sought to encourage greater reporting of suspected child abuse in order to prevent further abuse and to provide rehabilitative services for abused children and their families. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6302(b). The Act also establishes a statewide central registry for the maintenance of indicated and founded reports of child abuse, as identifying perpetrators of abuse serves to further protect children. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6331. Recognizing that identifying someone as a child abuser can profoundly impact that person’s reputation, the release of such information is advocated only in certain limited <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>venues. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6340 (reports of indicated and founded abuse identifying the perpetrator can be released to law enforcement, social work agencies, employers in child care services and other related venues). <em>See A.Y. v. Department of Public Welfare, </em><a href="/pa/537/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="537 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="775545" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0116-01">537 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/a2d/641/1148-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="641 A.2d 1148" data-case-ids="11296751,775545" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/1148-01,/pa/537/0116-01">641 A.2d 1148</a>, 1152 (1994). Finally, as related to our specific inquiry herein, the Act recognizes and offers no restriction on the existing rights of parents to use corporal punishment. 23 Pa.C.S. § 6302(c). Thus, any definition of accident must encompass the aims of preventing abuse, and identifying perpetrators of abuse, while simultaneously maintaining the acknowledged right of parents to exercise corporal punishment as a legitimate means of discipline.</p>

After investigation a report of indicated abuse was filed. J.H. appealed, arguing that the child did not suffer a serious injury, and that the injury was accidental, as it was unintentional.

Father was enjoying a regularly scheduled visitation with his sons when he discovered bruises on the six-year-old boy, Sean. Father took the boys for a medical examination where the physician informed him that the bruising may have been the result of child abuse. Father refused to return the boys to mother at the appointed time. Mother filed a writ of habeas corpus for return of the boys to her custody.

The investigation then goes in reverse in an effort to ascertain how and why that injury occurred. The most common initiation point is the administration of corporal punishment. Hon. Leonard P.

Rev. 983">36 Santa Clara L.Rev. 983</a> (1996). Any definition of child abuse that arises by defining that term in contrast to accident must incorporate the reality that corporal punishment is undertaken with intent. Corporal punishment at its core embodies intent to inflict pain. <em>See L.A.J., </em><a href="/a2d/726/1133-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="726 A.2d 1133" data-case-ids="11595085" data-case-paths="/a2d/726/1133-01">726 A.2d at 1136</a>. Thus, the legislature could never have meant the term accident to be defined within the Act by focusing solely on the intent of the perpetrator. The tension in resolving cases where a parent or guardian is accused of child abuse when an act of corporal punishment results in a serious injury must be acknowledged. Undoubtedly, the legislature recognized this dilemma when drafting the definition of child abuse at issue. To balance the competing objectives of protecting children from abuse while maintaining the parental right to use corporal punishment, the legal standard for differentiating abuse from accident must acknowledge some level of culpability by the perpetrator that his actions could reasonably create a serious injury to the child.
