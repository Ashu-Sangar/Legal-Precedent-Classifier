In the absence of precedent of this Court, the trial court based its decision on its understanding of Superior Court cases including <em>Karp </em>and <em>Terpak v. Terpak, </em><a href="/a2d/697/1006-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="697 A.2d 1006" data-case-ids="12021488" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/1006-01">697 A.2d 1006</a> (Pa.Super.1997). In <em>Karp, </em>the trial court entered an unallocated, tax-free award of $45,670 per month ($548,040 per year) for the support of wife and the parties’ four children. The <em>Karp </em>court performed a <em>Melzer </em>analysis with respect to the children’s needs, and based its award of alimony pendente lite, on the standard of living that was consonant with the husband’s significant disposable income. The Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s order in <em>Karp. </em>The decision in <em>Karp </em>led the trial court in the instant matter to conclude that in high-income cases, spousal support is to be determined based on a reasonable needs analysis. The court also considered <em>Terpak, </em>a matter in which the trial court based spousal support on the guideline formula even though husband’s monthly net income was more than $10,000 ($120,000 per year), which at the relevant time made this a high-income case. Pursuant to the formula, the trial court determined that the wife was entitled to support in the amount of $5,202.30 per month ($62,427.60 per year). However, it reduced that amount to $3,500 “upon its finding that [husband] was paying monthly premiums ($1,350) on an irrevocable life insurance trust established for the parties’ two emancipated children, [wife’s] retention of the marital residence at essentially no cost or expense, and the parties’ prior standard of living.” <em><a href="/a2d/697/1006-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="697 A.2d 1006" data-case-ids="12021488" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/1006-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/697/1006-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="697 A.2d 1006" data-case-ids="12021488" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/1006-01">at 1008</a>.

In the case before us, the trial <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>court viewed <em>Karp </em>and <em>Terpak </em>as irreconcilable decisions, and elected to follow <em>Karp </em>as precedent for applying a <em>Melzer </em>analysis in high-income spousal support cases. However, as the Superior Court notes, the issue in <em>Karp </em>was whether the support order was excessive, and the issue in <em>Terpak </em>was whether a deviation from the guidelines was appropriate considering the facts of the case. <em>Mascaro v. Mascaro, </em><a href="/a2d/764/1085-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="764 A.2d 1085" data-case-ids="11170057" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/1085-01">764 A.2d 1085</a>, 1087 (Pa.Super.2000). In neither case did the Superior Court address the specific issue presented by the instant matter, namely whether spousal support orders in high-income cases are based on the guideline formula or on the reasonable needs of the obligee. Therefore, although the trial court considered itself faced with inconsistent precedent, there was actually no direct precedent at all.</p>

Significantly, the court’s Order directing Husband to pay Wife $13,000 per month also requires that he pay through his company for Wife’s car insurance, car phone, fuel and automobile repair bills.

At an on the record proceeding on June 10, 1998, the trial court made clear that if Husband’s company were to cease providing benefits to the spouses of partners, this would be a proper basis for a petition to modify by Wife, and that under such circumstances it would consider adding back into Husband’s income the value of Husband’s individual perquisites.

The Superior Court noted that because the Domestic Relations Code provides that a court may order an obligor to pay health insurance premiums for his or her spouse or children, “this sum is properly included in the calculations of Husband’s income.” <em>Id. </em>at 397. We disagree. Section 4324 of the Domestic Relations Code provides that in addition to periodic support payments, the court shall order an obligor to provide health care coverage to a spouse where such coverage is available at no cost or at a reasonable cost as a benefit of employment. Section 4326(b) extends a similar obligation from a noncustodial parent to a child. Because the obligation to provide medical insurance to a spouse and child is in addition to the support obligation, it would be inequitable to include the value of the medical insurance benefit when calculating Husband’s income available for support. Accordingly, to the extent that <em>Calabrese </em>holds otherwise, we specifically reject the reasoning of that decision of the Superior Court. Therefore, the trial court properly excluded the value of the medical insurance benefit that Husband receives from his employer.</p>
