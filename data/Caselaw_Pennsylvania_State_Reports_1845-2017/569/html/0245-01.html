In May and June of 1986, six-year old M.S. was in the care of Appellant. In 1987, the Loudens were charged with endangering the welfare of children in connection with allegations of abuse of children in their care. None of the allegations in that case involved M.S. Prior to trial, the Commonwealth sought permission to videotape the testimony of three child witnesses, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5984, and to have this videotaped testimony presented at trial, or to have the children present live testimony via closed-circuit television, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5985(a). The trial court granted permission, and the Commonwealth presented the videotaped testimony of the child witnesses at trial. On May 8, 1988, the jury convicted the Loudens of endangering the welfare of children. The Loudens filed post-sentence motions, however, claiming that the statutory provisions that authorized the admission of the videotaped testimony violated their rights to face-to-face confrontation of witnesses, as guaranteed by Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitu<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>tion. The trial court agreed, declared the statutory provisions unconstitutional, and granted the Loudens a new trial. In September of 1989, the Commonwealth appealed the trial court’s ruling to this Court, which assumed jurisdiction and retained the case for the next five years. <em>See Commonwealth v.

M.S.’s mother had asked her on other occasions about possible abuse by the Loudens, but M.S. always denied that anything had occurred. This time, however, M.S. stated that Appellant had sexually abused her in 1986 when she stayed at the Loudens’ home. Based on this report, M.S. was interviewed by Susan Stockwell of Lebanon County Children and Youth Services on June 21, 1990. At this interview, M.S. related three separate instances of sexual abuse by Appellant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that took place while she was in Appellant’s care. Ms. Stockwell subsequently re-interviewed M.S. on June 26, 1990 and July 3, 1990. On July 2, 1990, Ms. Stockwell brought M.S. to meet with Detective Richard Radwanski of the Lebanon County District Attorney’s office. Detective Radwanski interviewed M.S., who repeated the allegations of abuse by Appellant. In August of 1990, M.S. underwent a psychiatric evaluation in connection with the alleged abuse. No further investigation was done on the case from August of 1990 until the filing of charges in July of 1994.</p>

When this Court rendered a decision in the Loudens’ child endangerment case, we upheld the grant of a new trial and the ruling that the statutory provisions at issue were unconstitutional, but did not render that opinion until March of 1994. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Upon remand of the Loudens’ child endangerment charges, the Commonwealth sought consolidation of that case with the charges arising from the alleged abuse of M.S. by Appellant. The trial court denied the Commonwealth’s motion to consolidate, holding that the Loudens’ child endangerment charges did not involve the same act or transaction as the allegations of sexual abuse of M.S., and that evidence in the child endangerment case would not be admissible in the trial of the charges involving M.S. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1127A(1).</p>

According to M.S.’s trial testimony, the abuse occurred while she was in the Loudens’ care in May and June of 1986, when she was six years old. For four years, however, M.S. made no report of the abuse. The Commonwealth therefore bears no responsibility for delay in charging Appellant with the crimes during this four-year period. The Commonwealth had no information that a crime had occurred until June of 1990, when M.S. first accused Appellant of having abused her four years earlier. From the time the Commonwealth concluded its investigation of M.S.’s allegations in August of 1990 until the filing of charges against Appellant in July of 1994, however, the Commonwealth admittedly was responsible for this period of delay, for the reasons previously described. There is, additionally, a <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>thirty-two month post-indictment period of delay from July of 1994 to March of 1997, which is attributable, in part, to the disposition of Appellant’s pre-trial motions. The significance of these discrete time periods is to show the difficulty in ascertaining how much responsibility the Commonwealth bears with respect to M.S.’s inability to recall certain details during her trial testimony, when there was an initial four-year period of delay not attributable to the Commonwealth’s actions and a thirty-two month post-indictment, pre-trial delay for which Appellant’s litigation strategy was partly responsible.</p>

Moreover, there were occasions where M.S.’s trial testimony differed from her testimony at the preliminary hearing in September of 1994 and from the reports prepared by Ms. Stockwell and Detective Radwanski based on what M.S. told them during their interviews of her in June and July of 1990.</p>

It is inherent in cases where sexual abuse of a child is at issue that the victim may be reluctant to bring charges, may be prevented from bringing charges by an abusive parent or guardian, or may be unable to articulate the circumstances surrounding the abuse in the same manner that would be expected of an adult victim. Our legislature has addressed these concerns unique to child sexual abuse cases by, among other measures, tolling the <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>limitations period for prosecution of these crimes until the child reaches eighteen years of age, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5552(c)(3). Underlying this legislative effort is the recognition that prosecution of child sexual abuse charges frequently involves problems with the victim’s memory or ability to communicate details of the abuse coherently at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> From this perspective, we cannot say that the inability of M.S. to recall certain details, her confusion in portions of her testimony and her contradiction of previous statements and preliminary hearing testimony was so extraordinary as to have undermined the reliability of the proceedings.</p>

Here, Appellant does not contend that M.S. would have testified favorably for his defense but was unable to do so due to her loss of memory. Instead, he argues only that his ability to impeach her testimony was impaired by her inability to remember specific details. Moreover, we cannot accept Appellant’s argument that M.S.’s responses of “I don’t recall” or “I don’t remember” to some questions on cross-examination deprived him of the ability to challenge her credibility to the jury. On the contrary, Appellant utilized these lapses of memory, along with inconsistencies between M.S.’s trial testimony and her previous statements regarding the alleged abuse, to convey to the jury the impression that M.S. may have imagined the abuse, or may have fabricated the charges <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>in order to gain attention.
