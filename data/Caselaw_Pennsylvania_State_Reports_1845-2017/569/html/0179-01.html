Kelley filed an Omnibus Pretrial Motion, which included a motion for <em>habeas corpus </em>relief. On October 15, 1999, the trial court conducted a hearing on the pretrial motion and remanded the case to the district justice for a hearing on the motion for <em>habeas corpus </em>relief. During the hearing, which occurred on November 15,1999, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of the victim; and she testified that Kelley regularly touched her breasts and vaginal area. She stated that this conduct began when she was seven or eight years old and continued until she was eleven years old. According to the victim, the abuse occurred approximately one to two times a week. She further testified that, on more than one occasion, Kelley inserted his fingers into her vagina and moved them up and down. The victim also stated that Kelley “kissed” her vagina “for a few minutes” on one occasion. (Notes of Testimony (N.T.) dated 11/15/99, at 16, 33.) At the conclusion of the hearing, the district justice bound over one count each of rape, statutory sexual assault, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, as well as forty-two counts each of sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, indecent assault, and endangering the welfare of children.</p>

The court dismissed these charges because it held that the Commonwealth had failed to present evidence of penetration when Kelley allegedly “kissed” the vagina of the victim. In addition, the court dismissed all remaining counts of sexual assault because the court concluded that proof of digital penetration could not support a <em>prima facie </em>case of sexual <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>assault.

Second, the majority concluded that evidence of digital penetration could support the forty-one <em>prima facie </em>cases of sexual assault.

      <em>Compare </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3124.1 <em>'with </em>Model Penal Code § 213.4 (Proposed Official Draft 1962). The definitions of some of the terms included in the crime of sexual assault contained in our statute, namely sexual intercourse and deviate sexual intercourse, are similar to, but not identical with, the definitions of those terms as used in the Model Penal Code. <em>Compare </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3101 <em>with </em>Model Penal Code § 213.0 (Proposed Official Draft 1962); <em>see also </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3101, Historical and Statutory Notes (stating § 3101 is similar to Model Penal Code § 213.0).
