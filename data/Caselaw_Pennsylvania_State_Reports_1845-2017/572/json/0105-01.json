        "text": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nChief Justice ZAPPALA.\nThe present appeal challenges- the denial of relief pursuant to Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition.\nIn 1980, Appellant, Robert Fisher, murdered his girlfriend, Linda Rowden, because she gave statements to the police implicating Fisher in the drug-related killing of Nigel Anderson. Appellant shot Rowden in public, in front of eyewitnesses, then drove to the apartment of a friend and told her he had shot Rowden because she was cooperating with the police in their investigation of Anderson\u2019s murder. Appellant fled to New York where he was apprehended seven years later, extradited to Pennsylvania, tried for Rowden\u2019s murder, convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to death in 1988. On direct appeal, this Court vacated the conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial, due to improper evidence introduced in the first trial. Commonwealth v. Fisher, 527 Pa. 345, 591 A.2d 710 (1991) (Fisher I).\nAppellant was retried in 1991, again convicted' of first-degree murder, and again sentenced to death. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction, but held that Appellant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because of improper admission of victim impact evidence. Commonwealth v. Fisher, 545 Pa. 233, 681 A.2d 130 (1996) (Fisher II).\nFollowing a third sentencing hearing, Appellant was again sentenced to death. On appeal, this Court affirmed the death sentence. Commonwealth v. Fisher, 559 Pa. 558, 741 A.2d 1234 (1999) (Fisher III).\nAppellant then filed a petition for post-conviction collateral relief. Counsel was appointed and filed an amended petition. Following a hearing, the PCRA court denied relief. This is the appeal from the denial of PCRA relief.\nAppellant asserts that all prior counsel were ineffective. In order to demonstrate entitlement to relief for a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel, Appellant would have to demonstrate: (1) that there is merit to the underlying claim; (2) that counsel had no reasonable basis for his or her conduct; and (3) that Appellant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the act or omission challenged, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. Commonwealth v. Meadows, 567 Pa. 344, 787 A.2d 312, 319 (2001). Moreover, the PCRA requires that the allegation of error has not been previously litigated or waived. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3). These standards govern our review of the issues raised by Appellant.\nAppellant raises fourteen issues. They are:\n1. \u201cWhether the learned trial judge erred by denying Fisher\u2019s amended petition for post conviction relief?\u201d\n2. \u201cWhether Appellant was denied a full and fair opportunity to develop and litigate his claims that prior counsel was ineffective, and was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process, where the trial court denied Appellant funds for investigation and mental health experts necessary to demonstrate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness?\u201d\n3. \u201cWhether the learned trial judge erred by not explaining to the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be connected to the crime itself and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal?\u201d\n4. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to present all mitigation evidence to the jury when the trial judge precluded Fisher from testifying that he did not commit the crime and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal?\u201d\n5. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation and due process during both the guilt and penalty phase, when the trial judge permitted hearsay allegations from the deceased regarding alleged assaults on the deceased by Fisher and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal?\u201d\n6. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by the prosecutor\u2019s numerous improper comments made during the closing arguments of the guilt phase and penalty phase?\u201d\n7. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process and effective assistance of counsel where counsel failed to object or seek remedial actions following the prosecutor\u2019s numerous improper comments made during his closing arguments and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal?\u201d\n8. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by the trial judge\u2019s erroneous instructions on \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 and whether all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim at all prior stages of these proceedings?\u201d\n9. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel where his attorney failed to object or otherwise challenge the court\u2019s failure to give an appropriate cautionary instruction on identification testimony and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal?\u201d\n10. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel where his attorney failed to investigate, develop, present and argue mitigating circumstances and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and' litigate this claim on direct appeal?\u201d\n11. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the defense of intoxication and counsel\u2019s failure to request such an instruction or object to its omission denied Fisher effective assistance of counsel and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal?\u201d\n12. \u201cWhether Fisher was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial when the court failed to dismiss jurors who were exposed to outside information regarding his case and whether all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim at all prior stages of these proceedings?\u201d\n13. \u201cWhether Fisher was entitled to post conviction relief from his conviction and sentence because of the cumulative effect of the errors contained in this petition and litigated in prior proceedings?\u201d\n14. \u201cWhether all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise the issues presented in Fisher\u2019s amended petition for post conviction relief at all prior stages of this case?\u201d\nWe will consider these issues seriatim.\nFirst, Appellant claims the PCRA court erred by denying his petition for post-conviction relief. As Appellant recognizes, this is the ultimate issue of this appeal, and depends on our resolution of the remaining thirteen issues.\nNext, Appellant claims he was denied a full and fair opportunity to develop and litigate his claims that prior counsel was ineffective, and was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process, where the trial court denied him funds for investigation and mental health experts necessary to demonstrate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. He relies in part on Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 70, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985) (stating that when a capital defendant\u2019s mental health is at issue, \u201cthe Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense.\u201d).\nAppellant\u2019s reliance on Ake is misplaced. The Court in Ake held that indigent defendants are entitled to cost-free access to psychiatric experts only in very limited circumstances where the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense was a significant factor at trial. In Ake, there was a defense of insanity, not, as Appellant is arguing, questions of mitigation relevant to a sentencing determination. In fact, Appellant is not even arguing he should have received public funds to engage a neuropsychological expert to aid his defense during the penalty phase of trial\u2014he claims it was error to deny public funds to engage a neuropsychological expert to aid him in a collateral proceeding to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\nThis Court recently held that \u201ca capital defendant is entitled to state-paid psychiatric assistance only where the assistance is needed to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s argument of future dangerousness, not to prove mitigating circumstances.\u201d Commonwealth v. Miller, 560 Pa. 500, 746 A.2d 592, 600 (2000) (citing Commonwealth v. Christy, 540 Pa. 192, 656 A.2d 877, 883 (1995)). The Miller Court went on to say: \u201cHere, future dangerousness was not an issue; therefore, appellant was not entitled to psychiatric assistance to prove the mental health mitigating circumstances. Nevertheless, appellant was provided with psychiatric assistance, and two mental health experts testified on his behalf during the penalty phase of his trial.\u201d Miller, 746 A.2d at 600. As in Miller, Appellant was provided with state-paid psychiatric assistance though future dangerousness was not an issue. See Fisher III, 741 A.2d at 1245. Unlike Miller, the psychiatrists selected by Appellant concluded that his capacity was not diminished on the day of the murder, and thus their reports were not helpful to his defense. Appellant was then provided funds to engage a third psychiatrist, who concluded that Appellant did not suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome or disorder. Now Appellant is urging that it was error to deny additional public funds to enable him to seek other psychiatric experts to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a collateral attack on his sentence. This claim is far too attenuated to have any credibility. As this Court stated recently, \u201ca defendant is not entitled to unlimited court-appointed experts until he finds one that renders the opinion he desires.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ches ter, 557 Pa. 358, 733 A.2d 1242, 1252 (1999) (citing Commonwealth v. Faulkner, 528 Pa. 57, 595 A.2d 28, 37 (1991)).\nAppellant next argues that the trial judge erred by failing to explain to the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be connected to the crime itself and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal. The mitigation presented at Appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing consisted largely of his military experience, wounds received in battle in Vietnam, and his record in prison since his incarceration on these charges. Although the jury had been instructed on the mitigating circumstance of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8), the jury asked the Court the following question during deliberations: \u201cDo mitigating factors have to correlate with [the] crime or can they have no correlation at all?\u201d N.T., 6/24/97 at 145, 147. In response, the judge re-read the statutory language. When defense counsel objected, the judge responded: \u201cI\u2019ve given the instruction, which gives the opportunity to decide that it goes with the offense or it doesn\u2019t go with the offense,\u201d id. at 150, essentially allowing jurors freedom in weighing mitigating evidence whether or not it was connected to the crime.\nThe United States Supreme Court reviewed 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8) in Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299, 308, 110 S.Ct. 1078, 108 L.Ed.2d 255 (1990), and held that the statutory language satisfies the dictates of the Eighth Amendment. Section 9711(e)(8) states that mitigating circumstances shall include: \u201cAny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\u201d\nIt was not erroneous to repeat this language in response to the jury\u2019s question. It is within the sound discretion of the judge to determine the scope of additional instructions to be given to a jury which has requested information so long as the additional charge is a correct statement of the law. Commonwealth v. Perkins, 473 Pa. 116, 373 A.2d 1076, 1084 (1977); see also Commonwealth v. Chambers, 546 Pa. 370, 685 A.2d 96, 106 (1996).\nAppellant\u2019s fourth claim is that he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to present all mitigation evidence to the jury when the trial judge precluded him from testifying he did not commit the crime and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal. Immediately before the killing, an eyewitness who had known Appellant for eleven years saw him riding with Rowden in her car. The other passenger in the car saw Appellant shoot the victim. Immediately after the killing, as he dumped Rowden\u2019s body on the sidewalk, Appellant explained to the bystanders that his \u201cwife,\u201d the victim, had just shot herself, a claim conclusively disproved by forensic evidence. Then Appellant drove to the home of a friend and told her he had just shot Rowden and why. Appellant subsequently fled the jurisdiction and eluded capture for seven years.\nThe PCRA court denied relief because this Court has held that a capital defendant has no constitutional right to testily to his innocence at the penalty phase of trial, citing Commonwealth v. Stokes, 532 Pa. 242, 615 A.2d 704 (1992). Appellant attempts to distinguish Stokes on the basis that the Stokes penalty-phase jury was the same body as the guilt-phase jury, whereas Appellant\u2019s penalty-phase jury was a new jury, not the same one which had decided his guilt. Nevertheless, the reasoning of Stokes applies in Appellant\u2019s circumstance as well: \u201ctestimony regarding appellant\u2019s guilt was no longer relevant at the sentencing phase. The appellant\u2019s testimony was properly limited to a consideration of the appropriate aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\u201d Stokes, 615 A.2d at 715.\nAppellant argues that Stokes is undermined by Commonwealth v. Meadows, 567 Pa. 344, 787 A.2d 312 (2001), whether or not the same jury is determining both guilt and penalty. Meadows referred to the concept of \u201cresidual doubt,\u201d whereby a jury which had any lingering or residual doubt about a defendant\u2019s guilt might minimize the damage by not sending him to his death. Meadows, 787 A.2d at 321. Meadows, however, did not undermine Stokes. Meadows held that trial counsel was not ineffective merely because he pursued a \u201cresidual doubt\u201d strategy during the penalty phase rather than a different, inconsistent, mutually exclusive penalty-phase strategy. Meadows does not stand for the proposition that penalty-phase counsel must employ a \u201cresidual doubt\u201d strategy, nor does it suggest that counsel might be deemed ineffective for failing to do so. We have said repeatedly that a petitioner is not entitled to relief because counsel\u2019s trial strategy was unsuccessful; when the course chosen was reasonable, counsel cannot be faulted for failing to pursue a different path. Chester, 733 A.2d at 1252-53. Speculation by hindsight that a different strategy might possibly have been successful is not the test which establishes ineffectiveness of counsel.\nAppellant\u2019s next argument is that he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation and due process during both the guilt and penalty phase, when the trial judge permitted hearsay allegations from the deceased regarding alleged assaults on the deceased by Appellant and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal. There is no merit to this contention.\nThis argument was litigated and decided in both Fisher II and Fisher III, and thus runs afoul of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3), which prohibits PCRA review of issues previously litigated. In Fisher II, this Court held that it was proper to allow introduction of the victim\u2019s hearsay statements to the police two days before her murder that Appellant had been assaulting and harassing her because she was cooperating with the police in connection with the Nigel Anderson murder investigation. The statements were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted by the declarant, but to establish her belief that this was the reason for Appellant\u2019s harassment. Thus the statements were admissible to establish the victim\u2019s state of mind, and the trial court admitted the statements with a cautionary instruction to that effect. The statements sup-\nported the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that the motive for Appellant\u2019s crime was retaliation for the victim\u2019s cooperation with the police or prevention of future cooperation. Fisher II, 681 A.2d at 138-39; Fisher III, 741 A.2d at 1242. As evidence of motive, the testimony was clearly relevant and admissible. Commonwealth v. Griffin, 511 Pa. 553, 515 A.2d 865 (1986). An appellant cannot obtain post-conviction review of claims previously litigated on appeal by alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel to support previously litigated claims. Commonwealth v. Bracey, 568 Pa. 264, 795 A.2d 935, 939 n. 3 (2001); Commonwealth v. Porter, 556 Pa. 301, 728 A.2d 890, 896 (1999); Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 554 Pa. 547, 722 A.2d 638 (1998); Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 720 A.2d 693, 703 (1998).\nThe next issue is whether Appellant was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by the prosecutor\u2019s numerous allegedly improper comments made during the closing arguments of the guilt phase and penalty phase and whether trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to object or seek remedial actions and for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal.\nThe \u201cnumerous improper comments\u201d alleged by Appellant are these. First, the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the credibility of Commonwealth witnesses and expressed his personal opinion about the evidence. N.T., 6/24/97, at 80; N.T., 8/27/91, at 146. Second, he allegedly expressed his personal opinion that the death penalty was required. N.T., 6/27/97, at 65. Third, he allegedly misled the jury that mitigating evidence must be connected to the crime and that mitigating circumstances had to exist at the time of the crime. N.T., 6/24/97, at 65, 80, 83-86. Fourth, he allegedly expressed his opinion that Appellant was just trying to fool the jury and wrongly told the jury that mercy and sympathy could play no part in their deliberations. N.T., 6/24/97, at 65, 82-85. Fifth, he allegedly made numerous improper references to the murder of Nigel Anderson. N.T., 6/24/97, at 66-70. Finally, the prosecutor allegedly tried to bolster the credibility of Commonwealth witnesses by referring to prior consistent statements, though such prior testimony had not been admitted into evidence. N.T., 6/24/97, at 80-81.\nComments by a prosecutor do not constitute reversible error unless the unavoidable effect of such comments would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant so they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict. Commonwealth v. Hackett, 558 Pa. 78, 735 A.2d 688, 696 (1999). The alleged erroneous remarks must be examined in light of the case as a whole and in the context of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\nAppellant\u2019s first allegation is that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of prosecution witnesses. When read in context, however, the remarks were not improper. The prosecutor was reviewing the testimony of several prosecution witnesses after Appellant\u2019s counsel had attacked their testimony, in an effort to counter the argument of defense counsel. Second, the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the death penalty was required was not a statement of personal opinion but argument that the Commonwealth had proved an aggravating factor and Appellant had proved no mitigating factor, in which case imposition of the death penalty is statutorily required. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv). \u201cAt the penalty phase, where the presumption of innocence is no longer applicable, the prosecutor is afforded even greater latitude.\u201d Hackett, 735 A.2d at 696-97. Third, as to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged attempt to mislead the jury that mitigating circumstances had to exist at the time of the crime, the argument cannot be read as an attempt to mislead the jury, but only as disparaging, yet fair, comment on Appellant\u2019s presentation of his good prison behavior record as evidence in mitigation. Fourth, the prosecutor did not tell the jury that mercy and sympathy could not be considered, but only that a defendant was not entitled to an instruction that the jury may consider feelings of sympathy and mercy, which was a correct statement of the law. Inasmuch as the court properly instructed the jury as to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8), there was no error. Finally, the references to Nigel Anderson were based on the evidence in this case and were in no way improper.\nNext, Appellant argues that he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by the trial judge\u2019s erroneous instructions on reasonable doubt and that all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim at all prior stages of these proceedings. He objects specifically to two examples given by the trial judge to express the concept of reasonable doubt. First, the trial judge explained that prior to deliberations, a juror has reasonable doubt because he has not yet had a chance to deliberate. Once a juror has heard the evidence and deliberated, he may go beyond reasonable doubt and reach a verdict. Second, the judge used the example of a parent weighing the advantages of placing a child in a private school rather than public school. The judge described the point at which the parent reaches a decision as the point where he overcomes reasonable doubt.\nA jury charge must be read as a whole, and will not be reviewed by taking isolated comments out of context. Commonwealth v. Gibson, 553 Pa. 648, 720 A.2d 473, 481 (1998); Commonwealth v. Smith, 548 Pa. 65, 694 A.2d 1086, 1092-93 (1997).\nThe court\u2019s charge was as follows:\nAlthough the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every charge, this does not mean that the Commonwealth must prove it beyond all doubt or to a mathematical certainty or to a hundred percent or beyond a peradventure of doubt or any other untoward and impossible burden, nor must the Commonwealth demonstrate the complete impossibility of innocence.\nNow, what is reasonable doubt? A reasonable doubt, a word that I have used throughout this charge, is a doubt that would cause a reasonably careful and sensible person to pause and hesitate before acting upon a matter of importance in his or her own affairs. Let me repeat it. A reasonable doubt is a doubt that would cause a reasonably careful and sensible person to hesitate before acting upon a matter of importance in his or her own affairs.\nLet me put it in a civil context for you. Suppose you and your wife, you and your husband were arguing back and forth whether or not to send a child of yours to private school, sending your child to private school at considerable havoc to your personal budget, and if you did send this child to a private school, it would be a considerable inconvenience to you and sacrifice. And you were arguing back and forth as to the pluses of going to private school, small classes, individual attention, ability to participate in all of the activities and maybe the greater demands and more personal instructions versus a wider distribution of persons from all areas of the community versus the better equipment that may be provided by the public tax dollars and, perhaps, the ability to get rubbed up a little bit with all levels of society ' versus not so. And suppose, after discussing this with your \u25a0wife or your husband, as the case may be, after two weeks, you really didn\u2019t make any determination whether you wanted to send the kid to private school or not. But suppose you continued on this discourse and you talked about it for another two weeks. And suppose after two weeks had transpired, you came to the firm conclusion that it was more advantageous to send this child to private school, even though it was going to cause some havoc to your personal budget but that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages and you were firmly committed to send this child to private school. It was at this point in this very important decision in your own private lives that, after great logic, reasoning and rationale and everything else being applied to this particular problem, that you came to the firm conclusion that you were going to send this child to private school. It would be at that point, after you had come to that firm conclusion, you had done something about it, that you would have gone beyond reasonable doubt.\nSo, to summarize, you may not find the Defendant guilty based on a mere suspicion of guilt. The Commonwealth has the burden of proving the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If it meets that burden, then the Defendant is no longer presumed to be innocent and you should find him guilty. On the other hand, if the Commonwealth does not meet its burden, then you should find him not guilty.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s burden, as I said, is to prove the Defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but it does not mean that the Commonwealth must prove the utter impossibility of the Defendant\u2019s innocence or the Defendant\u2019s guilt to a mathematical certainty, nor must it prove the Defendant\u2019s guilt beyond all doubt. The Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that the Commonwealth must prove the Defendant\u2019s guilt to a moral certainty.\nA reasonable doubt can not be fancied or conjured up in the minds of the jury, as I said, to escape an unpleasant duty. It must be an honest doubt arising from the evidence, itself, the kind of doubt that would restrain a reasonable man from acting in a matter of importance to himself or herself, a reasonable woman.\nN.T., 8/28/91, at 20-25. Viewing the lengthy charge on reasonable doubt as a whole, it clearly and accurately stated the law, and there was no error. Counsel, therefore, cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object or to raise this issue in prior proceedings.\nAppellant\u2019s ninth claim is that he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel where his attorney failed to object or otherwise challenge the court\u2019s failure to give an appropriate cautionary instruction on identification testimony and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal. He claims that Commonwealth identification witness Frieda Sambrick failed to identify Appellant at a lineup. Trial counsel attacked her in-court identification, but did not request a Kloiber instruction to the effect that her identification testimony must be received with caution.\nThis issue has been fully and finally litigated. In Fisher II, 681 A.2d at 141-42, this Court dealt with Sambrick\u2019s identification at length, concluding that her failure to identify Appellant in a pre-trial line-up was not due to lack of recognition but rather to her fear that identifying Appellant, whom she had known for eleven years, would endanger her and her family. \u201c[A] petitioner cannot obtain post-conviction review of claims previously litigated by alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel and presenting new theories of relief to support previously litigated. claims.\u201d Bracey, 795 A.2d at 939 n. 2; Porter, 728 A.2d at 896.\nNext, Appellant claims that he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel where his attorney failed to investigate, develop, present, and argue mitigating circumstances and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal. He alleges that counsel should have investigated, among other things, \u201cFisher\u2019s family relationships, childhood, upbringing, incidences of abuse or neglect, education, injuries, diseases, psychological condition, marital status, etc.,\u201d and that failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance. Brief for Appellant at 44. We are not convinced that to meet the minimal constitutional standard of effectiveness, counsel must thoroughly investigate all the specified areas and other unspecified areas, as Appellant argues.\nAt his third sentencing hearing, Appellant testified at length about his childhood, education, military service, wounds, Purple Heart awarded personally by President Johnson, drug abuse to counter the pain from his military wounds, exemplary work history in prison, and treatment by psychologists and psychiatrists. Counsel requested and received state funds to employ a private investigator to aid his investigation, and counsel personally pursued leads suggested by Appellant. At the evidentiary hearing before the PCRA court, Appellant\u2019s counsel testified that Appellant instructed him he did not want any of his family members to testify.' Counsel who represented Appellant at his first two sentencing hearings also testified that Appellant told him he did not want his family to testify.\nCounsel cannot be deemed ineffective for following his client\u2019s instructions. Commonwealth v. Taylor, 553 Pa. 144, 718 A.2d 743, 745 (1998); Commonwealth v. Sam, 535 Pa. 350, 635 A.2d 603, 611-12 (1993). Appellant did not present anything at the PCRA evidentiary hearing which would have produced a different result at his third sentencing hearing. Counsel cannot be faulted for failing to discover or present evidence if Appellant fails to meet the burden of establishing that the evidence exists. Commonwealth v. Morris, 546 Pa. 296, 684 A.2d 1037, 1045 (1996); Commonwealth v. Pettus, 492 Pa. 558, 424 A.2d 1332, 1335 (1981). We find no merit in this issue, and counsel cannot be deemed ineffective.\nAppellant\u2019s next argument is that he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the defense of intoxication, and counsel\u2019s failure to request such an instruction or object to its omission denied Appellant effective assistance of counsel, and appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim on direct appeal.\nThe issue of Appellant\u2019s intoxication has been fully and finally litigated. In Fisher III, 741 A.2d at 1246-47 (citation omitted), this Court stated:\nFinally, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence that Appellant\u2019s intoxicated state at the time of the murder resulted in his inability to fully appreciate the nature of his acts. We disagree. At the post-trial motion hearing, Appellant testified that he consumed a number of drugs on the day of the murder, including heroin and methamphetamine. The Sentencing Code permits a defendant to prove as a mitigating circumstance that his \u201ccapacity ... to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(3).\nDespite Appellant\u2019s claim that he was in a \u201cdrug-induced frenzy,\u201d two expert reports solicited by prior defense counsel indicated that Appellant\u2019s capacity was not diminished on the day of the murder. Counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue a claim of diminished capacity where the psychiatric records indicate that that theory was unsupportable. Moreover, at the post-trial motion hearing, Appellant\u2019s counsel testified that Appellant continued to maintain his innocence even during the penalty phase. N.T. 1/20/98 at 29-30. Clearly, presenting evidence regarding Appellant\u2019s inability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct would have been inconsistent with Appellant\u2019s claim of innocence.\nA petitioner cannot obtain post-conviction review of claims previously litigated by alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel and presenting new theories of relief to support previously litigated claims. Bracey; Porter.\nAppellant next claims that he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair penalty hearing when the court failed to dismiss jurors who were exposed to outside information regarding his case and that all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise and litigate this claim at all prior stages of these proceedings. He alleges that a potential juror, Kevin Kulp, discussed outside knowledge of Appellant\u2019s case with two other potential jurors, Kristen Murphy and Jennifer Feulner. Kulp was dismissed for cause. Murphy and Feulner were not.\nThe trial court questioned Murphy and Feulner during voir dire regarding their discussions with Kulp. Murphy described Kulp\u2019s remarks about the case, and stated that she would pay no attention to what he said. Asked whether she had formed a fixed opinion about the sentence to be imposed, she answered, \u201cI know nothing about the details. I couldn\u2019t form an opinion either way.\u201d N.T. Voir Dire, 6/19/97, at 145-48. Feulner, likewise, was questioned about Kulp\u2019s influence. She recalled nothing Kulp said specifically, and also said she would be impartial. The test for determining whether a prospective juror should be dismissed for cause is whether he or she is willing and able to eliminate the influence of any knowledge of the case and render a verdict according to the evidence, and this is to be determined on the basis of demeanor as well as the answers to the questions. Commonwealth v. Bridges, 563 Pa. 1, 757 A.2d 859, 873 (2000). Based on the record in this case, there is no indication that Appellant was denied a fair and impartial jury at his third sentencing.\nAppellant argues that he was entitled to post-conviction relief from his conviction and sentence because of the cumulative effect of the errors contained in this petition and litigated in prior proceedings. He cites no Pennsylvania cases to support his proposition of cumulative ineffectiveness. We find no merit in his argument. Commonwealth v. Rompilla, 554 Pa. 378, 721 A.2d 786, 795 (1998) (where individual claims of error fail for lack of merit, there could be no cumulative prejudicial effect when there was no harm in the first place).\nAppellant\u2019s final argument is that all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise the issues presented in Fisher\u2019s amended petition for post-conviction relief at all prior stages of this case.\nThis blanket allegation of layered ineffectiveness is necessary to preserve issues for review when they would otherwise be deemed waived pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9543(a)(3) and 9544(b). See Commonwealth v. Miller, 746 A.2d at 598 n. 3 (citing Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 536 Pa. 244, 639 A.2d 9 (1994)). As we have found no merit in the underlying issues or that the claims have been previously litigated, there is no basis for a finding of ineffectiveness. Commonwealth v. Basemore, 560 Pa. 258, 744 A.2d 717, 738 (2000).\nReturning to the first yet ultimate issue stated by Appellant, he claims the PCRA court erred by denying his petition for post-conviction relief. Based on our thorough review of the record and Appellant\u2019s arguments, we hold that it was not error to deny post-conviction relief.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the PCRA court is affirmed.\nJustice CAPPY, Justice NIGRO and Justice SAYLOR file concurring opinions.\nJustice CASTILLE files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justice EAKIN joins.\n. Post Conviction Relief Act. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\n. This Court directly reviews the denial of post-conviction relief in death penalty cases. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d).\n. But see Miller, (Saylor, J., concurring) (\"It might be an abuse of discretion for a trial court in a capital case to deny psychiatric funding in a broader array of circumstances, to insure that an indigent defendant. is provided core resources necessary to present a full and fair defense in all phases of capital litigation.\u201d).\n. Imposition of tine death penalty requires a unanimous jury. Aggravating circumstances must be found unanimously by the entire jury. Commonwealth v. Jermyn, 551 Pa. 96, 709 A.2d 849 (1998). Mitigating circumstances, on the other hand, may be found individually and personally by single jurors. Id; Commonwealth v. Begley, 566 Pa. 239, 780 A.2d 605, 644 (2001).\n. Commonwealth v.

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nAlthough I concur in the result, I believe that certain of Appellant\u2019s claims warrant additional elaboration.\nIn this regard, Appellant challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s use of an example to illustrate reasonable doubt, specifically, a husband and wife arguing over the advantages and disadvantages of enrolling their child in a private school. The analogy concludes with the trial court explaining that, if after weighing the various concerns, you decide to send the child to private school, \u201c[i]t would be at that point, after you had come to that firm conclusion, you had done something about it, that you would have gone beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d I recognize that the trial court has broad discretion in phrasing its instructions, provided that, upon review of the charge as a whole, it clearly, adequately and accurately informs the jury on the law. See Commonwealth v. Prosdocimo, 525 Pa. 147, 150, 578 A.2d 1273, 1274 (1990). Here, however, the illustration attempted to draw a parallel between making a future personal decision and deciding whether facts offered by the Commonwealth surrounding a past incident were sufficiently proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Apart from the fact that such analogy was inapt, it suggested a preponderance of the evidence weighing process, obfuscating the applicable burden of proof. While the Court has not prescribed a particular charge on reasonable doubt, see Commonwealth v. Williams, 432 Pa. 557, 561, 248 A.2d 301, 303 (1968) (plurality opinion), the subcommittee note following the suggested instruction indicates that it is \u201cintentionally brief,\u201d as a more elaborate definition may confuse a jury. See Pa. SSJI (Crim) 7.01 subcomm. note (citing Commonwealth v. Del Giorno, 303 Pa. 509, 154 A. 786 (1931)).\nSignificantly, other jurisdictions have cautioned against the use of analogies or illustrations to explain reasonable doubt, reasoning that such examples tend to mislead the jury, trivialize its responsibility, and understate the burden of proof. See generally United States v. Pinkney, 551 F.2d 1241, 1244 & n. 9 (D.C.Cir.1976) (collecting cases). Moreover, most people do not make private decisions based upon a reasonable doubt standard, see generally Commonwealth v. Ferreira, 373 Mass. 116, 364 N.E.2d 1264 (1977), as \u201c[djeciding the wisdom of future action involves a different type of judgment than that used in deciding whether something did or did not happen.\u201d Bumpus v. Gunter, 452 F.Supp. 1060, 1062 (D.Mass.1978). Indeed, individuals often have minimal information upon which to base important future decisions, and nevertheless act despite reasonable doubts. See generally Robert C. Power, Reasonable and Other Doubts: The Problem of Jury Instruc tions, 67 Tenn. L.Rev. 45, 80 (1999). A jury may also be inclined to accord undue weight to an example, finding it easier to understand, and, during deliberations, may simply compare a defendant\u2019s conduct with the example. See generally State v. Cruz, 33 Conn.App. 849, 639 A.2d 534, 538 (1994) (citing People v. Shepherd, 63 Mich.App. 316, 234 N.W.2d 502 (1975)). In light of such authority, therefore, I would conclude that Appellant\u2019s claim is of arguable merit.\nWith respect to prejudice, Appellant argues that errors involving the reasonable doubt standard can never be harmless. See Commonwealth v. Bishop, 472 Pa. 485, 491, 372 A.2d 794, 797 (1977); Commonwealth v. Salameh, 421 Pa.Super. 320, 326, 617 A.2d 1314, 1317 (1992). While such assertion may be accurate as a matter of direct review, in this case, the claim is presented in the form of a collateral attack and governed by an ineffectiveness standard. Appellant must therefore demonstrate that counsel\u2019s omission, namely, his failure to object, had an actual adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings, that is, that there is a reasonable probability the verdict would have been different absent counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness. See Commonwealth v. Howard 538 Pa. 86, 99-100, 645 A.2d 1300, 1307-08 (1994) (differentiating the harmless error standard on direct appeal from prejudice in collateral review and explaining that \u201cit is not axiomatic that what can never be harmless error by the trial court equates to ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d). Here, although the use of an illustration, in my view, constituted error, the court provided correct definitions of reasonable doubt both prior to and following the example, and the evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt was compelling. Thus, I would conclude that Appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice sufficient to entitle him to relief.\nMy remaining concern is with respect to Appellant\u2019s claim that appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to raise as an issue the trial court\u2019s ruling precluding evidence of residual doubt during the re-sentencing proceeding. Appellant argues that such ruling violated his constitutional right to testify and to present evidence in mitigation. The majority resolves this issue by noting that a capital defendant does not have a constitutional right to testify to his innocence in the penalty phase of a trial, see Commonwealth v. Stokes, 532 Pa. 242, 263, 615 A.2d 704, 715 (1992) (plurality opinion), and that Appellant is not entitled to relief merely because counsel\u2019s strategy at the sentencing proceeding was unsuccessful.\nAs trial counsel attempted to introduce evidence of residual doubt, and the claim is directed at appellate counsel\u2019s effectiveness for failing to pursue such issue on appeal, I do not believe that the issue should be dismissed as one implicating reasonable trial strategy. I recognize, nevertheless, that the United States Supreme Court has ruled that a capital defendant does not have a constitutional right to have the jury instructed on residual doubt, see Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 US. 164, 172-73, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 2327, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (1988) (plurality opinion), reasoning that such doubts do not implicate a defendant\u2019s character, record, or the circumstances of the offense, and a constitutional right to rely upon residual doubts is \u201carguably inconsistent with the common practice of allowing penalty-only trials on remand of cases where a death sentence\u2014but not the underlying conviction\u2014is struck down on appeal.\u201d See id. at 173 & n. 6, 108 S.Ct. at 2327 & n. 6. The plurality in Franklin did not explain why, as a matter of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, residual doubts do not implicate the circumstances of the offense. Similarly, in Stokes, a plurality of this Court, without elaboration, deemed testimony in the penalty phase regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt irrelevant. See Stokes, 532 Pa. at 263, 615 A.2d at 715. I would not, however, treat such authority as foreclosing consideration of this issue on other grounds.\nIn this regard, the text of the catch-all mitigator provides:\n(e) Mitigating circumstances.-Mitigating circumstances shall include the following:\n(8) Any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). In contrast to the statutory language introducing aggravating circumstances, which states that such circumstances \u201cshall be limited to the following,\u201d see 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9711(d), the list of mitigating circumstances is not prefaced with similarly limiting language. Of additional significance, Section 9711(a)(2) of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(2), provides that \u201cevidence may be presented as to any other matter that the court deems relevant and admissible on the question of the sentence to be imposed.\u201d Id.; see also Commonwealth v. Means, 565 Pa. 309, 324-25, 773 A.2d 143, 152-52 (2001) (plurality opinion) (concluding that, pursuant to Section 9711(a)(2), relevant evidence is not limited to statutory aggravators and mitigators).' Notwithstanding the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment interpretation, as a matter of statutory interpretation, I believe that, at least in certain instances, evidence of residual doubt may be viewed as constituting a circumstance of the offense, and, in any event, such evidence is arguably admissible as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance. Cf. United States v. Davis, 132 F.Supp.2d 455, 464, 468 (E.D.La.2001) (permitting residual doubt evidence to be introduced at defendants\u2019 re-sentencing hearing as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance under the federal death penalty statute). Moreover, a number of the statutory aggravators directly implicate a defendant\u2019s guilt or culpability, for example, whether the killing was committed while in the perpetration of a felony. Consequently, depending upon the nature of the aggravator, a defendant\u2019s testimony concerning his role in committing the offense could be relevant. In addition, residual doubt concerning a defendant\u2019s culpability following, for instance, an unsuccessful claim of self-defense may be perceived as qualitatively different than that associated with a disbelieved alibi. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that residual doubt may be an effective mitigator, see Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 181, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 1769, 90 L.Ed.2d 137 (1986), and this Court has similarly acknowledged that emphasis of residual doubt may constitute a reasonable penalty-phase strategy. See Commonwealth v. Meadows, 567 Pa. 344, 359, 787 A.2d 312, 320-21 (2001) (plurality opinion).\nOther jurisdictions have been divided on the issue. Although state courts tend to deem evidence of residual doubt irrelevant, some courts (most notably federal courts) permit consideration, while others decline to instruct the jury on residual doubt, but allow arguments respecting the issue. In my view, Appellant\u2019s claim implicates issues of statutory interpretation, public policy, and consideration as a matter of Pennsylvania Constitutional jurisprudence, which are best addressed upon proper framing and full briefing by the parties. Other than asserting federal constitutional guarantees, however, Appellant\u2019s argument focuses upon an alleged inconsistency between the Court\u2019s decisions in Stokes and Meadows. Further, to the extent that reliance upon residual doubt is to be permitted in the penalty phase of a capital case, reasonable limitations are implicated, since, having established a defendant\u2019s guilt, the Commonwealth should not be compelled to reestablish it for purposes of sentencing, particularly, where, as here, the case has been remanded for a re-sentencing hearing. See generally Buford v. State, 403 So.2d 943, 953 (Fla.1981) (stating that, \u201c[a] convicted defendant cannot be \u2018a little bit guilty[;]\u2019 [i]t is unreasonable for a jury to say in one breath that a defendant\u2019s guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and, in the next breath, to say someone else may have done it, so we recommend mercy\u201d). Here, I do not view the direct testimony of Appellant to the effect that he did not commit the crime as the type of residual doubt presentation that should be permitted, particularly in the context of a re-sentencing, as it would have the effect of requiring a re-trial of the guilt phase.\nMoreover, I do not believe that Appellant has demonstrated prejudice as a result of the trial court\u2019s limitation. At the PCRA hearing, trial counsel acknowledged Appellant\u2019s desire to testify at the re-sentencing that he did not commit the crime; however, counsel also explained that he sought to, inter alia, challenge the aggravating circumstance by arguing that Appellant did not kill the victim because she was a Commonwealth witness, but rather, that the victim was Appellant\u2019s girlfriend, and that the killing occurred because of a lover\u2019s quarrel. As such argument would have been inconsistent with Appellant\u2019s testimony that he did not commit the crime, the trial court\u2019s ruling would appear to have enhanced the viability of the defense theory concerning this aggravator.\n. Although the District Court in Bumpus determined that the use of an analogy by the state court judge in his jury instructions amounted to a constitutional error, but that the error was harmless, the Court of Appeals disagreed with this analysis, concluding that, while the illustration was flawed and while the jurors may have been confused, the error did not deprive the defendant of due process. See Bumpus v. Gunter, 635 F.2d 907, 913 (1st Cir.1980).\n. 11 is also noteworthy that the plurality in Franklin observed that even if a right to present residual doubt evidence were discerned from the Eighth Amendment, no limitation had been placed upon the defendant in arguing residual doubts to the sentencing jury, and the jury was not precluded from consideration of such issue. See id. at 174, 108 S.Ct. at 2327.\n. In a concurring opinion, Justice O\u2019Connor, joined by Justice Black-mun, reasoned that such doubt is not a fact about the circumstances of the offense, but rather, \u201ca lingering uncertainty about facts, a state of mind that, exists somewhere between 'beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 and 'absolute certainty,\u2019 \u201d and that there is no requirement of proof of guilt to an absolute certainty for purposes o\u00ed imposing the death penalty. Id. at 188, 108 S.Ct. at 2335 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).\n. Although I do not subscribe to an open-ended construction of Section 9711, see id. at 326, 773 A.2d at 160 (Saylor, J., concurring), the Court\u2019s rulings permitting the introduction of non-statutory aggravation evidence in Means and Commonwealth v. Trivigno, 561 Pa. 232, 254, 750 A.2d 243, 254 (2000) (plurality opinion), support similar allowance with respect to evidence in mitigation.\n. Indeed, the catch-all mitigator was added to expand the scope of evidence that could be presented in mitigation. See Legis. J.\u2014Senate at 722 (Jun. 26, 1978).\n. Certain of the miligators also bear upon guilt or culpability related to a defendant's mental state. See, e.g., 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2), (3).\n. Such evidence has also been described as \"the most powerful \u2018mitigating\u2019 fact.\u201d Stephen P. Garvey, Aggravation and Mitigation in Capital Cases: What do Jurors Think?, 98 Colum L.Rev 1538, 1563 (1998) (analyzing data from interviews of jurors in forty-one capital cases).\n. See, e.g., Preston v. State, 607 So.2d 404, 411 (Fla.1992); State v. Josephs, 174 N.J. 44, 803 A.2d 1074, 1116-17 (2002); Evans v. State, 112 Nev. 1172, 926 P.2d 265, 284-85 (1996); State v. Fletcher, 354 N.C. 455, 555 S.E.2d 534, 544 (2001); State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, 1122-23 (1997).\n. See, e.g., Davis, 132 F.Supp.2d at 458-62 (collecting cases); State v. Hartman, 42 S.W.3d 44, 59 (Tenn.2001).\n. See, e.g., People v. Cox, 53 Cal.3d 618, 280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351, 384 (1991); cf. Shelton v. State, 744 A.2d 465, 495-96 (Del.1999) (permitting defendant to discuss or argue in allocution facts respecting guilt).\n. Notably, there was no formal offer of proof as to Appellant\u2019s testimony-\n. While there may be practical reasons for differentiating re-sentencing proceedings on this basis, 1 would not necessarily craft a general rule on such grounds, since it may also be argued that a defendant should not lose the benefit of any residual doubts because, through no fault of his own, an error occurred at the initial proceeding. However, it is also significant that, although the defendant in a re-sentencing proceeding \"may lose whatever advantage inheres in the 'residual doubts\u2019 that the original jury may have had regarding [his] guilt, the [Commonwealth] may also lose whatever 'advantage' inheres in the emotional impact that often surrounds the initial guilt phase.\" State v. Biegenwald, 106 N.J. 13, 524 A.2d 130, 160 (1987) (citations omitted).",

I also join in the ultimate mandate affirming the denial of PCRA relief. However, I respectfully dissent from the lead\u2019s employing relaxed waiver on this PCRA appeal to reach numerous waived claims.\nAppellant raises a number of issues as claims of trial court error. Since those claims could have been raised on appellant\u2019s direct appeal, they are explicitly waived under the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b) (An issue is waived under the PCRA \u201cif the petitioner could have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, during unitary review, on appeal, or in a prior state postconviction proceeding\u201d). The lead opinion nevertheless reviews the waived claims on the merits. It apparently does so because it deems appellant\u2019s \u201cblanket allegation of layered ineffectiveness\u201d as preserving those claims that \u201cwould otherwise be deemed waived pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9543(a)(3) and 9544(b).\u201d Op. at 773.\nIn my view, appellant\u2019s boilerplate, layered claim of counsel ineffectiveness does not undo the PCRA waiver provision and make appellant\u2019s waived claims of trial court error reviewable. Those claims are unequivocally waived under the PCRA. The only versions of these claims that would be reviewable under the PCRA are appellant\u2019s distinct, substantive constitutional claims sounding in the ineffective assistance of his previous counsel. By reaching appellant\u2019s waived claims on the merits, the lead opinion employs a form of a relaxed waiver which subverts the statute and is contrary to our decision in Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 720 A.2d 693 (1998). See Commonwealth v. Marshall, 810 A.2d 1211, 2002 WL 31630168 (Pa.2002) (Castille, J., concurring and dissenting); Commonwealth v. Meadows, 567 Pa. 344, 787 A.2d 312 (2001) (Castille, J., concurring).\nI would reject appellant\u2019s claims of counsel ineffectiveness because they are boilerplate and because, as the lead opinion notes, the underlying assertions lack even arguable merit.\nJustice EAKIN joins this concurring and dissenting opinion.",
