Should this Court grant Allowance of Appeal to review the decision of the Commonwealth Court because the Commonwealth Court departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings by raising Sua Sponte the issue of requiring a hearing prior to withholding funds from an inmate\u2019s prison account for the payment of costs, fines and restitution pursuant to Act 84 and ruling upon the same without providing Petitioner the opportunity to brief and argue the issue.\nShould this Court grant Allowance of Appeal to review the decision of the Commonwealth Court because the Commonwealth Court departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings by requiring that the court of common pleas hold a hearing prior to permitting deductions from Respondent\u2019s prison account, but did not remand the case back to the common pleas court for the purpose of holding such a hearing.\nThe parties are hereby ordered to submit the matter on the briefs.",
