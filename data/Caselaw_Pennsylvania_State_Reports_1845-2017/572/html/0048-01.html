Following the conclusion of trial, a jury convicted Appellant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. An appeal was filed by another member of the public defender’s office. The trial court found the existence of a conflict of interest and appointed new counsel to represent Appellant on appeal. On appeal, the Superior Court remanded the matter to allow Appellant to file a post-sentence motion <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to challenge the weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence as to the remainder of Appellant’s claims. The court reviewed the substance of most of Appellant’s claims and concluded they were without merit.

Further, Appellant’s claim related to alleged prosecutorial misconduct was not sufficiently developed to warrant review of the issue. Related to this claim, the Commonwealth points out that <em>Hubbard </em>provides the proper procedure for appeals alleging ineffectiveness in order to ensure that the claims are disposed of in an efficient fashion. Lastly, the Commonwealth argues that the trial court did not err in allowing it to introduce evidence that Appellant was not licensed to carry a gun at the time of the instant incident.</p>

Appellant attempted to impeach Moore with this information, but the trial court did not allow the introduction of the evidence due to the age of the convictions. However, Appellant now alleges that there was at least one more crimen falsi conviction dating from 1984<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> related to this witness as well as additional information that Moore was incarcerated during the intervening years. Additionally, Appellant alleges that Moore was on state parole at the time of the instant incident, which may have colored his testimony. According to Appellant, such additional information may have changed the trial court’s decision to allow Appellant to impeach Moore with his prior convictions. However, Appellant fails to argue that the Commonwealth had such evidence in its possession at the time of trial and knowingly withheld such information. Instead, Appellant acknowledges that the failure of the Commonwealth was most likely an oversight on its part. Further, the public defender’s office uncovered this evidence after the trial. At trial, Appellant was represented by a public defender. Appellant failed to explain why the public defender could not have procured this same information before or during trial. Thus, by Appellant’s own admission, he has not demonstrated that there has been a suppression of such information by the Commonwealth that violated the dictates of <em>Brady. </em>Additionally, it appears that Appellant may have had equal access to this information before or during trial. In fact, Appellant alternatively raises this issue as one of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>uncover this evidence. It appears that the ineffectiveness claim presents a better avenue to address Appellant’s issue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Accordingly, as stated previously, we will discuss the ineffectiveness claims later in the opinion.</p>

At trial, the Commonwealth submitted into evidence a certified copy of a document indicating that Appellant was not licensed to carry a firearm. Then, during the discussion of what charges the court would give to the jury, the Commonwealth requested that the jury be given a charge based upon 18 Pa.C.S. § 6104. Section 6104 provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="AU" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[327,1032,1120,349]]]'>In the trial of a person for committing or attempting to commit a crime enumerated in section 6105 (relating to persons not to possess, use, manufacture, control, sell or transfer firearms), the fact that that person was armed with a firearm, used or attempted to be used, and had no license to carry the same, shall be evidence of that person’s intention to commit the offense.</blockquote>

In order for § 6104 to apply to a particular case, it requires that the Commonwealth establish as a fact: 1) that a crime has been committed as enumerated in § 6105; 2) that the person com<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>mitting the crime was armed with a firearm; 3) that the firearm was used or attempted to be used; and 4) that the person had no license to carry the same. When these facts are established, they “shall be evidence of that person’s intent to commit the offense.” <em>See </em>§ 6104. None of these requirements includes a mandate that the Commonwealth establish a violation of § 6106. Thus, contrary to Appellant’s argument, § 6104 does not require that the Commonwealth establish a predicate violation of § 6106.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Appellant argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to uncover impeachment evidence regarding Christopher Moore. Additionally, Appellant argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call two Commonwealth witnesses. The Superior Court dismissed both of these claims for lack of adequate development. Appellant argues that the Superior Court’s action was improper. According to Appellant, the procedural rules prescribed by this court require an appellant to confine his issues raised on appeal to those contained in the record. Thus, the rules prevented Appellant from supplementing the record on appeal and rendered him incapable of providing concrete <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>evidence, through reports or documents, regarding the alleged ineffectiveness. Thus, Appellant concludes that rather than dismissing the claims for inadequate development, the Superi- or Court should have remanded the claims to the trial court in order to give him the opportunity to fully develop his claims.</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[285,624,1159,742]]]'>Appellant also contends that this court should not reconsider our original position in <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the above argument made by Appellant regarding the Superior Court’s handling of his ineffectiveness claims is essentially an attack on <em>Hubbard. </em>The <em>Hubbard </em>rule simply provides that claims of ineffectiveness must be raised at the time a defendant gets new counsel. In the event that the claims are not raised at that time, they are waived. <em>Hubbard, </em><a href="/pa/472/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="472 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1727744" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0259-01">372 A.2d at </a>695 n. 6. As Appellant’s argument in this case highlights, the <em>Hubbard </em>rule is often difficult to reconcile with traditionally-accepted rules of procedure, which normally do not allow issues to be raised for the first time on appeal and do not allow an appellant to supplement the record on appeal.</p>

Thus, we will first examine the origins of the <em>Hubbard </em>rule.</p>

In <em>Dancer, </em>this court considered “whether a [petitioner] represented on direct appeal by an attorney other than his trial counsel waives his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel by failing to raise that issue on direct appeal.” <em>Id. </em>at 436. The court first looked at the language of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>(“PCHA”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> which created a rebuttable presumption that the failure to raise an issue was “knowing and understanding.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
      <em>Id. </em>at 437. Due to this presumption, the court determined that the failure to raise an issue on direct appeal will only be justified where extraordinary circumstances exist. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the court concluded that ineffectiveness of trial counsel may only be raised in collateral proceedings under the following circumstances:</p>
    <blockquote id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[250,761,1109,514]]]'>1) where petitioner is represented on appeal by his trial counsel, for it is unrealistic to expect trial counsel on direct appeal to argue his own ineffectiveness, 2) where the petitioner is represented on appeal by new counsel, but the grounds upon which the claim of ineffective assistance are based do not appear in the trial record, 3) where the petitioner is able to prove the existence of other “extraordinary circumstances” justifying his failure to raise the issue or 4) where the petitioner rebuts the presumption of “knowing and understanding failure.”</blockquote>

Appellate courts in Pennsylvania routinely decline to entertain issues raised on appeal for the first time. Indeed, the Pennsylvania Appellate Rules of Procedure specifically proscribe such review. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). The Rules and case law indicate that such a prohibition is preferred because the absence of a trial court opinion can pose a “substantial impediment to meaningful and effective appellate review.” <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[205,897,1159,1394]]]'>Yet, in the arena of ineffectiveness claims, appellate courts are routinely called upon to perform each of these tasks. In ruling on an ineffectiveness claim, it is rare that a trial court opinion exists which will aid the appellate court in examining the claim. Appellate courts are frequently called upon to consider matters outside the record. Moreover, appellate courts often engage in some fact finding by being required to speculate as to the trial strategy of trial counsel in order to rule upon these claims. It seems anomalous that where the issues involve claims of ineffectiveness, we employ the exact opposite appellate review process that we require in almost all other appeals. In fact, we require the defendant to raise a new claim for the first time on appeal. When an appellant has not raised this new claim on appeal, he is subject to the waiver provision of the PCRA. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b). These considerations prompt us to revisit the continued validity of <em>Hubbard. </em>However, the mere fact that our current process to review ineffectiveness claims does not square with the rules of appellate procedure employed in most cases cannot conclude our discussion of this matter, since these rules of appellate procedure existed at the time we announced the <em>Hubbard </em>rule. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

These courts recognize that the role of appellate counsel may not include raising claims that are not contained in the record certified for appeal; that the record may not be sufficiently developed on direct appeal to permit adequate review of ineffectiveness claims; and that appellate courts do not normally consider issues that were not raised and developed in the court below.

    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[287,825,1157,777]]]'>First, ineffectiveness claims, by their very nature, often involve claims that are not apparent on the record. Thus, appellate counsel must not only scour the existing record for any issues, but also has the additional burden of raising any extra-record claims that may exist by interviewing the client, family members, and any other people who may shed light on claims that could have been pursued before or during trial and at sentencing. Importantly, appellate counsel must perform this Herculean task in the limited amount of time that is available for filing an appeal from the judgment of sentence— 30 days. Pa.R.Crim.P. .720. Further, following the rationale expressed in <em>Woods, </em>it is not even clear if appellate counsel’s duty extends to finding extra-record claims or whether appellate counsel would be ineffective for failing to uncover extra-record claims.</p>

For example, the prejudicial effect of trial counsel’s chosen course of action is determined more accurately after the trial and appellate courts have had the opportunity to review the alleged claims of error and if necessary, correct any trial court errors. It is only after this review that the full effect of counsel’s conduct can be placed in the context of the case.</p>

      <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>What is apparent from the above discussion of other jurisdictions’ review of ineffectiveness claims is that the same concerns that animated our general approach to appellate review should apply with equal vigor in the ineffectiveness arena. The unqualified <em>Hubbard </em>rule ignores these valid concerns. In the twenty-five plus years since <em>Dancer </em>and <em>Hubbard, </em>we have learned that time is necessary for a petitioner to discover and fully develop claims related to trial counsel ineffectiveness. Deferring review of trial counsel ineffectiveness claims until the collateral review stage of the proceedings offers a petitioner the best avenue to effect his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, we overrule <em>Hubbard </em>to the extent that it requires that trial counsel’s ineffectiveness be raised at that time when a petitioner obtains new counsel or those claims will be deemed waived.</p>

This Court’s recent experience has more than amply demonstrated the inherent difficulties with this rule, difficulties which are aptly expressed by the majority. Application of the rule has caused particular havoc in this Court’s capital PCRA jurisprudence, as the majority also notes. The question of “layering” routinely arises in capital PCRA appeals because those defendants frequently have been represented by counsel other than trial counsel on direct appeal. The <em>Hubbard </em>rule makes those direct appeals a previous opportunity to raise claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness in the first instance for purposes of the PCRA’s waiver provision. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b) (issue is waived under PCRA if petitioner “could have raised it but failed to do so” in prior proceeding). Accordingly, to state a cognizable claim under the PCRA deriving from alleged deficiencies in representation at trial, the petitioner must “layer” his claim by pleading and proving that direct appeal counsel was ineffective.

Such a practice creates difficulties both for new counsel and for the reviewing court. Moreover, it is particularly anomalous to permit, much less to require, the raising of such new claims on direct appeal when the General Assembly has provided a specific vehicle for such collateral claims via the PCRA. Indeed, claims sounding in the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel are specifically deemed cognizable under that Act. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(ii). Criminal appeals, like other appeals, should generally be confined to those claims which were properly raised and preserved at the trial court level—which, of course, may include claims of counsel ineffectiveness if such were actually raised by new counsel on post-sentencing motions and were decided by the trial court. Collateral claims should be directed to the PCRA, which exists for that very purpose.</p>

The majority holds that, as a “general rule,” criminal defendants on direct appeal “should” wait until collateral review to raise new claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness. Majority op. at 732. In addition to employing the equivocal word “should” in the actual standard, the majority also appends a footnote in which it suggests, in <em>dicta, </em>an exception to the new rule.

The word “should” does not bar appellants from raising new claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness on direct appeal: it therefore suggests an aspiration rather than an actual standard; it invites appellants to try to avoid the “general” rule; and it promises years of further confusion as the contours of the play in the new rule are litigated. In this regard, I note that the <em>Hubbard </em>rule has been a fixture of Pennsylvania’s legal landscape for over twenty-five years and, for many in the criminal defense bar, raising new claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness on direct appeal no doubt has become a matter of routine. A significant number of appellants and their counsel are likely to share the view of the parties and the <em>amicus </em>here that “the interests of justice are best served by prompt adjudication of ineffectiveness claims,” <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant at 41, and they will thus persist in attempting to raise such claims on direct appeal.

But the allegation is far more difficult to prove under the prevailing Sixth Amendment standard. I see no reason to afford such mere allegations special status on direct appeal. It is more than sufficient that the relaxation of the substantive ineffectiveness standard will apply when the claim is raised on collateral attack. The predictable consequence of the majority’s <em>dicta </em>is that routine claims of counsel ineffectiveness will now be accompanied by an exaggerated assertion of the constructive denial of counsel— <em>i.e., </em>the courts will see claims that counsel’s performance in failing to raise an objection was so deficient that it was as if the defendant were unrepresented—merely in the hope of securing a preview round of collateral attack upon direct appeal.</p>

If the case law interpreting our new rule—and its possible “exceptions”— develops in such a way as to permit certain new claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness to be raised as a matter of right on direct appeal then, as to those claims at least, we will be right back to where we were under the <em>Hubbard </em>rule for purposes of PCRA waiver. This is so because the PCRA waiver provision speaks in terms of claims which “could have been raised” on direct appeal. The exceptions invited by the majority, if they materialize, will create classes of claims sounding in <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>trial counsel ineffectiveness which are cognizable on direct appeal; and if those cognizable claims are not so raised, they will be subject to waiver under the PCRA unless they are properly layered.

On the question of potential exceptions to this general rule, although I recognize the majority’s concern, I believe that it is sufficient to state the general rule for now, and let experience with the rule be our guide.

Under our settled precedent, a new judicial rule cannot have the global retroactive effect the majority accords its new rule <em>here—ie., </em>it cannot apply retroactively to a case where no party has even raised a challenge to the <em>Hubbard </em>doctrine. When a new rule is deemed to apply retroactively, it still applies only to matters where the very question at issue—in this case, the continuing propriety of the <em>Hubbard </em>rule and the substitution of a new rule—was properly raised and preserved at all stages of the adjudication <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>up to and including the direct appeal. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, the new rule substituted for <em>Hubbard </em>properly should only apply retroactively to a case where one of the parties advocated that change in the <em>Hubbard </em>doctrine.

If not, will the Court apply today’s decision retroactively and force defendants in pending direct capital appeals to raise their ineffectiveness claims under the PCRA—even if such are the only claims raised? With respect to relaxed waiver, it also bears noting that many of the concerns that have led the Court to overrule <em>Hubbard </em>today are also present when the Court “relaxes” waiver on capital direct appeals and reviews fictional claims of “trial court error” involving objections that, in fact, were never brought to the trial judge’s attention.

Since no such challenge has been made here, like Justice Saylor, I would proceed to the merits and reject the claims since appellant has failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.
