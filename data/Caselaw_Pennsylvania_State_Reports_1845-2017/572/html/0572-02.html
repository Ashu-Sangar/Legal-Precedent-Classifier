Even though the timeliness requirements of the PCRA leave a court without jurisdiction to consider the merits of an untimely petition, they do not preclude a court from appointing counsel to aid an indigent petitioner in attempting to establish an exception to the time-bar. Although the PCRA court determines the issue of timeliness prior to reaching the merits of a PCRA petition, the PCRA court is not divested of its jurisdiction until it analyzes the facts and makes the determination that the petition is time-barred. Therefore, an indigent petitioner, who files his first PCRA petition, is entitled to have counsel appointed to represent him during the determination of whether any of the exceptions to the one-year time limitation apply. The Commonwealth’s alternative argument is moot in light of our determination that an indigent petitioner is entitled to the appointment of counsel during PCRA proceedings in order to determine whether the petition is time-barred.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that <em>Murray </em>stands for the proposition that where it is obvious on its face that a petition for post conviction relief is untimely and where the petition itself fails to allege and prove that one of the enumerated exceptions to the time-bar applies, the petition must be dismissed without appointment of counsel. However, <em>Murray </em>is distinguishable from the <em>Ferguson </em>line of cases and from the matter <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Murray, </em>the petitioner filed a <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition claiming that trial counsel acted ineffectively by failing to file a direct appeal to the Superior Court. <em><a href="/a2d/753/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="753 A.2d 201" data-case-ids="11205468,225995" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0201-01,/pa/562/0001-01">Id.</a> </em>The PCRA court dismissed the claim without a hearing, holding that the petitioner did not file his petition in a timely manner and failed to plead and prove any of the exceptions to the one-year time limitation provided in the PCRA.

We maintain that where a petitioner files an untimely PCRA petition “the courts have no jurisdiction to grant [a petitioner] relief unless he can plead and prove that one of the exceptions to the time-bar ... applies.” <em>Pursell, </em>749 A.2d at 914. However, we now hold that counsel should be appointed to help an indigent petitioner attempt to demonstrate that one of these exceptions applies.

Without legal counsel, an indigent first-time PCRA petitioner would not know of the necessity of demonstrating the existence of an exception to the time-bar. The standard PCRA petition form that is extensively used by inmates in Philadelphia, and which Smith was required to fill out, does not reference the PCRA’s time limitation mandate. However, even if the petitioner was aware of the need to prove an exception to the time-bar, appointed counsel would be more able to investigate underlying facts and explore whether such facts are sufficient to prove that one of the exceptions to the one-year time limitation applies. Therefore, we conclude that an indigent first-time PCRA petitioner is entitled to the assistance of counsel, whether or not the PCRA court ultimately concludes that the PCRA petition is untimely.</p>
