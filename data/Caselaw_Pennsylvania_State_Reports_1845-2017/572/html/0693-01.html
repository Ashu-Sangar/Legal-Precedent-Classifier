Whether, even if the Commonwealth Court correctly ruled that Annunziata is entitled to Workers’ Compensation benefits and Heart and Lung pay in light of his concurrent employment, the Commonwealth Court committed error in not directing Annunziata to forward his workers’ compensation pay to the City of Erie under Section 637(a) of the Pennsylvania Heart and Lung Act, 53 P.S. Section 637(a).</blockquote>
