Appellant retrieved a .30-30 caliber rifle from his house, forced his way into the house next door, and chased Jones upstairs.

In addition to being waived, two of these sub-claims are also previously litigated. First, appellant alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor, during her penalty phase summation, asked the jury to consider the reaction of others to their verdict if they returned a life sentence. Trial counsel did, in fact, promptly object to these comments. <em>See </em>N.T. 8/18/92 at 38. The trial court sustained that objection and instructed the jury that its sentence should be based solely upon the evidence presented and should not be influenced by what others might say or think. The issue was raised on direct appeal as a preserved claim of prosecutorial misconduct. This Court con-<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>eluded that, although improper, any prejudice which may have resulted from the prosecutor’s remarks was cured by the trial court’s contemporaneous instructions and its final charge to the jury. Accordingly, we denied relief. <em>See Jones, 683 </em>A.2d at 1201. Second, appellant alleged on direct appeal, as he does now, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s penalty phase suggestion that, if the victims’ friends and families had been permitted to testify, they would have requested that the jury sentence appellant to death. In rejecting this claim, this Court held that the prosecutor’s “isolated reference” fell “within permissible bounds,” and thus trial counsel was not ineffective. <em>See id. </em>at 1203-04. Because the substance of these two sub-claims was decided on appellant’s direct appeal to this Court, these particular claims are previously litigated, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(2) (claim is previously litigated if “highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue”), and cannot be revived by appellant’s renewing them under the guise of an allegation of subsequent counsel ineffectiveness. <em>E.g.

On these equally essential substantive elements of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant is largely silent. Appellant forwards no relevant argument as to why PCRA counsel’s failure to perceive and pursue any particular claim must be deemed ineffective. Instead, appellant declares in summary fashion that, simply because he believes the claims have merit, PCRA counsel must have been ineffective for failing to pursue them.

The High Court has explicitly recognized that appellate counsel is not constitutionally obliged to raise any and all nonfrivolous claims; to the contrary, the Court has, on repeated occasions, emphasized that vigorous, effective appellate advocacy requires the exercise of reasonable selectivity in deciding upon which claims to pursue. <em>Robbins, </em><a href="/us/528/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="528 U.S. 259" data-case-ids="9476301" data-case-paths="/us/528/0259-01">528 U.S. at 288</a>, <a href="/us/528/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="528 U.S. 259" data-case-ids="9476301" data-case-paths="/us/528/0259-01">120 S.Ct. 746</a>; <em>Barnes, </em><a href="/us/463/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="463 U.S. 745" data-case-ids="6199647" data-case-paths="/us/463/0745-01">463 U.S. at 750-54</a>, <a href="/us/463/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="463 U.S. 745" data-case-ids="6199647" data-case-paths="/us/463/0745-01">103 S.Ct. 3308</a>.

Except for the most obvious of claims—none of which the concurrence suggests are present here—appellate counsel simply cannot know with any degree of certainty which of the limitless prospective issues on appeal (and the prospective claims on a capital direct appeal are truly limitless given the relaxed waiver doctrine) may ultimately prove successful. The fact that a foregone claim appears to have merit to a majority of a court upon collateral review years later cannot retroactively control the question of the objective reasonableness of previous direct appeal counsel’s decision to raise different claims. Rather, a substantive review of the legal landscape and reasonable options confronting appellate counsel at the relevant time is required in order to vindicate the constitutional value implicated. Thus, as the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly and wisely emphasized, the adequacy of appellate counsel’s performance can be measured only by looking to what appellate counsel actually faced, at the time he had to act, and engaging in a substantive comparison of the course taken with the available course available but not taken.</p>

Ours is a society of competing values. The General Assembly has determined that, in criminal cases, unlike all other cases, otherwise final judgments are subject to collateral attack, under the PCRA. This second bite at the review apple obviously is afforded because of the important stakes uniquely involved in serious criminal cases, <em>i.e., </em>life and liberty. But the exceptional collateral attack thus authorized is not arbitrary or uncabined: it exists to vindicate specifically delineated, fundamental, and primarily constitutional, values. It is hardly “fair” to the victims of crime, to the cause of justice, to appellate counsel, or to society in general, for a Court to take it upon itself to arbitrarily overlook or “relax” the substantive constitutional standard which is approved for collateral attack by the General Assembly, in order to vindicate some lesser, vague, and debatable notion of fairness—no matter how much easier a lesser standard would make the job of PCRA petitioners and reviewing courts.</p>

Presumptively effective direct appeal counsel did not simply “mail in” his appellate performance; rather, he raised nearly two dozen claims. The notion that each of the fifteen new substantive claims that appellant identifies on this PCRA appeal are both clearly meritorious and clearly stronger than the ones actually pursued by counsel on direct appeal—bald assumptions which the concurrence is willing to accept as proof that appellate counsel was ineffective—is implausible in the extreme. The notion that any one of the present claims is both clearly meritorious and clearly stronger than the direct appeal claims counsel forwarded is not self-proving: it is a question that requires comparison of the <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>raised claims and the forgone claims, as well as a consideration of counsel’s reasons for acting as he did. For this Court to decide the claim under the actual' constitutional standard and in light of the actual value at stake—rather than treating the claim as a mere “pleading mechanism” to revive the waived underlying claims—requires us to navigate waters that appellant has elected not even to visit, much less chart, for us.

Although Justice Castille correctly notes that <em>Pursell </em>was not decided under the 1995 amendments, which added the timeliness requirements to the PCRA, we fail to see how these amendments serve to alter <em>Pursell’s </em>clear holding that this Court may properly review claims of PCRA counsel’s ineffectiveness when it is an appellant’s first, and quite possibly only, opportunity to do so.</blockquote>

By doing so, I tried to avoid muddying the waters even more by adding to the mix yet another responsive opinion which merely reiterated my own understanding of the approach to be used when deciding which claims should or should not be deemed waived for purposes of the PCRA. However, as time passes and the issue remains unresolved, I felt the better course would be to at least offer the parties some explanation as to where it is that my approach differs from that offered by the lead opinion.</p>

However, I write separately because I am concerned that, in our attempts to resolve the difficulties posed by appellate review of layered claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in PCRA capital cases, this Court gives too much significance to the need for adequate “layering,” i.e., the articulation of the three-part test from <em>Commonwealth v. (Charles) Pierce, </em>515 Pa.153, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a> (1987), needed at each level of representation by new counsel. While I agree with the lead opinion that each level of representation gives rise to distinct claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and that appellants should recognize this and frame their petitions and briefs accordingly, nevertheless this Court should not impose too onerous a standard on how appellants must plead these claims in order to obtain substantive review of them.</p>

I read this portion of the lead opinion as suggesting, as an example, that even though a waived claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness would, if not waived, have entitled a defendant to some form of relief, a claim of ineffectiveness of subsequent appellate counsel could fail because appellate counsel may have had a “reason” for foregoing the particular claim of the ineffectiveness of trial counsel on appeal.</p>

When appellate counsel fails to advance an issue that would, if raised, have entitled his or her client to a new trial, or a new sentencing hearing in a capital case, I simply cannot see how this strategy would ever be reasonable. Although I realize that trial lawyers, in arguing a case to a jury, often forego meritorious objections for a variety of strategic reasons (for example, not wishing to confuse the jury on a technical issue, the possibility of defense theories appearing to conflict, credibility with the jury, etc.), appellate litigation presents entirely different considerations. As an adjunct to the lawyer’s responsibility to represent his or her client zealously, an appellate lawyer must be expected to pursue every avenue for his or her client, even where two appellate issues rest on conflicting legal theories, with the understanding that appellate courts are capable of digesting inconsistent claims in the same appeal without suffering from the confusion or incredulity to which juries are occasionally subject. In brief, if the underlying claim of error is of such an important magnitude that it would have entitled a defendant to relief had <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>it been raised on appeal, there can be no justification for the failure of appellate counsel to pursue the claim that would ever qualify as a reasonable professional judgment.</p>

As long as an appellant has sufficiently layered his or her claim, even in boilerplate fashion, to overcome waiver, this Court should undertake as much as possible to determine the significance of the underlying claim that appellate counsel defaulted (i.e., whether it possesses merit and/or establishes how the- appellant was prejudiced), rather than dismiss the claim because the appellant inadequately pled the ineffectiveness of each level of counsel with reference to the <em>Strickland </em>test. This is the course that this Court followed in <em>Commonwealth v.

By their operation and effect, the rules facilitate the exposure of potential ineffectiveness in the initial stages by, <em>inter alia, </em>requiring the PCRA court to provide both notice of its intention to dismiss and the supporting reasons, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2), and, where appropriate, allowing amendment of a petition to correct defects. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(A) (stating that “[ajmendment shall be freely allowed to achieve substantial justice”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2)(c)(ii) (noting that the PCRA court may permit amendment of a petition following notice of intention to dismiss). Here, for example, the PCRA court’s notice of its intention to dismiss the petition was <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>identical, in all material respects, to that which was at issue in <em>Williams, </em>in which the Court remanded for compliance with the rules. While I acknowledge that such omission does not appear to have substantially impacted upon Appellant’s claims before this Court (as all but two of the issues were never raised below), I would nevertheless continue to emphasize that noncompliance with the rules detracts from this Court’s ability to conduct effective appellate review. <em>See Williams, </em><a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="170" data-cite="566 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="706331" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01">566 Pa. at 569</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="782 A.2d 517" data-case-ids="706331,9471643" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0553-01,/a2d/782/0517-01">782 A.2d at 527</a>.</p>

Unless and until such questions are adequately <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>addressed, I believe that the Court should be less exacting in its strict enforcement of waiver principles predicated on deficiencies in appellate briefing.</p>
