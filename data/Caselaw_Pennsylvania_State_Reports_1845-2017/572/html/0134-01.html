A case management order was issued by Judge O’Keefe on July 24, 1997, setting December 7, 1998, as the deadline for submission of the expert reports of the Gerrows. On November 23, 1998, all parties joined in a motion to extend the discovery deadline, but the motion was denied by Judge O’Keefe. The parties nevertheless continued discovery after the December 7 cutoff date.</p>
    <p id="b331-5" data-blocks='[["BL_331.6",331,[178,955,1168,960]]]'>The case management order issued by Judge O’Keefe had an additional deadline, setting January 4, 1999, as the final date for filing pretrial motions. Though Appellant Shincor was amenable to continuing discovery beyond the deadline of December 7 and had joined the unsuccessful motion to extend the deadline, Shincor was mindful of the January 4 pretrial motion deadline. To protect its position, Shincor filed a motion for summary judgment on December 31, 1998. The motion was based on the Gerrows’ failure to submit expert reports within the time allotted by the case management order, without which the Gerrows could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case due to the technical nature of their negligence claim. Shincor reasoned that, if the trial court later refused to permit untimely filing of expert reports, the court might also refuse to permit untimely filing of pretrial motions, so the motion for summary judgment had to be filed before the January 4 deadline even though Shincor had no objection to the Gerrows continuing their efforts to obtain expert reports.</p>

It found fault with both conclusions of the trial court: it held that the expert reports appended to the response to the motion were a permissible supplementation of the record pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1035.3(b); it also held that the coordinate jurisdiction rule, under these circumstances, did not preclude Judge Abramson from revisiting the case management deadlines established by Judge O’Keefe.</p>

To begin with, it appears erroneous in the first instance for Judge O’Keefe to deny the November 23, 1998 motion to extend the discovery deadline. The motion was joined by all parties. It was based on the necessity of extensive traveling to depose witnesses in several states, as well as a financial crisis faced by one corporate defendant. All parties were aware of these difficulties and believed they justified extension of the discovery timetable. Judge O’Keefe did not permit hearing, argument, or conference on the motion and, in summarily denying it, gave no rationale for the denial. There is thus no basis for this Court to review his discretion in denying the motion. What appears to be an unreasonable decision has no explanation in the record, and the decision appears to be unjust. It would have been perfectly proper for <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Judge Abramson to reexamine the discovery timetable in order to correct that error.

    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[285,554,1159,626]]]'>Secondly, under the rationale of <em>Riccio, </em>the coordinate jurisdiction rule did not apply to Judge Abramson. Judge Abramson was not presented with the same question as Judge O’Keefe had been. Judge O’Keefe had been presented with a scheduling issue affecting case management and the court’s timetable. Judge Abramson, by contrast, was faced with the ultimate question of whether summary judgment should be granted, ending the litigation entirely. The considerations were entirely different, so the coordinate jurisdiction rule did not apply in the sense of precluding an examination of Appellees’ expert reports to determine whether they established a <em>prima facie </em>case, making summary judgment inappropriate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

I agree in many respects with points made in Mr. Justice Nigro's dissent, but do not believe, respectfully, that I am "putting the cart before the horse,” as he suggests, <em>see </em>Dissenting Opinion, at 789 n. 7. I have merely recognized that the present rules contemplate a separate motion serving as the procedural vehicle to implicate the necessary determination of prejudice as a prerequisite to the imposition of preclusive sanctions prior to trial. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Williams v. SEPTA, </em><a href="/a2d/741/0848-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="741 A.2d 848" data-case-ids="11656695" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0848-01">741 A.2d 848</a>, 855-56 &amp; nn. 5-6 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999) (addressing a motion to preclude expert testimony and applying a prejudice standard), <em>appeal denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=563%20Pa.%20680" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="563 Pa. 680">563 Pa. 680</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=759%20A.2d%20925" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="759 A.2d 925">759 A.2d 925</a> (2000). Such framework manifests no facial incongruity, since the factual predicate for preclusion is the failure to obey an order of court regarding discovery, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. No. 4019(a)(l)(viii), not the particular substance of a disclosed, undisclosed, or yet-to-be-prepared expert report. Moreover, Rules 4003.5(b) and 4019(i) do not in and of themselves control, since those provisions do not address the specific timing of pre-trial disclosure, but rather, concern only the necessity of making a requested disclosure of identity <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>on a pre-trial basis. Additionally, as noted, both have been read to incorporate a prejudice requirement, <em>see, e.g., Feingold, </em><a href="/pa/512/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="512 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1800438" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0567-01">512 Pa. at 573</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="512 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1800438" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0567-01">517 A.2d at 1273</a>; <em>Williams, </em><a href="/a2d/741/0848-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="741 A.2d 848" data-case-ids="11656695" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0848-01">741 A.2d at </a>855-56 &amp; nn. 5-6, which Justice Nigro acknowledges as precedent contrary to his position. Thus, while my thoughts align in a number of material regards with Justice Nigro's, I believe that the better approach to substantial amendments to the rules is to invoke the orderly process of rulemaking, with the concomitant notice to and opportunity for review and comment by the involved interests. In this regard, the First Judicial District may wish to raise with the Civil Procedural Rules Committee the question of whether the rules should be amended to implement an “extraordinary circumstances” standard for allowing late submission of expert reports.</p>

Significantly, the First District’s protocol in Administrative Docket No. 03 of 1998 essentially tracks the “extenuating circumstances” language of the rules, stating that “[t]he dates set forth in the Case Management Order are deadlines after which, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, no new experts or theories can be identified.” Accordingly, unlike the majority, I believe that enforcement of the First District’s scheduling orders and preclusion of expert witnesses who are not identified by the date set forth in any such order are entirely consistent with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

Appellees filed their initial complaint in this case on April 10, 1997. On July 24, 1997, the trial court entered its scheduling order, giving the parties over fifteen months (until November 2, 1998) to conduct discovery, and not requiring Appellees to submit expert reports until December 7, 1998. It was not until November 14, 1998, almost sixteen months later, and nearly two weeks <em>after </em>the November 2nd discovery cut-off date, that Appellees filed their motion for extraordinary relief, asking for yet another nine months of discovery and an extension of the expert deadlines. In their motion, Appellees represented that one of the corporate defendants was suffering financial hardship and no longer had counsel. They further represented that there were “several days of depositions left to be taken” and therefore contended that the requested extension was both necessary and warranted. However, nowhere in the motion did Appellees state when in <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>the nearly sixteen months allotted for discovery the defendant had lost its counsel, thus stalling discovery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_12" id="ref_footnote_4_12">12</a> Nor did they attempt to explain what discovery they had conducted in the preceding months or detail what discovery remained to be taken.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_13" id="ref_footnote_4_13">13</a> Moreover, in filing their motion <em>after </em>the discovery deadline, Appellees violated the local court rule that petitions for extraordinary relief must be filed “prior to the deadline that is sought to be changed.” Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Reg.

First, it states that “it was perfectly proper for Judge Abramson to reexamine the discovery timetable in order to correct [Judge O’Keefe’s] error” under the “manifest injustice” exception to the coordinate jurisdiction rule.

Specifically, the motion stated that "[a]s a result of the downturn in the Asian economy, Defendant John Royle has suffered serious financial setbacks at the current time. Upon advice of counsel for Defendant John Royle[J it is understood that John Royle is in reorganization and hopeful of recovery in the next 4-6 months.” With such vague representations, one is left with the distinct impression that- Royle did not face its allegedly debilitating "financial setbacks” until the end of the discovery period, if not after discovery had already closed.</p>

Again, given the absence of specificity, the motion leaves one with the impression that Appellees had thus far conducted little discovery. In fact, the parties’ briefs to this Court indicate that Appellees waited over a year after the entry of the scheduling order to serve written discovery on Appellant Shincor Silicones, Inc.</p>

The comments to Rule 206.1 of the Philadelphia Local Rules of Civil Procedure direct litigants to the court publication "Civil Trial Division Administration, at a Glance” for procedures relative to motions for extraordinary relief. The year 2000 version of that publication reiterates that any extraordinary relief petition "must be filed prior to the deadline that the party is seeking to change.” <em>Civil Administration 2000, </em>at 130. Furthermore, it warns:</p>
      <blockquote id="b348-7" data-blocks='[["BL_348.8",348,[356,1902,1091,233]]]'>Counsel who do little work on the case in timely fashion but nevertheless request extensions of court ordered deadlines are unlikely to receive them.

As stated above, before precluding expert testimony under Rule 4003.5(b), a Court need only consider whether “extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the defaulting party” caused the delay in the expert disclosure. Pa.R.Civ.P. 4003.5. As Appellees could not establish their entitlement to an extension of the discovery and expert deadlines here, there were clearly no such "extenuating circumstances” excusing their failure to produce expert reports in a timely fashion.</p>
