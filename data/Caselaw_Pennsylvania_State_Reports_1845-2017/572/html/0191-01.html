Mosaica and the Department of Education contend that although <em>Babcock </em>is generally the controlling law on the issue of out-of-district transportation of students to public schools, when the Legislature enacted Section 17-1726-A. of the CSL, it carved out an exception to the <em>Babcock </em>holding. Mosaica and the Department of Education rely on the portion of Section 1361 that states: “When provision is made by a board of school directors for the transportation of public school pupils to and from such schools ... the board of school directors shall also make identical provision for the free transportation of pupils who regularly attend nonpublic kindergarten, elementary or high schools.... ” They submit that the reference in the CSL to Section 1361 demonstrates that the Legislature’s clear intent was to require that students be transported to out-of-district charter schools that are located within ten miles of the district’s boundary, just as transportation is to be provided to nonpublic school students. They further assert that <em>Babcock </em>was decided fourteen years before charter schools were developed in this Commonwealth and <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>therefore it cannot now control the distinct issue of transportation of nonresident students to charter schools.</p>

There is a degree of ambiguity in the Legislature’s cross-reference to Section 1361 in Section 17-1726-A. of the CSL. While it is true that the precise language in Section 1361 relied upon by Mosaica and the Department of Education applies to nonpublic schools, it cannot be ignored that the sole statutory provision the Legislature referred to in addressing the transportation of charter school students outside their district, <em>i.e., </em>Section 1361, was designed to provide adequate transportation to resident pupils attending <em>nonpublic </em>schools. <em>Babcock, </em><a href="/pa/502/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="502 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1784514" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0349-01">466 A.2d at 617</a>. The CSL also states that funding for the transportation of students to charter schools is provided pursuant to Section 2509.3, which deals exclusively with private schools. Thus, although the General Assembly was clear in defining a charter school as a public school, it went to great lengths to treat the charter schools akin to private schools <em>for purposes of transportation. </em>Finally, as noted, the CSL defines charter school as an <em>“independent </em>public school,” 24 P.S. § 17-1703-A., distinguishing it from traditional public schools, which were at issue in <em>Babcock. </em>Thus, we conclude that the General Assembly elected to require transportation to resident students attending a charter school located outside of its district by incorporating Section 1361 to define the level of transportation to be provided to non-resident students. There is no other logical purpose for the Legislature’s reference to Section 1361 and the disparate treatment between students attending a charter school inside their district as opposed to a charter school outside their district.</p>

    <p id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[188,512,1152,1123]]]'>According to the majority, the Philadelphia School District cannot defend itself against this claim for over $1.4 million in annual tuition subsidies and transportation services because the CSL does not specifically provide for an appeal from a local board of school directors’ decision to grant a charter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> However, when the regional charter provisions are applied as I believe they were intended, it is readily apparent that the General Assembly did not provide for appeals from charter grants because to do so would have been gratuitous given the democratic regional charter approval process. Under the statute as I interpret it, if a charter school intends to serve a region, it must obtain the approval of <em>all </em>of the school districts within that region from which it intends to actively recruit students. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1718-A.(b) (“[A]ny action to ... sign a written charter of an applicant shall require an affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors of each of the school districts involved.”). As such, approval of the charter signals unqualified support for the charter from all of the targeted districts. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the regional charter approval process simply negates the need to provide such districts with an appellate remedy.</p>

Nevertheless, Mosaica drew approximately 60% of its students from Philadelphia and sought to divert to its independent venture over $1.4 million in Philadelphia taxpayers’ money that was presumably already budgeted for the <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>Philadelphia public school system. The fundamental unfairness of this process is self-evident and, in my view, is not what the General Assembly intended. Accordingly, I would hold the charter invalid, at least insofar as it purports to impose obligations on the Philadelphia School District, and would thereby relieve the Philadelphia School District of any obligation to pay tuition subsidies to Mosaica or provide transportation to Mosaica students.</p>

The majority also contends that “the legislature’s decision to permit an appeal only from the denial of a charter application is not offensive to individual rights because all private citizens had a right to attend and participate in BTSD's July 7, 1998 open public forum.” Op. at 818-19. However, this public forum took place almost two weeks <em>after </em>BTSD granted the charter. Accordingly, to the extent that individual rights had been violated by the unilateral grant of the charter, I do not see how this forum could have ameliorated those violations.</p>
