Kennedy Boulevard in Philadelphia. The male asked the victim if she was “working.” The victim answered “no” and continued walking. A short time later, the same male confronted the victim a second time, this time claiming to have a gun in his coat pocket and threatening to kill her if she did not do as she was told. He then grasped the victim by the arm and forced her to an enclosed space beneath nearby train tracks where he raped her and stole her money.</p>

Later that night, the police canvassed stores near the crime scene. The cashier at a pornography store, Elgee’s Novelty Shop, told the police that a man matching the victim’s description of the assailant had been in the store around the time of the rape and that this man had attempted to a make a purchase using an ATM card, but the card was rejected. The cashier provided the police with a list maintained by the shop of all ATM card transactions attempted and completed that day. The list showed the number of each card used and identified the bank that issued the card. The list indicated that two different ATM cards—one issued by Mellon Bank and one issued by Drovers and Mechanics Bank (“Drovers Bank”)—had been rejected. The police also viewed the store’s surveillance videotape, which showed a man matching the victim’s description of her assailant attempting to make a purchase with an ATM card.</p>

Mellon Bank provided this information, and the user of the card was ultimately eliminated as a suspect. The police then telephoned Robert Garrison, the manager of Drovers Bank, and requested the name and address corresponding to the declined Drovers Bank ATM card. The police inexplicably did not obtain a warrant before making this telephone request. Mr. Garrison consulted a list, kept within the bank, of all individuals to whom the bank had issued ATM cards. Mr. Garrison then relayed to police appellant’s name and address in York County, Pennsylvania. Mr. Garrison did not ask the police if they had a warrant because the information requested by the police “was not financial.” N.T. 9/29/1997 at 15.</p>

The Superi- or Court focused on whether appellant had an expectation of privacy in his bank’s knowledge of his name and address. Following a thorough discussion of <em>DeJohn </em>and other precedents from this Commonwealth, as well as a number of decisions from other jurisdictions, the Superior Court observed that “there is a fundamental difference between the type of information that is subject to a constitutionally protected right to privacy and a person’s identification information, <em>i.e., </em>one’s name and address.” <a href="/a2d/752/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="752 A.2d 404" data-case-ids="11509994" data-case-paths="/a2d/752/0404-01">752 A.2d at 412</a>.

In <em>DeJohn, </em>the appellant was suspected of murdering her husband in order to collect the proceeds of his life insurance policy, of which she was the primary beneficiary. In an effort to obtain evidence of a financial motive for the crime, the local District Attorney’s Office served two “court subpoenas” on officials of the bank where appellant and/or her husband were believed to maintain one or more accounts. The “subpoenas” were obtained without any court process. Indeed, the <em>DeJohn </em>Court noted that at the time both “subpoenas” were issued there was no ongoing legal proceeding of any nature. Thus, no Common Pleas Court Judge or District Justice had issued or authorized the “subpoenas.” Instead, they bore the signature of the local Clerk of Courts.</p>
    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[283,1153,1159,905]]]'>The first “subpoena” demanded “copies of all information pertaining to accounts, or application for account, made by Jill and/or Michael DeJohn.” The second “subpoena” demanded “all original records pertaining to personal cash reserve account application, and original new account card for Michael and Jil[l] DeJohn.” Pursuant to these “subpoenas,” the police obtained the actual cancelled check used to purchase the typewriter that Jill DeJohn had used to type an extortion note to a neighbor. In addition, the police obtained evidence that DeJohn had signed her husband’s signature on a loan application to obtain money to pay back $3,000 owed to an employee of their home builder. This evidence of DeJohn’s financial dealings, secured by police employing non-legal subpoenas, was introduced at her murder trial to show motive and she was ultimately convicted of third-degree murder. In a subsequent trial, DeJohn was also convicted of attempted theft by extortion concerning her neighbor.</p>

The Commonwealth did not dispute that the subpoenas were illegal; and this Court noted that, under our precedent, the Commonwealth could not claim that the subpoenas were lawful. <a href="/pa/486/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="486 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1757589" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0032-01">403 A.2d at </a>1287 n. 5.

Justice O'Brien's lead opinion in <em>DeJohn </em>was joined outright by only two of the five other participating Justices: Chief Justice Eagen and Justice Nix. Justice Pomeroy did not participate. Justice Roberts filed a concurring opinion in which, among other things, he expressed disagreement with the lead opinion’s Article I, Section 8 analysis since, in his view, a bank customer's interest in his account is "something less than a constitutional right of privacy.” <a href="/pa/486/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="486 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1757589" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0032-01">403 A.2d at 1293</a> (Roberts, J., concurring).

On the Article I, Section 8 question, Justice Manderino did not join the lead opinion, but stated that, "[t]he bank records, must be excluded for the reasons stated by the majority with which I agree.” <a href="/pa/486/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="486 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1757589" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0032-01">403 A.2d at 1307</a> (Manderino, J., dissenting).

There is, then, a clear mandate regarding the expectation of privacy in those sorts of records.

The dissent expresses concern that, in light of the Court's holding today that the police conduct here was constitutionally permissible, there will be "nothing to stop law enforcement officers from obtaining lists of ATM account numbers utilized at select targeted establishments and then telephoning the respective banks to compile a full list of names and addresses of citizens frequenting those establishments.” Dissenting slip op. at 4-5. This assertion misses the mark. Strictly speaking, nothing that this Court does in a case involving a suppression issue prevents police from doing anything, such as making telephone calls; the question is one of whether to provide a trial remedy. On that question, the obvious answer to the dissent's exaggerated fear is that the probable cause requirement, for one, stands in the way of admitting evidence that police seized for no reason other than to compile a list of citizens frequenting a "targeted establishment.” In this case, as the dissent concedes, <em>see id. </em>at 4 (“[T]here was nothing to prevent the police in this case from obtaining a warrant for bank records showing the name and address that corresponded to the ATM card number at issue"), there is no question that police had probable cause to believe that the person whose identity they were seeking to ascertain was the suspected rapist. The other "protection” against such requests is the bank’s authority to say "no.” That is a private matter a customer should take up with his bank; it does not trigger constitutional concerns.</p>

The record reflects that Duncan obtained from the bank a personal ATM card in his own name, and signed an agreement stating that the card was “non-transferable.” (R.R. 22a-23a). As such, it is clear that Duncan understood that he was establishing an exclusive relationship with his bank. Given this record fact, and in the absence of any record evidence that Duncan ever violated the non-transfer agreement or gave access to third parties to his private account information, the record supports the conclu<a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>sion that Duncan, by his conduct, exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy in the bank records associated with his ATM account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

In support of its conclusion that Duncan did not establish that he had a subjective expectation of privacy, the majority finds persuasive that Duncan attempted to use his ATM card in a public store, when both his name and account number appear on the face of the card. However, there is no evidence that Duncan actually relinquished his card to the cashier or otherwise gave the cashier an opportunity to view or record the name on the card. Under these circumstances, I do not agree with the suggestion that Duncan somehow voluntarily forfeited his reasonable and subjective expectation of privacy in his account information.</p>
