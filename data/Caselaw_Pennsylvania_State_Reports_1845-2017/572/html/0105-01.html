Appellant shot Rowden in public, in front of eyewitnesses, then drove to the apartment of a friend and told her he had shot Rowden because she was cooperating with the police in their investigation of Anderson’s murder. Appellant fled to New York where he was apprehended seven years later, extradited to Pennsylvania, tried for Rowden’s murder, convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to death in 1988. On direct appeal, this Court vacated the conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial, due to improper evidence introduced in the first trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant was then provided funds to engage a third psychiatrist, who concluded that Appellant did not suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome or disorder. Now Appellant is urging that it was error to deny additional public funds to enable him to seek other psychiatric experts to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a collateral attack on his sentence. This claim is far too attenuated to have any credibility. As this Court stated recently, “a defendant is not entitled to unlimited court-appointed experts until he finds one that renders the opinion he desires.” <em>Commonwealth v. Ches</em>

Other than asserting federal constitutional guarantees, however, Appellant’s argument focuses upon an alleged inconsistency between the Court’s decisions in <em>Stokes </em>and <em>Meadows. </em>Further, to the extent that reliance upon residual doubt is to be permitted in the penalty phase of a capital case, reasonable limitations are implicated, since, having established a defendant’s guilt, the Commonwealth should not be compelled to reestablish it for purposes of sentencing, particularly, where, as here, the case has been remanded for a re-sentencing hearing. <em>See generally Buford v. State, </em><a href="/so2d/403/0943-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="403 So. 2d 943" data-case-ids="9581928" data-case-paths="/so2d/403/0943-01">403 So.2d 943</a>, 953 (Fla.1981) (stating that, “[a] convicted defendant cannot be ‘a little bit guilty[;]’ [i]t is unreasonable for a jury to say in one breath that a defendant’s guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and, in the next breath, to say someone else may have done it, so we recommend mercy”). Here, I do not view the direct testimony of Appellant to the effect that he did not commit the crime as the type of residual doubt presentation that should be permitted,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_11" id="ref_footnote_4_11">11</a> particularly in the context of a re-sentencing, as it would have the effect of requiring a re-trial of the guilt phase.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_12" id="ref_footnote_4_12">12</a>

      <em>inter alia, </em>challenge the aggravating circumstance by arguing that Appellant did not kill the victim because she was a Commonwealth witness, but rather, that the victim was Appellant’s girlfriend, and that the killing occurred because of a lover’s quarrel. As such argument would have been inconsistent with Appellant’s testimony that he did not commit the crime, the trial court’s ruling would appear to have enhanced the viability of the defense theory concerning this aggravator.</p>
