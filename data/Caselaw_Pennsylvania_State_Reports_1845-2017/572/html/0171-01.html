On April 11, 1995, Robert Bandy, a liquor enforcement officer with the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police, entered appellant’s establishment wearing plainclothes. Officer Bandy observed three female erotic dancers remove their tops during the course of their performances. The dancers’ nipples and areolas were left covered only by a transparent liquid latex substance. None of the dancers removed the bottom portions of their outfits. Officer Bandy issued a citation to appellant for permitting lewd, immoral or improper entertainment on the licensed premises in violation of Section 4^93(10) of the Liquor Code.

This does not constitute a mere semantic distinction. Section 493 is a regulation of the liquor business, and, as such, is required only to bear a reasonable relation to the evil sought to be controlled; the right of the individual to freedom of speech and expression is not involved. This section does not constitute an abridgement of the freedom of speech of the individual, but rather, an abridgement of a privilege granted solely by the state. That in order to secure and retain this privilege, an individual may be incidentally required to modify the exercise of certain rights does not constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of those rights by the issuing authority.</blockquote>

The <em>Pap’s </em>litigation involved the constitutionality of a public indecency ordinance enacted by the City Council of Erie which made it a summary offense to appear in public in a state of nudity. Appellant Pap’s operated a non-liquor licensed establishment known as “Kandyland,” which featured totally nude erotic dancing performed by women.

However, the majority reasoned that this stated purpose was inextricably bound up with an “unmentioned purpose that directly impacts on the freedom of expression: that purpose is to impact negatively on the erot<a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>ic message of the dance” which was presumed to be the cause of the negative secondary effects.

The plurality rejected this Court’s approach in <em>Pap’s I </em>because it deemed that approach to merely follow Justice White’s dissent in <em>Barnes, </em>which had been rejected by a majority of the <em>Barnes </em>Court.

The first factor of the <em>O’Brien </em>test is whether the governmental regulation falls within the constitutional power of the government to enact such regulation. Appellant argues that this first factor is not met because the Board lacks the authority to interpret and enforce Section 4-493(10)’s ban on lewd, immoral or improper entertainment. Appellant asserts that Sections 2-207 (general powers of Board) and 2-208 (specific subjects on which Board may adopt regulations) of the Liquor Code limit the Board’s powers to the restriction and regulation of the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. Appellant contends that “[b]y interpreting and enforcing Section 4-493(10) ... to include a ban on topless, erotic dancing at licensees, the Board attempted to legislate morality and exceeded its scope of authority to act.” Supplemental Brief of Appellant at 17. Section 2-207(h) of the Liquor Code, however, broadly grants to the Board the authority to “do all such things and perform all such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this act and the regulations made thereunder.” 47 P.S. § 2-207(h). The Board clearly acted within this broad statutory authority when it enforced the statute against appellant. In any event, as appellee notes, the relevant inquiry is not whether the Board exceeded its statutory powers in enforcing the statute, but whether it was within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to enact the statute in the first place. <em>See Pap’s II, </em><a href="/us/529/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="529 U.S. 277" data-case-ids="9508427" data-case-paths="/us/529/0277-01">529 U.S. at 296</a>, <a href="/us/529/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="529 U.S. 277" data-case-ids="9508427" data-case-paths="/us/529/0277-01">120 S.Ct. 1382</a>.
