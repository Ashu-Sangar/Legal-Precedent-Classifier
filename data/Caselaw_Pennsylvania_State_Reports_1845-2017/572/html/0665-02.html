Wife is correct that <em>Simeone </em>did not overrule the <em>Geyer </em>court’s requirement, but neither did <em>Simeone </em>adopt that portion of <em>Geyer. </em>Thus, the requirement that a party be made aware of his or her statutory rights, set forth by the plurality in <em>Geyer, </em>has never been adopted by a majority of this court, and we decline to do so here.</p>
    <p id="b866-5" data-blocks='[["BL_866.5",866,[277,1302,1163,721]]]'>Adopting such a requirement would contravene the guiding principles of Simeone,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The <em>Simeone </em>court explained that traditional contract rules should be applied to marriage agreements. We expressly rejected an approach which would allow the court to inquire into the reasonableness of the bargain, or the parties’ understanding of the rights they were relinquishing. We decline to resurrect the paternalistic approaches to evaluating marriage contracts by requiring Husband to explain to Wife the statutory rights that she may be surrendering. Such an approach assumes that Wife lacks the intelligence or ability to protect her own rights. Instead, we endorse the parties’ rights to freely contract, and thus decline to impose the additional inquiry as to whether the parties were sufficiently advised of their statutory rights.</p>

Indeed, we recognized in <em>Simeons </em>that “[pjarties to these agreements do not quite deal at arm’s length, but rather at the time the contract is entered into stand in a relation of mutual confidence and trust that calls for disclosure of their financial resources.” <a href="/pa/525/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="525 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1823712" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0392-01">581 A.2d at 167</a> (citations omitted). In light of this unique relationship, we reaffirm the principle in <em>Simeone </em>that full disclosure of the parties’ financial resources is a mandatory requirement. This requisite acknowledges that the parties stand in a closer relationship beyond that of professional acquaintances negotiating a commercial contract. However, for the reasons expressed above, we do not find that the spousal relationship warrants the extra requirement that the parties be advised of their statutory rights. Rather, we find that the right balance is struck by requiring full disclosure of financial assets, in conjunction with the protection of traditional contract remedies for fraud, misrepresentation or duress.</p>
