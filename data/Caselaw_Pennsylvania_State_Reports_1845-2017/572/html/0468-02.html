Realizing that someone was in the apartment, Mr. Taha got out of bed and went to the living room to investigate. Mrs. Murtaza heard someone hit her husband and she attempted to contact the police on the bedroom phone. Before she was able to get through she saw her husband at the bedroom door, blood running from his chest and face, with [Ajppellant standing behind him holding a knife to his neck. As Mrs. Murtaza hung up the phone [Ajppellant threw Mr. Taha to the bed and approached Mrs. Murtaza, holding his knife to her chest. Appellant demanded money and jewelry. She gave him jewelry from a candle case; [Ajppellant forcibly removed what jewelry the victims were wearing. He then announced his desire to rape Mrs. Murtaza and tore off her brassiere. Before carrying these intentions further he repeated his demand for money, and was told by Mrs. Murtaza that their money was in the living room in her purse. Appellant ordered Mr. Taha up from the bed and pushed him toward the living room. Still bleeding Mr. Taha headed for the bathroom, at which point [Ajppellant at<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>tacked and stabbed him again. Appellant forced Mr. Taha into the living room where Mrs. Murtaza emptied the small amount of change in her purse onto the floor. Appellant expressed his disappointment. In a relaxed and “very cool” manner he opened the refrigerator, took out a glass container and drank some water. Then he advanced on Mrs. Murtaza, hugged her, touched her breast and reiterated his intent to have intercourse with her. He struck her and threw her to the floor next to her husband. Mr. Taha protested, but was struck in the face and ordered to put his neck down. Appellant then stabbed him again and repeatedly stated that he was going to kill Mr. Taha and then would rape her. At this point [A]ppellant opened his pants and drew out his penis. Mr. Taha arose and began to scuffle with [AJppellant; Mrs. Murtaza ran out of the apartment and onto the street where she saw two police officers, Sergeant Wagner and Officer Miller. She directed them to the apartment where the police officers observed [A]ppellant crouched over Mr. Taha pulling a knife out of Taha’s chest. Appellant was immediately arrested. Mr. Taha died subsequently as a result of twenty-eight stab wounds to his body.</blockquote>

    <p id="b670-5" data-blocks='[["BL_670.4",670,[275,592,1162,417]]]'>In this case, Appellant filed his third PCRA petition long after the PCRA timing mandate expired.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> However, Appellant argues that he satisfied the second, “newly discovered evidence” exception to the PCRA. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(h). Appellant maintains that the statistical study of the Philadelphia criminal justice system by Professors David Baldus and George Woodworth (the Baldus-Woodworth Study)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> was this “newly discovered evidence.”</p>
    <p id="b670-6" data-blocks='[["BL_670.5",670,[273,1044,1164,636]]]'>Contrary to this position, we have previously held that the Baldus-Woodworth study is not “newly discovered evidence” for purposes of the PCRA, because “the statistics which comprise the study were of public record and cannot be said to have been ‘unknown’ to Appellant.” <em>Lark, </em><a href="/a2d/746/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="746 A.2d 585" data-case-ids="11471640,95775" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/0585-01,/pa/560/0487-01">746 A.2d at </a>588 n. 4. Therefore, the argument Appellant raises in asserting that he satisfied the “newly discovered evidence” exception fails. Consequently, because the third PCRA petition filed by Appellant is untimely and does not qualify for any of the exceptions to the timing requirement of the PCRA, the PCRA Court was without jurisdiction to consider its merits. <em>See, e.g., Murray, supra; Fahy, supra.</em>
