The matter proceeded to a week-long jury trial before the Honorable James M. Munley, of the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County. On November 20, 1997, the jury returned a verdict finding that appellee was negligent, but that his negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about Mr. Armbruster’s harm.</p>

Within that motion, appellants also requested transcription of the trial testimony of appellant Charles Armbruster, appellee, and two other witnesses. On December 9, 1997, Judge Munley entered an order directing the stenographer to transcribe the testimony of those witnesses “to aid the Plaintiff in the preparation of his Brief in Support” of the post-verdict motion. The order further directed that “Plaintiffs brief shall be due two weeks after the transcribed testimony is filed with the Prothonotary and the Defendant shall have two weeks thereafter to file a responsive Brief.” In addition, the order stated that argument on post-verdict motions would be scheduled upon the Court’s consideration of “plaintiffs formal written request therefore.”</p>

This is so because the question of evidentiary weight is uniquely suited to the trial court function, while an appellate court sits only in review of the trial court’s exercise of discretion in ruling on the claim. While they acknowledge that the Superior Court has, in certain instances, addressed post-trial claims where the trial court failed to rule on the claims and/or did not file an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> appellants note that these precedents do not involve claims that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that they are therefore distinguishable.

In such instances, he argues, equity and judicial economy dictate that the appellate court stand in the shoes of the trial court and rule upon the claim, rather than automatically award a new trial. In addition, appellee notes that the Superior Court has entertained a variety of appeals where a Rule 1925(a) opinion was not filed by the trial court below and thus, as here, was deprived of the trial court’s views on often-discretionary issues. Finally, appellee notes that the jury’s verdict was entirely consistent with his testimony and that of the defense experts.

As we have noted above, there is some obvious tension between the broad, settled, exclusive role of the fact-finder in assessing credibility and the limited power of trial judges, in narrowly circumscribed circumstances, to overturn those assessments when the judicial conscience is not merely disappointed, or uncomfortable, but “shocked.” To automatically require a new trial in all instances where the trial judge becomes unavailable to rule upon a post-verdict challenge to the weight of the evidence reverses the presumption that <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>credibility is for the fact-finder, makes the extraordinary the ordinary, and wrongly intrudes upon the jury function.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Weight of the evidence claims are, of course, common in trial practice and are often articulated by rote and in the sketchiest of terms. <em>See Brown, </em><a href="/pa/538/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="648 A.2d 1177" data-case-ids="475548,7882479" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0410-01,/a2d/648/1177-01">648 A.2d at 1191</a> (noting that it is “all too common” in trial practice for litigants to present in post-trial motions a boilerplate challenge to the “sufficiency and weight of the evidence”). Moreover, since there are numerous reasons a trial judge may become unavailable to rule on such a claim— including resignation, illness, death, retirement, appointment to another court and election defeat—a rule requiring new trials on undecided weight claims could lead to scores of retrials every year, unduly burdening our already heavily burdened judiciary. <em>See Commonwealth v.

To contemplate such an extreme rule, where weight claims already exist only as an extremely narrow exception to the general rule that credibility is exclusively for the fact-finder, and where the claims are often articulable only in boilerplate fashion, might ultimately force the Court to reconsider whether the power should at all be reposed in trial judges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

We are confident in the ability of our appellate courts to apply this exception appropriately, with an eye to the delicate balance that exists between the jury’s exclusive role in assessing credibility, and our longstanding recognition of the power in courts to allow justice another opportunity to prevail when a verdict nevertheless shocks the judicial conscience. In this regard, we note that our appellate courts are well-familiar with weight claims.

In hewing to this intermediate path, our Court has adopted the prevailing rule in the federal courts and one which is widely followed in the state courts.</p>

I would apply the general rule that an appellate court may not conduct the initial review of a weight of the evidence claim in cases, such as this, where the trial judge is not available to address the claim.</p>
    <p id="b209-7" data-blocks='[["BL_209.9",209,[200,1031,1155,895]]]'>A litigant seeking review of a weight of evidence claim should not be disadvantaged by the absence of the trial judge, a circumstance not within the control of the litigant. When an intermediate appellate court conducts the initial review of the litigant’s weight of the evidence claim under such circumstances, the litigant is effectively deprived of his or her right of appellate review. Where the trial judge who presided over the trial is available to dispose of the litigant’s weight of evidence claim, the litigant is assured of initial review of the claim as well as the right to appellate review of that claim. Where, as here, the trial judge is not available, the litigant is deprived first of the opportunity for review of the weight of the evidence by the jurist who observed the proceedings, and then is deprived of the right to appellate review of the weight of evidence claim. Such litigants will have to file a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, which is discretionary rather than automatic.</p>

      <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>An appellate court by its nature stands on a different plane than a trial court. Whereas a trial court’s decision to grant or deny a new trial is aided by an on-the-scene evaluation of the evidence, an appellate court’s review rests solely upon a cold record. Because of this disparity in vantage points an appellate court is not empowered to merely substitute its opinion concerning the weight of the evidence for that of the trial judge. Rather our court has consistently held that appellate review of the trial court’s grant of a new trial is to focus on whether the trial judge has palpably abused his discretion, as opposed to whether the appellate court can find support in the record for the jury’s verdict. In that regard the Superior Court must review a trial court’s decision to <em>grant </em>a new trial in the same manner as we have required review of the <em>denial </em>of a new trial.</p>

Unless there are facts and inferences of record that disclose a palpable abuse of discretion, the trial judge’s reasons should prevail. It is not the place of an appellate court to invade the trial judge’s discretion any more than a trial judge may invade the province of a jury, unless both or either have palpably abused their function.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[322,1678,1123,523]]]'>To determine whether a trial court’s decision constituted a palpable abuse of discretion, an appellate court must “examine the record and assess the weight of the evidence; not, however, as the trial judge, to determine whether the preponderance of the evidence opposes the verdict, but rather to determine whether the court below in so finding plainly exceeded the limits of judicial discretion and invaded the exclusive domain of the jury.” Where the record adequately supports the trial court, the trial court has acted within the limits of its judicial discretion.</p>
