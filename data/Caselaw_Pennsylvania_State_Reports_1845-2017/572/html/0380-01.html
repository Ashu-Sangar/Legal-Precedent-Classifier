Employer accepted liability for the injury and issued a notice of compensation payable. Appellant received $173.50 per week in total disability benefits based upon his average weekly wage of $200.00. In October 1991, while still receiving disability payments, appellant was incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction. He was paroled in March 1995, but was recommitted to prison in July 1995 for a parole violation.</p>

    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[189,451,1153,738]]]'>The Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) made the following relevant findings: In November of 1995, while appellant was still incarcerated, Employer sent appellant’s workers’ compensation counsel referrals for three jobs, all in Philadelphia, which fit within appellant’s physical restrictions. Based upon the credited deposition testimony of Employer’s medical expert, appellant had sufficiently recovered from his work injury to be able to physically perform the referred jobs. Appellant did not follow through on the Philadelphia job referrals due to his incarceration in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. On November 18, 1996, appellant was paroled and, upon his release, he notified Employer of his willingness to pursue job referrals. Employer did not respond. Appellant sought gainful employment on his own, but to no avail.</p>
    <p id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[187,1215,1153,794]]]'>Based upon these findings, the WCJ concluded that: (1) Employer was entitled to a suspension of benefits from July 80, 1995 through November 17, 1996, due to appellant’s incarceration; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and (2) Employer was entitled to an outright suspension of benefits as of November <em>1995—i.e., </em>the point where Employer forwarded job referrals to appellant—based upon appellant having an earning capacity of $200.00 per week as of that date. With respect to the second conclusion, the WCJ reasoned that appellant’s “incarceration is not a valid justification for failing to respond to the job notices,” and thus appellant had acted in bad faith for purposes of <em>Kachinski. </em>The WCJ also rejected appellant’s argument that the job referrals were inappropriate because they were for positions located in Philadelphia while he was incarcerated in western Pennsylvania.</p>

Upon appellant’s further appeal, the Common<a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>wealth Court affirmed in a published opinion. <em>Mitchell v.

In that appeal, appellant argued, as he had below, that he was entitled to a reinstatement of benefits upon his release from prison because Kachinski’s requirement that a claimant follow-up in good faith on job referrals should not apply when a claimant is unable to pursue the referrals due to his incarceration. The Commonwealth Court panel majority rejected appellant’s argument, holding that “incarceration is not a valid justification for failing to respond to job notices.” The panel majority also found that Employer had complied with “all the requirements set forth in <em>Kachinski,’’ </em>there was nothing in the case law to say that an Employer cannot invoke the <em>Kachinski </em>model while a claimant is incarcerated and, since appellant had failed to respond to the offered positions, he was not entitled to reinstatement of his benefits. <a href="/a2d/734/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="734 A.2d 945" data-case-ids="11547594" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0945-01">734 A.2d at 946-47</a>.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[280,1246,1166,1004]]]'>Judge Doyle dissented, noting that the majority’s decision held, in effect, “that an employer may permanently terminate all future benefits of a claimant because he is in prison.” <em><a href="/a2d/734/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="734 A.2d 945" data-case-ids="11547594" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0945-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/734/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="734 A.2d 945" data-case-ids="11547594" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0945-01">at 947</a> (Doyle, J., dissenting). The dissent also noted that the majority had gone beyond previous decisions of this Court and the Commonwealth Court, which had recognized only that an employer is entitled to a suspension of benefits during a period of incarceration, but did not suggest that a permanent suspension of benefits was an appropriate consequence of incarceration under the <em>Kachinski </em>test. Indeed, the dissent noted, this Court in <em>Banic v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Bd. (Trans-Bridge Lines, Inc.), </em>550 Pa.276, <a href="/a2d/705/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="705 A.2d 432" data-case-ids="11867138,281252" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/0432-01,/pa/550/0276-01">705 A.2d 432</a> (1997), while phrasing the issue from the opposite perspective, had specifically noted that it was an open question: “ ‘the issue of whether a claimant’s release from prison automatically entitles the claimant to a reinstatement of benefits is left for another day.’ ” <a href="/a2d/734/0945-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="734 A.2d 945" data-case-ids="11547594" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0945-01">734 A.2d at 948</a> (Doyle, J., dissenting), <em>quoting Banic, </em><a href="/a2d/705/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="705 A.2d 432" data-case-ids="11867138,281252" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/0432-01,/pa/550/0276-01">705 A.2d at </a>437 n. 8 (emphasis by Judge Doyle).</p>

Noting the conclusiveness of a modification resulting from a finding of <em>Kachinski </em>bad faith under existing Commonwealth Court authority,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the dissent was concerned that “many employers who discover that a claimant has been incarcerated will simply ‘create’ a job and offer it to the incarcerated claimant, knowing full well when it is offered that the claimant cannot possibly appear for an interview, or physical examination, because he or she is in jail.” <em>Id. </em>at 948, <a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">532 A.2d 374</a>. By such a tactic, the dissent noted, the employer may obtain a permanent suspension of benefits based upon mere imputed bad faith by a claimant, which in fact is not bad faith at all since, “unless the claimant escapes from jail to present himself for a job interview ... he may not ‘cure’ his bad faith.... ” The dissent concluded that “[sjuch a scenario not only flies in the face of the humanitarian purpose and policies behind the Workers’ Compensation Act, it is, in my view, unconscionable.” <em><a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">Id.</a></em>

The WCJ credited medical evidence to the effect that the claimant’s work-related injury had resolved to the point where he could have performed sedentary or light-duty work if he were not rendered otherwise totally and permanently unable to work because of his brain injury. The WCJ suspended benefits, but the Board reversed (and the Commonwealth Court affirmed that reversal) on grounds that the employer had failed to prove job availability. This Court reversed, holding that it “would be pointless and would run contrary to the purpose of the ...

The employer argued that it was the fact of incarceration, and not the work-related injury, which should be deemed the cause of the claimant’s loss of earning power. This Court agreed and held that, in such a circumstance, the <em>Kachinski </em>test simply does not apply. Instead, the employer’s entitlement to a suspension of benefits during the period of incarceration stemmed from the more elemental fact that the claimant’s loss of earning power in that period arose from the fact of incarceration and not the fact of the prior work injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <em>Banic </em>was limited to a determination of the propriety of suspending benefits during the period of incarceration and the applicability of <em>Kachinski. </em>As Judge Doyle noted below, the <em>Banic </em>Court expressly reserved “for another day” issues related to the reinstatement of benefits following a claimant’s release from incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 437 n. 8.

Appellant further argues that Employer did not act in good faith, for purposes of <em>Kachinski, </em>by forwarding job referrals to him at a time when it knew that he was incarcerated and could not respond. In appellant’s view, Employer’s job referrals were a mere attempt to avoid paying compensation. Appellant also notes that the language of the 1993 amendment to the Act, providing for the suspension of benefits during a period of incarceration, fully protects employers. He argues that that language should supplant <em>Kachinski </em>in cases involving incarcerated claimants, and the courts should not fashion an <em>ad hoc, </em>more permanent consequence in favor of employers. Furthermore, appellant argues that, under the reasoning in <em>Banic, </em>when benefits to an injured worker are suspended because of incarceration status, those benefits should be reinstated upon the claimant’s release from incarceration, at which point the employer should have to satisfy <em>Kachinski </em>in order to secure a further suspension of benefits.</p>

Employer argues that appellant’s benefits here were properly suspended under <em>Kachinski, </em>irrespective of appellant’s incarceration, because it proved that appellant’s medical condition had changed, and that there was available work within appellant’s remaining medical restrictions. Employer suggests that it was neither appellant’s disability nor the absence of appropriate available jobs which prevented him from re-employment, but rather appellant’s “own actions, placing] himself behind bars” which rendered him unavailable for those jobs. Employer also argues that a continuing suspension of benefits following appellant’s release from prison is proper because it “successfully litigated” its claim upon <em>Kachinski </em>grounds and, furthermore, it should be under no obligation to refer additional jobs to appellant upon his release from prison.</p>

We recognize that this case, unlike <em>Banic, </em>involves a credited change in appellant’s medical condition, which rendered him physically able to return to the work force. But we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that appellant was incarcerated at the time Employer sought to invoke <em>Kachinski. </em>That incarceration directly affects the “economic aspect” of the guidelines <em>Kachinski </em>established, no less than it affected the calculus in the <em>Banic </em>case—operating there to the employer’s benefit by rendering <em>Kachinski </em>inapplicable.</p>
