For example, concerning the mitigation claim, trial counsel retained a psychiatrist, Robert Sadoff, M.D., who evaluated Appellant and prepared a report, which was read into the record during the penalty proceeding and, although Dr. Sadoff concluded that Appellant did not suffer from any mental illness, his report included certain aspects of the family history presently emphasized. Notably, trial counsel chose to have the report introduced by stipulation so as to avoid having Dr. Sadoff cross-examined on the underlying premise for his opinion. Furthermore, trial counsel had a valid reason for not contacting Appellant’s mother, as Appellant refused to provide counsel with her telephone number or allow him to contact her. <em>Accord Commonwealth v.
