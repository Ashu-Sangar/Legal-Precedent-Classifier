Based in large part on statements Johnson gave to police, the record indicated that someone robbed the girlfriend of Bridges at gunpoint on December 7, 1996. The robbers indicated that they were looking for drugs and money. They did not find any drugs or money, but they did abscond with a camcorder and Sony Playstation. News of this incident traveled quickly to Bridges, whose girlfriend informed him that the robbers wore green masks and green “hoodies.” Bridges recalled seeing Damon and Gregory wearing green “hoodies” earlier that day. Bridges and Johnson went to the home of Morales; while there, Bridges grabbed a shotgun and mentioned that he wanted to go to the home of Damon and Gregory and murder them. Bridges showed Johnson and Morales a 9-millimeter Glock pistol that he had on his person.</p>

Soon thereafter, they traveled in a minivan to the home of Damon and Gregory. While Bridges was in the house talking to Damon and Gregory, Johnson noticed a woman unloading groceries next door. Bridges emerged from the house with Damon and Gregory and stated that he wanted them to take care of drug-selling operations while he was away. Damon and Gregory got into the minivan with Bridges, Johnson, and Morales. The group drove to a dirt road near a car lot and construction site. <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>Bridges and Morales got out of the van and asked Damon and Gregory to accompany them to the location where the drugs were hidden. When Damon and <em>Gregory </em>refused, Bridges and Morales returned to the van and Bridges separately informed Johnson that he (Bridges) was going to shoot Damon and Gregory on the count of three. According to Johnson, Bridges then walked around to the front of the minivan, where Damon and Gregory were standing, and shouted, “What’s on station , two and three?” At that point, Bridges started shooting. In his statements to the police, Johnson claimed that Bridges also fired a shot at him, striking Johnson in the side of his torso. Bridges then drove away and Johnson walked approximately two miles to the Queen City Restaurant, where he was subsequently picked up and taken to the hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[285,1137,1161,994]]]'>The Commonwealth tried Johnson separately from Bridges and Morales for the murders of Damon and Gregory. At trial, the Commonwealth presented a crucial piece of evidence contradicting the claim of Johnson that he was not involved as a shooter. The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of a forensic pathologist, who stated that one of the bullets recovered from the body of Damon was a .38 caliber bullet. According to the testimony of the ballistics expert for the Commonwealth, the murder weapon was a .38 caliber handgun; police recovered a .38 caliber handgun close to the scene of the murder. George Robles (Robles), a friend of Johnson who was a witness for the Commonwealth, testified that Johnson possessed a .38 caliber handgun like the one found at the murder scene. Robles also stated at trial that when he visited Johnson in the hospital, Johnson told him that he had taken the handgun with him, had wiped it off with his shirt, and threw it on the side of the road within one-quarter mile of the murder scene. On November 26, 1997, a jury convicted Johnson of two counts of first-degree murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The jury found as a mitigating circumstance in the murder of Damon that Johnson had no significant criminal history.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The jury determined that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance and the court imposed a death sentence accordingly. When determining the sentence to impose on Johnson for the murder of Gregory, the jury found that the mitigating circumstance that Johnson had no significant criminal history was no longer true because Johnson had just killed Damon. “Upon questioning from the judge, the jurors stated that because there was testimony that [Damon] died before [Gregory], [Johnson] would have had a ‘criminal history’ (i.e. the murder of [Damon]) when [Gregory] was killed.” <em>Johnson I, </em>727 A.2d at 1102-1103. Thus, the jury found one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, mandating a sentence of death.</p>

On April 11, 2000, Johnson filed a Motion for an Emergency Stay of Execution and a <em>pro se </em>Petition for Post-Conviction Relief in the PCRA court. The PCRA court appointed counsel for Johnson, who filed a First Amended PCRA Petition on April 26, 2000. After reviewing the Motion for an Emergency Stay of Execution, the PCRA court refused to grant a stay. The court also denied the request of Johnson to file a Second Amended PCRA Petition.

On August 25, 2000, the PCRA court conducted a hearing to determine whether to amend the First Amended PCRA Petition to include those issues raised in the Supplement to the First Amended PCRA Petition. The court permitted the amendment and gave Johnson forty-five additional days in which to file additional materials in support of his position. On October 10, 2000, counsel for Johnson filed a Second Supplement to the First Amended PCRA Petition. As Johnson presented this document to the court more than forty-five days after the August 25th Order, the PCRA court denied the Second Supplement to the First Amended PCRA Petition on October 12, 2000.</p>

Johnson cites to a bail report on Robles, that Johnson contends could have helped him impeach Robles. According to Johnson, the report states that his bail is conditioned upon his appearance at court proceedings, reporting any changes of address, and undergoing drug testing and counseling. We fail to see how this report, if it had been disclosed to Johnson, would have changed the result of the proceeding. In his question to this Court, Johnson refers to other evidence that the police paid off Robles, but he does not cite to any such evidence in his argument. Johnson also posits that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Robles in this regard, but the Record indicates otherwise. Attorney Adams specifically asked Robles the following question: “They gave you bail because you agreed to testify, is that correct?” Trial N.T., 11/20/97, page 523. Robles responded: “No, they gave me bail because I met whatever requirements I needed to make bail.” <em><a href="/us/514/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="514 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="1339057" data-case-paths="/us/514/0419-01">Id.</a> </em>We refuse to find counsel ineffective because he did pursue this argument.</p>

Johnson fails to realize, however, that his several statements to police in December of 1996 severely constrained the avenues of defense left viable for counsel to pursue. In these statements to police, Johnson conceded that he knew Bridges planned to murder Damon and Gregory and that he drove Bridges, Damon, and Gregory to the location of the murders. Trial counsel could not pretend that these statements did not exist, as the jury would consider them. The only credible defense for counsel to present was one in which Johnson admitted the above-recited participation. Counsel chose to submit that it was Bridges, not Johnson, whose girlfriend was the victim of the robbery and that Bridges, not Johnson, had a motive to kill Damon and Gregory. Counsel also argued that Bridges shot Johnson before shooting Damon or Gregory and that Johnson fled the scene immediately, before Bridges fired at Damon or Gregory.</p>

Additionally, counsel presented evidence that Bridges fled the county, while Johnson stayed and met with police, to mitigate the culpability of Johnson. While this strategy ultimately did not succeed, given the evidence against Johnson, it was nonetheless one of the very few arguments that counsel could have reasonably made to the jury.

PCRA, 5/11/01, page 25. When asked by PCRA counsel for Johnson if these mental problems impaired the ability of Johnson to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, Dr. Armstrong replied that they did “because ... they caused him to act without thinking.

Sentencing N.T. 11/26/97, page 1031. Prior to the trial in this case, Johnson had no significant history of criminal convictions, which the jury found as a mitigating circumstance in the death of Damon. However, given the evidence that Gregory died after Damon, the jury found that the (e)(1) mitigator no longer existed. Johnson and the Commonwealth did not stipulate to the existence of the (e)(1) mitigator as to both murders; rather they agreed that at the beginning of the proceedings Johnson did not have a significant criminal past. <em>Rizzuto </em>mandates that the jury find the (e)(1) mitigator with respect to the first murder, but the jury was well within its bounds to reject the (e)(1) mitigator with respect to the second murder.</p>

Trial counsel sought as a mitigating circumstance the age of Johnson. Counsel did present some evidence of Johnson’s drug and alcohol abuse and, as discussed above, had a reasonable basis for not presenting more. Counsel also introduced the testimony of the family members of Johnson to show that he came from a family with problems and that they had high expectations of him.

Counsel conducted a reasonably thorough review and sought relevant information for the penalty phase. He presented his findings in a manner reasonably designed to highlight the positives of Johnson without bringing too much attention to the negatives.

Where the jury is required to rely upon the oral instructions given by the judge in his charge, if disagreement arises concerning the oral instructions, it is more likely that the jury would seek further instructions from the judge to resolve the question. When an issue is resolved by further instructions from the court, that procedure insures that misconceptions are not permitted to infect the deliberative process.

In this regard, Appellant asserts that the mitigating circumstance, by its terms, only applies to prior “convictions,” and that there is no dispute concerning the absence of such convictions regardless of which victim died first. Appellant contends that the jury “erred” by refusing to consider such mitigating evidence based upon the erroneous premise that the order of death of the two murder victims is determinative.
