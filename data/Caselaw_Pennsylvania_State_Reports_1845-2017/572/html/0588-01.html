Mr. Kim called to the store manager, Jai <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>Ho Lee, who was behind the counter.

The bullet entered the left lung and perforated the aorta, the main blood vessel to the heart, and then exited the body. Mr. Lee was pronounced dead fifteen minutes later having bled to death as a result of the gunshot. Appellant and his codefendant fled from the store after the shot was fired.</blockquote>

The court held an extensive evidentiary hearing over the course of several days where appellant was represented by both Attorney Djerassi and present PCRA appeal lead counsel, Michael Wiseman, Esquire, who at the time of the hearings was apparently affiliated with the Defender Association of Philadelphia and is now affiliated with the Capital Habeas Corpus Unit of that organization.

This Court granted the motion to withdraw representation and CLEADA, per Attorney Dun-ham, filed the Initial Brief of Appellant. Thereafter, the Commonwealth, responding to a <em>pro se </em>filing by appellant, filed a petition in this Court seeking a remand for a colloquy to determine whethér appellant desired to proceed <em>pro se. </em>On August 27, 1999, this Court remanded the matter for a limited hearing to determine: (1) whether appellant wished to terminate his appeal; (2) whether he wished to proceed <em>pro se </em>or to be represented by current counsel; and (3) whether he wished to proceed on the basis of the brief filed by counsel. After the hearing, Judge Savitt found that appellant did not wish to terminate his appeal, that he wanted to be represented by Attorney Wiseman, and that he wanted to proceed on the basis of the brief previously filed.

    <p id="b810-5" data-blocks='[["BL_810.5",810,[278,546,1164,1672]]]'>In any event, appellant’s “after-discovered evidence” claim does not warrant relief in the form of a hearing or a new trial. Although appellant never indicates which provision of the PCRA authorizes this particular claim, the only remotely applicable section is 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(vi), which recognizes claims alleging that the conviction or sentence resulted from, “[t]he unavailability at the time of trial of exculpatory evidence that has subsequently become available and would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced.” It is obvious, as a matter of law, that Wheeler’s affidavit provides no basis for PCRA relief under this provision, since it was not exculpatory. In this regard, appellant baldly mischaracterizes Wheeler’s statement when he states that it is a declaration of appellant’s innocence. It is no such thing. The unexceptional fact that Wheeler, while professing “no knowledge” of the crime, recants having previously implicated appellant in a statement to police does not remotely establish appellant’s “innocence” nor does it “exculpate” appellant. Under Wheeler’s new account, he states that he was in no position to know whether appellant was involved in this murder, or not. A witness’s lack of knowledge about a crime is neither inculpatory nor exculpatory; it is, by definition, an irrelevancy. Indeed, the only thing Wheeler’s affidavit conclusively establishes is that Wheeler is guilty of fabrication— either in his initial statement to police or in his post-conviction recantation. But even the fact that Wheeler is an admitted liar is not relevant to the reliability of the verdict in this case. As appellant himself notes, Wheeler did not testify at trial. Since Wheeler’s previous statement to police played no role in the evidence before the jury leading to appellant’s conviction, his present “recantation” remains irrelevant.</p>
