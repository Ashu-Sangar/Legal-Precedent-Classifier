In this case, as in <em>Riccio, </em>the procedural posture of the case was quite different at the time the two different decisions were made; the judge who presided over the trial was in a superior position to reevaluate the question of the products liability release and its relation to the medical malpractice case than was the pretrial judge who made the initial decision. During the trial of the plaintiffs case-in-chief, abundant evidence was presented which established that Appellant was seeking damages in this case for injuries suffered in the work-related products liability case; this supported the conclusion that the release in the products liability case barred the damages, or some of them, sought in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus, under the rationale of <em>Riccio, </em>the rule of coordinate jurisdiction did not apply, and it was not improper for Judge Field to permit the defendant doctors to amend their answers to the complaint to incorporate the plaintiffs release in the products liability case, even though Judge Gordon had denied permission at an earlier stage of the proceedings.</p>

It was thus apparent from <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>the face of the release and the pleadings already of record, at the time of Appellees’ first motion to amend, that the release constituted a possible bar to liability, and hence, that Appellees should have been permitted to amend their answer absent some valid reason for denying the amendment unrelated to the materiality of the release.</p>
    <p id="b364-5" data-blocks='[["BL_364.5",364,[287,668,1159,895]]]'>It should be acknowledged that there was one such potential reason before Judge Gordon at the time at which he initially denied the amendment-Appellant asserted that, given that Appellees’ effort to amend occurred on the eve of the date set for trial, the amendment would be prejudicial. Appellees, however, claimed to have only recently learned of the settlement, and, unfortunately, Judge Gordon did not provide the rationale supporting his order. Moreover, Judge Gordon postponed the trial to consider the motion, and issued his order denying the motion more than one year later. In my view, it was error for Judge Gordon to issue an unexplained, <em>per curiam </em>order denying Appellees’ petition for leave to amend their answer to assert the release in these circumstances, particularly where the basis for the amendment was always known to Appellant, and disallowance of the amendment opened the possibility for double satisfaction of Appellant’s claim for economic damages.</p>

American Republic Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/550/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="550 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="281052" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0254-01">550 Pa. 254</a>, <a href="/a2d/705/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="705 A.2d 422" data-case-ids="11866989,281052" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/0422-01,/pa/550/0254-01">705 A.2d 422</a> (Pa.1997), is distinguishable, however, as that case concerns correction of mistakes at the post-trial motions stage of a civil action. <em>See id. </em>at 262, <a href="/a2d/705/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="705 A.2d 422" data-case-ids="11866989,281052" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/0422-01,/pa/550/0254-01">705 A.2d at 425-26</a> (reasoning that “because the post-trial motion process is distinct procedurally from that of rendering a verdict following a non-jury trial and because the considerations of the judge are different at each procedural stage (rendering a verdict at the conclusion of trial versus correcting mistakes made during the earlier trial process), we hold that the coordinate jurisdiction rule does not apply to bar a substituted judge hearing post-trial motions from correcting a mistake made by the trial judge during the trial process”). Further, while it cannot be <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>disputed that the trial evidence advanced the understanding that Appellant sought overlapping damages in the medical malpractice and product liability actions (and therefore should be limited to a single satisfaction), as noted, this was already a matter of record in the case. While I recognize the concern that the manifest injustice exception to the coordinate jurisdiction rule should be applied cautiously and sparingly, liberal resort to a changed circumstances exception based upon modest developments in the record would implicate precisely the same sorts of concerns in terms of weakening the coordinate jurisdiction precept.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[196,945,1150,255]]]'>Here, the interests of justice and the coordinate jurisdiction rule would best be served by resting the Court’s present disposition on the injustice connected with the denial of the amendment. Such denial was sufficiently erroneous to permit correction upon renewal of the motion.</p>

The more common situation presented in the cases involves an injured person who commences actions against both a tortfeasor and a physician who rendered subsequent treatment. <em>See, e.g., Thompson v.
