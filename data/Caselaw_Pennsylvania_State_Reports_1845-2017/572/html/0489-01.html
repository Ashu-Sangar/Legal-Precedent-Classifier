Appellant beat Mar<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>tin severely and, as a result, was charged with aggravated assault. Appellant’s trial for aggravated assault was sched-' uled for November 1996. Prior to that time, appellant obtained the addresses from police reports of several of the witnesses against him, including Martin. Appellant instructed his then-girlfriend, Kimberly Kistler, to confirm that Martin lived at the address that appellant had obtained. Kistler did so.</p>

At appellant’s request, Kistler called Martin on November 3rd and lured him into what proved to be a fatal encounter. Kistler identified herself to Martin as a woman named “Patty” from Ohio, and claimed that she had met Martin on a prior occasion when he was drunk. She arranged to meet Martin for drinks at the Tobias S. Frogg restaurant in Lancaster between 7:30 and 8:00 that evening.</p>

Frogg well before the designated hour and, after surveying the area, waited in their car for Martin. After Martin arrived and entered the restaurant, appellant slashed the left front tire of Martin’s car, and then he and Kistler lay in wait for Martin in a nearby parking lot. At approximately 8:45 p.m., Martin left the restaurant, entered his car and attempted to drive away. Upon discovering that his vehicle had a flat tire, Martin pulled into the parking lot of an abandoned Dunkin’ Donuts. He then walked back to the restaurant and called his brother for assistance from the restaurant’s pay phone. When Martin returned to the Dunkin’ Donuts lot, however, appellant ambushed him with a knife, slashing Martin’s throat with such force as to leave a wound over eight inches in length and three inches deep, killing him.</p>

She testified that, after Martin had entered the Dunkin’ Donuts lot, appellant drove his track behind the lot, exited the vehicle, and instructed Kistler to drive around the neighborhood for a few minutes before returning to pick him up. After circling <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>the neighborhood for approximately five minutes, Kistler returned to the lot and saw appellant running towards the car. When appellant entered the vehicle, he was shaking, growling and breathing heavily. He was no longer wearing the plaid jacket that he had been wearing when he exited the vehicle earlier. Kistler further testified that, as they were driving on Route 741 near the Route 30 bypass, appellant threw his black Fila sneakers out of the car window.</p>

Appellant instructed Kistler to call his brother, Russell, on Russell’s cell phone and tell Russell to call one John Russo and then use appellant’s parents’ phone to call Kistler back. Appellant also told Kistler to tell the police that he had left Elizabethtown between 6:00 and 6:30 p.m. and had arrived home in New Jersey between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. Kistler further testified that, after appellant left to return to New Jersey, she indeed called Russell Harris on his cell phone and instructed him to call John Russo. Then, Kistler called Russell back at appellants’ parents’ home phone number and instructed him to call her back, which he did.</p>

Then, he called Kistler to tell her that he had made it home safely. Appellant told Ator that he went to look for Russo at the Mardi Gras bar in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. He claimed that he arrived at the Mardi Gras at 10:00 p.m. and asked the owner if Russo was around.</p>

Martin Nowinski, the owner of the Mardi Gras bar, testified that he did not remember appellant coming into the bar and speaking with him on November 3, 1996. Russell Harris testified that, on November 3, 1996, Kimberly Kistler called him on his cell phone at 9:15 or 9:30 p.m. and asked him to call John Russo. Harris testified that he made the call and left a message for Russo telling him to call Kistler. Two minutes later, Harris called Kistler back to tell her that Russo was not home. Harris further testified that he was living with appellant at their parents’ house on November 3 and that he did not see appellant at all on that day. Lurline Harris, appellant’s mother, testified that on November 3, 1996, she had been downstairs in her home until 11:00 p.m. and also did not see appellant at all that day. At approximately -11:30 that evening, however, when Mrs. Harris was in bed, she heard appellant say, “Hi, ma” from outside her bedroom door.</p>

Calhoun further testified that two hairs found in the truck driven by appellant on the night of the murder could have come from Martin. Finally, Calhoun testified that blood found on the knife and the plaid jacket was consistent with Martin’s blood.</p>

Bethel is 38 miles from Elizabethtown and a two-hour drive from East Rutherford. The same card was used to call John Russo from appellant’s workplace, to make a call to Kistler’s home from appellant’s home, and to make a call from Kistler’s home during a period when appellant was in Elizabethtown. Kistler testified that appellant had bought two pre-paid phone cards on the night of the murder. Thus, any alibi was effectively eliminated.</p>

The Commonwealth responds that appellant failed to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>Batson </em>and that, in any event, the trial court properly found that the prosecutor’s articulated reasons for the strike were race-neutral and did not err in crediting the prosecutor’s race-neutral explanation.</p>

      <em>Batson </em>and its progeny restrict, through the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause, the exercise of peremptory challenges based on race in state trials in an attempt to eliminate purposeful racial discrimination in the jury selection process.

But appellant does not identify any juror acceptable to the Commonwealth who was similarly situated to juror E.C. as to all of the factors articulated by the prosecutor as relevant to his decision to strike. Instead, appellant focuses on the identified factors individually. Thus, he claims that the reasons advanced by the prosecutor were pretextual because: five jurors in addition to E.C. allegedly appeared to have difficulty understanding certain questions posed by the prosecutor (jurors 30, 52, 60, 29, and 23); four other jurors appeared to equivocate on the death penalty (jurors 35, 108, 80, and 29); one other juror heard the court allegedly “admonish” the prosecutor after a misleading question (juror 60); and the body language of two other jurors allegedly was similar to that of juror EC (jurors 108 and 29). (Appellant makes no argument concerning the fifth factor identified by the prosecutor, <em>i.e., </em>that juror E.C. appeared to be more responsive to defense counsel than to the prosecutor.) Appellant’s comparison of jurors with select characteristics does not establish that the strike here, which was based upon a combination of reasons, was pretextual. <em>See State v.

In any event, even viewing the factors individually, the trial court’s finding that the strike here was not racially motivated was not clearly erroneous. For example, with respect to E.C.’s equivocation on her ability to return a sentence of death, it is clear that E.C. was not identically situated to jurors 35, 108, 80, and 29, as appellant argues. Before the individual <em>voir dire </em>of juror E.C., the trial court addressed general questions to her panel. E.C. responded affirmatively to the court’s question whether, if a proper case for imposition of the death penalty were made out, the juror would still “have any moral, religious, or ethical beliefs which would prevent you from considering the imposition of the death penalty.” N.T. 1254-55. As the trial court noted in its opinion, none of the jurors eventually seated in this case-which included the four jurors appellant cites as displaying the “same doubts and concerns” as juror E.C. in this regard-indicated that they had such a belief that would prevent them from imposing the death penalty. In addition, during the individual <em>voir dire </em>of those jurors, none of them expressed a moral, religious or ethical belief which would prevent them from returning a verdict of death. Trial Court op. at 9 n. 3. Even if it is assumed that the other jurors cited by appellant equivocated during individual questioning with respect to the death penalty, as appellant claims,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> they did not do so against a background of affirmatively indicating that they had a moral, religious or ethical belief that would preclude them from returning a verdict of death.

The mere fact that Kistler gave a statement to the Commonwealth and ultimately cooperated with the prosecution at appellant’s trial does not establish that she was acting as an agent of the Commonwealth. The second fatal flaw in the argument is that, even if this Court were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that Kistler was acting earlier as an agent of the Commonwealth when she wrote to appellant, <em>Giglio </em>would not command that the letters appellant wrote in response must be suppressed or excluded from evidence.

As a result of Kistler’s letter, appellant claims, he solicited legal advice from his own counsel, the substance of which he relayed in his letter of April 5.

The introduction of appellant’s letter to Ms. Kistler does not implicate the privilege. The letter is not a communication between appellant and his attorney, but it is instead a communication between two non-lawyers. Furthermore, introduction of the letter at trial did not involve counsel testifying against appellant, nor did it involve appellant being compelled to disclose communications between his lawyer and himself.

Pointing to Gehr’s testimony at the subsequent trial, appellant alleges that there were “discrepancies” between Gehr’s account at Kistler’s trial and Kistler’s account at appellant’s trial with respect to Kistler’s efforts to locate the victim two weeks prior to the meeting she arranged which ultimately led to this murder.

Appellant also argues that the Commonwealth took inconsistent positions as to Kistler’s role in the crime: According to appellant, the Commonwealth minimized Kistler’s role in the crime during his trial, but emphasized her role in her own trial, based in part upon the evidence from Gehr. These perceived discrepancies in the Commonwealth’s position respecting Kistler lead appellant to allege that the Commonwealth’s presentation of evidence at his trial was “deceptive.” Appellant then accuses the Commonwealth of failing to take steps after the fact to correct the deception. Appellant also alleges that the Commonwealth failed to disclose Gehr’s favorable “exculpatory” evidence to him. For these reasons, appellant claims that the Commonwealth violated <em>Giglio v.

Furthermore, the Commonwealth disclosed Gehr’s police statement to appellant and, in point of fact, appellant’s counsel employed that statement to impeach Kistler’s credibility.

The Commonwealth never claimed at appellant’s trial that Kistler was uninvolved in this murder. To the contrary, during summation, the Commonwealth noted for the jury that Kistler <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>“told you how she helped kill” Daryl Martin. At appellant’s trial, the Commonwealth argued that appellant was the person who actually committed the murder. At Kistler’s trial, the Commonwealth did not argue that she had physically killed Martin; it argued, instead, that Kistler was guilty of murder in the third degree because she set up Martin so that appellant could kill him. This is entirely consistent with the position that the Commonwealth took at appellant’s trial. Moreover, to the extent that the Commonwealth argued that Kistler’s implication of appellant was believable, but that her own attempt to minimize her role in the killing at her own trial should be rejected, this does not amount to the Commonwealth presenting false evidence. These discrepancies, to the extent they may be characterized as discrepancies at all, were a function of Kistler’s different status in the two trials: <em>i.e., </em>as an accuser of a cohort in one trial, and as the principal defendant in the next. The matters that appellant now identifies as affecting Kistler’s credibility at his trial were issues he properly could elicit at trial and argue to the jury. But these circumstances do not remotely prove misconduct or deceptive conduct on the part of the Commonwealth.</p>

In that case in which the jury found no mitigating circumstances, the appellant claimed on appeal that the jury should have found as mitigating circumstances that he was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance, his age (twenty-five), and “other evidence of mitigation.” This Court rejected the claim, noting that: “It is axiomatic that once a jury has been properly instructed on the nature of aggravating and mitigating circumstances as defined in the statute, as well as on the statutory scheme for balancing one against the other, it is not for reviewing courts to usurp the jury function and to substitute their judgment for that of the jury.” <em>Id. </em>at 1043.

Instead, the Commonwealth notes, its brief cross-examination of Dr. Berger on this point was designed to impeach his credibility and his conclusion that appellant suffered from severe emotional problems and a detachment/attachment disorder by showing that appellant merely had an antisocial personality disorder. The Commonwealth further notes that Dr. Berger agreed with the prosecutor that a lack of remorse is consistent with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder and, thus, it was appropriate to question him concerning whether appellant in fact exhibited that conduct in order to test the doctor’s overall diagnosis.</p>

Dr. Berger answered in the affirmative. The prosecutor then asked whether a lack of remorse is one of the factors that are consistent with an antisocial personal disorder diagnosis, and Dr. Berger testified that it is, but stated that he did not believe that appellant had the disorder. Subsequently, the prosecutor attempted to impeach Dr. Berger with the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM IV), which lists the characteristics of different mental disorders and is used by professionals in the field. The court allowed cross-examination on this subject provided that the prosecutor did not go through the characteristics of all of the different mental disorders. Later in the cross-examination, Dr. Berger reasserted that, in his opinion, appellant was capable of remorse. The prosecutor asked Dr. Berger whether he would agree that there was no remorse for the victim expressed in the letters that appellant had written to Ms. Kistler (which were in evidence). Dr. Berger stated that he could not remember reading any expressions of remorse in the letters but added that, since appellant did not admit to killing the victim, “there couldn’t be anything where he expressed remorse for it.” Dr. <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>Berger also stated that he believed appellant was capable of remorse but had not expressed remorse to him because Dr. Berger had never asked him about it.

Under the DSM-IV, “lack of remorse” is one of seven characteristics, at least three of which are needed to conclude that an individual suffers from antisocial personality disorder.

Furthermore, the Commonwealth never argued to the jury that appellant lacked remorse, much less that his lack of remorse should be considered by the jury as an aggravating circumstance or as evidence rebutting an unpursued mitigating circumstance of remorsefulness. In addition, Dr. Berger’s responses to the Commonwealth’s questions were in no way prejudicial to appellant, since Dr. Berger opined on more than one occasion that he believed that appellant was capable of remorse.

The trial court properly denied the request since there is no entitlement to such an instruction as a matter of right. Appellant did not make the distinct argument that he now <em>raises—i.e., </em>that he then became entitled to a <em>Simmons </em>charge premised upon the prosecutor’s allegedly proceeding to actually argue future dangerousness.

For example, the prosecutor’s argument that this murder was an attack on the criminal justice system, of which the jurors themselves now were a part, did not imply that appellant was a danger to the jurors.

The issue becomes simply whether evidence of the impact of the crime on the defendant’s family is relevant to the imposition of sentence. I must admit that my finding of relevancy in “third party impact” evidence is tied solely to the relevance the Court found in victim impact evidence. Once a value is permitted to be placed on the life of the victim, should not the defendant’s family be permitted to testify that the defendant’s human existence is likewise worthy of value in the eyes of the jury?</p>
    <p id="b728-8" data-blocks='[["BL_728.8",728,[284,1670,1159,419]]]'>Accordingly, because our Court has opened the door to allow the jury to hear evidence regarding the impact of the victim’s death, the door should not now close when the defendant attempts to offer evidence as to the impact the execution will have on his benefactors. Due to this disparity in treatment, I would reverse the sentence of death and remand for a new penalty hearing during which the defendant may present “third party impact” evidence.</p>
