Hernandez requested that the trial court grant him leave to file a direct appeal to the Superior Court <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>On September 4, 1998, the trial court dismissed the petition and granted Hernandez leave to file a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546, subject to its provisions concerning timeliness and eligibility for relief.

As in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the sentence imposed on Eller was greater than that recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, but within the statutory limits. Eller did not seek to: (1) withdraw his plea; (2) have his sentence reconsidered; or (3) file a direct appeal. Therefore, his sentence became final on July 11, 1997. On August 6, 1998, Eller filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>contending that counsel who represented him during his guilty plea refused to file a direct appeal, despite Eller’s request that he do so. The Superior Court denied the motion on August 24, 1998. Eller immediately filed a motion to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>in the trial court, which the court denied <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>on the same day.

In <em>Eller, </em>we <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>expressly distinguished the <em>Hernandez </em>situation, stating the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b677-4" data-blocks='[["BL_677.5",677,[224,447,1113,1165]]]'>The circumstance that aggrieves [Eller] arises not from his alleged reliance upon Superior Court decisions leading him to employ an incorrect form or title for his collateral ac<em>tion—i.e., </em>seeking <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief via a non-PCRA filing rather than via a PCRA petition—but from his tardiness in initiating any collateral attack at all. [Eller] did not seek collateral relief in the form of an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>until more than one year after his judgment of sentence became final. At that point, any petition he filed under the PCRA would have been time-barred, unless he could prove an exception to the time-bar. Thus, [Ellerj’s present request for “equitable” relief seeks an unintended benefit that was, at best, collateral to the Superior Court’s <em>pre-Lantzy </em>holding that this type of claim was not cognizable under the PCRA: the benefit of not being subject to the PCRA’s period of limitations. Even if the PCRA authorized this Court to recognize equitable exceptions to its period of limitations, we would not be inclined to fashion one under such circumstances. [Eller] could have preserved his claim simply by invoking the lower court’s jurisdiction within one year of final judgment. His failure to do so results in the unreviewability of his claim under the PCRA’s time-bar.</blockquote>

The majority approves of that rationale, concluding that “Hernandez reasonably relied upon the decisions of the Superior Court [... ] in which the Superior Court explained that the PCRA is not available for those seeking reinstatement of appellate rights <em>nunc pro tunc </em>unless they are asserting actual innocence, a standard not required for a direct appeal.” Majority Opinion at 482-83 (citations omitted).</p>

      <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>Yet in <em>Eller, </em>we expressly repudiated such a rationale. The appellant in <em>Eller </em>similarly argued that he should not be “penalized” for his reliance on the Superior Court’s pre<em>Lantzy </em>case law. The Superior Court in <em>en banc </em>decisions agreed, finding that it would be “unjust” to apply <em>Lantzy </em>to post-conviction petitioners who had improperly filed <em>nunc pro tunc </em>petitions, since they may then be time-barred from invoking the PCRA by operation of its one-year time limitation. We disavowed this reasoning, stating that “[t]his perceived injustice cannot warrant the judicial creation of an extra-PCRA remedy for claims exclusively reserved by the statute.” <em>Eller, </em><a href="/a2d/807/0838-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="807 A.2d 838" data-case-ids="11354551,312757" data-case-paths="/a2d/807/0838-01,/pa/569/0622-01">807 A.2d at 845</a>. That is because “[t]he PCRA confers no authority upon this Court to fashion <em>ad hoc </em>equitable exceptions to the PCRA time-bar in addition to those exceptions expressly delineated in the Act.” <em><a href="/a2d/807/0838-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="807 A.2d 838" data-case-ids="11354551,312757" data-case-paths="/a2d/807/0838-01,/pa/569/0622-01">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b680-4" data-blocks='[["BL_680.5",680,[281,1173,1161,802]]]'>The majority’s creation of an equitable exception in this case is all the more extraordinary since the court in <em>Eller </em>envisioned the very circumstances present here, and set forth the proper resolution: “given the courts’ liberal construction of <em>pro se </em>pleadings, including pleadings under the PCRA [...], <em>a non-PCRA petition filed unthin one year of the judgment becoming final could and should be treated as one sounding under the PCRA, and appropriate amendment permitted.” </em><a href="/a2d/807/0838-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="807 A.2d 838" data-case-ids="11354551,312757" data-case-paths="/a2d/807/0838-01,/pa/569/0622-01">807 A.2d at 845</a> (emphasis added) (citations omitted). As Hernandez filed his petition to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>within one year of the date on which his judgment of sentence became final, the proper resolution would be to remand this matter so that he could amend his petition. However, as Hernandez did not appeal from the lower court’s decision, I concur in the majority’s result.</p>
