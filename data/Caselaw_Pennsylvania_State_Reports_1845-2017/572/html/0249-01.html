Prior- to the 1974 amendment, Section 302(b) of the Act contained “elective” compensation language, which allowed a statutory employer to opt out of the workers’ compensation system with respect to employees of subcontractors. <em>Fonner, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0903-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="724 A.2d 903" data-case-ids="11639803,1702004" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0903-01,/pa/555/0370-01">724 A.2d at 905</a>. A statutory employer who opted out of the workers’ compensation system was relieved of the obligation to pay benefits to the injured worker, but also lost the immunity from suit provided by the Act. <em>Cf. Swartz v. Conradis, </em><a href="/pa/298/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="298 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1120326" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0343-01">298 Pa. 343</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20A.%20529" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="148 A. 529">148 A. 529</a>, 530 (1929). The 1974 amendment to Section 302(b) eliminated this option for statutory employers, however, obliging them to provide workers’ compensation benefits for the injured employees of subcontractors but making them only secondarily liable in the event the subcontractor failed to provide coverage. In <em>Fonner, </em>we decided whether, when the General Assembly amended Section 302(b) in 1974, it intended to similarly amend Section 203 so that a statutory employer would enjoy immunity from suit <em>only </em>when it had actually paid workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to Section 302(b). We rejected this argument. We held that if the General Assembly intended to amend Section 203 to require, as a precondition to statutory employer immunity, that the statutory employer actually have paid workers’ compensation benefits, it would have done so explicitly. We discerned no legislative intent in the 1974 amendment to the Act to alter our caselaw, which held that payment of compensation benefits was not a prerequisite to eligibility for statutory employer immunity. <em>Fonner, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0903-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="724 A.2d 903" data-case-ids="11639803,1702004" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0903-01,/pa/555/0370-01">724 A.2d at </a>906-907 (citing <em>Capozzoli v.

Accordingly, a statutory employer “is still entitled to its historic immunity as a ‘statutory employer’ from suit for common law negligence” even though “the subcontractor which directly employed the injured worker carried workers’ compensation insurance which paid benefits for the worker’s injuries.” <em>Fonner, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0903-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="724 A.2d 903" data-case-ids="11639803,1702004" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0903-01,/pa/555/0370-01">724 A.2d at 907</a>. In his Dissenting Opinion in <em>Fonner, </em>Mr. Justice Nigro criticized the majority’s interpretation of the statutory scheme, noting the windfall for statutory employers who need not pay workers’ compensation benefits in order to enjoy immunity from suit. <em>Fonner, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0903-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="724 A.2d 903" data-case-ids="11639803,1702004" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0903-01,/pa/555/0370-01">724 A.2d at 908</a>. Although we reaffirm our holding in <em>Fonner </em>that the statutory employer provisions in the Act require this result, we are mindful of the criticism that the scheme breaches the generally understood bargain of the workers’ compensation system by permitting a statutory employer the immunity of the Act without having to “pay” for it. Accordingly, we endorse the principle that, for purposes of Section 203 statutory employer immunity, statutory employer status should be found only where all five elements of the <em>McDonald </em>test are clearly met.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

However, we will affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court because we find a fundamental element of the <em>McDonald </em>test lacking: a contract between the owner and the purported statutory employer. The Board claims that it is in the position of a general contractor, charged with operation -and oversight of the Prison on behalf of the owner, Delaware County. However, the “contract” that the Board claims exists between it and Delaware County consists of the responsibilities for prison oversight and management conferred on the Board by the General Assembly in the Board’s enabling legislation.

There is no “bargaining” between Delaware County and the Board: the responsibilities of the Board to oversee the Prison result from acts of the General Assembly and not an independently negotiated agreement between the Board and Delaware County. Even if Delaware County is the owner of the Prison and the Board is something other than the owner, the absence of a contractual relationship between the two is fatal to the Board’s claim of statutory employer status.</p>

The lead opinion reasons that, because the Board’s responsibilities to oversee the prison results from legislation rather than an independently negotiated agreement between the Board and the County, there is no “contract” for purposes of the first element of the <em>McDonald </em>test. As a result, the Board is not entitled to statutory employer immunity.</p>

As the lead opinion notes, the General Assembly passed enabling legislation, which sets forth the Board’s responsibilities and obligations. I believe that these statutory provisions adequately form the “contract” under which the Board performs the work of managing the County’s prison, and satisfy the “contract” contemplated by <em>McDonald </em>in the more common contractor/subeontractor relationship paradigm.</p>

But for purposes of the “contract” element created by this Court in <em>McDonald, </em>I do, not believe that we are obliged to slavishly adhere to formalistic contract notions. This is particularly so in situations where legislation serves the same purpose as a contract. This case illustrates this point. If the Board and the County had entered into a “traditional” contract for the management of the prison facility, -with all “i’s” dotted and “t’s” crossed, that contract would have specified the Board’s obligations and duties in the four corners of the written instrument. But the enabling statutes already set out those very same obligations and duties—the details of the bargain—for the Board’s operation and management of the prison. Those statutory obligations should be recognized as the “contract” existing between the County as the owner of the premises and the Board for purposes of the first element of the <em>McDonald </em>test.</p>

      <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>To the extent that the lead opinion’s approach suggests that the <em>McDonald </em>test is to be viewed as a straitjacket from which no deviation is permitted, I believe that such an approach will lead us farther and farther afield from the actual language and purpose of the statute and fails to recognize contemporary work situations. The governmental entity in this case is not some mere bystander or potential third party tortfeasor. If the Board had not privatized these services, it unquestionably would be liable for compensation benefits and it would enjoy the concomitant protection of tort immunity. Moreover, if for some reason Wackenhut were unable to pay appellee for the injury here—now, or in the future—it is a safe bet that appellee would be looking directly to the Board as the logical secondary source for compensation payments, under section 302(b) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 462. The Court’s decision today exposes statutorily-created governmental entities to potentially massive tort exposure merely because of privatization—notwithstanding that the injured employee is covered and is reimbursed under the workers’ compensation system for the work injury and that the government exists as a potential secondary workers’ compensation insurer. In light of these realities, I would hold that the Board is the statutory employer of appellee under the Act and, therefore, is entitled to tort immunity.</p>

With that potential liability, however, came the counterbalancing benefit of immunity from common law negligence suits arising from the work injury. It was because of the fact that secondary “employers” could invoke that immunity that this Court, over seventy years ago, set forth its five-part test in <em>McDonald </em>to determine when the vicarious “statutory” employer relationship should be deemed to exist.</p>

The <em>McDonald </em>test only interprets the statute; it does not control the statute. There is something incongruous in a judicial interpretation that would arguably permit secondary workers’ compensation liability in the absence of a formal contract, but would not recognize statutory employer immunity without one.
