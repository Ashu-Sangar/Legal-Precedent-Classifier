Melendez also shared an apartment with appellant. Sometime in May of 1997, Melendez was present when another individual who sold drugs for appellant named “Celo” informed appellant that Jason <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>Bolton had stolen his chain and money. After Celo related this information to appellant, appellant went to confront Bolton. When appellant returned, he told Melendez that he was going to kill Bolton. Sometime later, appellant again told Melendez that he was going to kill Bolton because he was tired of Bolton “messin’ with his peoples.”</p>
    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.5",736,[282,670,1157,256]]]'>Melendez testified that, one night in late May of 1997, appellant left the apartment armed with a handgun and wearing a bulletproof vest. When he returned, appellant informed Melendez that he had just gone to Bolton’s house with a friend and that he had “shot the house up.”</p>
    <p id="b736-6" data-blocks='[["BL_736.6",736,[280,954,1160,581]]]'>Melendez further testified that, on June 11, 1997, he was walking to a laundromat when appellant called to him from the second floor window of LaDonna Johnson’s house. Melendez knocked on the door of the house and was admitted by Richard Boxley. At appellant’s request, Melendez and Boxley left the house to purchase two bags of marijuana and two Phillies Blunt cigars. While Melendez and Boxley were attempting to buy marijuana, they saw Bolton and Tyrone Bryant walking down the street. When Melendez informed Boxley that one of the men was Bolton, Boxley ran to get appellant.</p>
    <p id="b736-7" data-blocks='[["BL_736.7",736,[280,1562,1159,411]]]'>A short time later, Melendez encountered appellant and Boxley and informed them which way Bolton had gone. Melendez, Boxley and appellant then followed Bolton and Bryant for several blocks, during which time appellant stated that he was going to kill Bolton in broad daylight. After Bolton and Bryant had rounded the comer onto Sixth Street, appellant asked Melendez to look around the comer to see where Bolton was.</p>

He also saw three people across the street at a church, four children playing outside and a woman sitting on a porch. Melendez testified that appellant told Boxley to approach Bolton first because Bolton would not recognize him. As Boxley was walking toward Bolton, his gun went off in his back pocket. <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>Bolton looked at Boxley and stepped onto the porch. Boxley then began running toward Bolton and firing his gun. Appellant fired two shots at Bolton as well.

Thereafter, at appellant’s instruction, Melendez hid the firearms used by appellant and Boxley at his mother’s house. These firearms, a 9 millimeter Ruger and a Sturm Ruger double action revolver, were subsequently recovered by the police and were introduced into evidence at appellant’s trial.</p>
    <p id="b737-6" data-blocks='[["BL_737.6",737,[176,1048,1156,889]]]'>Tamika Johnson also testified at appellant’s trial. She related that she was present at LaDonna Johnson’s house on the morning of June 11, 1997, and that she overheard appellant tell Boxley that Bolton had forty-eight hours to live because Bolton had held up one of his boys. Later that day, while she was at a neighbor’s house, Johnson heard sirens and saw appellant, Melendez and Boxley running on Chestnut Street away from the direction of Sixth Street, the scene of the shooting. When she returned to LaDonna Johnson’s house, Tamika Johnson saw appellant, Melendez and Boxley celebrating and yelling, Yeah, we got that nigger. Tamika Johnson testified that appellant instructed her to go to the crime scene and determine whether Boxley was dead. She did so, and, when she returned to LaDonna Johnson’s home and informed appellant that the victim was going to die, Boxley appeared “scared to death” while appellant and Melendez remained happy.</p>

In addition, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence a statement appellant gave to New York City police on July 1, 1997, in which he admitted, among other things, that he used a 9 millimeter Ruger during <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>the incident, that three young children were present at the scene of the shooting, and that he fired two shots at Bolton.

Appellant first alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present an opening statement to the jury. He asserts in summary fashion that, “[t]here can be no logical reason to waive an opening statement in a capital case,” and that the prejudice which resulted from this “unreasonable trial tactic” was “incalculable.” Trial counsel, however, cannot be deemed ineffective <em>per se </em>for failing to make an opening statement. <em>See Commonwealth v. Rawles, </em><a href="/pa/501/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="501 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1782423" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0514-01">501 Pa. 514</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="501 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1782423" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0514-01">462 A.2d 619</a>, 624 (Pa.1983) (failure to make opening statement is within realm of sound trial strategy). Appellant has not offered to prove why trial counsel in this case must be deemed to have had no reasonable basis for declining to give an opening statement. As the trial court noted in its well-reasoned opinion below, trial counsel could have had any number of perfectly reasonable strategic reasons for not giving an-opening statement: “Perhaps the best of these is the fact that there was some uncertainty as to where the Commonwealth’s evidence might lead in this case [and][i]f the Defense were to. have made an opening outright denying the guilt of the Defendant, or averring a different version of facts than those presented, this might have destroyed the credibility of Defense Counsel and endangered their case.” Opinion at 9-10. Nor has appellant attempted to demonstrate how it is that, but for his trial counsel’s waiver of the opening statement, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different. Because appellant has failed to rebut the constitutional presumption that counsel was effective, this claim fails.</p>

That the improper admission of a defendant’s prior <em>non-crimen falsi </em>convictions proffered by the Commonwealth for the purpose of impeaching the testifying defendant’s credibility may be harmful reversible error, however, is not dispositive of the distinct question of whether a defendant was prejudiced as a result of his counsel’s unreasonable introduction of such evidence for a different purpose.

Importantly, the Commonwealth never argued to the jury that the prior conviction was a basis to reject appellant’s testimony on credibility or other grounds. The fact that the reference was not introduced by the Commonwealth to impeach, that it was isolated and not exploited, combined with the strength of the Commonwealth’s evidence—including the testimony of Wilson Melendez and Tamika Johnson, the ballistics evidence linking appellant to the shooting, and appellant’s own inculpatory statements to the police—strongly indicate that, even in the absence of the non-exploited evidence concerning the Riker’s Island assault, appellant would still have been convicted.</p>

In this regard, counsel testified during the post-verdict evidentiary hearing that he had “learned in very, very general terms from talking to [Appellant] that there was some kind of psychiatric problem;” however, counsel did not view such information as significant and did not believe that its introduction would have made any difference. Other than this general discussion with Appellant, counsel made no effort to ascertain the nature and extent of Appellant’s mental health history. Moreover, apart from asserting that Appellant’s role as an accomplice in the killing diminished his culpability and warranted the imposition of a life sentence as opposed to the death penalty, counsel did not introduce any mitigating evidence. Counsel justified such inaction based upon the belief that the proposed mental health evidence would have been inconsistent with the Commonwealth’s proof that Appellant <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>“seemed to be wheeling and controlling the whole, frankly, the whole murder operation.”</p>
