As they neared the vehicle, the officers could see a dog crate that appeared to be full of blood. The officers approached the three men, later identified as Appellee Erik Craven, Appellee Otis Townsend, and William Tench, to see if there was an injured dog to which they could offer any assistance. Tench told the officers that his dog had broken loose and fought with another dog. The officers then heard whimpering sounds from a nearby garage and asked Tench if he owned the garage. Tench responded that the garage was owned by his cousin, but that his cousin had given him permission to use it. Officer Uva then asked Tench if he could conduct a search and Tench consented. At that point, three more men, later identified as Marvin Howard, John Moran, and Phillip Worthy, emerged from the garage and joined Craven, Townsend, and Tench.</p>

Officer Uva also noticed equipment commonly used to train dogs for fighting. After making these observations, Officer Uva exited the garage and asked Tench where he could find the other dog from the fight. Tench said that the dog was in another vehicle parked directly in front of the sports utility vehicle. Upon looking into the second vehicle, Officer Uva found another pit <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>bullterrier covered by a towel.

The statute, however, does no such thing. Rather, under its plain language, the statute only criminalizes attendance at an animal fight <em>“as a spectator.” </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5511(h;l)(6). Webster’s Dictionary defines “spectator” as “one that looks on or beholds; [especially] one witnessing an exhibition (as a sports event).” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY UNABRIDGED 2188 (1993). “Presence,” on the other hand, is defined as “the state or being in one place and not elsewhere[;] the fact of being in company, attendance, or association.” <em>Id. </em>at 1793. The two are clearly distinct. A spectator does more than a person who is merely present at a particular place by happenstance, since a spectator, by definition, makes a conscious choice to view and witness an exhibition. Thus, contrary to the trial court’s finding, Subsection 5511(h.l)(6), like all of the other subsections in Section 5511(h.l) of the animal cruelty statute, does “indicate a conscious and knowing activity by the individual committing [the] crime.” Trial Ct. Op. at 10. We therefore conclude that Subsection 5511(h.l)(6) <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>is neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad as it does not, as the trial court found, impose strict liability on a person merely for being present at a dogfight. Rather, it criminalizes a person’s conscious decision to attend an illegal animal fight as a spectator and by doing so, puts individuals on sufficient notice as to what conduct is proscribed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
