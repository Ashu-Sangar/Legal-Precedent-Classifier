    <p class="author" id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[243,397,369,33]]]'>Justice CASTILLE.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.6",213,[198,468,1153,1015]]]'>The issue on appeal is whether the Superior Court erred in granting a new trial on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object, under the spousal confidential communications privilege set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 5914, to the voluntary testimony of appellee’s wife relating statements appellee made to her while charges were pending against him for the rape of his twelve year-old stepdaughter, B.G. The challenged statements, many of which were recorded by police with appellee’s wife’s consent, included: (1) admissions to having raped B.G.; (2) details of a plan to abduct and rape B.G. and another of his minor stepdaughters; and (3) attempts to intimidate his wife and B.G. into recanting their accusations. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that appellee’s challenged statements to his wife, all of which referred to his past and future-intended sexual assaults upon his minor stepdaughters, were properly admitted at trial. Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the Superior Court on this question and remand to that court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>
    <p id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.7",213,[198,1513,1151,411]]]'>Appellee’s wife, Kim, who had been married to appellee for four years by the time of trial, described their marriage as “sadistic and very violent,” as she endured repeated sexual, physical and mental abuse at the hands of her husband. Throughout the course of their marriage, appellee would order Kim to “step into [his] office,” at which point appellee would take her into the bedroom of their home and physically assault her.</p>
    <p id="b213-7" data-blocks='[["BL_213.8",213,[195,1962,1153,420]],["BL_214.1",214,[281,336,1158,148]]]'>In January 1995, Kim’s four daughters from a previous marriage, including twelve-year-old B.G., traveled from Kentucky where they lived with their biological father, to Pennsylvania, intending to stay with the Spetzers until May. The Spetzers lived in a two-bedroom mobile home with their own two small children, leaving little space for the four older girls, who slept in sleeping bags on the Spetzers’ living room floor. On a Saturday evening in April, B.G. awoke on the living room <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>floor to find appellee fondling her breasts and vagina. Although B.G. repeatedly asked appellee to stop, appellee persisted despite her protests.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[279,507,1162,733]]]'>Within a few days of the fondling incident, appellee told B.G. to sleep in her younger stepbrother’s room on the pretext that she could assist the child in the event of a fire in the mobile home. At around the same time, Kim, who normally went to bed between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and midnight, began falling asleep between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. She later learned that appellee had been surreptitiously drugging her with chemicals that made her drowsy. Appellee, who also normally retired between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., began going to bed between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m. In the same period of time, appellee told Kim that he did not want her daughters to wear bras and underwear to bed, claiming that the bras would cut off their circulation and the girls’ underwear was creating too much laundry.</p>
    <p id="b214-6" data-blocks='[["BL_214.6",214,[279,1264,1162,731]]]'>A few days after B.G. began sleeping in her stepbrother’s bedroom, appellee entered the room while B.G. was sleeping and raped B.G. at knifepoint. B.G. could not scream during the attack because appellee forced a folded tube sock into her mouth, which caused the sides of her mouth to split and bleed. After the rape, appellee threatened to kill B.G. or ruin her life if she said anything to anyone. Appellee again sexually assaulted B.G. on each of the two following nights. Prior to the second rape, appellee put on a condom and applied vase-line, telling B.G., “it would slide easier.” Again, he forced a sock into B.G.’s mouth, but this time he secured it with duct tape. On the third evening, appellee had unprotected, forced sexual intercourse with B.G. During each rape, appellee held a knife and threatened to kill B.G. if she told anyone.</p>
    <p id="b214-7" data-blocks='[["BL_214.7",214,[277,2021,1163,357]],["BL_215.1",215,[201,338,1152,150]]]'>In May 1995, Kim, who was unaware of the rapes, drove her four daughters, her two small children by appellee, her sister and her niece to Kentucky. Kim intended to return her four daughters to their father and then return to Pennsylvania, at which time she and appellee would move to Florida. En route to Kentucky, B.G. told her cousin that appellee had raped her. The cousin informed her mother, Kim’s sister, who in turn told <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>Kim. B.G.’s father also learned of the rapes from a family member and he immediately reported the rapes to the appropriate Kentucky child protection authorities.</p>
    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[199,522,1156,903]]]'>Kim confronted appellee about the rapes over the telephone, at which time appellee became angry and told Kim that she “better make sure that kid keeps her mouth shut. You better tell your sister to mind her own business and you better get your ass back up here.” Kim did not return to Pennsylvania. A few weeks later, however, appellee traveled by bus to Kentucky, retrieved Kim and their two children, and drove them back to Pennsylvania. During the trip to Pennsylvania, Kim told appellee that B.G. and her father had reported the rapes to authorities in Kentucky. She also told him that she was “sick to [her] stomach,” “disgusted,” and “didn’t think [she] ever wanted him to touch [her] again.” Appellee became enraged, grabbed Kim by the back of the head, pulled her head down and forced her to perform oral sex, all while he was driving the car with the couple’s two children awake in the back seat. He then stated: “I think you will do what I want you to from now on.”</p>
    <p id="b215-6" data-blocks='[["BL_215.6",215,[197,1458,1158,364]]]'>They continued to argue about the rapes during the rest of the trip back to Pennsylvania. At one point, late at night near Cumberland, Maryland, appellee became upset and pulled the car into an empty par-king lot. There, he assaulted Kim and choked her while telling her to make sure B.G. “kept her mouth shut,” and that “when I tell you to do something, you’re going to do it.”</p>
    <p id="b215-7" data-blocks='[["BL_215.7",215,[195,1857,1155,528]],["BL_216.1",216,[289,337,1153,95]]]'>Once back at home in Pennsylvania, Kim and appellee again discussed the rapes of B.G. and the fact that Kim’s family was angry with her for not reporting the rapes in Pennsylvania. Again, appellee became very angry and began screaming at Kim, who was two and one half months pregnant at the time. Appellee kicked her, pushed her against a wall and punched her arms, causing bruising. Kim managed to flee from the home and ran down the street screaming that appellee was going to kill her. She went to the home of a neighbor whom she had never met and called the police. The police respond<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>ed and arrested appellee, who was then admitted to Meadows Psychiatric Hospital.</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.5",216,[288,455,1157,618]]]'>Following appellee’s arrest, Kim petitioned for a Protection From Abuse (PFA) order. When she returned home, however, she found a note from appellee’s father stating that he wanted the car, which he owned, returned to him or he would have Kim arrested for stealing it. The note also informed Kim that she had two weeks to vacate her mobile home, which appellee’s parents also owned. Kim testified that she had no money, job, car or place to live on her own, and that she was completely dependent upon appellee and his parents. Therefore, she agreed to withdraw the PFA petition. In response, appellee’s parents returned the car to Kim and allowed her to remain in the mobile home.</p>
    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[287,1104,1160,937]]]'>In an effort to learn more about what appellee had done to B.G., and to determine whether he had abused any of her other children, Kim spoke several times on the telephone to appellee and visited him once while he was at Meadows Psychiatric Hospital. During the visit, appellee told his wife that he did not rape B.G.; instead, he said, “it really wasn’t sex because I didn’t get it all the way in.” He also admitted that he kept B.G. quiet during the attack by stuffing a sock in her mouth and securing it with duct tape and that he “really had her scared with a knife.” Appellee told Kim that B.G. was “so terrified of me after a while she just let me do it.” Kim testified that, as appellee was relating this fact to her, he “was laughing about it like it was fun to him, funny to him that he had terrified her so much that she would do what he wanted her to do without having to terrorize her any more to do it.” Appellee admitted to having raped B.G. five times, and to threatening B.G. that if she ever told anyone of the assaults he would kill her.</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.7",216,[288,2073,1157,308]],["BL_217.1",217,[197,322,1152,358]]]'>In July of 1995, B.G.’s father brought her three sisters and B.G. to Pennsylvania to report the rapes. Both B.G. and Kim made statements to the police about the rapes, B.G. stating what had occurred and Kim reporting that appellee had admitted to her that he had sex with the twelve-year-old B.G., although appellee deemed it to be consensual. Appellee, who <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>had been released from the hospital by that time, became enraged that B.G. and her father had reported the rapes and that Kim was unable to convince them to return to Kentucky and he again assaulted Kim. He threatened to kill B.G. and her father by shooting the tires of their car as they were driving or to follow them to Kentucky and shoot B.G. with his compound bow and arrow as she returned home from school.</p>
    <p id="b217-4" data-blocks='[["BL_217.5",217,[194,705,1155,1210]]]'>On July 14, 1995, appellee was charged with rape, statutory rape and related crimes as a result of his assaults upon B.G., and bail was set at $25,000. While appellee was in jail and after he was released on bail, he continued to engage in a course of conduct designed to intimidate Kim and B.G. into recanting their accusations. During one jail visit, appellee told Kim to tell his lawyer that she had lied to the police about the rapes and to have B.G. write a letter to the District Attorney’s Office stating that she had also lied. Appellee suggested that B.G. write that she had seen a magazine or a newspaper article about rape and that the article gave B.G. the idea to falsely accuse appellee. Kim eventually agreed to appellee’s demands because she was fearful that appellee would soon be released from jail since his parents had the financial resources to post bail. Accordingly, she told appellee’s lawyer that she had lied to the police. Kim also telephoned B.G. and told her that appellee wanted her to write a letter to the District Attorney’s Office indicating that she had fabricated the rapes. B.G. refused. Appellee wrote several letters to Kim urging her to have B.G. write the recantation letter. Appellee also asked that B.G. write letters to him saying that she was sorry, that he was a good stepfather, and that he would never have raped her.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[194,1941,1152,297]]]'>By the time of his arraignment, appellee had been released on bail and had been ordered to stay away from Kim and her daughters. Outside the arraignment courtroom, however, Kim told appellee that she would not lie for him in court and threatened to tell the District Attorney that he was pressuring her to lie.</p>
    <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.7",217,[193,2272,1151,94]],["BL_218.1",218,[286,321,1161,679]]]'>In violation of the court’s protective order, appellee returned to the mobile home that very night, kicked in the door, <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>and forced Kim, who was seven months pregnant at that time, to remove her clothes and get'down on her hands and knees. Appellee then kicked Kim and beat her with his belt, while screaming at the top of his lungs: “what are you going to do, Kim? You’re going to tell the D.A. what? I don’t think so, Kim.... I don’t think you’re going to tell the D.A. anything. I think you’re going to stick with the story lying to my lawyer.” Kim testified at trial that even though she knew she could potentially be jailed for lying to the police and the District Attorney, she would rather be charged with perjury and go to jail than endure further beatings by appellee. Therefore, she agreed to abide by her recantation to appellee’s lawyer about appellee raping B.G.</p>
    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[284,1024,1163,791]]]'>After securing through violence his wife’s promise to lie on his behalf about the rape of her daughter, appellee escalated the pressure on Kim to convince B.G. to recant her accusations. Appellee himself wrote letters to B.G. which he directed Kim to transmit to the child for him, since appellee had been ordered to have no contact with B.G. Appellee told Kim to remind B.G. of the threats that he had made to B.G. after raping her and that he would kill her or ruin her life if she reported the assaults. B.G. testified that, when her mother relayed to her what appellee had said, she felt “scared ... that he might come after me,” and that appellee “would hunt me down and try to kill me.” B.G. ultimately succumbed to the pressure from her mother and appellee, and wrote a letter to the District Attorney, which she provided to her mother, stating that she had lied about the rapes.</p>
    <p id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.6",218,[283,1839,1164,524]],["BL_219.1",219,[195,336,1153,350]]]'>Appellee, apparently not satisfied with his successful efforts to secure recantations from Kim and B.G., attempted to enlist Kim to arrange, a further sexual encounter in a motel with both B.G. and B.G.’s thirteen-year-old sister. At the time, both appellee and Kim were prohibited by court order from contacting Kim’s daughters. Appellee asked Kim to meet the children, who were in foster care at the time, at an area mall and take them to a pre-arranged motel room where appellee would sexually assault both girls while Kim waited in the mall. Appellee, who was not living with Kim at the time, was <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>“obsessed” with the idea of sexually assaulting the two girls, and pressured Kim on a daily basis to arrange the meeting. When, during a telephone conversation, Kim indicated reluctance to arrange the meeting, appellee ended the telephone conversation and went to the trailer where Kim was still living, tied her to the bed, beat her with a stick and threatened to sodomize her.</p>
    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[194,719,1156,671]]]'>This latest assault led Kim to agree that she would arrange a sexual encounter with her daughters and on three separate occasions appellee forced Kim to accompany him to a mall in Altoona for that purpose. The first time, Kim’s daughters were at the mall but Kim did not bring them to appellee’s motel room, which resulted in appellee beating Kim. The other two times, the girls were not at the mall because Kim had never actually arranged to meet them there. After the third failed attempt, appellee beat and sodomized Kim for failing to deliver her daughters as arranged, stating that, “next time I’m going to get the girls to the hotel.... [Y]ou’re going to start doing what I tell you to do. The next time you better get them.”</p>
    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[192,1424,1156,570]]]'>At this point, it became apparent to Kim that appellee was steadfast in his intent to sexually assault her daughters, so she reported his plans to the Pennsylvania State Police. Kim consented to a wiretap interception of her telephone conversations with appellee because, she testified, if she did not do so, appellee “would have eventually one day picked up the kids himself and brought them to the hotel room.” The recorded conversations detailed, among other things, appellee’s previous rapes of B.G., his continuing attempts to intimidate Kim and B.G. into not testifying truthfully, and his continuing intention to arrange for the sexual assault of B.G. and her sister.</p>
    <p id="b219-6" data-blocks='[["BL_219.7",219,[190,2020,1157,360]],["BL_220.1",220,[292,336,1157,673]]]'>In the intercepted telephone conversations, appellee discussed the particulars of his planned sexual assault. Among other things, appellee discussed whether he intended to use a condom; asked Kim to ask the children if they became sexually aroused at the prospect of having sex with him; and requested that Kim bring two packages of “edible underwear” with her on the day of the would-be rendezvous, so that each <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>child could wear one. Appellee also acknowledged the plan for Kim to abduct the girls at the mall and leave them with him in a nearby motel where, he said, he intended to “eat, suck and f—k” the victims. Appellee went on to discuss which of his stepdaughters he intended to “do” first, admitting in the process to his previous rapes of B.G. Appellee stated that he had decided that he would rape B.G.’s older sister first, since B.G. had “already had her taste.” Also, in these conversations, appellee made continuing attempts to influence Kim and B.G. to lie to authorities about the prior rapes. Finally, appellee asked Kim several times over the course of the recorded conversations if she was taping them; she responded that she was not.</p>
    <p id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[291,1040,1160,786]]]'>On the day of the would-be rendezvous, Kim picked appellee up and drove to a motel where she secured a room in her name. Appellee took the key to the room and Kim left the motel. The State Police then entered the motel room and placed appellee under arrest. The troopers retrieved several items from the room, including gray duct tape, two boxes of edible underwear, a box of condoms, and a jar of vaseline. Appellee was charged with numerous counts of intimidating witnesses, criminal solicitation and criminal attempt. The pending rape charges were consolidated with this second set of charges for trial. In July of 1996, a jury convicted appellee of all charges, encompassing some fifty-eight total counts. Appellee filed post-trial motions, which the trial court denied. Appellee was then sentenced to an aggregate term of sixty-three to one hundred and twenty-six years of imprisonment.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[291,1853,1158,415]]]'>Appellee appealed to the Superior Court, raising several claims. Pertinent to this appeal, appellee claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of Efim Spetzer’s testimony regarding communications between the two concerning the previous rapes and the attempts to arrange the sexual assault of B.G. and her older sister. Appellee argued that these communications were privileged under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5914, which provides that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.7",220,[333,2285,1118,95]],["BL_221.1",221,[250,333,1107,140]]]'>Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, in a criminal proceeding neither husband nor wife shall be competent <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>or permitted to testify to confidential communications made by one to the other, unless this privilege is waived upon the trial.</blockquote>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[207,501,1155,523]]]'>
      <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth argued that the communications fell outside the scope of the § 5914 privilege and that, in any event, all of the communications were admissible because the § 5914 privilege was inapplicable, in this instance involving sexual assaults upon appellee’s minor stepdaughters, by operation of 23 Pa.C.S. § 6381(c). Section 6381(c), which is part of the Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), provides that the spousal confidential communications privilege, “shall not constitute grounds for excluding any evidence at any proceeding regarding child abuse or the cause of child abuse.”</p>
    <p id="b221-6" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[206,1045,1153,632]],["BL_222.1",222,[276,334,1161,674]]]'>The Superior Court panel noted that the § 5914 privilege and § 6381(c) of the CPSL “appear to be inconsistent” because “[i]f the communications are deemed admissible that interpretation would appear at odds with § 5914” while, “[cjonversely, if the communications are deemed inadmissible then that interpretation would appear to be at odds with ... § 6381.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The panel further concluded that trial counsel lacked a reasonable basis for failing to object to those communications which were privileged, noting that counsel had testified on post-verdict motions and stated that the only reason he failed to object was because he believed the testimony was admissible under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5913. The panel further found that the prejudice arising from counsel’s ineffectiveness was “obvious,” since the Commonwealth itself had noted that Kim Spetzer’s testimony “might be the only evidence available to prove some of the crimes charged.” <em><a href="/a2d/722/0702-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="722 A.2d 702" data-case-ids="11775680" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0702-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/722/0702-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="722 A.2d 702" data-case-ids="11775680" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0702-01">at 711-13</a>.

    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[275,1040,1164,1217]]]'>In granting a new trial, the panel did not pass upon the admissibility of each of the challenged statements. Instead, the panel articulated for the trial court upon remand a frame of analysis of “the various general categories of communications presented in this appeal,” which the trial court was to employ in determining which communications should be deemed admissible at retrial. The panel deemed generally admissible: (1) appellee’s direct threats to injure or kill his wife, as well as information conveyed as part of the direct threats, since such are repugnant to the intimacy and confidentiality that is the basis of the marital privilege; and (2) appellee’s direct threats to injure or kill his stepdaughters, for similar reasons. On the other hand, the panel deemed generally inadmissible: (1) appellee’s “inculpatory statements or confessions” unless they had a character “affronting” his wife; and (2) appellee’s attempts to solicit his wife to arrange for the sexual assault of her daughters, as wéll as communications revealing his attempts to intimidate and influence witnesses, except to the extent that they were accompanied by actual physical threats. The panel reasoned that statements falling under the latter exclusionary “categories” “bear the hallmarks” of an intimate sharing made within the confidentiality of the marital relationship. <em><a href="/a2d/722/0702-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="722 A.2d 702" data-case-ids="11775680" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0702-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/722/0702-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="722 A.2d 702" data-case-ids="11775680" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0702-01">at 711-13</a>.</p>

This is so because the communications involved were uttered in the context of appellee’s ongoing brutalization and manipulation of his wife in an attempt to force his wife into providing an opportunity to forcibly sexually assault her children. The communications related not to the usual subjects of sharing and intimacy that characterize a marital relationship, but to past and future sexual assaults upon Kim Spetzer and her minor daughters. Furthermore, the communications occurred not just in the context of a brutalizing marital relationship, but also in the context of a legal situation where charges were already pending against appellee for the previous rapes of <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>B.G., and where appellee knew that his wile was a potential witness against him. Certain of appellee’s communications, moreover, were designed to intimidate and influence his wife and stepdaughter to perjure themselves. The Commonwealth further argues that the remaining communications, relating to appellee’s attempt to have his wife arrange for a future sexual assault upon B.G. and her sister, were ongoing efforts directly related to appellee’s manipulation and intimidation of his wife and her minor daughters. The Commonwealth submits that the disputed spousal communications were “part of an ongoing, sadistic and tyrannical reign of threats and abuse [which] is far removed from the sharing and intimacy which form the foundation of any expectation of marital confidence.” In concluding that these communications should not be deemed confidential, the Commonwealth urges that: “The law on confidential communications between spouses should not be interpreted in a manner that would allow one to violently abuse and destroy his family with impunity by shielding himself with a statute designed to enhance and preserve the very unity he is destroying.” Brief for Appellant, 26-33.</p>

      <em>Seitz </em>was a divorce action brought by Mrs. Seitz on grounds of her husband’s adultery. Mrs. Seitz attempted to testify to conduct of her husband which she had witnessed and statements he had made to her which tended to prove the fact of adultery, but that testimony was excluded at trial on grounds of spousal privilege. On appeal, this Court first determined that, under section 5(c) the Act of May 23, 1887,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Mrs. Seitz was “clearly competent to testify to anything she had seen.” <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.%20578" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="32 A. 578">32 A. at 578</a>.

      <em>Whether a communication is to be considered as confidential depends upon its character as well </em>as upon <em>the relation of the parties. </em>It is essential that it should be made in confidence, and with the intention that it should not be divulged. The privilege is based upon considerations of public policy, as in the case of husband and wife to preserve the peace, harmony, and confidence in their relations, and in the case of attorneys and client to secure the unreserved communication which the ends of justice require. If not made because of the relation of the parties and in the confidence which that relation inspires and which it is the policy of the law to hold inviolate, it is not privileged.

No considerations of domestic peace and harmony or of the sanctity of the marital relation forbid their disclosure to redress the wrongs of the injured party.

To the contrary, these communications were intended to further marital disharmony. Of the cases decided by this Court involving the privilege, this case is most like <em>Seitz. </em>Appellee’s statements, like the statements made by the husband in <em>Seitz, </em>“did not relate to the confession of a penitent husband who had confided to his wife the story of his wrongdoing.” <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.%20578" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="32 A. 578">32 A. at 578</a>.

As the Commonwealth aptly notes, “If revealing an extra-marital affair to one’s spouse in a taunting manner is of a character that personally affronts the recipient spouse, then adding the fact that your sexual affair is with the recipient’s twelve-year old child while repeatedly gagging and raping her at knife point, in addition <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>to threatening to kill her should she ever reveal this fact, can do no less.” Brief for Appellant, 29.</p>

Accordingly, we hold that here, as in <em>Seitz, </em>the challenged communications “did not arise from the confidence existing between the parties, but from the want of it,” <em><a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.%20578" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="32 A. 578">id.,</a> </em>and, as such, the communications were admissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Counsel therefore was not ineffective for failing to object to evidence of the communications.</p>

Rather, in light of <em>May, </em>the CPSL is relevant to the construction of § 5914 in a more subtle and indirect fashion. The Court in <em>May </em>recognized that the question of what is a “confidential” communication turns in part on the reasonable expectation the declarant has that the communication will remain confidential. <a href="/pa/540/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="656 A.2d 1335" data-case-ids="472159,7889297" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0237-01,/a2d/656/1335-01">656 A.2d at 1341-42</a>. Even if it is assumed that § 6381(c) does not act directly to provide a broad child abuse “exception” to § 5914’s application in criminal proceedings, it certainly affects what a spouse’s “reasonable expectation” of continued confidentiality may be with respect to marital communications that reveal the previous or intended abuse and intimidation of a child. Thus, in light of § 6381(c), a husband who describes to his spouse his previous rape of her child, for example, or his plans to abduct and rape her children in the future, can have no reasonable expectation under Pennsylvania law that that communication will “remain confidential.” Indeed, appellee admits as much, <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>as he concedes that, “Statements made by the Defendant to his wife that are in question in this appeal could certainly have been used at, and most likely were used at, the Children and Youth Services matter seeking to have the children adjudicated dependent.” Brief for Appellee, 11. In accordance with <em>May, </em>appellee here had no reasonable expectation that his statements to his wife concerning his previous rapes of his stepdaughter, his attempts to intimidate the witnesses in the prosecution arising from those crimes, and the further crimes he intended to commit upon his stepdaughters, would remain their “little secret.” That reality, in turn, destroys any notion that these marital communications would remain “confidential.” For this additional reason, the testimony of appellee’s wife respecting these communications was not excludable upon grounds of privilege, and counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the testimony.</p>

Our conclusion here is not to be read as suggesting that the subject matter of marital communications necessarily controls the question of privilege. Where there is an intact marriage, spouses possess a reasonable expectation of confidentiality as to their shared communications regardless of whether the content of those communications further the nature of the marital relationship. It is only where the communications are intended to create or further disharmony in the marital relationship that the privilege yields. The rationale supporting the privilege should not be utilized in a case such as this to aid one spouse in a tyrannical effort to maintain his abusive hold over the other spouse and her children.</p>
