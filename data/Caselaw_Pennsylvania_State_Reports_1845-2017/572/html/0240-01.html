Thus, as Appellants’ challenge alleged a substantial constitutional question, i.e., the authority to impose the tax, the Commonwealth Court held that the trial court erred in dismissing Appellants’ action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

Further, the court held that the remaining “counts” raised in Appellants’ motion raised issues relating to the valuation of their interest rather than the constitutional claim of lack of taxing authority. Accordingly, the court found that these matters were not properly within the court’s jurisdiction as they would have to be resolved, establish, initially, through the administrative process. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the court’s decision on appeal and, thereafter, on December 4, 2001, we granted allowance of appeal.</p>

Nevertheless, the trial court and the Commonwealth Court concluded that oil and gas rights were within the purview of Section 201. Specifically, the trial court concluded that oil and gas lights fall within the general meaning of the term “[a]ll real estate.” The Commonwealth Court, on the other hand, concluded that oil and gas rights fall within the definition of the term “lands” specifically enumerated in Section 201.</p>

Thus, Appellants argue that because there is no explicit reference to oil and gas interests as proper subjects of assessment and taxation- in Section 201, there was no intent by the General Assembly when enacting this section to tax oil and gas interests. Further, Appellants maintain that because the General Assembly explicitly recognized the taxing of coal interests in other sections of The General County Assessment Law and The Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law, Act of May 21, 1943, P.L. 571, <em>as amended, </em>72 P.S. §§ 5453.101-5453.706, it can be concluded that no such corresponding authority exists as to oil and gas interests.</p>

Appellants point out that Black’s Law Dictionary defines “to wit” as “that is to say; namely.” <em>Black’s Law Dictionary </em>1337 (5th <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>ed.1979). They argue that had the General Assembly desired to merely designate “all real estate” as the proper subject of such taxation and allow this term to be determined by general principles of Pennsylvania property law, it could have so provided; however, this is not what the General Assembly did. To the contrary, the General Assembly provided a lengthy list of the specific subjects of taxation to which it was referring. Thus, Appellants note that if the General Assembly intended to subject all real estate to <em>ad valorem </em>taxation, the lengthy list enumerated thereafter would be meaningless.

However, I disagree with the majority’s application of <em>ejusdem generis </em>because it renders the phrase “all other real estate” in section 201(a) of the Assessment Law ineffective. Rather, I would simply hold that Appellees lacked the statutory authority to tax Appellants’ interests because oil and gas are of a fundamentally different character than real estate.</p>
