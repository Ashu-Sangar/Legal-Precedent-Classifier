(Love), represented Miller’s uncle, Gregory Miller (Gregory) on various matters, and successfully obtained money for Gregory as the result of a variety of civil claims. Specifically, Love settled one claim against the City of Philadelphia, recovering fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) for Gregory. However, Love could not distribute the entire sum to Gregory because of outstanding support orders and child support arrearages.</p>

During the ensuing conversation, Gregory spoke to the others about robbing Love at his office at 1006 Spruce Street in Philadelphia, and mentioned that anyone present at the office might have to be shot. According to the original plan, as <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>devised by Gregory and as testified to by Blakeney, Miller was to be the shooter and Lloyd was to tie up the victims while Blakeney acted as a lookout. Gregory gave Miller a handgun and told Blakeney to go to Love’s office, get a check for ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) from the attorney, and give the check to Lloyd; Gregory instructed Lloyd to take the check to the bank and cash it. Gregory did not accompany Miller, Blakeney, and Lloyd to Love’s office, but before they left for the office, Gregory told the three that the victims would have to be killed and to “leave no witnesses.” (Notes of Testimony (N.T.) September 21, 1999, pp. 27-28).</p>

Brian Barry (Barry), a paralegal, opened the office door, whereupon Miller, Blakeney, and Lloyd entered and Blakeney brandished the gun. Blakeney then told Love to write out a check for ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) while Lloyd tied up Barry. Lloyd departed to cash the check at the bank. Remaining at Love’s office, Miller and Blakeney passed the gun back-and-forth to each other.</p>

September 21, 1999, p. 34). Miller then handed the gun to Blakeney and exclaimed that Blakeney “was a b**** ass n***er if [he didn’t] kill the mother f***ers.” (N.T. September 21, 1999, p. 35). Blakeney then confronted the victims in the back storage room of Love’s office and shot each of them in the head. Blakeney took fifteen hundred dollars ($1500.00) from Love’s person, and then Miller, Blakeney, and Lloyd fled the scene. The three parted ways temporarily. They later met at Blakeney’s house, agreed to split the fifteen hundred dollar ($1500.00) “proceeds” among the three of them, and further agreed to tell Gregory that they did not obtain any money because they could not cash the check.</p>

At Tann’s trial, the Commonwealth, in addition to Patterson and Hill, also called the attorneys who represented Patterson and Hill to testify about the plea agreements.

The defendant is unduly prejudiced by this blatant invitation for the jury to draw an inference from the fact that the witness is foregoing his constitutional right against self-incrimination. This tends to spotlight the accused if he fails to do the same thing and clearly invites an improper prejudicial inference from the jury. In the present case, the Commonwealth’s use of this unwarranted tactic could only steer the jury to infer that since its witnesses, Patterson and Hill, waived their Fifth Amendment rights and <em>willingly </em>gave self-incriminating testimony, Patterson and Hill’s testimony was the truth and entirely believable. Added to this is the circumstance of the appellant Tann not taking the witness stand and failing to offer any testimony in his own defense.

At the Commonwealth’s request, the trial court allowed the plea agreements to be sent out with the jury during its deliberations. The jury subsequently convicted the defendant of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to death. Relying on <em>Tarn, </em>this Court determined on appeal that the trial court committed reversible error in sending the agreements out with the jury. In reversing the conviction, we noted that the language in the plea agreements obligated Rossi and Kellington to tell the truth, and that the signatures of law enforcement officials on the documents that formalized the agreements “placed the imprimatur of their offices as support for the proposition that Rossi and Kellington were <em>telling the truth.” Bricker, </em><a href="/pa/525/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="525 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1823700" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0362-01">581 A.2d at 154</a> (emphasis in original). We further observed that “by admitting into evidence these agreements that vouch for their credibility, the government was testifying <em>sub silentio </em>that <em>‘just this once’ </em>these lowlife witnesses should be believed; that <em>‘during this trial’ </em>they are crowned with the governmental halo of <em>‘being on the right side’ </em>and are therefore credible.” <em>Id. </em>at 155 (emphasis in original). The plea agreements, the Court explained, in effect served as “silent witnesses” from which the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant had the same opportunity as Rossi and Kellington to cooperate, yet chose to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 154-155. Based on this reasoning, we concluded that it was “beyond question that permitting the prosecution to send these documents out with the jury during deliberations impermissibly bolstered the credibility of Charles Rossi and Charles Kellington.” <em>Id. </em>We warned that such “impermissible vouching for witnesses—especially witnesses of this caliber—offends our sense of decency and our <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>notion of the fundamental fairness inherent in our judicial system.” <em>Id. </em>at 155.</p>

I believe Appellant has satisfied the burden of demonstrating that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s questioning on direct examination. <em>See Wallace, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0916-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="724 A.2d 916" data-case-ids="11639881,1701912" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0916-01,/pa/555/0397-01">724 A.2d at 921</a>. Based on the record and the above discussion, it is clear to me that Appellant’s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s questioning of Blakeney on direct examination is of arguable merit. Furthermore, the course chosen by trial counsel to stand by and permit, without objection, the prosecutor’s improper bolstering and vouching of Blakeney's accomplice testimony could have no reasonable basis designed to effectuate Appellant's interest. <em>See Tann, </em><a href="/pa/500/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="500 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="1781046" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0593-01">459 A.2d at 328</a>.

I would note that the trial court conducted a lengthy and thorough charge of the jury, encompassing more than fifty pages of the trial transcript. (N.T., 9/24/99, at 7-62). In addition to the corrupt source instruction, the jury charge included, <em>inter alia, </em>instructions regarding the credibility of witnesses in general, an instruction that statements made by counsel are not evidence and instructions regarding the arguments of counsel. (N.T., 9/24/99, at 14, 21, 52-54). However, in my view, those general charges were not sufficient to remedy any and all error in the direct examination and testimony of Blakeney. Rather, as noted above, a proper cautionary instruction would have specifically addressed the prosecutor's bolstering and vouching in the context of questioning Blakeney.</p>

Notably, although Appellant has not submitted a post-conviction affidavit from a psychiatrist supporting this diagnosis, the fact of Appellant's institutional treatment is undisputed and the testimony of Appellant's mother contains indicia of the diagnosis. Were this case to be remanded for a hearing, presumably, Appellant would present expert testimony from a psychiatrist or other mental health professional. Certainly, the raising of this claim on direct appeal absent the presentation of expert testimony would be disturbing, as such omission is likely to be fatal to the effort to obtain relief and arguably may foreclose collateral review of the mitigating circumstances issue under the doctrine of previous litigation.</p>
