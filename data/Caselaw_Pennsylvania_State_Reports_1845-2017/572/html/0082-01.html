At the time of the accident, Adam resided with his parents, Gary and Christine Colbert, who owned three automobiles, all of which were insured with both UM and UIM coverage under a single policy with Prudential. The Prudential policy did not cover Adam’s vehicle in any respect; indeed, as discussed <em>infra, </em>it was expressly excluded from coverage.</p>

In addition, Adam recovered the maximum amount of UIM coverage recoverable under his policy with State Farm. Adam then made another claim for additional UIM benefits under his parents’ policy with Prudential. Prudential denied coverage on two separate grounds: (1) Adam was not an “insured” under the Prudential policy; and (2) the Prudential policy, in its “other household vehicle” exclusion, expressly excluded coverage of a named insured or household resident for accidents occurring while the insured or household resident was using another owned vehicle not insured under the Prudential policy.</p>

The Prudential policy definition of “insured,” however, purports to narrow the broad classification provided by the MVFRL by deeming resident relatives, such as Adam Colbert, to be “insured” only when they are using a vehicle specifically insured under the Prudential policy. As a result, the policy’s more restrictive definition of “insured” is in conflict with the MVFRL.

First, Adam Colbert owned the vehicle in which he was injured. The reasoning of <em>Burstein, </em>however, was not predicated upon ownership of the vehicle in which the claimant was injured; rather, it focused upon whether the insurer was compelled to underwrite unknown risks that it has not been compensated to insure. <em>See id. </em>at 208. Second, Adam purchased UIM coverage for his vehicle from State Farm Insur<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>anee Company, and was also an insured on his parents’ insurance policy from Prudential. Thus, each of the Colberts’ vehicles were covered by insurance, whereas the employer-provided vehicle in <em>Burstein </em>did not carry UIM coverage.

Thus, <em>Adam received the UIM coverage for which he paid. </em>Nonetheless, Adam also attempted to recover UIM benefits from his parents’ insurance policy with Prudential. Neither Adam nor his parents paid Prudential to insure his car; indeed, the “other household vehicle exclusion” in Prudential’s policy expressly excluded such vehicles from coverage. Likewise, there is nothing to suggest that Adam or his parents ever disclosed Adam’s vehicle to Prudential. Under these facts, voiding the “other household vehicle exclusion” would force Prudential into the same predicament as was the insurer in <em>Burstein: </em>it would be compelled to underwrite unknown risks that the insureds neither disclosed nor paid to insure.

The same would be true even if the insureds never disclose any of the other household vehicles to the insurers.

The plaintiffs decedent, Betty Dymond, was a passenger in a motor home operated by her husband, Fred, when the motor home was involved in a single-vehicle accident in which both of the Dymonds were killed. The motor home was insured under a policy with Foremost Insurance Company, which named both Betty and Fred Dymond as insureds. At the time of the accident, the Dymonds owned three other vehicles, which were separately insured under a policy issued by the defendant, Hartford Insurance Company. The Hartford policy also named both Betty and Fred Dymond as insureds. The plaintiff, who was the daughter of the decedents and the administratrix of Betty Dymond’s estate, recovered the Foremost policy limits and then sought underinsured motorist benefits under the Hartford policy. Hartford denied coverage, citing the family car exclusion in its policy with the Dymonds.

Significantly, and distinct from <em>Eichelman, </em>Adam was listed as a resident relative and driver of the family cars on his parents’ policy with Prudential. Prudential was aware that it was extending coverage to Adam on his parents’ policy and was certainly capable of including that fact in its premium calculation, and very well may have done so.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.6",297,[187,1579,1153,677]]]'>While the exclusion at issue in <em>Windrim </em>is not the same as the exclusion at issue in the case <em>sub judice, </em>this Court’s opinion in <em>Windrim </em>is nevertheless instructive in grappling with the question of public policy, for it enunciates an additional concern with invalidating exclusionary language, <em>i.e., </em>that exclusionary provisions should not casually be invalidated where to do so would create an incentive for families to purchase coverage for only one vehicle and then seek coverage for other household vehicles under that single policy. Here, however, voiding the exclusion will not trigger the concern articulated in <em>Windñm. </em>As I have already noted, appellants purchased policies including uninsured and underinsured coverage on all of their vehicles.</p>

The overriding concern with the costs of insurance cannot alter the fact that a consumer of automobile insurance is entitled to coverage for risks for which he contracted and paid. In this case, appellant parents entered into an insurance contract with Prudential that included coverage for their son, Adam, who also insured his own vehicle. Appellants specifically and voluntarily purchased underinsurance coverage that insurers are required to offer by the MVFRL, but consumers are not obliged to purchase, and they paid premiums for that optional coverage to both Adam’s insurer and Prudential.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[287,1062,1161,518]]]'>For the reasons stated above, the exceptional, policy-based circumstances that led to this Court’s upholding of exclusions in cases such as <em>Burstein, Paylor </em>and <em>Eichelman </em>are decidedly not present here. The majority’s decision upholding the other household vehicle exclusion here, far from furthering the purposes of the MVFRL, instead thwarts them by allowing insurers to deny benefits for which their insureds have specifically paid. Such a circumstance, in turn, provides a disincentive to insureds to pay premiums for coverage not required by law.</p>
