Appellants submitted a claim to Progressive for UIM benefits; Progressive denied the claim, asserting the policy excludes UIM coverage for accidents “that occur while the covered vehicle ... is operated by the excluded driver.” As Christopher was an excluded driver when the accident occurred, no UIM benefits were due.</p>

Therefore, they argue, the public policy of insurance cost containment is not implicated. Instead, appellants suggest the public policy at issue is protection of the insured from the risk that a negligent driver of another vehicle will cause injury to the insured and will have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate the insured for his injuries. <em>See Eichelman, </em>at 1008-09 (citing <em>Paylor, </em>at 1235-36).</p>

The effect of the named driver exclusion was to set the limit of liability for bodily injury to zero. Permitting the recovery of UM/UIM benefits in excess of the liability coverage would be contrary to the statutory scheme of limiting <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>UM/UIM benefits to liability limits. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1736 (limiting UM/UIM coverage increases no greater than limits of liability specified in bodily injury provisions).</p>

To gain UM/UIM coverage under the policy for Christopher, he was required to purchase the cost prohibitive liability coverage. Therefore, to the extent a named driver exclusion operates to bar UM/UIM coverage because of foregone liability coverage, the result is consistent with the public policy of cost containment and consumer choice. <em>See generally Luechtefeld v.

Given the indirect costs associated with obtaining UM/UIM coverage and the ability to reject such coverage, there is no clear legislative pronouncement of requiring public policy UM/UIM coverage for a named driver exclusion. We are compelled to enforce the unambiguous language of the named driver exclusion, which denies coverage “for any claim arising from an accident or loss that occurs while a covered vehicle or non-owned vehicle is operated by the excluded driver.” Accordingly, the decision of the Superi- or Court is affirmed.</p>

The insurers argued <em>Hall </em>required the policy exclusions to be permissible under the MVFRL. This Court rejected the argument and distinguished <em>Hall </em>because it concerned the portability of coverage and not the identity of the underinsured motorist. <em>Kmonk-Sullivan, </em>at 962 n. 6. Relying on 75 Pa.C.S. § 1703, we concluded the MVFRL did not permit the exclusion of all government vehicles.
