Singley, who was also a friend of Fry had, however as Williams’ friend, taken part in the negotiations for the purchase from Fry of his option, was a witness to the paper of August 6,1913, and Singley purchased on the same day, August 6, 1913, 20 shares of the Runock Specialty Company (par value $50) from Fry for $400. Williams was a witness to this agreement. It seems, therefore, that Williams must have known at the time he purchased the stock from Fry that it was worth not more than $20 a share, and that 300 shares could be purchased for $6,000 at that rate, while Fry also included in his sale for the above amount a note for $1,000 and an agreement to have.
