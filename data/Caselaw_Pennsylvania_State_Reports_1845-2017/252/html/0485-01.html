The brother bid $30,160, subject to the sister’s life interest which should be paid in addition to the bid. The sister bid $30,251, and her counsel stated in open court that it was made subject to the sister’s life estate. The court awarded the purpart to the sister, on the ground that her bid was the highest and best. <em>Held, </em>that as the sister’s life interest was a charge upon the brother’s estate, he added nothing substantial to his bid by stating that he took subject to the life estate; inasmuch as he could not escape liability for said life interest by the partition proceedings, and that without reference to what was said in open court, the sister’s bid was the highest and best, and the decree was affirmed.</p>

No objection was made thereto at the time and appellant’s counsel prepared the decree for such award. Then five of the remaining purparts were in due course awarded to appellant and one to appellee; and at the request of counsel the matter was continued to May 7, 1915.

    <p id="b520-7" data-blocks='[["BL_520.6",520,[260,1168,1148,903]]]'>Appellant’s earnest contention that his bid is higher because it is subject to appellee’s life estate seems to overlook the important fact that such life estate was a charge solely upon his part of the estate. He and his sister each derived a one-third interest in fee under their father’s will; then he obtained the other one-third under his brother’s will, but took it subject to the one-half of the one-third life interest in the mansion house given the sister. That is, by her brother’s will, to her one-third was added a life estate in one-half of one-third, or one-sixth of the mansion house, but of course that one-sixth life estate was no charge upon her original one-third, but was a charge upon the one-third of the estate received by appellant from his brother. And if that were all, in this partition she would be entitled to that much more than one-third and he to that much less than two-thirds of the estate.</p>

He could not take otherwise nor escape liability for her said life interest in the mansion house by a partition. Where all parties are represented their respective interests however acquired may be ad<a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>justed in one proceeding; and where, as in this case, they are all before the court it is competent to ascertain and charge or secure a life interest which has arisen since the death of him whose estate is being partitioned: Baker v.

And see Martin’s Est., 1 Chester County Rep. 512. Eliminating as unimportant that part of appellant’s bid, which refers to the life estate, the bid of appellee is the higher and better bid, without reference to what was said in court in explanation thereof, and entitles her to the property.</p>

While this conclusion may seem unjust to her, it is the result of the merger, and in harmony with the understanding of the parties when the allotment was made.</p>
