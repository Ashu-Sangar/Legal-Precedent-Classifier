On that day Mrs. Little having information that said securities in defendant’s possession were liable to be lost, owing to the unsatisfactory state of Mr. Little’s account, took and delivered to defendant additional securities properly authenticated for transfer, to strengthen said account and to protect the securities previously pledged. ^She testifies in effect that she then complained to defendant that her husband had made unauthorized use of her securities <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>in Ms said stock transactions and that defendant then assured her that said securities would not be used in connection with Mr. Little’s future speculations but held until he could repay his said indebtedness^ Defendant in his testimony denies any such understanding, and, in, support of his denial, a receipt made by him on the day she delivered said securities is in evidence as follows, viz:</p>

However, his stock transactions, including some had after December 15,1905, proved so unfortunate that all of said securities, except some unsaleable Acadia stock of the estimated value of eight hundred dollars, were exhausted and disposed of by defendant, prior to June 1, 1906. On that day Mr. Little gave defendant a note of $17,000.00 to settle the balance of the account.</p>
