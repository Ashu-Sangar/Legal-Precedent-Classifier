Callery now presents a petition alleging that he has a- superior right to this fund, and he asks that he be allowed to intervene by Avay of cross-bill. Objection thereto is made by the complainants. The right which he seeks to litigate is based upon his contract with the defendants, Geyer, Stybr and Einstein, whereby they guaranteed that the financial condition of said corporation was as shown to him at the date of the contract, to wit, July 26, 1912. He now avers that the financial condition of the corporation was not as represented, because a large amount of accounts were worthless and a large amount of debts were unreported. This undoubtedly gives Mr. Callery a right of action against Geyer, Stybr and Einstein. This right arises by virtue of their express agreement of guaranty. But that contract was made by Geyer, Stybr and Einstein as individuals and in no other capacity. Mr. Callery has no contract with the complainants; he obtained from them exactly what they agreed to sell him, to wit, their stock at a stipulated price. It is not averred that they even knew of the contract of guaranty, when they transferred their stock. Neither has Mr. Callery any contract with the corporation of which com<a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>plainants are stockholders. In other words, his right of action is against Geyer, Stybr and Einstein alone, it arises solely by contract, and can be litigated only in a court of law. He and the complainants stand in no fiduciary relation; neither do he and the defendants. Consequently, we cannot perceive what interest he has in this fund, either legal or equitable, or how his claim is in any way germane to the matter in controversy. If this be true, the petition must be refused.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b159-3" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[134,824,1150,959]]]'>The fact, that these defendants did not receive the profit, is not sufficient to relieve them of accountability. They were trustees and were therefore bound to exercise good faith to their cestui que trust. They were bound to see that the corporation obtained the entire value of its stock, so that all the stockholders might obtain the benefits. It ivas not the property of the defendants, but it was that of the corporation, which they as trustees were selling. And, when they knew that the stock was worth $64 per share, they could not dispose of it for but $50 per share, upon any arrangement that did not amount to a binding contract previously made in good faith. Their doing so was a violation of their duty as trustees; and, even though they permitted Lang, Guckert, Short and Gray to obtain the profits, the corporation and those who were then stockholders must not suffer by reason of the wrongful act of the defendants.</p>

It is wrell established that, when a party institutes litigation whereby a fund is raised for distribution among a class of which he is a member, the whole fund so realized ought to bear the expense of the litigation. While they do not controvert this principle, the defendants assert that they, as shareholders, ought not to bear part of the expense of litigation against themselves. On first impression this proposition looks reasonable. But it will not bear analysis. It is founded upon misconception of the posi<a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>tion of the defendants. As stockholders, they are interested in the recovery of this fund, no matter who the trustees ex maleficio may have been. But they were not sued as stockholders, nor merely as individuals. They were sued as trustees, and the proceedings were based upon their failure to observe their fiduciary obligations. They must answer for their acts as trustees, and it is of no moment that they happen to be stockholders and as such interested in the fund recovered; If some party other than themselves were the declared trustee, would they not be averring their interest? The circumstance, that they are before the court in a dual capacity, makes no difference in equity. As a matter of fact, it has been decreed that they obtained this fund illegally and have no title to it. By the decree, they become entitled to a legal share thereof — what they did not have previously. What their proposition really means is, that it is of no advantage to them to share in this fund, which they themselves must produce. But that does not touch the question of their legal interest in the same, when raised. We are of opinion that reasonable compensation to plaintiff’s counsel should be charged against the whole fund.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[280,1633,1144,795]]]'>The defendants produced at the trial releases from various parties, who were stockholders of record on July 26, 1912, of all their interest in this fund — the total being 9,025 shares. These were received in evidence under plaintiff’s objection, subject to further consideration. Upon reflection, we think these releases are not proper subjects in this litigation. After the fund has been realized, such stockholders cannot by their action nullify the just results. The defendants must comply with the decree and provide the fund, or so much as is necessary, so that proper expenses may be charged and the lawful stockholders paid. If hereafter any stockholder desires to release the defendants from payment of the share decreed to him, there is no reason why that should not be done. But it cannot be done now.</p>

      <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>J. D. Callery presented a claim for distribution to him, or his assignee, of that portion of the fund distributable to 1,770 shares, as set out in Findings of Fact 4. He bases his claim upon the proposition that, when he purchased said stock, all the rights and incidents thereto passed to him. It is true that all dividends upon stock belong to him who is the holder at the time they are declared. They therefore pass by a sale of the stock to a purchaser. The same is true likewise with respect to any mere increase in the value of stock. If the thing with which we are now dealing were a dividend, or an increase in value produced in the ordinary way, the proposition of Mr. Callery would be sound. But this fund is not a dividend at all; none was ever declared. It does not represent an increase in value — something produced by the employment of the corporation capital and assets. On the contrary, this fund consists of moneys, to which the corporation was rightfully entitled, but which were wrongfully diverted from it by the defendants. It represents the advantage which they obtain for themselves and friends, by a misuse of their fiduciary position, and which equity will not permit them to retain from those who were thereby injured. Those parties, it has been determined in these cases, are the stockholders of the Pennsylvania Light &amp; Power Company of record July 26, 1912. The title, by which these stockholders acquire a right to participate in this fund, is a purely equitable one. Whereas, their title to a dividend upon, or a mere increase in value of, stock is a legal one. It follows, therefore, that this right of these stockholders is not a legal incident of their ownership of said stock. In consequence, such right did not pass to Mr. Callery by said sales, and it is of no importance under what contract he purchased the same. There is no pretense that there was any express agreement to transfer such right to Mr. Callery.</p>

If a trustee be appointed, it does not seem to us that it would be equitable to charge the expense thereof upon the fund. The plaintiff, however, does not insist upon the above method of framing a decree, accepting the statement that the defendants are responsible parties. Therefore, if the parties agree, we see no difficulty in framing a decree, fixing the amount which the defendants must pay, and calculating the amounts to be distributed to each party respectively in accordance herewith; and then the record can be satisfied by each party as he receives or releases the share, so awarded to him. Otherwise, a trustee will have to be appointed for the purpose' of executing the decree. We have stated a conclusion that a trustee should be appointed, in order to finally determine the controversy. But this may be modified hereafter by agreement as above indicated.</p>
