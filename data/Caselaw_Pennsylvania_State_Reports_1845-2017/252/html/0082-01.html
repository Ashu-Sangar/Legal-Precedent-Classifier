Plaintiff took nonsuit as to Fairley. At the conclusion of the trial the defendants asked ús to direct a verdict in their favor, which was refused. The evidence of the plaintiff was not disputed, and we directed a verdict in his favor. The defendants raised no question as to the amount of the verdict, but they set up their discharge in bankruptcy as a bar to plaintiff’s right of recovery. On the argument of the motion of defendants for judgment n. o. v. and in the brief of counsel the sole question raised and discussed was whether the defendants were released by that discharge. The defendants were bankers and stock brokers in this city, and the plaintiff is, and then was, a member of this bar. The plaintiff was a customer of the defendants and did business with them for four or five years. The last business transaction between them was the one out of which this controversy grew, and was this: On January 4, 1909, the plaintiff went to the defendants’ place of business and directed them to buy him 200 shares of the capital <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>stock of the Manufacturers’ Light &amp; Heat Company, and as collateral security gave the defendants two six per cent, bonds of the same company, each of the face value of $1,000. On January 6, 1910, defendants purchased 150 shares of the stock of that company, and on the 10th of the same month 50 shares of the stock of the same company, both purchases being made for account of the plaintiff and the money therefor advanced by the defendants. After thus purchasing the stock the transaction was carried along on the books of the defendants, they retaining the stock and sending the plaintiff monthly statements in which he was charged interest on the amount of the stock purchased, and credited with dividends on the stock so purchased, and the semi-annual payments of interest on the bonds. This was an ordinary marginal transaction in which the plaintiff deposited with the defendants as his brokers two bonds, instead of the cash, as margin or collateral security for the purchase for him of two hundred shares of stock. There is some evidence going to show that on the day that the bonds were deposited the defendants purchased 100 shares of Crucible Steel Company stock for the plaintiff, and that the bonds were put up as margin on that stock. Whether that was the case is of no consequence, as the only account or transaction the plaintiff had with the defendants at the time of their failure, and at the time of the hypothecation of the stock and bonds, was that relating to the stock and bonds of the Manufacturers’ Light and Heat Company.</p>

To secure this latter bank on that note the defendants hypothecated, as a part of the necessary collateral the bonds and stock of the Manufacturers’ Light and Heat Company, then owned by the plaintiff, and which had been pledged by him to <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>secure the defendants on their purchase of that stock for his account. The plaintiff paid the defendants nothing-on account of the purchase of that stock. The purchase price of the stock was $4,450.00 and there was due on that stock, on April 24, 1912, $4,655.66.</p>

On April 25, 1912, the defendants filed their petition in bankruptcy. The plaintiff made a demand of the defendants for the return of his securities before suit, but after their hypothecation, and about the time of their sale by the bank, and offered to give them his check for the amount due on the purchase of his stock. On June 23,1913, the individual members of the firm, as well as the firm, were discharged. On the trial the plaintiff admitted that the referee in bankruptcy granted a rule on him to show cause why he should not affirm or decline his right to participate in a fund derived from the sale of certain collateral pledged to the First National Bank of Pittsburgh, as security for the note heretofore mentioned, and to show his right, if any, to participate in the distribution of the balance derived from the sale of that collateral after payment of the note, and that in answer to said rule he presented his petition and set forth his claim; that the referee filed his report allowing the plaintiff to participate in the distribution and awarded him a dividend of 40% on $4,198.78, being the balance found by the referee to be due the plaintiff. In the brief of counsel for plaintiff he admits that since the trial the plaintiff has received $1,619.63, for which the defendants are entitled to credit. The schedule of bankruptcy show that the plaintiff was listed as a general creditor.</p>

If not, or if it were excepted from the operation of the discharge, we should enter judgment against the defendants. We are of opinion that the plaintiff’s claim was a provable debt, and was released by the defendants’ discharge in bankruptcy. We are forced to this conclusion by recent decisions from which there seems to be no escape, one of which is Crawford v. Burke, <a href="/us/195/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="195 U.S. 176" data-case-ids="3633924" data-case-paths="/us/195/0176-01">195 U. S. 176</a>.

Crawford, et al., were stock brokers that not only sold their customers’ stock and converted, the proceeds, but after doing so made calls on the customer for more margin in order to save the stock, and thereby secured over ten thousand dollars. In that case the customer sued in trover, and in our case in trespass in the nature of trover. The Supreme Court in Crawford v.

We find that in the same case it was held that the provable debts that are excepted from the benefit of a discharge are fraudulent, etc., debts that were in judgment at the time of the discharge, and not fraudulent debts generally. It naturally excites some wonder why a fraudulent debt in judgment should not be released by a discharge, while another debt equally, or more, fraudulent should be released for no other reason than that it'was not in judgment. An explanation is given in a number of cases to the effect that were it otherwise in the act of Congress there Avould be a strong temptation to creditors to show fraud on the part of their debtors in ordinary commercial transactions, and thus avoid a release of the debtor by discharge. The claim of the plaintiff being provable, although it does arise out of the fraudulent act of the defendants in converting his bonds and stock to their own use, it is not Avithin the exception of subdivision 2 of Section 17.

The discharge in bankruptcy was offered in evidence but rejected by the trial court. Conceding that the court should have considered and disposed of the defendants’ motion for judgment on the record with this evidence excluded, the plaintiff acquiesced in the court hearing and ruling the motion on the theory that the discharge was in evidence and before the court for consideration. In his opinion, the learned judge says: “On the argument of the motion of defend<a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>ants for judgment n. o. v. and in the brief of counsel the sole question raised and discussed was whether the defendants were released by that discharge.” The case must be disposed of here on the same theory. It is now too late for the appellant to complain that the court below treated the discharge in bankruptcy as being in evidence and considered it in disposing of the motion for judgment: Safe Deposit Bank of Pottsville v.
