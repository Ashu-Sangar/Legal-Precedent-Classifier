    <p class="summary" id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[281,413,1147,701]]]'>John Marrón, W. W. Weiss, H. H. Yon Schlick and William M. Stieren entered into an agreement to buy 45,000 shares of stock of a corporation and for that purpose a joint note was given by the four parties to the contract. The agreement provided “that in the event that the said John Marrón shall have to pay the face of said note, and if the said W. W. Weiss and H. H. Von Schlick shall not be of ability to contribute thereto, the said William M. Stieren shall be liable and responsible for one-half of said note and interest thereon.” Subsequently Marrón paid the note. This is an action by his administratrix to recover from William M. Stieren one-half of the amount paid by Marrón.</p>

The condition in the agreement on which plaintiff sues is “that in the event that the said John Marrón shall have to pay the face of said note and that the said W. W. Weiss and H. H. Von Schlick shall not be of ability to contribute thereto the said William M. Stieren shall be liable and responsible for one-half <em>(y2) </em>of said note and the interest thereon.” The defendant does not set up an affirmative defense and a denial would be sufficient if it was as full as the averment in the statement. It “denies that the said Weiss and Von Schlick were not of ability to contribute” and this is evasive.</p>
