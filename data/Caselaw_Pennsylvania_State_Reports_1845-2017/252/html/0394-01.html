(2) At the death of Nancy Neel her brothers and sisters and the children of any brothers and sisters then deceased took a vested interest and estate in all of the corpus of such estate which passed into the hands of her trustees. (3) Upon the death of the testatrix, one-fourth of the corpus of her estate became vested in her brother, Isaiah White, and upon his death, intestate, it passed to his next of kin as follows: One-fourth to his niece, Adella Neel, and the remaining three-fourths in equal shares to her brother, Samuel H. White, and her two sisters, Lucinda Taylor and Mary Pearson. (4) At the death of the testatrix, Samuel H.

(5) The accumulations now in the hands of the trustees of the decedent pass to the administrator of the estate of Adella Neel, who was the only child and therefore the next of kin of Nancy Neel. (6) It appears that the trustees have paid collateral inheritance tax amounting to $4,750.00, being the tax on one hundred thousand dollars, less the discount. In the foregoing calculations this tax paid has been all charged to accumulations. The auditor is of opinion that so much of said sum as would pay the tax upon the corpus should now be charged against that fund and credited to accumulations. The balance of the amount paid will be a credit upon such tax as may properly be found to be chargeable against the accumulations upon the final distribution of that fund.”</p>

In dealing with the subject of the character of the estate for distribution, whether real or personal, the auditor said: “It is to be noted that the will authorizes and empowers the trustees to make sale of the real estate at any time they may see fit, and directs that the proceeds thereof shall be held upon the same trusts and for the same purposes as the personal estate. At the death of her daughter, Adella Neel, she (the testatrix) provides for the distribution of her estate in the form of money, and, for that purpose, again gives to her trustees authority to sell any real estate then unsold, with the further provision that all of her estate shall be converted into money and that it shall be so distributed. The language of the will scarcely constitutes a positive direction to sell the real estate, but, in order that the trustees may execute the will according to its purpose and intent, there would appear to be an absolute necessi-. ty to sell any of the real estate remaining unsold at the death of the daughter, Adella Neel, in order to make distribution of the estate in the manner provided under the will. The auditor is of opinion, that there is under the provisions of this will such a blending of realty and personalty of the decedent’s estate as to show that she intended to create a common fund from both and to bequeath such fund in the form of money; ......it is apparent, therefore, that the provisions of the will worked a conversion of her real estate into personalty, thus breaking the descent and vesting the entire estate as personalty: Dundas’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="64 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1021302" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0325-01">64 Pa. 325</a>; Darlington v.

In relation to this, after reviewing the will of Nancy Neel, and numerous relevant authorities, the auditor concluded that “the bequest to the brothers and sisters of the testatrix, or their children, gave a vested interest immediately upon the death of Nancy Neel......, and the interests of any of the brothers and sisters who died prior to the death of Adella Neel......(and without issue) would pass immediately to their personal representatives.” Notwithstanding the able arguments presented by the appellants against this view, on the facts at bar, we are not convinced of error. The interests given to the brothers and sisters of the testatrix were willed to persons in being and ready to take actual possession immediately upon the death of her daughter, Adella, and these bequests were not upon an express precedent condition that the legatees should be alive at the time of the distribution, as in Roney’s Est., <a href="/pa/227/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="227 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1008514" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0127-01">227 Pa. 127</a>, 129, and other such cases; but the words of the will are, “I will, devise and bequeath all my property......at the death of Adella to and among my brothers and sisters, share and share alike,” and then the testatrix annexes the substitutionary clause, “the children of any now or then deceased brother or sister to represent his or her parent and take the share he or she would take if living.” The contingencies provided for, as this will was written, were such as might defeat the estates taken by the several brothers and sisters after they had vested, but, under the relevant authorities, these estates were so vested at the death of the testatrix that, upon the demise of any one of the legatees in the lifetime of Adella, without children him or her surviving, the interest in question would pass to his or her legal representatives; nevertheless, the estates given to the brothers and sisters were always subject to be divested, during the life of Adella, first, by the latter dying leaving children (Packer’s Est.

Neither does it depend upon the defeasibility or indefeasibility of the right of possession; for many estates are vested without possession, as well as with, which are yet defeasible. If there is a present right to a future possession though that right may be defeated by some future event, contingent or certain, there is nevertheless a vested estate.” Moreover, a legacy will always be regarded as vested rather than as contingent unless the language of the will plainly indicates that the testator had a different intention ; and here, when we consider that the brothers and sisters of the testatrix were alive and ready to take at the date of her will, and at the time of her death, and that her daughter, Adella, because of her physical and mental condition, was never likely to marry or have children, it is plain that the testatrix, in all probability, intended to vest an estate in such brothers and sisters. As said by the present Chief Justice in Rosengarten v. Ashton, <a href="/pa/228/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="228 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="969908" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0389-01">228 Pa. 389</a>, at page 396, in distinguishing Carstensen’s Est., supra, “the brothers and sisters of the testatrix were in esse at the date of her death, and the time when they were to come into possession of their legacies was fixed by the will, to wit, at the death of Edward Carstensen (here, Adella Neel);...... the bequest was not qualified, but absolute and immediate; there was no condition precedent attached to the gift <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>which the legatees were required to fulfill prior to receiving the bequest; the time fixed by the testatrix for the enjoyment of the ulterior interests in her estate was not annexed to the legacies themselves and was in no sense a part of the description of the objects of her bounty; and it was evident that the only object of the testatrix in the postponement of the distribution of the estate among her brothers and sisters was a desire that she had to give her husband (here, her daughter) a life interest in it.” If it were not for the substitutionary clause above quoted, there could be no question raised but that the interests taken by the brothers and sisters were vested, quodam modo, at the death of the testatrix, subject to be divested should Adella die leaving children her surviving (Packer’s Est., supra) ; and, under the rule in Carstensen’s Est., supra, it is clear that the substitutionary clause did not change this condition of affairs, but merely added another contingency, the happening of which might defeat the estate taken by any one of the brothers and sisters. . In short, the meaning of the language employed in the bequest under consideration is not that the brothers and sisters must live to the time of distribution in order to take a vested interest, but that the estates given to them respectively shall vest at once upon the death of the testatrix, and that the decease of Adella leaving children her surviving, or the demise of any one of the brothers and sisters, during the lifetime of Adella, leaving children him or her surviving, shall defeat the estates thus vested.</p>

On the facts in that case, as in many others of its kind, so far as concerns its final determination, the result would have been precisely the same whether the limitation <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>over were construed as a contingent remainder or as one vested, quodam modo, subject to be defeated. The will in the Frasier case and the one at bar are not alike, and the decision there does not control here; the language of the present limitation is much more similar to that employed in Carstensen’s will (<a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a>, at p. 326). While, after the several limitations in her will, the present testatrix provides, “and for the purpose of distributing the estate to and among whichever class shall happen then to be entitled I do authorize, etc.,” yet, when this language is taken with its context, it is clear that the word “class” is not meant in a technical sense. The testatrix, on the one hand, gave her residuary estate to her lineal descendants, and on the other, in default of such descendants, then to her collateral heirs, and these two sets are what she plainly had in mind when she used the word “class”; by the phrase “shall happen then to be entitled,” we take it that the testatrix meant — shall happen to be entitled to the beneficial enjoyment of my estate at the death of Adella, and nothing more. The general subject covered by the branch of the case now before us has been so fully discussed in recent decisions of this court, comprehending practically all the points urged by the present appellants, that it would serve no useful purpose to go further into the matter at the present time; it is sufficient to say that we agree with the conclusions in relation thereto reached by the auditor and affirmed by the court below.

The questions to be determined are whether such increase, now amounting to more than $48,000.00, constitutes unlawful accumulations in violation of the statute, and whether it is to be distributed as part of the original fund and to the same persons, or otherwise. Counsel for the kindred of Adella Neel on her father’s side contend that this increase of the fund constitutes unlawful accumulations and that, as to such amount, Nancy Neel died intestate, and, therefore, the same would pass under the intestate laws to her daughter, Adella Neel; while counsel for the brothers and sisters of Nancy Neel and their issue contend that the entire fund, corpus and increase, should pass (to them) under the terms of the will giving the estate at the death of Adella Neel without children to brothers and sisters of the testator or their children, that this provision operates as a residuary clause and the beneficiaries thereunder should be entitled to take as residuary legatees.”</p>

Notwithstanding the fact that there is no direct and positive language to accumulate and capitalize the income, the auditor is of the opinion that the statute applies whenever the result of the directions in the will is to produce accumulations and capitalization thereof under conditions which do not comply with the provisions of the statute, although in such case there may have been no conscious intention on the part of the testator to direct unlawful accumulations. As was said in White’s Est., 8 Pa. D. R. 33, 35, by Penkose, Judge, ‘Accumulation is forbidden by the act no less where it results by indirection than where it is expressly ordered.’ The same lan<a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>guage is quoted with approval by the lower court in Weinmann’s Est., <a href="/pa/223/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="223 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="960970" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0508-01">223 Pa. 508</a>, 510, and approved by the Supreme Court on appeal......If the result of carrying into effect the provisions of the will has produced accumulations beyond the period and not within the conditions provided by the act, then such accumulations are void......It is true, that in several instances the courts have refused to terminate the trust and to order a distribution of the accumulations prior to the death of the person for whose benefit the trust was created, but the auditor is unable to find any authority for the decision that accumulations may thus be made lawful. The courts have permitted accumulations to be kept intact on the theory that they may be necessary to provide for future contingencies, but these rulings have not effected the disposition of such accumulations upon the termination of the trust. In the case now in hand......it is ably contended by counsel for the brothers and sisters of the testatrix and their issue that the purpose and intention of the testatrix was that her entire estate remaining after the death of her daughter, should pass to and become vested in her own blood relations. There is sufficient in the will to justify this conclusion. If this contention be true then it was the intent of testatrix, as expressed by her will, that the corpus of the estate, together with any accumulations which might possibly be in the hands of the trustees, at the death of Adella Neel, should go to her brothers and sisters or their issue. If, however, this was her intent, then such intent would be unlawful so far as it concerns any accumulations now in the hands of her trustees under the act above mentioned, since these accumulations were not to be made during the minority of any person, nor during the minority of a person who would Tor the time being if of full age be entitled unto the rents, issues, interests and profits so directed to accumulate.’ If, therefore, the indirect result of the provisions of the will of testatrix has brought about accumulations and these accumulations were not <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>in. favor of either class of persons mentioned in the act they could not he.considered lawful, and would, therefore, fall. If, on the other hand, there was no intent to accumulate beyond the limits prescribed by the act, then it cannot be assumed that the testatrix intended that such excess as now appears to exist should pass under the provisions of her will. If she did not have in contemplation that there might be any such excess, or increase, then it cannot be successfully contended that she disposed of such increase by her will. If, therefore, the testatrix did not have an intention of creating any accumulation, or increase, of her estate in the hands of her trustee she could have no intent to provide for the devolution of the whole fund, principal and income, to her brothers and sisters and their issue; if this be the fact, then she must be held to have died intestate as to the accumulated income now in the hands of her trustees and such sum would pass as if Nancy Neel had died intestate.”</p>

In negativing this view of the case, the auditor said that, under the decisions already cited, he could not sustain the above stated contention, for, according to the terms of the will, the brothers and sisters, or their issue, were not entitled <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>to actual possession of any part of the estate until after the death of Adella Neel, and the residuary estate itself was the subject of the provision that, in effect, directed the accumulations; citing- in support of this what was said by Judge Penrose in White’s Est., <a href="/pa/227/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="227 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1008544" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0069-01">supra,</a> to the effect that, if the unlawful accumulations relate to a vested interest, taking effect in immediate possession the released income goes at once to the beneficiary, but, if to an interest not vested in immediate possession, the income goes to the residuary legatee or devisee, “unless the residuary estate itself be the subject of the provision, in which case the income goes under the intestate laws to the next of kin or heirs” (see also Grim’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>, 397; Rhodes’ Est., <a href="/pa/147/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="147 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="829834" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0227-01">147 Pa. 227</a>, 231; Roney’s Est., <a href="/pa/227/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="227 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1008544" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0069-01">supra, 131</a>; Wright’s Est., <a href="/pa/227/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="227 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1008544" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0069-01">supra, 74</a>; Sternbergh’s Est., <a href="/pa/250/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="250 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1017013" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0167-01">250 Pa. 167</a>, 171).

Walter’s Est., <a href="/pa/223/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="223 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="960961" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0598-01">223 Pa. 598</a>, where Barger’s App., <a href="/pa/100/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="100 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="498473" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0239-01">100 Pa. 239</a>, was relied upon by the appellant, as it is by some of the present appellants, more nearly approaches the case in hand than any other called to our attention, and the distinction sought to be drawn between that case and the present one, that there the gift was an absolute bequest of all the income to the testator’s son, while here the daughter of the testatrix is given no such absolute right, is not tenable. The right of the son in Walter’s Est. and of Adella Neel under the will at bar, for all purposes apropos to the decision of this case, practically accord; both had interests in the nature of equitable tenants for life; in each instance the trustees who held the legal estate were vested with discretionary power over the expenditure of the income; and in each instance <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>the accumulations were awarded to the personal representative of the only person who in life enjoyed such income. The award in neither instance, however, was because the person in question had been entitled to the beneficial enjoyment of the income during life, but owing to the fact that he or she was the sole heir at law of the testator or testatrix, it being especially stated in Walter’s Est., <a href="/pa/223/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="223 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="960961" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0598-01">223 Pa. 598</a>, 600, “the testator must be taken to have died intestate with respect to the accumulations which the auditor distributed.” Therefore, the contention of appellants that the income in Walter’s Estate “having been given to him (the one who enjoyed such income during life), it (the accumulations) must pass to his administrator,” has no force; for that was not the reason of the decision, as already indicated, the decree in that case resting upon exactly the opposite ground, i. e., an intestacy. -It is to be noted that the testamentary provision in Walter’s Estate was an express spendthrift trust, which is also true of Carson’s App., <a href="/pa/99/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="99 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="446168" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0325-01">99 Pa. 325</a>; and this is sufficient to dispose of the appellants’ contentions wherein the present case is treated as being in the nature of a spendthrift trust. Finally, we feel that the cases relied upon by the court below fully sustain the auditor’s conclusions that, “Whether the testatrix in this case intended the income should be capitalized and made a part of her general estate passing to her brothers and sisters and their children, or whether there was no such intent and yet the results of the directions of her will have produced such accumulations, in neither case would the conditions of the Act of 1853 be complied with, and the provision of the will which undertakes to dispose of them would fall, further, there being no residuary gift which is not itself affected by the direction to accumulate, the fund must pass to the next of kin under the intestate laws;” that is to say, to Adella Neel, who was the next of kin living at the time of the testatrix’s death (Gorgas’ Est., <a href="/pa/248/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="248 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1011466" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0343-01">248 Pa. 343</a>), and, she being <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>deceased at the date of the adjudication, the award was properly made to her personal representative.</p>
