A copy of the lease is attached to and is a part of the statement. From the lease itself it appears that it was made in accordance with and by virtue of an ordinance of the city council, authorizing the directors of public service to lease the “said real estate to the highest bidder, according to law,” &amp;c. The lease is for a term of ten years, at the annual rent of $6,000, payable $500 monthly in advance. The defendant paid rent from April 1, 1912, to the last day of August, 1913. Plaintiff’s present suit is for fourteen months’ rent from September 1,1913, to October 1,1914, including the rent for October.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b652-3" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[266,1136,1142,314]]]'>There is no denial in the affidavit of defense that the defendant went into possession under the lease, or that it paid the rent as stated, or that it has not paid the rent for the fourteen months sued for, or that it has been and is now in the peaceable, uninterrupted and full possession of the demised property.</p>

This criticism of the affidavit is Avell founded. The facts upon which the legal conclusions are sought to be based are not set forth with sufficient distinctness. Proper data should be given from which the conclusions in the affidavit would logically follow.</p>

This objection to the affidavit in the present case is well taken.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b653-3" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[152,743,1146,970]]]'>There is no rule of law better settled by the decisions, in nearly all jurisdictions, “that a tenant in undisturbed possession of the demised premises is estopped to deny the title of his landlord, as such title existed in him at the time of the inception of the tenancy.” As far as the pleadings in the present case show, the plaintiff was in possession of the leased land at the time the lease was executed. The defendant by accepting the lease and going into possession thereunder, impliedly admitted the title of the landlord. We cannot find that this case comes within any of the exceptions to the general rule. Defendant went into possession at the date of the lease; there was no fraud, mistake, duress or misrepresentation at the inception of the transaction; defendant’s possession has remained undisturbed; there has been no eviction of the defendant from the premises or any part thereof, and neither the lessor nor the lessee has been disturbed in any way by a paramount title.</p>
