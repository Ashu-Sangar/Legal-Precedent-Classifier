The length of the wagon from the end of the pole was twenty to twenty-one feet. Sitting beside the plaintiff, who was driving, was an employee named Sciotti.</p>

At the first rail of the car track he said he looked again and saw the car at about League street, ninety to one hundred feet south of him, and he kept on and had nearly cleared the west track when the left back wheel of his wagon was struck by the car, his wagon overturned and plaintiff and Sciotti thrown to the ground.</p>

The plaintiff testified, when the team was at this position, he saw the car at Washington avenue, about two hundred feet distant. When he looked again his horses must have traveled about twelve feet to reach the east rail of the track, and the car had then reached League street, about ninety to one hundred feet distant. The plaintiff then drove upon the track and had gone about twenty-five or twenty-six feet when the car struck the rear left wheel of his wagon. In other words, while he covered twenty-five feet the car traveled ninety to a hundred feet. Kim-ball and League streets are not principal streets at which cars stop for passengers.</p>

The conductor was off the car, he was looking along the tracks..,... It was on the south side of the tracks. The car was going along slowly (page 5a). When I first saw the car it was at Washington avenue. I started to cross. As the horses were near the track, I again looked and the car was within the first rail. The car was then at League street......When I saw that the car was that distance, I kept on crossing, as I said, and all at once I felt the car jolt into1 my wagon— knocked into my wagon and hit the left wheel — and my wagon was overturned” (page 6a).</p>

A. — Yes, sir,” he replied.that he had, hut it was a mistake (page 10a). He was then asked, “Q.— Then you say that the second time you looked this car had crossed those tracks at Washington avenue and was coming up Thirteenth street approaching Kimball street? A. — The wagon is a covered wagon, and of course, after I had gotten in the tracks, my duty was to look ahead. I couldn’t look through the covering of the wagon. Q. — Now, your first look was when the seat was at the house-line, wasn’t it? A. — I looked the first time, yes, sir. Q. — And the second time when your horses were just on the rail, according to your statement to-day? A. — Yes, sir” (page 11a).</p>

Some cars go slower, some cars go easier. This car that did this damage was going fast as fast could be.” “I saw the car first on the railroad tracks there at Washington avenue......I just saw the car as it was crossing the railroad tracks. It was coming north. I then heard the noise of a wagon coming from some direction, but I did not see it because it was coming along Kimball street. I saw the wagon when it reached the line there at Thirteenth street. I saw the horses’ heads. Then I saw the car coming from Washington avenue at full speed. The wagon was loaded — it was going along slowly, because it was pretty heavy. The wagon had almost passed the track when the car struck it. The car barely touched it and turned the wagon — spinned the wagon around — spinned it around to the sidewalk and the macaroni all fell out and the two men who were in the wagon also fell to the ground.” The car “stopped (after striking the wagon) at the corner of a small street called Mott street......about ninety or a hundred feet above Kimball street (pages 13a and 14a).</p>

This testimony seemed to be a compromise between what he testified in chief, “As the horses were near the tracks, I again looked and the car was within the first rail. The car was then at League street,” (page 5a), and his testimony in the Sciotti case that the half of the wagon had already passed the track when he looked the second time: Moser v.

To drive on the track was, therefore, taking a risk of a collision, and to depend wholly upon the motorman of the car to avoid one.</p>
