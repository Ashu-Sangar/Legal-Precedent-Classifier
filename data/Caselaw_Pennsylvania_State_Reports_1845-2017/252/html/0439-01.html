It further appears that the part of the roof which they regarded as dangerous had nothing to do with the accident, being <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>from ten to twelve feet away from where the accident occurred. Counsel for the plaintiff has endeavored to bring out certain testimony as to notices or failure to instruct the employees, but if there was failure, unless that failure to instruct them had something to do with accident it does not make the defendant liable.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[248,679,1150,1239]]]'>In the first place, my difficulty in the case is that the statement of claim is so indefinite. So far as one gets any light on the case from the statement of claim, it amounts to no more than saying that the company failed to observe the mining laws and therefore it is responsible. When we come to the testimony of the witnesses, I adduced from it that the real point in the case is that there was a dangerous roof to this part of the chamber, and that the fall of the coal from this dangerous roof, which the company either knew was dangerous or ought to have known was dangerous, is the negligence alleged. That seems to be the theory of the case. When we come to the testimony of the witnesses which is offered to support that theory, we find that they do not testify that the dangerous part of the roof caused the injury, but, on the contrary, that the coal fell from the part of the roof which they regarded as safe — which they had tested with their drills and regarded as safe. Consequently, we have the fact that a part of the roof which the miners themselves, who had tested it, regarded as safe, fell upon this boy, the part which they did regard as dangerous being twelve to fifteen feet from where the miners were standing and not being the part that fell.</p>

The company or individual operating a mine is not an insurer of the safety of the miners working there and in order that they may be held liable for an accident of this kind, negligence must be shown.
