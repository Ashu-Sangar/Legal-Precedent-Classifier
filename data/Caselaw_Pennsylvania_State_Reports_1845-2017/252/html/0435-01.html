In an action against a street railway company to recover damages for the death of plaintiff’s husband, binding instructions were properly given for the defendant where it appeared that at the time of the accident deceased was riding a bicycle in close proximity to defendant’s street car track; that a ear approached from the rear striking the handlebar of the bicycle, causing deceased to fall under the car, killing him; that had deceased looked before going in proximity to the tracks he must have seen the car about thirty feet away and observed the extent to which it overhung the track; and there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the motorman operating the ear.</p>

Each rode on a bicycle. On reaching 16th street both men turned left into that street. DeBeck, who had been riding about 75 feet ahead of Smith, crossed the 16th street car track and proceeded north<a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>ward on the roadway between the track and the east curb. When he passed the west house line of 16th street a car operated by the defendant was at Wallace street (180 feet south of Melon street), moving north on the 16th street trank. Smith rode north on the roadway of 16th street between the car track and the west curb, on a line “a couple of feet” from the west car rail. The distance of that rail from the west curb is approximately 10 feet, 5 inches. At that time a portion of this space was occupied by a wagon which was standing in front of a livery stable on the west side of 16th street, some 30 feet north of Melon street, “straddling” the curb in such a position as to leave a free passage at least four feet wide between it and the car track. As Smith turned from Melon street into 16th street, the car which, when DeBeck noticed it, had been at Wallace street, was only thirty feet from him. Smith was riding slowly, “just crawling along.” When he had gone about ten feet northward on 16th street, he was overtaken by the car, which struck the handlebar of his bicycle, and threw him to the ground. He fell beneath the car and was instantly killed. The car ran about thirty feet beyond the point of the collision before it could be stopped. It had been moving at the rate of ten miles an hour. None of the witnesses who testified on this subject heard any signal of its approach given. The car was from twelve to eighteen inches wider than the ordinary passenger car, being one of those employed by the defendant in hauling ashes. Melon street is 32 feet wide. It does not extend east of 16th street, but ends on the west side of that street. The accident occurred at five minutes past six o’clock p. m., while it was still light.</p>

If he did <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>not do this he was guilty of negligence which contributed to bring about his mishap. If he did what the law required of him in this respect, he undoubtedly saw the car that subsequently struck his bicycle, since it was then distant but thirty feet and there was still light enough for him to see it. Such being the case, it was apparent to him that this car overhung the track to an extraordinary extent. In approaching the west rail so nearly as he did he, therefore, acted imprudently, and exposed himself to a known danger. Moreover, it does not appear that the car was moving at an excessive rate of speed, or that the motorman had any reason to anticipate that, in face of a car so near at hand, the deceased would hug the track with his bicycle so closely as to get in its way..</p>
