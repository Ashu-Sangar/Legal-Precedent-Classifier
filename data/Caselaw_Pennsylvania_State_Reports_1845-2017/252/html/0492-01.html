The relationship of the parties to this transaction is far from clear, although the defendant was afforded the fullest opportunity by obtaining leave to file two supplemental affidavits of defense, of which privilege he availed himself. The transaction apparently was one in which the judgment note executed and delivered by Stern to defendant was employed to raise money for Stern, instead of the mortgage mentioned in the assignment, which was first in contemplation. When, instead of demanding cash from Nellie Gallagher, defendant used the note to pay his individual indebted<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>ness to her, lie became tbe purchaser of tbe note and liable to tbe plaintiff and Stern for tbe proceeds.
