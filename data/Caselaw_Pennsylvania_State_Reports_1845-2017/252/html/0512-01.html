It has no capital stock and conducts its business upon the mutual plan. The accounting officers of the State have made four settlements against the defendant company for tax on gross premiums, from each of which settlements the company has appealed. Trial by jury has been duly waived. From the evidence, submitted we find the following</p>

The member pays during his early years a sum in excess of the current cost of his insurance. This excess is applied to the creation of a reserve or individual insurance fund, which serves to maintain the insurance in the later years, when the stipulated level premium would be insufficient to meet the current cost of insurance on the natural premium plan. At the end of each year the excess of income over disbursements is ascertained, and after setting aside so much of said excess as is required for the increase in policy reserves and other liabilities the balance is treated as a resource, enabling the company thereafter to demand from the policyholders less than the stipulated premium. Each policyholder’s share in this so-called fund is then ascertained and before his next premium falls due he is advised of the amount thereof, and that the company, if he wishes to use it in abatement of premium, will accept in full settlement of such premium the difference between the premium written in his policy and the amount standing to his account with the company which has arisen out of the previous premium payments. Unless used in the abatement of premiums the policyholder may, if he desires, withdraw his share of the so-called fund in cash, permit it to accumulate; or this share is paid to him if he discontinues his policy, or is paid in addition to the amount insured if the policy becomes a death claim. For the first year of each policy the company invariably collects the maximum premium stipulated in the policy, and such premiums form part of the company’s taxable income for their respective years. This method of calculating premiums and ascertaining and disposing of the excess at the end of each year is practiced not only by the defendant company but other mutual life insurance companies generally.” One of the by-laws of the defendant company thus provides:</p>

The owner of this policy shall have the right in any year to have the current dividend arising from such participation applied to reduce the premium, to increase the amount insured, or to accumulate to its credit at 3 per cent, compound interest per annum, which accumulation will be payable at the maturity of the policy, or may be withdrawn at any premium anniversary.

It is not alleged that the company received notes for the whole or any part of this amount, nor that any credit was given the company for the whole or any part of this sum. Indeed no credit could possibly have been given to the company for it is not pretended that there was any obligation of the company upon which <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>credit could have been given by policyholders for the premiums payable by them respectively. The company simply had in its possession money due to its policyholders, which money the policyholders requested should be credited upon the premiums payable by them respectively, and it was accordingly done. The policyholders alone received credits. It is only credits received by the company which are taxable under the statute, and the company received no credits in any of these transactions with its policyholders. The maximum premiums named in the several policies were neither demanded nor received by the company. Under the terms of the contract the policyholders had the right to demand that their respective shares of their previous contributions over and above the actual and necessary expenses of the company should be credited upon the maximum premiums at each premium paying period, and that upon payment of the balance the policies should respectively be continued in force until the next premium paying period arrived.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b549-3" data-blocks='[["BL_549.4",549,[168,1457,1150,532]]]'>The principle here involved was considered and decided by President Judge Simonton of this court in Commonwealth v. Penn Mutual Insurance Company, 1 Dauphin Repr. 233. The question there raised was whether these abatements upon premiums was to be regarded as earnings or income of the company taxable under the Act of May 1, 1868, P. L. 108, and it was held that they were neither earnings or income. In so concluding Judge Simonton uses the following language (p. 239) :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b549-4" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[168,2002,1146,429]],["BL_550.1",550,[263,360,1156,1241]]]'>“We think the so-called ‘dividends to policyholders’ are not net earnings or income and do not represent such earnings, and that defendant is not liable to tax in respect to them......It is strenuously contended by the able special counsel for the Commonwealth that because these abatements are entered on the books of the company as dividends to policyholders or sprplus to policyholders they therefore represent net earnings or income, <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>and furnish, a measure of the liability of the company to taxation. Whatever these statements may be called, they are in reality what we have stated in the findings of facts. The amounts they represent are mere negative quantities, abstract statements not of what is or is to be received or to come in, but what is not to be received. The calculations are made for the express purpose of determining how much of the amount which the company might receive shall not be received, and one of the items which make up the apparent amount upon the basis of which this calculation is made, is the sum which was abated and not received during the preceding year. In short, the whole proceeding is merely a method by which the books of the company are made to show what would be the actual gross debtor and creditor accounts of the company if the whole amount of the premiums was collected and a part was afterwards returned to the policyholders, while in fact it is neither collected nor returned. The reason for fixing the premium stipulated for at a ‘higher rate than sufficient under ordinary circumstances to cover the risk is, of course, that the company may be strong enough to stand in case of extraordinary mortality among its members.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[275,1613,1142,425]]]'>This decision of Judge Simonton was cited at length and approved by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company v. Kentucky, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20Ky.%20L.%20Rptr.%20338" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="33 Ky. L. Rptr. 338">33 Ky. L. R. 338</a> (107 S. W. Repr. 802), in which the State of Kentucky by statute imposed “A two per cent, tax on all renewal premiums received in cash or otherwise” and it was held that abatements upon premiums were not taxable; the conclusion being thus stated (p. 343) :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[274,2049,1145,373]],["BL_551.1",551,[165,352,1146,1137]]]'>“The difficulty which surrounds the appellant in this case grows out of its method of bookkeeping and its use of terms out of their ordinary signification. What really happened in every case was that the stipulated premium was much larger than the company actually needed to carry the risk,under ordinary conditions; but if extraordinary conditions should arise, the whole might be <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>needed. Thus, if an epidemic swept over the country the losses among the policyholders would perhaps be abnormal, and then the company would need the full amount of the contract premium. Now, in order to prepare in advance against such untoward contingencies of the future the company collected the first year the full amount of the premium and set aside so much of it as was overpayment, as a guaranty against misfortune; and then said to its policyholders: ‘You need, not pay hereafter the full amount of the stipulated premium, but may omit the overplus because we have already collected from you more than you should have paid under ordinary circumstances, and we are holding that as protection against extraordinary losses’......The company, on its books calls this a dividend, and pretends to credit the annual premium with it. Now, the truth is that this overpayment is not a dividend in any sense of the term; nor is the failure of the company to collect the full amount of the premium in after years a credit in any sense of the term. A sum of money applied as a credit can never be used for the same purpose again.”</p>
