Two suits in equity were brought to compel a building and loan association to pay off two ground rents and a mortgage on properties owned by the respective plaintiffs. It appeared that plaintiffs had applied to defendant for first mortgage loans to pay off encumbrances on the properties which they owned; that defendant’s conveyancer was plaintiffs’ agent for obtaining the loans; that defendant’s treasurer issued orders in plaintiffs’ name which were given to the conveyancer, that plaintiffs endorsed the orders and returned them to the conveyancer who obtained a check from the treasurer in his own name as attorney, for the amount of the loan, less fees, dues and premiums, that it was the custom of the association for the conveyancer to receive money advanced and after settling all liens and claims against the property to pay over the balance to the person obtaining the loan; that in accordance with this custom the conveyancer cashed the check and paid the part due the borrowers, but embezzled the part of the money applicable to the payment of the encumbrances, and reported to defendant that the mortgages were first liens on the real estate in question.

Frank A. Friend, a real estate broker and defendant’s conveyancer, attended to both applications and all other matters incident to the transaction for both plaintiffs and defendant. He received the money from the defendant association and embezzled the part which should have been applied in redeeming the two ground rents and in paying one of the two mortgages. The learned counsel for the appellant properly concede that although the assignments of error are numerous they present but a single controlling question, viz: Did Friend embezzle the money in question as the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s agent? The learned chancellor held he was the defend<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>ant’s agent, and decrees were entered in accordance with the relief prayed for in the bills. The defendant contends that some of the findings of fact are not supported by the evidence, but that if the facts were correctly found, the court erred in holding that Friend was acting as defendant’s agent and hence drew an erroneous conclusion of law as to the liability for the loss occasioned by his embezzlement of the money.</p>
    <p id="b625-3" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[158,816,1147,1626]],["BL_626.1",626,[279,368,1140,1339]]]'>It may be conceded, for the purpose of disposing of these appeals, that Friend was the agent of the plaintiff during part of the transaction in obtaining and securing the loan. In fact, it may be admitted that he was his agent until the checks were given by defendant’s treasurer on which Friend drew the money with which to pay the ground rents and the two mortgages. The order on the treasurer was. issued by the defendant in the name of the plaintiff and was delivered to Friend but, as the court properly finds under the evidence, with the express or implied understanding that under no circumstances should the plaintiff get control of it, and that all he had to do was to endorse it and let Friend carry it away. Friend took the order to the plaintiff who signed the receipt attached thereto and endorsed the order so that Friend could get the money. He subsequently presented the order to the treasurer of the association who drew a check to the order of “Frank A. Friend, attorney,” for the amount of the loan, less small amounts for fees, dues and premiums. The defendant was to have a first mortgage on the property of the plaintiff to secure its loan, and the encumbrances had necessarily to be removed before the defendant’s mortgage, as understood by the parties, would be a first lien on the real estate. Friend was elected as one of defendant’s official conveyancers who are required to be members of the association, and had served in that position for several years prior to the date of the loan. His duties were not defined by the by-laws of the association, but the court found, from sufficient evidence, that it was the custom <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>of the association for the conveyancers to receive money advanced by the association, and after settling all liens and claims against the property to pay over the balance to the person obtaining the loan. Custom and usage of the business in which an agent is engaged form part of his authority: 31 Cyc. 1330; Laussatt v. Lippincott, 6 S. &amp; R. 386; Williams v. Getty, <a href="/pa/31/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="31 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="985104" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0461-01">31 Pa. 461</a>; Brooke v. N.

In accordance with this custom and usage, Friend drew the money on the check and paid the part of it due the borrowers. He did not pay but embezzled the part of the money applicable to the ^payment of the ground rents and one of the two existing mortgages on the properties, and reported to the defendant association that its mortgage was the first lien on the real estate. The procedure in the transaction, it will be observed, was in strict accordance with the custom and practice of the defendant association in making all its loans. The orders in the two cases were issued respectively on August 6 and 7, 1912, but the bonds and mortgages to secure payment of the loan by the plaintiff to the defendant were not executed until September 30th following, thereby affording sufficient time for Friend to pay the existing claims against the properties before he took the securities for the defendant’s loan.</p>

Cairns, <a href="/pa/133/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="133 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="812950" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0114-01">133 Pa. 114</a>, 120, we are required to look closely into the facts to discover in which capacity he did the fraudulent act. It is true that the plaintiff was required to satisfy the existing claims against the property, but it is clear that the defendant did not intend to place the money in his hands for the purpose and permit him to use his pleasure in doing so. Had such been the defendant’s intention the check for the amount of the loan would have been made payable to the plaintiff and not drawn to the order of Friend, a member of its association and its agent, to settle liens and claims against the properties before he paid the bor<a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>rower his share of the loan secured by the mortgage to be given the defendant. It does not appear that the officers of the defendant association had such intimate relations with or knowledge of the plaintiff as would warrant the payment to him of the sum necessary to satisfy the ground rents and mortgage liens on the property, but the defendant’s officers knew Friend, who had been in their service many years in the same capacity, and believed that they could trust him as their agent, as they had theretofore done in similar cases, to see that the rents and liens were removed and that their mortgage was the first lien on the premises. The condition on which the loan was made was that the existing claims against the property should be paid out of the fund obtained from the defendant so as to give the defendant the first lien on the real estate, and the officers of the association would certainly not have been justified in placing the money beyond their power to have the condition performed. As the learned chancellor aptly says: “The evidence is uncontradicted that the loan was made on a first mortgage. There could not be such a first mortgage, within the meaning of the term as used by all the parties, without the prior redemption and extinguishment of the ground rents. The lender was entitled to receive this extinguishment before it definitely accepted the mortgage. Its plain course, therefore, was to reserve the $1,800 in its hand until it received the extinguishment. When it gave the money to Friend it did what common prudence required it to do, namely, it entrusted its agent with the money which should be applied to the extinguishment of the rent and relied on his fidelity to his trust.” The purpose to insure the payment of the existing mortgages and the extinguishment of the ground rents was accomplished by the defendant’s treasurer making the check payable to Friend and not to the plaintiff to whom the orders were payable.</p>
