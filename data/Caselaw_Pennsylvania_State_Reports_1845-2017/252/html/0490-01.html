White, the plaintiff’s husband was imprisoned in Norristown, Pa., as the result of nonsupport proceedings instituted against him by the plaintiff. On the same day, the defendant by writing under seal bound himself to become surety for the making of certain payments that plaintiff’s husband had, by a bond given on the same day, obligated himself to make to the plaintiff for the support of their two children. The husband was discharged from custody and the pending proceedings were terminated. After making weekly payments for five weeks, the husband refused to continue further payments; the plaintiff instituted new proceedings in the Quarter Sessions Court of Philadelphia County for the support of the children in which proceedings the husband was arrested and twice imprisoned. The plaintiff subsequently brought suit on the defendant’s agreement <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>to recover payments in arrears. The trial judge directed a verdict for plaintiff but allowed the jury to determine the amount which plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>

    <p id="b523-10" data-blocks='[["BL_523.10",523,[175,1342,1146,576]]]'>This action was brought against the appellant as surety on an agreement by appellee’s husband to pay her a stipulatéd weekly sum for the support of their minor children. It was not shown, and there was no competent offer to show, that the appellant had been released from his obligation. The action subsequently taken by the appellee against her husband was rather in relief of the appellant than to his prejudice, and was in no sense an abandonment of the agreement by her. The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
