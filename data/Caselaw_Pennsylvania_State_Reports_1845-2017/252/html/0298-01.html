It would therefore seem to be just, as well as equitable, that those who have an immediate and direct interest in the question should be left to contest and bear all the costs and charges attending it. It ought to be left to them to employ counsel or not, as they please, and consequently to bear the expenses of doing so.” And on page 444, “The person named as executor in the writing, when advised that its validity as a will is about to be contested, ought to give notice to those who are named in it as legatees or devisees, so that they may employ counsel if deemed requisite, or authorize him to do so at their expense.”</p>
