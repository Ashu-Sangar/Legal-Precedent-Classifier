Smith, Receiver of Pittsburgh, Shawmut & Northern Railroad Company, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Railroads \u2014 Passengers \u2014 Platforms \u2014 Absence of guard rail \u2014 Gase for jury.\nIn an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff in consequence of a fall from a platform at one of defendant\u2019s stations while waiting for a train, the case is for the jury and a verdict for the plaintiff will be sustained where it appeared that plaintiff miscalculated the distance of the platform from the ground and in stepping therefrom fell into a ditch, that the night was dark and there was no guard rail at the end of the platform where the accident occurred.\nSubmitted Feb. 1, 1916.\nAppeal, No. 1, Oct. 1, 1916, by defendant, from judgment of C.

The station consisted of a platform, forty feet long and nine feet, four inches wide, with a shelter house on the north side along the highway where the passengers get on the platform and where a step is maintained for that purpose.\nThe plaintiff, her aunt and cousin went up onto the platform into the shelter house.\nThe plaintiff stated that she went out of the shelter house and walked up and down in front of same; that she then walked to the north end of the station platform; that she could see that she was at the end of the platform and thought it was about a foot to the ground, stepped down intending to walk a short distance up the track, was mistaken in the distance which was about four feet and fell into a ditch, spraining her ankle. The night was dark, and it was raining. There was no guard rail at north end of platform where accident occurred.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $2,500.00 and judgment thereon.
