    "head_matter": "Marron v. Stieren, Appellant.\nAffidavit of defense \u2014 Insufficient averments \u2014 Evasive denials\u2014 Contracts.\n1. In an action by a maker of a note against one of the three other joint makers thereof, who had agreed that in the event of the plaintiff having to pay the face of the note and the other two makers not being of ability to contribute thereto, the defendant would be responsible for one-half of the note, an affidavit of defense is evasive and insufficient which merely denies that the other two makers were not of ability to contribute and fails to set up any affirmative defense.\n2. In such ease where the alleged forgiveness of such debt was without consideration it is not binding.\nArgued Oct. 22,1915.\nAppeal, No. 146, Oct. T., 1915, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Allegheny Co., July T., 1914, No. 2040, for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in case of Mary Gertrude Marr\u00f3n, administratrix of the Estate of John Marr\u00f3n, deceased, v. William M. Stieren.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on written contract.\nJohn Marr\u00f3n, W. W. Weiss, H. H. Yon Schlick and William M. Stieren entered into an agreement to buy 45,000 shares of stock of a corporation and for that purpose a joint note was given by the four parties to the contract. The agreement provided \u201cthat in the event that the said John Marr\u00f3n shall have to pay the face of said note, and if the said W. W. Weiss and H. H. Von Schlick shall not be of ability to contribute thereto, the said William M. Stieren shall be liable and responsible for one-half of said note and interest thereon.\u201d Subsequently Marr\u00f3n paid the note. This is an action by his administratrix to recover from William M. Stieren one-half of the amount paid by Marr\u00f3n.\nFurther facts appear in the following opinion of Macfaklane, J., sur plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense:\nThe averment that Weiss and Von Schlick were not of ability to contribute at the time of payment and have not since been able to pay is a necessary part of the plaintiff\u2019s case. The condition in the agreement on which plaintiff sues is \u201cthat in the event that the said John Marr\u00f3n shall have to pay the face of said note and that the said W. W. Weiss and H. H. Von Schlick shall not be of ability to contribute thereto the said William M. Stieren shall be liable and responsible for one-half (y2) of said note and the interest thereon.\u201d The defendant does not set up an affirmative defense and a denial would be sufficient if it was as full as the averment in the statement. It \u201cdenies that the said Weiss and Von Schlick were not of ability to contribute\u201d and this is evasive.\nThe action of assumpsit lies: Meason v. Kaine, 63 Pa. 335. While the payment was not made on the original note, the right of action accrued in 1912 when Mr. Marr\u00f3n paid a renewal. The alleged forgiveness of the debt was without consideration and not binding. Neither is the claim that the defendant was not liable for interest, nor does the affidavit set out any foundation of fact therefor. His contract plainly is for interest.\nThe court made absolute plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in making absolute the judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nGeorge II. RanMn, for appellant.\nF. G. McGirr, for appellee.\nJanuary 3, 1916:"
