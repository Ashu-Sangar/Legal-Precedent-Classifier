        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThe plaintiff sued in trespass to recover for personal injuries; he secured a verdict, on which judgment was entered, and defendant has appealed.\nOn August 10, 1912, Michael Brennen, the plaintiff, an employee in the defendant\u2019s mine, was driving a mule hauling two loaded coal cars down a grade; the mule shied at a water pump, as an immediate result of Avhich one of Brennen\u2019s legs was broken and subsequently had to be amputated. The animal in question, named \u201cPete,\u201d had a reputation for being generally vicious and shying. When the plaintiff went to work on the day of the accident, he reported to a Mr. Toward, the boss driver, who told him to use \u201cPete.\u201d The plaintiff replied that he had driven \u201cPete\u201d once before and \u201ccouldn\u2019t work with him,\u201d that another mule named \u201cFritz,\u201d which he drove on the previous night, \u201chad shied at the pump,\u201d and he did not want to take \u201cPete in there.\u201d Nevertheless, the boss directed him. to take the mule designated, saying that \u201cPete would not shy up there as that was his regular haulage.\u201d At another place in his testimony, the plaintiff stated that the boss said \u201cto take Pete in there, he would not shy, he is all right,\u201d and that, acting on these instructions, he took the mule as directed. When he came to the pump, however, the animal shied, and the accident happened.\nIt appears that Mr. Toward was employed by the superintendent of the mine, and was accountable directly to him for the work done by the mules and their drivers; that he had the power to employ and discharge the drivers; further, that the mine foreman did not exercise control over these employees, and, in fact, had never given the plaintiff any orders. Mr. Toward stated that out of sixteen mules at the mine only four were safe, and \u201cPete\u201d was not one of these; he said he had expressed the opinion that \u201cPete was safe\u201d in order \u201cnot to discourage\u201d the plaintiff; finally, the secretary and treasurer of the defendant company testified that he picked the mules and sent them to the mine superintendent.\nThe trial judge left all questions of fact, where there was a controversy in the testimony, to the jury, and he submitted to them the issues of the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. Since the verdict favored the plaintiff, we must assume the material facts to have been found as just stated, for there was evidence before the triers sufficient to justify such findings. On these facts, the jury might well have concluded that the plaintiff accepted and acted upon the judgment of his superior, and not his own, when he undertook to work with the mule \u201cPete,\u201d and therefore that his employer, and not he, assumed the risk of the accident which subsequently happened.\nIn conclusion, we may state there was ample evidence to show that \u201cPete\u201d had kicked, balked, run away and shied on previous occasions; that for \u00e1 number of years he had the reputation of being a dangerous animal of which the drivers were afraid; that the boss driver was aware of this; and the superintendent of the mine had ample opportunity to know it. Hence the jury could have well concluded it was negligence on the part of the defendant company to give the plaintiff this mule to drive. In the defendant\u2019s mine, the department of work with which we are here concerned was conducted directly under the superintendent and his assistant, the boss driver; therefore, \u201cthe mine foreman defense\u201d was not available to the appellant. The law on the points involved in this case is so well established and has been discussed by us in so many recent opinions that no citation of authorities is needed to sustain the judgment entered by the court below.\nThe assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.",
