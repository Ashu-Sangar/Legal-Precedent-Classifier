White, Appellant.\nContracts \u2014 Support agreements \u2014 Surety\u2014Subsequent arrest of husband \u2014 Effect on obligation of surety.\nThe surety on an agreement by a husband to pay his wife a stipulated weekly sum for the support of their minor children, is not relieved from his obligation by the fact that the wife subsequently brought nonsupport proceedings against her husband; such action being rather to the relief of the surety than to his prejudice.\nArgued Jan. 11,1916.\nAppeal, No. 218, Jan. T., 1915, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Philadelphia Co., March T., 1910, No. 2391, on verdict for plaintiff, in case of Caddie White v. Stacy H. White.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Stewart, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a support contract. Before Audenried, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that on November 23, 1904, Charles H. White, the plaintiff\u2019s husband was imprisoned in Norristown, Pa., as the result of nonsupport proceedings instituted against him by the plaintiff. On the same day, the defendant by writing under seal bound himself to become surety for the making of certain payments that plaintiff\u2019s husband had, by a bond given on the same day, obligated himself to make to the plaintiff for the support of their two children. The husband was discharged from custody and the pending proceedings were terminated. After making weekly payments for five weeks, the husband refused to continue further payments; the plaintiff instituted new proceedings in the Quarter Sessions Court of Philadelphia County for the support of the children in which proceedings the husband was arrested and twice imprisoned. The plaintiff subsequently brought suit on the defendant\u2019s agreement to recover payments in arrears. The trial judge directed a verdict for plaintiff but allowed the jury to determine the amount which plaintiff was entitled to recover.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $1,519.34 and judgment thereon. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were rulings on evidence, instructions to the jury, the refusal of the court to direct a verdict for defendant and to enter judgment for defendant n. o. v.\nJohn O. Gilpin, with him Graham & Gilfbllan, for appellant.\nHenry J. Scott, for appellee.\nMarch 6, 1916:"
