T., 1915, by Christine Markert, Executrix of the Estate of Louis Markert, deceased, from decree of O. C. Del. Co., No. 9993, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in the Estate of Louis Markert, Deceased.\nBefore Msstrezat, Potter, Stewart, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to the report of Howard E. Hannum, Esq., Auditor.\nThe following opinion was filed by Broomall, J., dismissing exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report:\n(a) When this case was previously before the court, the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were sustained by an opinion filed March 27, 1914, and the report was referred back to the auditor for further consideration, and we then stated the facts and questions involved as follows : \u201cIt appears that on December 1, 1908, George L. Markert and Louis Markert executed their judgment note to the Adam Scheidt Brewing Company in the sum of $5,000, payable in one day. On the same day, George L. Markert executed his note to the brewing company for $5,000. These two notes were given for a loan of money made by the brewing company to George L. Markert. Louis Markert was surety for George L. Markert on the first note. Subsequent to the giving of these notes, the brewing company loaned to George L. Markert at different times an aggregate sum of twelve thousand seven hundred and twenty-five dollars. From May 17, 1909, to July 3, 1913, inclusive, George L. Markert paid to the brewing company at various times, an aggregate sum of six thousand two hundred and three dollars and fifty-four cents. The contention is whether these payments shall be applied first to the extinguishment of the note upon which Louis Markert was surety, or applied to the debt of George L. Markert, upon which Louis Markert was not surety.\u201d The evidence taken by the auditor was to the effect that no specific appropriation of these moneys was made at the time of the payment of them, either by the brewing company or by George L. Markert, By the evidence taken by the auditor, the condition of all the books of the brewing company was not Clearly shown. The report was referred back to the auditor for the purpose of giving these books further examination and if applicable, to apply the rule that a surety has the right to compel the creditor to appropriate moneys received from the principal debtor to the earliest item in the account. By a supplemental report, the auditor has found that the brewing company has appropriated the moneys received from the principal, George L. Markert, to the reduction of his separate debt. We have caused the books to be brought before us for examination and we find that there is no doubt about the fact as the auditor has it reported, and that the brewing company by their accounts, actually appropriated the moneys received from George L. Markert, in reduction of his separate debt. This leaves the claim of the brewing company against Louis Markert, the decedent, unaffected by these payments.\nThe exceptant urges to our attention that there was an agreement made by the brewing company at the time of the execution of the two notes, that whatever money it should receive from George L. Markert should be appropriated first to the reduction of the Louis Markert note. If this were so, of course, these moneys would have to be so appropriated, but we can find no evidence submitted upon which such an undertaking can be inferred.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report.\nHarry G. Most, for appellant.\nW. Roger Fronefield, with him Robert A. Meier, for appellee.\nMarch 13, 1916:"
