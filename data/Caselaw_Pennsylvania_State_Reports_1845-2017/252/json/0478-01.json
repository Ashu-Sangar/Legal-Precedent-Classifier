        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Walling,\nThis case is the result of a collision of two automobiles, used as taxicabs. On November 30,1911, at about 2:30 o\u2019clock a. m., defendant\u2019s taxicab or car was being driven east on Chestnut street, Philadelphia, and collided with plaintiff\u2019s taxicab while the latter was going north on 17th street. The streets cross at right angles, Chestnut street being sixty and 17th street fifty feet wide. The cartway of each is of the width of twenty-six feet, with a single track street railway in the center. The accident occurred north of the center of Chestnut street and east of the center of 17th street. In plaintiff\u2019s car were six persons, including four passengers, one of whom was on the front seat Avith the chauffeur; and plaintiff sat on the floor of the car between such passenger and the dash board, facing west with his feet on the running-board, but no part of his person being outside of the line of the car. It was plaintiff\u2019s custom to accompany his car to collect fares and look after passengers. After the collision defendant\u2019s car came to a stop against the telegraph pole at the northeast corner of said streets and plaintiff\u2019s car, which had been turned to the right in an effort to avoid the accident, stopped about twenty feet further east. By the collision plaintiff was thrown to the pavement near the telegraph pole and very seriously injured. His car was damaged and some of his passengers hurt.\nThe evidence is conflicting, that for plaintiff tending to show that defendant\u2019s car was driven in a reckless manner and at very high speed and ran violently into plaintiff\u2019s car; while that of defendant\u2019s chauffeur places the responsibility for the accident upon the reckless management of plaintiff\u2019s car. The trial judge fairly submitted the case to the jury, who found for the plaintiff and judgment was entered thereon.\nThe first and second assignments of error, Which complain of the court\u2019s refusal to decide the case for the defendant as matter of law, are without merit, as it was clearly for the jury.\nIt is the duty of one approaching the crossing of a street intersection to have his vehicle under control; and to observe what is or may be approaching on the other street. And where another vehicle is first at the crossing to give it an opportunity to clear the same; and to use due care to avoid a collision. The third assignment of error as to the charge of the court on this branch of the case cannot be sustained.\nPlaintiff was the owner and in charge of his car and it is not clear that his position thereon was one of danger, or that he was more liable to injury there than elsewhere. It bears no analogy to the case of a passenger voluntarily standing on the bumpers or foot-board of a car, or riding with his feet between a car and the engine. The cause of the accident wrns the violent collision, resulting as the jury found from defendant\u2019s negligence, and not because of the place plaintiff occupied on his car. His being there was merely a condition, not the cause of the accident.\nA person injured by the negligence of another is not deprived of all remedy merely because at the time he was occupying an unusual position in a conveyance, unless he thereby cooperated in causing his injury:\n\u201cThe contributory negligence which prevents recovery for an injury, is that which cooperates in causing the injury \u2014 some act or omission concurring with the act or omission of the other party to produce the injury (not the loss merely), and without which the injury would not have happened\u201d: Gould v. McKenna, 86 Pa. 297, 803.\n\u201cThe test for contributory negligence is found in the affirmative of the question, does that negligence contribute in any degree to the production of the injury complained of? If it does, there can be no recovery; if it does not, it is not to be considered\u201d: Creed v. Penna. R. R. Co., 86 Pa. 139, 145.\nIn Gannon v. Wilson, 1 Sadler 422, 424, defendant\u2019s horse ran on the sidewalk in front of plaintiff\u2019s store and damaged some property belonging to plaintiff. Defendant offered as evidence of contributory negligence an ordinance prohibiting the placing of wares on the sidewalk. This evidence was excluded, and in affirming the judgment this court say:\n\u201cIf the defendant in error did violate an ordinance of the city, that violation was not a proximate cause of the injury.\u201d ,\nThe question as to the negligence of plaintiff\u2019s chauffeur was submitted to the jury and there is nothing to sustain a finding that plaintiff was personally guilty of any negligence which contributed to his injury, or that because of his position on the car he and the chauffeur were bound to exercise extraordinary care, or that he thereby assumed the risk of injury caused by some one negligently colliding with his car.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",

Pennsylvania Taximeter Cab Company, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Automobiles \u2014 Collision \u2014 Conflicting evidence\u2014 Contributory negligence \u2014 Proximate cause \u2014 Case for fury.\n1. It is the duty of a driver of a vehicle approaching the crossing of a street intersection to have his vehicle under control and to observe what is or may be approaching from the other street; and where another vehicle is first at the crossing, to give it an opportunity to clear the same and to use due care to avoid a collision.\n2. Where in an action for injuries, occasioned in a collision between plaintiff\u2019s automobile and another automobile, plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that defendant\u2019s car was driven in a re.ck-less manner and at very high speed and ran violently into plaintiff\u2019s ear; while defendant\u2019s evidence placed the responsibility for the accident upon the reckless management of plaintiff\u2019s car, the case is for the jury.\n3. In such case plaintiff was not precluded from recovery by reason of the fact that, at the time of the accident, he was sitting on the floor of the car between the driver and a passenger, as his unusual position was not the cause of the accident and in no way contributed thereto. A person injured by the negligence of another is not deprived of all remedies merely because, at the time, he was occupying an unusual position in a conveyance, unless he thereby cooperated in causing his injuries.\nArgued Jan. 10,1916.\nAppeal, No. 396, Jan.
