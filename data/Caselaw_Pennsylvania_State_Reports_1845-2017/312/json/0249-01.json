Assignments of error raise only questions involving facts which were properly submitted to the jury, and we find ample testimony warranting the verdicts. The evidence does not, as argued by defendant, show incontrovertible physical facts proving the accident could not have occurred as claimed by plaintiff.\nThe judgments are affirmed.",
