        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nSeptember 25, 1933:\nThis appeal complains of the denial of probate, on the ground of forgery, by the substitution of one page and the alteration of another, of an instrument bearing decedent\u2019s signature, and of the refusal of an issue devisavit vel non.\nEliza Leiper Kane, domiciled in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, died April 29, 1929, without issue. She was survived by her husband, from whom she had been separated six years. Her next of kin were three brothers and a sister. In her safe deposit box, in a trust company in Chester, a holographic will (quoted below) was found. It was admitted to probate August 10, 1929. Letters of administration c. t. a. were granted to George G. Leiper, decedent\u2019s eldest brother. October 28, 1929, Mrs. Davis and her sister appealed from the probate, and also offered for probate an alleged will of later date, that now in question, under which they would take the entire estate. This paper was typewritten, dated January 30, 1929, witnessed by a sister of the beneficiaries, Kathryn C. Page, St. Petersburg, Florida, and by Mary A. Smith, Eustis, Florida. The first paragraph contained a direction to pay debts and funeral expenses; the second, reciting her husband\u2019s desertion and failure to support, provided that he should not receive any of her property;' the third excluded her brothers and sisters, because \u201call of them have treated me with injustice and cruelty since the death of my beloved Mother.\u201d The fourth paragraph was as follows: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my two beloved friends, E. Irene C. Davis and Ray A. Craven, share and share alike, all of my property, real, personal or mixed of whatever kind or nature or wheresoever situate, absolutely in fee. These two friends have been as daughters to me; have advanced me sums of money from time to time for a period of over twenty years and when I was in need; they nursed me in sickness and gave me home and love and affection.\u201d Mrs. Davis was appointed executrix. By the holographic will, Mrs. Davis and Miss Craven each received five hundred dollars.\nOn proponents\u2019 petition, probate of the will on which letters had been granted was opened and the proceedings were certified into the orphans\u2019 court, where evidence was taken to determine whether the second instrument should be admitted to probate. When the testimony was about completed, proponents filed their petition for an issue devisavit vel non.\nThe applicable rule of law was thus stated in Fleming\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 399, 109 A. 265: \u201cA dispute as to the facts such as to require the granting of an issue under the Act of March 15, 1832, P. L. 146, 4 Purdon (13th ed.), page 4088, [Section 21 (b), 1917, P. L. 382], must he a substantial dispute and the evidence, considered as a whole, must be such as would sustain a verdict in favor of the party praying for the issue. Such party is usually the contestant, but the rule is the same as to either side, and where the trial judge, after a careful review of all the testimony, would feel constrained to set aside a verdict, if in favor of one side, as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, the issue should be refused. See Conway\u2019s Est., 257 Pa. 314, 101 A. 652; Roup\u2019s Est., 236 Pa. 31, 84 A. 592; Fuller\u2019s Est., 222 Pa. 182, 70 A. 1005; Knauss\u2019s App., 114 Pa. 10, 6 A. 394; Harrison\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 458.\u201d See also Tetlow\u2019s Est., 269 Pa. 486, 112 A. 758; Wagner\u2019s Est., 289 Pa. 361, 137 A. 616; Mark\u2019s Estate, 298 Pa. 285, 148 A. 297; Minnig\u2019s Est., 300 Pa. 435, 150 A. 626; Roney\u2019s Est., 309 Pa. 309, 164 A. 55.\n- Decedent\u2019s residence was on her farm at Knowlton in a bouse which she had built. She was sixty-eight years of age, quite feeble, afflicted with diabetes, and, in February, 1929, spent some time in a hospital. From March 1, 1929, to March 22d, she lived with appellants. She then went to her own home, where, as Mrs. Davis testified, she \u201ctook a terrible cold\u201d and \u201cthen she returned to me [Mrs. Davis] after ten days.\u201d From then until her death, April 29th, she remained with appellants at their home in Ridley Park, Delaware County.\nMay 5, 1929, decedent\u2019s brother, her nephew, two lawyers, and Mrs. Davis went to the residence at Knowlton to search for the key to decedent\u2019s safe deposit box. They found, as the learned judge below stated, that \u201cEverything in the rooms was in great confusion and they searched through the said rooms, through the house, from one to two hours and were unable to find any key or anything else, so far as appears, of any value. Before leaving, at the suggestion of James L. Rankin, Esquire, and agreed to by Mr. Hodge and the Leipers [all present] a woman by the name of Mary Brown, who resided in the neighborhood, was placed in charge of the house and received private instructions from James L. Rankin, Esquire, to make further search and if she found anything of value to bring it to him together .with any mail that should be received. Mary Brown testified that she was cleaning up the house and went to the third story to take some old newspapers and other stuff and when she arrived in the third story room she noticed some evidence of mice having been there and which she followed up and found an old hamper in the back part of the room \u2014 the said room being littered with furniture and other stuff \u2014in an old trunk which showed evidence of the mice having been in that. There were three or four comfortables in the trunk which she took out and searched down to the bottom of the trunk where she saw the evidence of mice and in the search she discovered some papers and two boxes; one a tin box which was locked and had no key. She at once called to her husband \u2018see look what I found\u2019 and he told her to put it back and leave it there until she had some mail to take to Chester. She left the said box in this trunk until June 4, 1929, when she took it to Chester and delivered it to James L. Rankin, Esquire, together with some papers that she found.\u201d\nThe tin box remained in Mr. Rankin\u2019s possession until October, 1929, when it was pried open in the presence of Mr. Hodge, of counsel for the next of kin. In it was found the alleged will, some receipts, letters, and a stock certificate (par value, $4,000) later appraised at no value. This instrument was then offered for probate, as stated above (Sebik\u2019s Est., 300 Pa. 45, 150 A. 101). It consisted of two sheets of paper and a backer; the first sheet contained all the dispositive provisions; only the testimonium clause, with decedent\u2019s signature, and the attestation clause, with the signatures and addresses of the witnesses, were on the second sheet. When produced by proponents, these two sheets were bound together by a backer of gray paper1, fastened at the top by three eyelets, designated in the evidence as Bates Eyelets. The typewriter, a portable machine, on which the document was written, was produced in court. A witness, McGinnis, testified that, at Mrs. Kane\u2019s direction, and in her presence, he wrote the will on the typewriter in the office of a real estate agent, with whom he was associated from time to time on a commission basis, in West Philadelphia, and accompanied her to the banking department of the Eeal Estate Land Title and Trust Company, in Philadelphia, where she met the two subscribing witnesses; that he produced the paper and that she executed it and asked the subscribing witnesses to attest her signature; that she put the paper in her handbag and left with both the witnesses. For these services, he said, he received two dollars. He stated that he heard no more of the matter until he read in a Philadelphia newspaper an account of a contest concerning Mrs. Kane\u2019s will, which led him to write to Mrs. Davis stating that he had drawn a will for Mrs. Kane, etc. He testified that the typewriter belonged to him and, from the time of its purchase, had not been out of his possession. He kept it at his home, \u201coccasionally\u201d taking it to the real estate office. Testifying in September, 1980, he stated, at one point in his testimony, that he had purchased the typewriter, secondhand, from an itinerant vendor, who came to his residence for the purpose of making the sale, two years before (which would date the purchase in September, 1928); at another point in the record, he said that he purchased it in December, 1928. The difference in time is of possible consequence in connection with the use of the same machine for the purpose of inserting the word \u201ctrustee\u201d in the Herring deed in September, 1928, a fact to be referred to later. While on the subject of this typewriter, a related piece of significant evidence may conveniently be mentioned. A young man named Joe Mays did chores about decedent\u2019s farm and drove her automobile. He produced a letter signed \u201cA friend\u201d (Quoted below), mailed and postmarked at Chester, January 15, 1929, two weeks before the date of the alleged will, addressed to him at Knowlton, Pa., \u201ccare Mrs. Thos. A. Kane.\u201d An expert witness, called on behalf of appellants, agreed, with evidence offered by the next of kin, that this letter, and the envelope in which it was mailed, were written on the typewriting machine produced by McGinnis. Hoffman, mentioned in the letter, was an acquaintance of Mays, and known to be so by appellants. We have not been able to find in the record that McGinnis was examined about the letter. Appellees suggest that only persons interested in establishing this will could profit by getting Mays out of the neighborhood in order to avoid the effect of his evidence. Mays testified that he showed the letter to Mrs. Kane, who said, among other things, \u201cthat she suspected somebody up at Ridley Park, either Mrs. Davis or Miss Ray Craven\u201d; because \u201cthey were afraid of me. Mrs. Kane said they couldn\u2019t handle me\u201d; that \u201cthey said they wanted to get me to go away from the old lady.\u201d He also testified that Mrs. Davis told him he \u201cought to get a job\u201d; that Miss Craven said \u201cI ought to get away from that old woman. I am not getting anything. I ought to go to work and stay away from her. ......\u201d Hoffman, who was present, corroborated Mays as to these statements, said to have been made by appellants; Miss Craven denied making them, while Mrs. Davis said she did not remember making such a statement. The value of Miss Craven\u2019s testimony concerning Mays is much impaired by her evidence; she accused Mm of theft from her, yet, in cross-examination, identified a picture postcard which she admitted sending to him from Florida, in 1930, stating: \u201cHad hoped you would be with us this winter \u2014 seems to be our fate not to be able to reach you when we need you \u2014 you have missed a treat by not being with us. Perhaps you can go to Canada with us in June.\u201d She explained, that she meant to employ him as chauffeur. Mays, from time to time, drove Mrs. Kane to and from her Knowlton residence to appellants\u2019 residence at Kidley Park. He testified that on one of these trips she informed him that \u201cthere was something missing out of her hand bag\u201d; \u201cshe said there was some paper, Philadelphia letters, checks and the keys and other things that she had.\u201d She thought they had been taken by \u201csomebody in the Davis\u2019s.\u201d Mays left the community March 4, 1929, taking employment at a distance, and did not return until May 19, 1929. He then went, accompanied by Hoffman, mentioned above, to the Davis residence to see Mrs. Kane and found there only Mrs. Smith (one of the attesting witnesses) who informed him that Mrs. Kane died April 29th.\nMrs. Page, one of the subscribing witnesses, a sister of appellants, was interested in the sale of Florida real estate. During September, 1928, she caused a deed, called the Herring deed, for the sale of land in Florida, to be drawn in Chester to be executed by her. She testified that she signed it in Philadelphia and sent it to a real estate agent, named Allen, in Jacksonville, Florida, to ascertain whether she held title as trustee, and, if she did, to make the deed read accordingly. The deed, offered in evidence, shows that the word \u201ctrustee\u201d- was added to her name, with a typewriting machine having a different style of letter from that in which the deed had originally been written. Allen testified that he had that word inserted in Florida at her request.\nThe evidence shows that the word \u201ctrustee,\u201d so inserted, and the endorsement on the deed, were written on the same typewriting machine on which McGinnis said he wrote the alleged will, and on which the anonymous letter to Mays was written. There is evidence that Mrs. Page\u2019s husband possessed and operated a portable typewriter, described by witnesses who saw it, as like the one in court, which McGinnis said he used. Unfortunately, perhaps, for the more complete elucidation of the transaction, Mr. Page was not interrogated about this or other related matters. Did this typewriter belong to him, in spite of what McGinnis said? Had it belonged to him? Where, and by whom was it used in completing the Herring deed? What, if anything, did he know about the preparation of the paper offered for probate or of the anonymous letter to Mays?\nThe evidence supports the finding that, out of the three eyelets used to bind the instrument, the middle eyelet had been removed and had been again replaced, with slight damage, readily observable, to the paper. On behalf of the next of kin, it is suggested that a document bearing decedent\u2019s signature, and originally bound with only one eyelet, was altered by the removal of the first page and the substitution of another first page as it now appears, and the addition of the attestation clause on the second page, followed by rebinding with three eyelets, two of which had not been used originally, the middle one filling, and somewhat enlarging, the puncture made by the first binding. It is conceded that decedent\u2019s signature is genuine. Both subscribing witnesses testified that they saw her sign her name and attested her signature at her request; in the orphans\u2019 court, Mrs. Page testified several times; as the other witness, Mrs. Smith, was a nonresident who declined to appear in the orphans\u2019 court on the ground of ill health, after the probate of the will was opened, evidence of her signature was offered. There is evidence that prior to Mrs. Kane\u2019s death,.Mrs. Smith from time to time visited appellants at Ridley Park.\nOn this record we find no reason to differ from the conclusion, implied in the decision of the learned chancellor, that the portable typewriting machine, in evidence, destroys proponents\u2019 case. While McGinnis was on the stand, he made a copy of the alleged will, and other matter submitted to him, on the machine. This copy of the will has been submitted to us; the physical characteristics described by the trial judge are apparent. He said: \u201cThen again the writing that McGinnis made in the test at court showed a heavy touch. If the alleged will was written, as he says it was, by him, the typewriter would make burs on the back of the paper. An examination of the back of the alleged will shows no burs and shows no evidence of any heavy touch. In the typewriting that he did in Court with reference to the verse from Nehemiah, where the numeral one was used, he made it with the lower case (1) ell. Therefore, in my opinion he was not the one that wrote the alleged will.\u201d On the same general subject he said: \u201cThe typewriter which was produced by McGinnis, on which he said the alleged will was written, has no character for the numeral one, in the keyboard. The type was elite. In Mc-Ginnis\u2019s letter to Mrs. Davis, which he says was written on this typewriter on July 29, 1930, the numeral one is made by the lower case (1) ell, and it occurs four times.\n\u201cIn the letter of McGinnis to Eliza Leiper Kane, the numeral one is made by the lower case (1) ell and it occurs at least twice. In the deed and in the testimonial clause of the alleged will, the numeral one is made by the capital (I) eye. In the Iona Herring deed the numeral one on the back of the deed is made by the capital (I) eye. This deed was written by a young woman by the name of Dougherty at the instance of Mrs. Page and it gives Mrs. Page\u2019s residence as of Eustis. But this young-woman did not write the endorsement on the deed.\n\u201cOn this machine produced by McGinnis the type was elite and there was no numeral one on the keyboard. The alleged will and the Ku Klux letter [the letter to Mays] and the endorsement on the back of the Herring-deed and also the word \u2018trustee\u2019 on the inside of the deed are of elite type, and were, as the evidence shows, all written on this machine. I, therefore, conclude that the alleged will, the Ku Klux letter and the endorsement on the deed, etc., were written by some person other than McGinnis.\u201d\nIt is unnecessary to discuss a number of other elements, considered below, among them, the evidence that the holographic will of 1925 was in accord with the repeated declarations of testatrix of an intention to benefit a charity; that prized family possessions were bequeathed to relatives appropriately chosen in each case to receive the particular gift; considerations arising from the evidence concerning Mays and Hoffman and their relations with proponents; the receipt obtained for money expended in repairing the typewriter; and other serious contradictions in testimony offered on behalf of appellants.\nIn their brief, appellants made no specific reference to, and give us no aid in dealing with, the obvious and serious difficulties arising out of the alleged use of the typewriter by McGinnis, if it was used by him, in its relation to the documents referred to. We can only place one interpretation on their silence on this subject. They assert that the court erred in refusing prohate on \u201cthe opinion of a handwriting expert\u201d (McWilliams\u2019s Est., 259 Pa. 526, 103 A. 365), which, they say, is only of corroborative value. But that is not what occurred. The basis of the decision is largely dependent on observation of physical facts, many of them not disputable, not on comparison of handwriting. Concerning many important elements, the experts on both sides agree. We do not regard it essential, in the circumstances disclosed, to fix the exact time when the dispositive parts of the alleged will, or the attestation clause, were written, one expert claiming that his observation led him to conclude that they were written four or five months after the testimonium clause, while appellants\u2019 expert thought that the entire document was written at the same time.\nOn this record we should not be justified, by the precedents cited above, in differing from the learned chancellor in the ultimate conclusion that, considering the evidence as a whole, if a jury rendered a verdict sustaining the will, he would be compelled to set it aside.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 costs.\n\u201cJune 1, 1925. I am about starting\u2019 on Auto trip to Annapolis and direct that in ease of death, my farm be given to the Chester Y. W. C.

Kane.\u201d The beneficiaries named Black, Carey and Haddon were relatives of testatrix.\nThe evidence is that the house was much larger than her necessities required. Friends testified that, from time to time, she stated that she wished there to \u201cestablish a home for others\u201d; that she said \u201cI think I will leave my place to the Y. W. C. A.\u201d (as was done by the will admitted to probate). She repeated this as late as September, 1928. While the house was building, Frank Ogden, who was working on it, suggested to her that she should build a bungalow; she replied, \u201cNo, I want to build a big house\u201d; when she \u201cwas done with it, it went to, a charitable orphanage.\u201d She said it should be known \u201cas Chateau Faysoux\u201d (a family name) and that \u201ca bronze plaque was to be made, and she showed me [Bowen] the place on the wall where it was to be fastened,\u201d\nA scrivener, who understood his business, would of course never have prepared, or permitted to be executed, a paper so easily altered by a change in the first page, as the one in question. McGinnis testified that he acquired his \u201cknowledge of writing wills\u201d in Milwaukee, assisting \u201can expert in forged and questioned handwriting. ...... I wrote many a will on the typewriter or copies of them.\u201d\n\u201cFriend Joe \u2014 Say Joe, there is a plot to get rid of you. You know them Ku Kluxers, well they are planning to take you away.. I hear there has been stealing around your place and you are blamed. So Joe get out of this country as fast as you can. I am your friend. I can\u2019t now tell you who I am. Don\u2019t come back until you hear from me, for these fellows will follow you for revenge. You are watched. They say you are living with the old woman on the hill. Leave your address with Hoffman. I will get it and warn you from time to time. A Friend.\u201d\nAllen first testified that he saw the word \u201ctrustee\u201d added by his stenographer, a Miss MacMillan; then, that Miss MacMillan was the stenographer of one Gibbons, a lawyer with an office in 206-208 Graham Building, where she added the word, and made the endorsement on the deed. Several months after Allen testified, appellee called Mrs. Florence Watson of Jacksonville. She testified that she was Gibbons\u2019s stenographer at the time described by Allen; that Gibbons had no stenographer named MacMillan; that his office was not 206 Graham Building, but 105 Graham Building; that Gibbons\u2019s typewriter was equipped with pica and not with elite type. The word \u201ctrustee\u201d was written on a machine with elite type. Subsequently, the typewriting machine, used by Mrs. Watson, in Gibbons\u2019s office, was produced in court, fully identified. Allen\u2019s testimony, in the important respect indicated, cannot be accepted as in accord with the facts.",
