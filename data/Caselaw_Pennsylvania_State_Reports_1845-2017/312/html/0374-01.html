Their business was to act as “financial and selling agents for the Camden Iron Works and the Florence Iron Works......[corporations then]......engaged in the manufacture of iron pipe and like material and of machinery.” The firm held shares of stock and bonds of those corporations. It was a partnership at will (Wood v. Todd, <a href="/f/251/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="251 F. 530" data-case-ids="3984042" data-case-paths="/f/251/0530-01">251 Fed. 530</a>) and therefore was dissolved March 2, 1914, by the death of a partner. As survivor, Walter Wood was entitled to wind up. While he was so engaged, in October, 1914, the court below, on bill filed by the appellees, as executors of the deceased partner, appointed receivers (Walter Wood being one of them) to liquidate the partnership. Various accounts by the receivers were filed and audited. As all debts have been paid, no rights of creditors are involved. Numerous exceptions to the auditors’ reports were heard and disposed of by the learned court below to the satisfaction of the parties, except as to two points, now here for review: 1, the distribution of the assets between appellant and the deceased partner’s personal representa<a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>tives; and, 2, payment of the receivership expenses. No facts are in controversy. The accuracy of the figures is conceded. Only the plan of distribution is disputed.</p>

The liquidation records show that, to the date of dissolution, capital contribution had been made as follows :</p>

To illustrate his contention, he states an account, by selecting figures from the schedule of distribution approved below, as showing “Net profits since dissolution” of $354,578.54, and a net capital gain of $60,112.75. To illustrate his position, his account is quoted from his brief in a note.* In stating that account, appellant makes the date of final distribution the decisive date of ascertaining the value of his capital interest, instead of the date of dissolution which was adopted by the learned court below and for which appellees contend. This appeal depends on which is correct.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[245,1044,1169,370]],["BL_403.1",403,[191,332,1158,1571]],["BL_404.1",404,[275,336,1153,424]]]'>We all agree that the decisive date for the purposes in question is the date of dissolution. On that date, March 2, 1914, the relative rights of the partners became fixed,. and each partner, or his representative, became entitled to take out his share of the capital, creditors having been paid. If it could not then be delivered because the amount required ascertainment by winding up, he was <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>nevertheless to be treated from that time as owner of it, and, therefore, entitled to receive what it earned from that time until paid or delivered to him. On that date, each partner became a creditor of the capital in the then net value of his contribution. From that date, in a partnership engaged as this one was, his contribution ceased to earn “profits” for the partnership, because the contract provided for the sharing of profits only during the existence of the partnership and not after its dissolution; the contract governs the distribution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> On the other hand, the result contended for by appellant is not in accord with the contract, but in violation of it. On appellant’s theory, joint trade for partnership purposes would be continued after dissolution, and the value of the retiring partner’s contribution chargeable to capital assets, would depend on • contingencies not within the articles of partnership. In fact, in this case joint or partnership trade did not continue. Accordingly, from the date of dissolution each partner is entitled to receive, in addition to his original contribution, or what remains of it, the net earnings made by or attributable to it. As the learned president judge of the court below said: “Indeed it would not be fair that an agreement made between partners to divide profits and losses in certain proportions should apply to the conditions existing after dissolution. New business contracts cannot then be entered into nor enterprise exerted in aggressive search of gain; the assets are merely items of property and lack the dynamic quality of profit-producing cap<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>ital employed for business purposes.” See Hay’s App., <a href="/pa/91/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="91 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="488823" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0265-01">91 Pa. 265</a>, 270; Plumly’s App., <a href="/monaghan/1/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Monag. 177" data-case-ids="254651" data-case-paths="/monaghan/1/0177-01">1 Mona. 177</a>, 181; Brenner v.

Tke learned court below was of opinion tkat tke expense had been incurred “in order to salvage not only tke net capital which existed at tke time of dissolution but also tke income which accrued during liquidation,” and apportioned it between capital and income. Property placed in tke custody of receivers is charged witk the necessary expenses incurred in caring for and administering it (Bauer v. Wilkes-Barre Light Co., <a href="/pa/274/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="274 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1073035" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0165-01">274 Pa. 165</a>, 169, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.%20920" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="117 A. 920">117 A. 920</a>) and, while generally income is first chargeable with expenses, tke general rule is subject to equitable considerations. This was a liquidating receivership. Tke proceeding is in equity. Tke value of tke contributions at dissolution was enhanced, or tke capital loss was minimized, during tke long period occupied in liquidation. Tke receivers were tke appointees and agents of tke court, not of tke parties.
