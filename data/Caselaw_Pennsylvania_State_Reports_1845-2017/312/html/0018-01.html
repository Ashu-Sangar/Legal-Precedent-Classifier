      <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>On October 24, 1930, Sidney F. T. Brock, then sole surviving member of the firm of Beilly, Brock &amp; Co., a banking and brokerage partnership, executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. The Bank filed a proof of claim as a general creditor of the assigned estate, for $195,000. This claim had its origin as follows: On July 12, 1930, Beilly, Brock &amp; Co. wrote the Bank this letter: “Dear Sirs: If you will discount a 6% six months’ collateral note of Central Properties Company in the sum of Two hundred thousand dollars, said collateral to be second mortgage on the northeast corner of Nineteenth and Walnut Streets, Philadelphia, Pa., and the vacant land contiguous thereto to the east, we agree if said note has not been paid at maturity to purchase said note from you at the then face thereof, you at that time to assign all collateral pledged therewith to us.” Upon receipt of the letter the Bank discounted the note mentioned and exacted as collateral the second mortgage referred to in the letter. A receiver was appointed on January 2, 1931, for the Central Properties Co. and for the Corporation Beal Estate Co., which executed the second mortgage, and when the note matured on January 12,1931, it was not paid.</p>
    <p id="b45-5" data-blocks='[["BL_45.5",45,[177,1609,1157,809]],["BL_46.1",46,[275,349,1153,320]]]'>Appellant claims that the contract evidenced by the above letter was a contract of suretyship. Appellee claims that it was a contract of guaranty. What we said in our opinion filed this day in the Brock’s Assigned Estate (No. 1), <a href="/pa/312/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="312 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="1150634" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0007-01">312 Pa. 7</a>, as to the difference between a contract of suretyship and one of guaranty applies to the issue raised by the Bank in this appeal. The undertaking on the part of Beilly, Brock &amp; Company was an absolute promise to buy the note unless a certain thing should happen, to wit, the payment by the maker at maturity. The fact that the payment to be made was in the future does not affect the absolute character of the obligation. The only contingency which would terminate the obligation of Beilly, Brock &amp; Co. to purchase this note at the face value thereof, i. e., to <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>pay it, was its payment by the Central Properties Co. Their obligation was in being from the date that the Bank made the loan in reliance on their promise of July 12th. That this obligation was defeasible upon the happening of a subsequent event did not affect its legal absoluteness.</p>
    <p id="b46-4" data-blocks='[["BL_46.5",46,[274,677,1155,854]]]'>The three cases cited by the court below to sustain its ruling are not applicable. One of them is In re Pettingill &amp; Co., <a href="/f/137/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="137 F. 143" data-case-ids="3865763" data-case-paths="/f/137/0143-01">137 Fed. 143</a>. There it was held that the breach of an agreement by the bankrupt to <em>guarantee </em>for an indefinite period the payment of certain dividends by a corporation could not be proved in bankruptcy. The decision was in no Avay adverse to the provability of a claim arising from suretyship. One of the claims adjudicated in this case was that of the Chicago Newspaper Union. That claim arose from a guaranty by the Pettingill Co. of dividends and redemption of stock three years after the date of issue. The court said: “The contract to redeem the stock three years after the date of issue may fairly be construed as a contract to purchase the stock....... I am of opinion that proof is possible.”</p>
    <p id="b46-6" data-blocks='[["BL_46.6",46,[276,1550,1154,527]]]'>In the second case cited, In re Merrill &amp; Baker, <a href="/f/186/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="186 F. 312" data-case-ids="6746607" data-case-paths="/f/186/0312-01">186 Fed. 312</a>, it Avas decided that the holder of a guaranty of an obligation by a bankrupt cannot prove his claim against the estate if the obligation had not matured at the time of the adjudication. In that case the court said: “Counsel......demands dividends upon the face of debts which have largely been paid. To do this these contracts of guaranty must be construed as contracts of suretyship. They are not susceptible of such construction.”</p>

In that case the trust company gave a bond “conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of the guardian. The securities of the ward were delivered by the guardian to the trust company which entered them in its book in <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>which it entered property held by it in a fiduciary capacity. The trust company made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors on December 24, 1897. Subsequently, in March, 1901, the treasurer of the trust company fraudulently disposed of the securities for his own use.” Mr. Justice Mestrezat said in that case: “At the date of the assignment there had been no breach of the bond given by the trust company as surety of the guardian. The securities were then intact and could have been recovered from the company at that time or at any time prior to March, 1901, when they were fraudulently appropriated by its treasurer. Hence, there was no...... liability on the bond of the surety for more than three years after the assignment of the trust company for the benefit of its creditors......[page 154]. A conditional bond, such as the one in question, does not create an indebtedness absolutely payable in the future, but is an obligation which becomes an indebtedness on the happening of a contingency, and, until the contingency occurs, there is no claim or demand which can be enforced against the assignor of his estate.”</p>

See Bank of Pennsylvania v. M’Calmont, <a href="/rawle/4/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="4 Rawle 307" data-case-ids="1823551" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0307-01">4 Rawle 307</a>. In that case this court said in an opinion by Mr. Justice Kennedy: “The note having been given without consideration, for the accommo* dation of John Strawbridge, no debt of any kind existed until he got the note discounted, but as soon as that was done a debt was created most clearly, and that too by his act, for his own exclusive benefit; and under his agreement with the drawer and payee of the note, he then became absolutely bound to pay it at maturity, to the bona fide holders, whoever they might be. Although not absolutely bound to pay by virtue of his endorsement, yet, I conceive, that there cannot be a material difference if he were so upon any principle, and that he <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>was, under Ms engagement with the drawer and payee, is indisputable. It is clear, then, that a debt was created before the assignment was made, and was growing due at that time; that John Strawbridge, the assignor of the defendants, was in reality the debtor, and the plaintiffs were the creditors, and that he was under an obligation to pay them in any event. Indeed, under a full view of the whole ground of the case, I cannot perceive that his liability had the least shade of contingency about it. On the contrary, I think it was certain, absolute and unqualified....... It is sufficient that it existed at the time of the assignment, and was connected with the note in such a way as to follow and accompany it; and this, I think, was clearly the case.”</p>

E. 272</a>, plaintiff and defendant, as partners, endorsed two nonnegotiable notes. Their partnership was then dissolved before the notes matured. Upon maturity the maker failed to pay the notes. Plaintiff paid them. He then sued to recover defendant’s proportionate share. Defendant’s answer alleged that on dissolution of the firm, plaintiff had agreed to pay the indebtedness of the firm. It was held that the plea was good and the obligation constituted a firm indebtedness, the court saying: “The undertaking endorsed upon the note......was an original, direct, and absolute engagement, binding the signers thereof unconditionally to pay the note.”</p>

The first section of that act provides, inter alia, that “ ‘debt’ includes any legal liability, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> See Schline v.

Teresa Marotta, that court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Butler said: “Under the common law rule a creditor having only a contingent claim, such as was that of the petitioner at the time respondent made the transfer in question, is protected against fraudulent conveyances, and petitioner, from the time that it became surety on Mogliani’s bond was entitled as a creditor under the agreement to invoke that rule.” In that case it was held that the transfer by an indemnitor of the surety on a fireworks exhibitor’s bond of her property after a verdict against the exhibitor was returned, but before the judgment was entered, is an act of bankruptcy, on the theory that it was made with intent to defraud the surety even though the surety’s claim at such time was contingent and not provable.</p>
