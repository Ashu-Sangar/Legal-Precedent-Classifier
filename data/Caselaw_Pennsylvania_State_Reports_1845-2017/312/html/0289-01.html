The procedure necessary to give effect to the borrowing power is not an incident of the power, but a regulation for its proper exercise. The purpose for which money is to be used, or a debt is to be created, may be ascertained from the authorizing acts, or duty enjoined, or necessarily implied therefrom. In this case it is alleged that the notes were given for loans incurred for the repair and improve<a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>ment of public roads.

    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[262,1058,1155,1239]]]'>The power of a second-class township to borrow money is found in the township code and other statutes, and is limited and regulated by the Constitution. Appellee contends that the notes are void under section 10, article IX, of the Constitution and the legislation enacted in conformity therewith. It reads as follows: “Any county, township, school district or other municipality incurring any indebtedness, shall, at or before the time of so doing, provide for the collection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof within thirty years.” It is appellees’ contention that <em>at or before </em>any debt may be incurred (money borrowed by note or bond) an annual tax sufficient to pay the loan or debt within 30 years must be provided for, and that of course can only be done by a tax levy which does not in terms appear, and if the annual tax has not been provided for by the levying of some millage or amount the loan is void; that the municipality cannot later cure it no matter if such curing process be undertaken a day or nine years later. Such construction challenges the validity of many municipal bonds as well as loans and we are of opinion that it is a too drastic interpretation of the constitutional provision as to a procedural matter.</p>

The latter is a command to the township to provide, by the method therein specified, funds for the payment of an indebtedness, which the legislature authorized within the limitation of the Constitution. The municipality’s power is not therein affected, but rather its mode of exercise. The words “at or before” are mandatory, but there is no provision stating that any indebtedness of the city shall be void if such a tax is not provided at or before the incurring thereof. The section is an explicit and express command to subdivisions of government to perform a duty, a duty which may be enforced by mandamus: Com. ex rel. Hamilton v. The Select and Common Councils of Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/34/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="418009" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0496-01">34 Pa. 496</a>; East St. Louis v.

The right to mandamus after money on a loan has been secured indicates that the duty imposed by the Constitution is a regulation of the exercise of the power and does not qualify the power itself: section 10 is purely regulatory. In Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., volume 1, section 211, page 418, the author says: “The general construction put upon these provisions is that they are <em>qualifications and restrictions upon the power or mode of exercising the power </em>of municipalities to become indebted;...... We venture to observe that, so far as these and like decisions (see note for authorities) hold that the constitutional provisions quoted are mandatory, that they impose a duty upon the legislature in authorizing the creation of debt, to provide for the levy each year of a tax sufficient to pay the interest and to extinguish the principal at maturity, and that the duty thus imposed is absolute and may be enforced by mandamus or other appropriate remedy; their soundness is beyond question. But the Constitutions do not in general expressly provide that if the municipality does not at or before the time of creating a debt pass an ordinance levying such a tax, that such debt, if otherwise in all respects authorized and valid and for which the municipal<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>ity has received full consideration, <em>shall he void. </em>If the debt is void, the failure of the municipal officers to do their duty is visited upon third persons, although these persons can enforce such duty in the courts just as effectually as if the duty enjoined by the Constitution or by statute had been reaffirmed and redeclared in a municipal ordinance or resolution....... It is not essential, where an <em>ordinance </em>is not expressly required, that the municipality itself should make provision by ordinance for the levy of the tax, as the insertion of the direction in the enabling or other statute that a sufficient tax be levied gives the bondholder the right to enforce the levy by mandamus or other suitable remedy. This sound view will probably have the effect to modify prior decisions in several States which assert, or assume, or proceed upon the view that a resolution or ordinance for the levy of the tax is in all cases a sine qua non to the validity of the debt.”</p>

That was a case where the indebtedness of Wilkins Township was within the 2% limit. Nevertheless bonds were issued and offered for public sale. A taxpayer filed a bill to restrain the issuance of the bonds, averring a failure on the part of the township authorities to assess a tax sufficient to secure the redemption within a period of thirty years. The court below sustained this contention. Mr. Justice Sadler said: “One narrow question is now presented for consideration. A tax was assessed by the township authorities sufficient to pay the principal of the bonds, with interest at <em>5.6% </em>within the period fixed by law....... Upon its face, the tax so provided for is insufficient, by $2,100, to pay the total for which the township made itself liable. It is ample, however, if the agreement to pay state tax is disregarded, and it is now insisted that <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>such a charge need not be considered in making the assessment.” Justice Sadler held that the promise of the township to pay the state tax was a part of the liability, for the liquidation of which a fund must be provided. “To put a check upon the incurring of indebtedness by municipalities, the Constitution not only limited the amounts which could be borrowed, but required provision for repayment within a fixed period, and, with this thought in mind, the special tax was provided for. It is immaterial whether the definite promise of the township to pay be called principal or interest. What must be looked at is the obligation assumed. In the present instance, it has contracted for the payment of the four mills for the benefit of the State; it is a part of the debt which the township is bound to pay, and for which it must malte provision. This it has clearly failed to do, and, as a result, its attempted issue of bonds was properly restrained.” Justice Sadler refers to article IX, section 10, of the Constitution as a “mandate.” He says: “To enforce this mandate, the Act of April 20,1874, P. L. 65, directed a levy in such cases not exceeding in any one year <em>8% </em>of the borrowed sum, to provide Tor the payment of interest and the liquidation of the principal.’ An amendment of April 18, 1897, P. L. 17, makes like requirement, omitting, however, the clause limiting the sum to be collected annually, and this legislation is now applicable to townships of the first class...... See also Act of April 28, 1915, P. L. 195.”</p>

Under a long and consistent line of decisions handed down by this court the debt should be declared void. Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., volume I, section 211, page 418, is cited in the majority opinion. Only part of section 211 is quoted, however. As I read this entire section, I interpret it as opposed to the position taken by the majority opinion. In the excerpt from Dillon quoted in the majority opinion six dots indicating an omission appear in the fourth line of the quotation. The clause omitted reads as follows: “That no indebtedness can be incurred without a substantial compliance with their requirements [i. e., the requirements of constitutional provisions], and that contracts made, and bonds and other evidences of indebtedness issued, in violation of their terms are invalid, and, if there be no estoppel, cannot be enforced.” Where the six dots appear in the last part of the quotation cited in the majority opinion, indicating an omission, I find, inter alia, the following from Dillon: “Under this provision of the Constitution no municipal corporation can incur debt without legislative authority, express or implied; but the grant of such legislative authority carries with it the constitutional obligation on the part of the municipality to levy and collect a sufficient annual tax to pay the interest as it matures and the principal within the prescribed term of years....... The <em>provision </em>required by the Constitution <em>mewns such fixed and definite provision </em>for the levying and collecting of the required tax as will become a legal right in favor of the holder of bonds issued thereon, or in favor of any person to whom such debt may be payable. But the provision of the Constitution <em>is sufficiently complied with </em>if the <em>statute </em>which confers authority upon the municipality to incur the debt directs that an annual tax shall be levied sufficient to pay the interest on and create a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds.” Dillon <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>makes it very plain that no valid debt can be incurred by a municipality unless either the municipality itself makes provision for the levy of taxes, or that there be a direction in the enabling or other statute that a sufficient tax be levied to take care of the indebtedness.</p>

The cases cited do not sustain any such proposition. The case of Boro, of Rainsburg v. Fyan, supra, gives no support to the proposition set forth in the majority opinion. <em>In that case the indebtedness of the borough was not increased by a single cent. </em>The court below in that case said: “At least $350 of the amount borrowed was applied in the mere exchange of one creditor for another by paying an existing lawful debt, without thereby increasing the debt, and the other portion of the loan, to wit, $150 of the identical money borrowed from the plaintiff, remaining in the treasury of the borough for the use of the plaintiff. It should not in this case be held to have been such an increase of indebtedness as becomes unlawful, for, taking into consideration this unexpended fund lying in the treasury and held there for the purpose, as seems conceded, to pay back to plaintiff, the indebtedness of the borough was not increased thereby.”</p>

The court held, as appears from the excerpt first quoted, that <em>there was no actual increase in the borough’s indebtedness, and therefore the payment of the $500 interest did not involve a breach of article IX, section 10, of the Constitution. </em>The judgment was affirmed per curiam.</p>

There was not the slightest suggestion that the borough in incurring this debt had violated any provision of the Constitution; the only question was the validity of the paper supporting the judgment. The debt itself was not stamped with illegality. The debt in the case before us is illegal and void, because the Constitution says municipalities cannot incur debts the way Maidenereek Township attempted to incur this one.

To sanction the attempted validation by the action of the supervisors in 1930 of the debts they illegally incurred in 1921 and 1928, respectively, would be to countenance an. attempted circumvention of the Constitution. When a second-class township is not able to manage its fiscal affairs on a “pay-as-you-go” basis and is therefore obliged to incur an indebtedness, the Constitution in article IX, section 10, tells that municipality in language so clear that no doubtful meaning can be read into it, that it “shall at or before the time of so doing,” i. e., “incurring any indebtedness” “provide for the collection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof within thirty years.” Instead of obeying this constitutional behest and providing <em>at or before </em>the time of incurring the indebtedness for the collection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the debt in thirty years, the township supervisors waited nine years before providing for the collection of an annual tax with which to discharge the indebtedness. For nine years it saddled “a floating debt” on the municipality and this is one thing the Constitution says cannot be done lawfully. The bank is in effect asking us to write into section 10, of article IX, of the Constitution after the phrase “at or before the time of so doing,” the additional phrase “or within nine years thereafter.” The answer to that is that this court has no authority to amend the Constitution.</p>

In that case this court said in an opinion by the present Chief Justice: “......the financial resources of township supervisors are limited and they are without general power to borrow money on the credit of the township. An exception to this limitation, arising from necessity, exists however where, by reason of an extraordinary emergency or condition, such as a destruc<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>tive flood, roads are rendered impassable and bridges destroyed and the current revenues from taxation are insufficient to defray the unusual expenses necessary for repairs and reconstruction. In such case, as tbeir duty requires them to place bridges and roads in a reasonably safe condition for travel without delay, the only course open is to borrow the necessary funds, and power to do so is necessarily implied: Maneval v. Jackson Twp., <a href="/pa/141/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="141 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="974794" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0426-01">141 Pa. 426</a>, 435 [<a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20672" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="21 A. 672">21 A. 672</a>].” In the case before us there was no “extraordinary emergency or condition” to excuse the supervisors’ acts. No reason whatsoever can be invoked to explain the failure of the township supervisors to comply with article IX, section 10, of the Constitution in their attempt “to incur this indebtedness” in a manner utterly at variance with the constitutionally prescribed method of incurring it. The failure to comply with the Constitution makes this debt, in my opinion, void.</p>

In that case the lower court held (and the judgment was affirmed per cui’iam): “......the failure to file the statement before the issuing of the bonds of 1890, even if fatal to the issuing of bonds as bonds, was not an absolute and necessary precedent to the validity of the loan, as there was a lawful indebtedness existing, which the corporate authorities could afterwards recognize and pay.” In the case now before us there was no lawful indebtedness incurred and therefore none existing unless article IX, section 10, of the Constitution does not mean what it says.</p>

Section 2 of the Act of March 31, 1927, P. L. 91, making it the duty of the Department of Internal Affairs “to carefully examine all proceedings had by the several municipalities of this Commonwealth for the incurring or increasing of the indebtedness thereof, and to ascertain whether the proposed debt is within the limitations imposed by the Constitution and whether such proceedings are in conformity with existing laws” merely clothes that department with certain supervisory powers over municipalities. The act was not intended to establish the doctrine of the infallibility of the Secretrary of Internal Affairs on questions pertaining to the constitutionality and legality of municipal debts. The following succinct statement made by President Judge Schaeffer on this phase of the case in the discussion filed with his decision cannot be improved upon: “There is no warrant or authority in law for the Secretary of Internal Affairs, years after debts are illegally incurred, to validate them and make them legal obligations of the municipalities.

The indebtédness challenged is invalid because the conditions which section 10, of article IX, imposed as precedent to incurring it were not complied with. Therefore, no statute can save it. The Constitution is not subject to amendment either by the judiciary or by the legislature.</p>
