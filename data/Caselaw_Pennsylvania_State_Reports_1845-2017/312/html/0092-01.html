L. 106, leaves one <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>in no doubt concerning to whom and what <em>“such” </em>refers. This section, while not actually divided by the legislature, logically and grammatically <em>invites </em>division into four subsections. The first subsection emphatically says: <em>“No </em>individual, partnership, or unincorporated association shall hereafter engage directly or indirectly, in the” banking business without first obtaining a license to do so. Second, the next subsection prescribes what an “applicant” for a license must do and declares that “the board may, in its discretion, approve or disapprove the application.” The word “applicant” is mentioned in this subsection at least fifteen times. The third subsection proceeds on the theory that the application has been granted and the applicant has then become a “licensee.” This latter word appears in the third subsection at least six times, and the word “license” appears many more times, and once the following sentence is used in the third subsection: “It shall be unlawful for any person or partnership or unincorporated association holding such license certificate,” etc. The fourth subsection includes the last part of section 1 of the Act of 1911 plus the amendment of 1927, which deals with the question of preference accorded to depositors. That part which was in the original Act of 1911 and is still retained, provides that “the money and securities deposited with the Commissioner of Banking” by the licensee “and the money which in case of default shall be paid on the” licensee’s bond “by any applicant or the surety thereof, shall constitute a trust fund for the benefit of the depositors of the licensee,” etc., “and such beneficiaries shall be entitled to an absolute preference as to such moneys or securities over all general creditors of the licensee.” It is then immediately provided that in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the licensee, “such moneys and securities shall be delivered by the Commissioner of Banking, on the order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to the assignee, receiver, or trustee of the licensee designated in <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>such order or judgment.” In the very next sentence (this being the first part of the amending Act of 1927), it is provided that “in case of the insolvency of any such individual, partnership,” etc., the depositors shall be given a preference, etc.</p>
    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[179,623,1155,1508]]]'>“Such” i. e., “that kind” of individual, partnership, etc., as used in that sentence can mean only the individual, etc., who has been duly licensed as a private banker. If the word “such” does not mean that, it has no place or purpose whatever in the act. If the sentence quoted means what appellants contend it means, the word “such” is entirely superfluous and should be deleted so that the sentence would read: “In case of the insolvency of <em>any </em>individual,” etc., “acting as a private banker,” etc. For us to delete a word from an act so as to give it a different meaning is for us to engage in legislation. The “applicant” mentioned in subsection 2 has been transformed into a “licensed banker” in subsection 3. Section 1 of the Act of 1927 is therefore concerned only with “such [i. e., a duly licensed] individual, partnership, or unincorporated association.” It has no interest whatever in anyone who engages in the banking business without having been duly licensed. The amending Act of <em>1921, </em>which relates only to section 1 of the Act of 1911, makes no reference whatever to any individual, partnership, etc., who or which engages in the banking business <em>without </em>a license. <em>Section 1 </em>of the Act of <em>1911 </em>makes no reference whatever to an unlicensed banker except to “outlaw” him in the first ten lines of the act. When the Act of 1911 next refers to an unlicensed banker it is in séction <em>3, </em>where he is given the status of a misdemeanant and his punishment provided for.</p>

Such an interpretation would encourage the very practice the law condemns by relieving “outlaw” bankers of the necessity of making application, filing a bond and depositing securities, and would thereby accord bankers who flout and evade the law a preference over those who respect it and abide by it. Any interpretation of the Act of 1927 that leads to such an anomalous result would have to be based on equally anomalous grammar.</p>

The <em>only </em>bond or securities deposited would be those of <em>a duly licensed </em>banker, for the filing of an approved bond or the deposit of approved securities are prerequisites to the granting of a banker’s license.</p>
