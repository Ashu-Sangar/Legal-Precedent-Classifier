    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.9",286,[281,1217,1152,804]]]'>The City of Bethlehem contracted with the Rathbun Company for the improvement of two city streets. The contractor gave one bond for each contract, but the bonds did not include labor and materialmen as obligees or potential use-plaintiffs, nor did the city require an additional bond for the payment of labor, material and machinery used. The contractor became bankrupt and failed to pay the appellants who furnished materials to the contractor. This suit was instituted in trespass against the city to recover damages arising out of the neglect of the city to obtain the additional bond. The city, by affidavit of defense, raised the question of law that it was not liable to plaintiffs as it was acting in a governmental capacity. The court below sustained its legal position and this appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b287-3" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[193,620,1155,1026]]]'>The Act of May 10, 1917, P. L. 158, required cities in the erection of public buildings to procure an additional bond which would provide for the payment of labor and materialmen who are employed on the improvement. The Act of May 6, 1925, P. L. 546, provided that it <em>should be the duty </em>of cities, etc., to secure the additional bond. These acts, however, were not deemed broad enough to cover all the contingencies of a contractor’s failure to pay labor and materialmen. Accordingly, the Act of March 28,1929, P. L. 106, was enacted, providing: “That it shall be the duty of......counties......in the erection......of roads, bridges, edifices and public buildings......to require of the contractor......an additional bond......providing for the payment of” labor, materialmen and for machinery. These acts speak in the terms of a command to the respective municipalities, and the duty is imposed on them to secure an additional bond which shall provide for the payment of labor, materialmen and for machinery used in and about the work.</p>

Philadelphia School District, <a href="/pa/311/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="311 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1146296" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0090-01">311 Pa. 90</a>, and in reviewing them and the liability of municipalities for the payment of labor and materialmen of the contractor, it was stated: “Ordinarily, and at common law, the owner [municipality or other subdivision of government] is under no liability in a contractual sense, nor is......[it] under any duty [at common law] to pay, nor may......[its] property be subjected to payment of labor and materialmen of the contractor...... Property of municipalities, school districts and the like are exempt from such liability.. A mechanics lien or attachment in the nature thereof cannot be filed against property belonging to these agencies of government.” On, <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>page six, it is stated: “......the two bonds......[that were required to be given] one for the protection in construction, [and] the other for the benefit of labor and materialmen, [are] two distinct and separate obligations...... But......neither bond changed the common law status of the owner [municipality] as it related to the contractor’s employees or materialmen.” After citing many cases, we said: “These cases clearly show a municipality has no duty to see that labor and material-men are paid......” In construing the real purpose of the acts in question, we there stated: “The legislature has, however, seen fit to protect labor and materialmen engaged by a contractor in the erection of public buildings or doing public work, by requiring the contractor to give a bond to protect them.” The legislature in due recognition of services connected with public works deemed it expedient to establish as part of the public policy of the Commonwealth that labor and materialmen should receive additional protection in the matter of compensation for such services to that heretofore <em>given; </em>as their labor and materials went into the construction of state or municipally owned property, they should have some guarantee for payment beyond that of the contractor. It therefore required the additional bond to .be given by the contractor. Neither bond was in fact necessary for the actual accomplishment of the particular undertaking, here the construction of a street. The requirement of the additional bond was purely an act of government, a protective measure for the betterment of a substantial part of the public, that is, persons who worked or provided materials for public works. The public generally would be assured that all elements contributory to its buildings, roads, and public works were paid for and no complaint could be lodged against the government that the means had not been afforded to provide for payment of labor or material connected therewith.</p>

It did not prescribe any penalty for their failure to act, nor did it impose any liability on the municipality if anyone should suffer loss.by such failure; but there is always a remedy to enforce performance of a public duty. It was within the power of those who dealt with the contractor to see that protection was procured, even though the additional bond was not given when their contracts were executed. Where á county, city, borough, town, township, school district, or poor district fails to require a contractor employed in and about the erection, alteration, addition or repair of roads, bridges, edifices and public buildings to secure an additional bond as required by law for the payment of labor, material and machinery, the courts will compel the performance of this public duty by mandamus.

They argue that these accretions mean more patronage for its municipal utilities, more money circulating within its borders, more taxes for better streets, parks and public buildings, better homes, churches and schools, and that where these powers and functions are granted to it for the specific benefit and advantage of the urban community embraced within its corporate boundaries, such functions are purely corporate in character, and, therefore, the failure to perform the duty entailed liability.</p>

See Cheltenham Twp. v. P. R. T. Co., <a href="/pa/292/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="292 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1109666" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0384-01">292 Pa. 384</a>, and North Middleton Twp. v. Weary, <a href="/pa-super/78/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="78 Pa. Super. 503" data-case-ids="650229" data-case-paths="/pa-super/78/0503-01">78 Pa. Superior Ct. 503</a>. Cities and boroughs with respect to highways are similar to counties and townships as discussed in this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[260,1547,1153,372]]]'>The act of procuring a bond was extraneous to the particular power herein involved. It was incidental to its performance, and was not directly involved in the construction, repair and maintenance of a highway. The duty to procure it was governmental, and the legislation provided no penalty for such failure. Neglect to perform will not impose liability on the city.</p>
    <p id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[259,1927,1152,426]]]'>Appellants say there was a conspiracy among the officers not to procure the additional bond. If this condition of affairs really existed, it might become very important as between the officers and the subcontractors or materialmen who had not been paid, but it does not in the least strengthen their position in this action against the city, nor would the question of their good faith in acting for the best interest of the city aid.</p>
    <p id="b292-7" data-blocks='[["BL_292.7",292,[305,2362,818,44]]]'>Judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
