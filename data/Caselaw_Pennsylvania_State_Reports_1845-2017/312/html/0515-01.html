The important date in determining the property which passes to the trustee is the day of the adjudication. In White, Trustee, v. Stump, <a href="/us/266/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="266 U.S. 310" data-case-ids="6141327" data-case-paths="/us/266/0310-01">266 U. S. 310</a>, 313, the court said: “Thus we have said that the law discloses a purpose ‘to fix the line of cleavage’ with special regard to the conditions existing when the petition is filed,......and that <em>—‘It is then that the bankruptcy proceeding is initiated, </em>that the hands of the bankrupt and of his creditors are stayed and <em>that his estate passes actually or potentially </em>into the control of the bankruptcy court.’ ”</p>

In other words, on that day this property, including the cash surrender value of the policies of insurance, yielded no equity available for the trustee in bankruptcy. It has been established in á long line of cases beginning with Burlingham v. Crouse, <a href="/us/228/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="228 U.S. 459" data-case-ids="3667606" data-case-paths="/us/228/0459-01">supra,</a> that where a life insurance policy has no cash surrender value, nothing passes to.the trustee. In that case the loan and cash surrender value were the same, insured died and the Supreme Court held no title to the insurance passed to the trustee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> It must follow a.trus<a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>tee is entitled to cash surrender value only if the poliey in fact has one or that which is free from liens less than that value.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.6",548,[273,500,1159,970]]]'>Granting for a moment the trustee had title subject to the lien, unless the property should increase in value its title was valueless. Is it possible then to reason that the bankrupt’s death, causing the face value of the insurance policies to become due, actually increased the value of the property and created an equity which the trustee can claim? This does not accord either with the letter, the spirit, or the judicial interpretation of the law as to this increment in value of life insurance policies resulting from death. The difference between cash surrender value and face value of policies is not to be considered an increase in value in the same sense that the difference in market value of stock on different days is an increase in <em>value; </em>rather it is after-acquired property. True, the difference represents the proceeds of a contract between the bankrupt and the insurance company, but it is property specifically exempted from the hand of the trustee by section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act, supra.</p>

If a relative or friend had advanced to her the funds necessary to lift the debt and had taken the property over or given it to the bankrupt,' would such act inure to the benefit of creditors whose rights were fixed on the day of adjudication? The accident of death does not raise a fund for creditors from a contract which the policy of the law has announced shall inure to the benefit of beneficiaries rather than creditors. Property may not be reached by indirection that cannot be reached directly. While it is undoubted the trustee may claim any increase in market value of stocks held as collateral for indebtedness, here no such increase existed. The purpose of this provision <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>as to insurance in- the Bankruptcy Act was to enable bankrupts, after bankruptcy, to retain their insurance after payment to the trustee of the cash surrender value, since, in many instances, because of age or debility, the procurement of new insurance would be impossible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

The mere chance that it so adopted this method of satisfying its claim does not cause the beneficiaries to lose the whole benefit of the insurance proceeds. Though the executor could not compel the bank to subject the life estate and the stock to part payment, thereby releasing a portion of the proceeds of the insurance policies,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">†</a> it does not necessarily follow that because the executor may not compel such action, he is thereby deprived of any remedy in such a situation. The relations between junior claimants established by law cannot be injuriously affected by adverse action by the pledgee. If a remedy is necessary, the executor may be subrogated to the rights of the bank, his decedent’s creditor, in the property discharged from the lien by reason of the payment from her (the decedent’s) own property acquired subsequently to her adjudication in bankruptcy. In Barbin v. Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.%20409" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="159 A. 409">159 Atl. 409</a> (N.

The insured died and the bank paid the loan from the insurance and satisfied the mortgage. The mortgaged property was then sold and the beneficiaries claimed the sum from the estate that they were entitled to, as though the pledgee had collected on the mortgage collateral. The court held they were entitled to that money even though creditors went unpaid. See Burlingham v. Crouse, <a href="/us/228/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="228 U.S. 459" data-case-ids="3667606" data-case-paths="/us/228/0459-01">supra.</a></p>

In equity the situation is, in substance, as though the bank had sold all the collateral subject to its lien and applied the proceeds of such property, together with sufficient from the proceeds of the life insurance policies, to the payment of its claim, and now held the balance of the proceeds of the life insurance policies. To deny the executor his right to this fund is, in effect, to permit the trustee in bankruptcy to reach property of the bankrupt acquired after the adjudication of bankruptcy, as well as to deprive the bankrupt or his representatives of the benefits under section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act, supra, as to insurance.</p>
