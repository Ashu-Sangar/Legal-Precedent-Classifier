An ordinance of the city enacted December 15, 1931, required those giving athletic contests or exhibitions at which an admission was charged to pay a license fee based upon a reasonable estimate of the number of policemen or firemen which, in the opinion of the director of public safety, would be necessary to protect the public safety at and on the premises at such contests or exhibitions, at the rate per man of $5.50 per day. Appellee and the Philadelphia National League Club were notified by the director of public safety that neither would be permitted to play its first scheduled game unless it applied for a license, and paid as the license fee for that particular <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>game $66.00, and thereafter it would be required to pay a license fee for each of its scheduled games or exhibitions for the year 1932. The applications for licenses and payment of the fees were made under protest. Appellee and the Philadelphia National League Club filed a bill in equity against the city, its mayor, director of public safety and superintendent of police, to have the ordinance declared invalid and to restrain its enforcement. The court below decreed the ordinance invalid, restrained its enforcement, and directed the repayment of the fees already paid. The city appeals from this decree.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[263,991,1155,913]]]'>At the outset it must be noted that the ordinance deals with private enterprises engaged in a continuous seasonal business for profit, which make extraordinary use of municipal facilities in order to conduct their private business successfully. The profitable operation of these businesses involves the attraction of a large number of persons to a central place. They require a large number of police officers for the maintenance of public order, especially at the ticket windows and entrances, the speedy conduct of traffic on the highway, and the protection of appellees’ property and business in supervising the attendance by preventing from attending those who fail to pay an admission fee. Without the presence of this unusual number of policemen, the proper ordering, protection and safety of the public would be impossible, where, as is usual at public athletic contests, large groups of persons gather together.</p>

It was said in the last case cited, page 361: “if a, corporation ‘so carries on its business as to justify, at the hands of any municipality, a police supervision of the property and instrumentalities used therein, the municipality is not bound to furnish such supervision for nothing, and may, in addition to ordinary property taxation, subject the corporation to a charge for the expense of the supei’vision.’ ” The conditions requiring these special services were created by appellees, and the municipality was required to render them. Manifestly the conduct of appellees’ business imposes on the municipality a special burden, of which the municipality has a right to be relieved.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[190,1105,1156,1130]]]'>It is objected that the ordinance imposes a tax under the guise of a license fee and was enacted purely as a revenue producing measure. The history of the ordinance is set forth by appellees to substantiate this theory. In the broad sense every ordinance which requires the payment of money is a revenue producing measure, but <em>the primary purpose of ordinances </em>such as this under consideration <em>is the reimbursement of the city </em>for providing special services to the licensees. The preamble of the ordinance in part reads: “Whereas, it is necessary for the City of Philadelphia, acting through its department of public safety, to furnish the services of firemen and policemen to protect the public safety at athletic contests and exhibitions, by assigning police and firemen to regulate traffic created thereby and to guard against fire within the premises used for such contests and exhibitions.” Though we may suppose the ordinance was imposed to increase the revenue, this does not invalidate it as a licensing ordinance if it clearly appears the city is seeking to compel the persons who cause expense to pay for it.</p>

The wage of policemen varies according to the length of service from $4.40 to $6.00 per day.' The rate of $5.50 per man fixed by the ordinance is not excessive or unreasonable; it is based on a workday of eight hours and is the customary wage. Prom past experience, as well as by prior mutual arrangement, some 12 policemen under command of a sergeant were deemed necessary by the director of public safety of the City of Philadelphia and by appellee for the purposes heretofore mentioned. In addition, a considerable number of extra officers for the purpose of regulating traffic on streets neighboring appellees’ parks, and for which no charge is made, were required.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[249,1431,1156,914]]]'>However, it is contended by appellee that the ordinance involves a delegation of legislative authority in that the amount of the license fee is not fixed and determined by the ordinance, but is left dependent upon the number of men employed in performing the extra services for appellee; and that the number is wholly within the discretion of the director of public safety, an administrative official. Thus, it is pointed out, the amount of the license is in reality wholly determined by an administrative officer and not by the legislative body. If this conclusion is true, unquestionably the ordinance is invalid for the legislature may not delegate its law making authority; but an examination of the ordinance as related to the facts at once discloses that the means used to determine the amount of the license fees are similar to those involved in nearly all license legislation.</p>

Generally speaking, in all cases where the reasonableness of the action of the administrative officer in fixing license fees is subject to the visitation of the courts, if the discretion lodged in such an official is abused, the courts will provide a remedy as the case arises.</p>

It is the determination of this value which fixes the amount of the tax.' It is so with respect to telephone pole and wire license fees. The determination of reasonableness as to the charge is an administrative matter concluded by what is then considered proper.

The sole purpose of the act was the defining of the terms of the policy contract and enforcement of its use. No form had been drafted, but the whole matter was left to the commissioner with a penalty fixed for failure to comply with his requirements. In the instant case the purpose is declared, the subject-matter is definite, the acts to be licensed stated, the rate of the levy fixed, the official to levy named, the standard of reasonableness prescribed, and the penalty for disobedience determined.

As to the first ground, it seems hardly necessary to point out that there is a considerable difference between the necessity for policing athletic contests and other forms of amusement and entertainment, such as theaters, musical concerts, art exhibitions and the like. It is commonly known that larger numbers of people usually congregate at one time for an athletic contest than at places of other forms of amusement. The conduct of persons congregating at athletic contests is different from that of those attending other forms of entertainment. Considering the distinction made by the ordinance between athletic contests where admission is paid and where no admission is paid although police supervision may be necessary, we may point out that such a classification is not arbitrary nor without a sound basis. Where admission is charged, the maintenance of the exhibition or contest is in the nature of a business for profit, while in the case where no admission is charged there is present no suggestion of business. It is not without reason that where a profit is expected, and the whole purpose of the exhibition is to produce a profit, the city authorities should conclude <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>that it is improper to require the public to contribute to the success of the business to a greater extent than is necessary in the conduct of other businesses. It does not appear as unreasonable that the municipal authorities should require those who demand special services from it in order to conduct their businesses at a profit to pay for the additional services, and not burden other citizens of the municipality with the cost of such services.</p>

In answer we may say it is true the city is obligated to render services to all taxpayers, but where that service is worked into the success of their business so that they may make a profit, a different question arises. There is a vast distifiction between great public buildings which house thousands, great department stores where thousands visit daily, great industrial plants where tens of thousands are employed, who at noon and evening hours discharge on the public streets tens of thousands who need no extra police supervision, and an athletic contest such as a baseball game which imposes on the city an extraordinary expense. In brief the city should not be required to help defray the operating costs of a business of this kind.</p>

In that case the ordinance provided that “not exceeding four regular or special officers” might be detailed to attend any theater to preserve strict order, etc. We do not consider the presence of this maximum limitation feature essential to the validity of an ordinance of this kind because four policemen might be a wholly unreasonable number and the cost of their services an arbitrary levy for a license to operate a particular theater, while a proper number and expense therefore as to another theater.</p>

The duty of protecting the person or citizen from dangers of fire in the exercise of the police power would seem to carry with it the right to employ the most effective means to that end, and this would include the right of designating competent agents or servants for the performance of such duty. The doctrine as to the right of the municipality to impose the cost of the performance of such services by the firemen on the manager of the theater, as was done in the case at bar, was upheld in New Orleans v.

Co., <a href="/pa/166/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="166 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="864260" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0072-01">166 Pa. 72</a>, 77, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20A.%20943" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="30 A. 943">30 A. 943</a>, that a law “must be complete in all its terms and provisions when it leaves the legislative branch of the government, and that nothing must be submitted to the judgment of the electors or other appointee of the legislature except an option to become or not to become subject to its requirements and penalties.” We cited this with approval in Baldwin Township’s Annexation, <a href="/pa/305/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="305 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1134628" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0490-01">305 Pa. 490</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.%20272" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="158 A. 272">158 A. 272</a>. We there made a distinction between a “law” which is so far from complete that something must be supplied by an agency other than the legislature in order to malee it complete, and a law which is complete in all its details but becomes operative only with the consent of the electors of a certain locality or, as in the Baldwin Township case, with the consent of the State Council of Education. In the case before us the ordinance imposing the license <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>fee or tax is not complete in all its details; before it becomes operative, the director of public safety must determine <em>the amount </em>of the fee to be charged. The ordinance itself is no more complete than is a signed check which is delivered to the payee named therein with the amount of the check left in blank. <em>This ordinance is as invalid as would be a state motor vehicle license law clothing the secretary of .revenue with the power to charge each applicant for a license a fee based on the secretary’s estimate of the number of miles of state highways the automobile licensed would be likely to traverse during the year. </em>The ordinance now in question introduced a new method of imposing a license fee or tax into our American system and no case anywhere sanctions this departure from the long established and constitutionally supported policy of making all license fees and taxes definite in the law imposing them.</p>

They were paid by the city at the rate of $4.40 for an eight-hour day, and their services at the baseball park took about three-fourths of an eight-hour day.

J., page 839, lays down this principle : “The legislature cannot delegate its powers to fix the tax rate.” In the case before us the council did delegate to the department of public safety “the power to fix the tax rate.” It is true that the tax rate is “$5.50 per policeman assigned” but the department of public safety determines <em>the number of policemen to be assigned </em>at each game. If the council can lawfully do this, it can by ordinance say to any citizen: “If the department of public safety thinks you need extra police protection it can assign to you any number of policemen it sees fit and assess you $5.50 for every policeman so assigned and for each day of such assignment.” The wealthy parent of a child who might be subject to kidnapping could under this system be made to pay a fee “based upon a reasonable estimate of the number of police and firemen which, in the opinion of the director of public safety, are necessary to protect the public safety at and on the premises of such” citizen. (The language quoted is from the ordinance in question.) Such a system is oppressive and tyrannical and is out of place in this country. “Under the Norman kings of England, the right to tax to obtain money for public uses was vested in the king, and was exercised by him at his own will. The money directed by him to be raised was assessed on persons or property by the officers of the exchequer, collected by the sheriff, and paid into the exchequer.

To leave to a state officer or board the power to determine whether a tax should be laid for the current year, or at what rate, or upon what property, prescribes no rule and originates no authority.

The ordinance itself should specify every condition of the license, and the officer should be merely intrusted with the duty of issuing licenses to all who comply with the prescribed conditions.” The court said further: “It is therefore material to the validity of an ordinance that a fixed and definite license fee should be named in the ordinance, which all persons engaged in like business shall pay.

Section 5 provided that “the said board or officer in such city charged with the duty of issuing merchants’ licenses, shall have power to fix the sum to be paid for licenses required by this act, but such license fee shall not be fixed at less than three nor more than five hun<a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>dred dollars for every class or group......” The Supreme Court of Missouri said: “......the authority to name and fix the amount of the imposition between those designated sums is plainly delegated to the commissioner, and can be exercised according to his arbitrary discretion in the premises, subject only to the qualification ......‘that the license fee exacted shall be uniform in each city in which it is collected.’ Until the commissioner acts and determines upon the rate of the imposition to be levied within the limits of the city for which he is appointed, no one of that community can determine from the law itself what the license fee or tax is or will be. <em>Until he acts, the rate of the taw is an unknown quantity. In fact, until he acts, there is no taw provided. An undetermined taw is in law no taw </em>[italics supplied]. The determination of the amount or rate of a tax to be imposed is as essential an exercise of the taxing power as the designation of the property to be taxed, or ■ the time for its collection or enforcement.” The court held that in this act the uniformity clause of the Missouri State Constitution was violated, which provides that all taxes to be levied “shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and that all taxes shall be levied and collected by general law.” (This is practically identical with the provision in section 1, article 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.) The court said further that the uniformity clause of the constitution had been violated “not only by the arbitrary and unreasonable classification of merchants of a natural class, for the particular purpose of this particular imposition, and also on account of the discretion given to the commissioner to be named under the act to fix, in different cities, different license fees or rates of taxation upon the merchants of the same designated class, but the very uncertainty in the language of the act has introduced another element of possible and probable inequality and want of uniformity in the matter of determining the amount of the <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>tax to be fixed and imposed. In the exercise of the taxing power, which is thé very essence of sovereignty, and of the gravest consequences to the citizen, there ought to be no ambiguity or uncertainty in the language of the law.”</p>

The court declared the act unconstitutional as an attempt to delegate an essential element of the power of taxation. Judge Garrison there said: “That the amount to be raised by taxation is to be based upon the expense incurred by the commission in construction and maintenance does not render the determination of the amount of taxation any less a matter that is committed to the judgment and discretion of the commissioners...... This court is unequivocally committed to the doctrine that the legislature of this state, in which the governmental power of taxation resides, does not possess the power to delegate to another body, having no governmental functions, the authority to determine, in its judgment or discretion, the amount to be raised by taxation, to which obviously must be added that such authority is in effect so delegated if such body may be empowered to levy taxes to the amount of an indebtedness to be incurred by it in its judgment or discretion.”</p>

Nowhere is this power entrusted to the executive branch of government, not even in these days when unusual and extraordinary powers are being transferred by Congress to the President. Cooley in his “Constitutional Limitations,” volume 2, 8th edition, page 986, says of the power to impose taxes: “No attribute of sovereignty is more pervading, and at no point does the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>power of the government affect more constantly and intimately all the relations of life than through the exactions made under it.” Chief Justice Marshall in M’Culloch v. Maryland, <a href="/whart/4/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="4 Whart. 316" data-case-ids="1835013" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0316-01">4 Wh. 316</a>, said that “the power to tax is the power to destroy.” I can find no constitutional warrant and no justification in any sound view of public policy for entrusting any administrative officer of city, state, or nation, with this “pervading,” “destroying” power.</p>

In the case of Miller v. Seare et al., decided in 1773, 2 Wm. Blackstone’s Reports 1140,* page 1142, Chief Justice He Grey aptly said on the subject of arbitrary power: “Here, little danger is to be apprehended from such a power of commitment, as the commissioners are usually men of knowledge and discretion, chosen by the Great Seal, and acting under its immediate inspection. The defendant, Mr. Seare, in particular, we all personally know to be a gentleman of the utmost integrity and honour. But, in the <em>country, </em>very low and obscure men often creep into the commission, and to arm them with such arbitrary powers would be of the most terrible consequence.”</p>

The discretion vested in the director of public safety by this ordinance is one that can <em>not </em>under our federal and state Constitutions <em>be vested in any official. </em>The charge imposed as a license fee by the director of public safety is a “taking of property” according to his judgment or caprice and not “by due process of law.” Cooley on “Taxation,” 4th edition, volume 1, section 348, says: “As to the equal protection of the laws clause, it is beyond question that it applies both to license or business taxes and also to license Tees.’ ”</p>

It does not fix the fee but gives the director of public safety absolute discretion to determine the number of police and firemen necessary ‘at the rate per man of $5.50 per day.’ It is true that the fee is to be ‘based upon a reasonable estimate of the number of police and firemen which......are necessary,’ but that rests entirely in his opinion.”</p>
