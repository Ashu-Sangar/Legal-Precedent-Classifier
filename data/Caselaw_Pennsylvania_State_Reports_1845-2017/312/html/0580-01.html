H. Bentley. The only question we are asked to decide is whether or not defendant is liable for the negligence of Bentley.</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.8",605,[184,899,1154,531]]]'>In their statement of claim appellees aver, inter alia, that “At the same time [i. e., the time of the collision] one B. H. Bentley, an agent and employee of the defendant, P. G. Publishing Company, was driving an automobile southwardly upon said Jacob Street, upon the business of said defendant, P. G. Publishing Company, and within the scope of his, said B. H. Bentley’s, authority and employment,” and then and there negligently ran into appellees’ car, causing the injury of which complaint is made.</p>

Under such circumstances they are conclusively determined to be true for the purposes of the trial: Section 13 of the Practice Act of 1915, P. L. 483, 485; Farbo v. Caskey, <a href="/pa/272/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="272 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1068377" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0573-01">272 Pa. 573</a>; Gurdus v. Phila. Nat.

Indeed, no countervailing evidence was offered, appellant contenting itself with testimony tending to show that the automobile being driven by Bentley, belonged to him personally and not to defendant (which, standing alone, is an immaterial matter: Lotz v. Hanlon, <a href="/pa/217/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="217 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="953647" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0339-01">217 Pa. 339</a>, 341), without even offering to prove that it was not then being used with his, defendant’s knowledge and consent, npon his business, and within the scope of Bentley’s authority and employment. The question at issue then resolves itself into this: Is an employer liable for the negligent acts of his employee, if this results in injury to a nonnegligent third <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>party, while the employee is upon the business of the employer and. within the scope of his, the employee’s, authority and employment?</p>

In 2 Mechem on Agency (2d ed.) 1458, it is said: “It is sufficient to make the master responsible civiliter, if the wrongful act of the servant was committed in the business of the master, and <em>within the scope of his employment </em>and this, although the servant, in doing it, departed from the instructions of his master.” In 1 Shear-man &amp; Redfield on the Law of Negligence (6th ed.), 347, it is said: “It is an old and thoroughly established doctrine that, where the relation of master and servant exists, the master is responsible to third persons for the damage caused by the wrongful acts or omissions of his servants, in the course of their employment as such.” And again, page 357: “The test of the liability of a master for the torts of his servant is, <em>whether the latter was at the time acting within the scope of his authority, </em>and not whether the act was done in accordance with instructions.” So, also, it is said in 2 Berry on Automobiles (6th ed.) 1073, and in note in <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.L.R.%20739" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="57 A.L.R. 739">57 A.
