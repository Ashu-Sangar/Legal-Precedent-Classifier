The holder agrees to execute a warranty deed and deliver with it a policy of title insurance insuring a clear title. The bond provides that it shall not “vest any right, title, lien, interest or option to or in favor of any of the parties hereto in or against said property..... .nor......constitute an incumbrance or restriction against said land, or cloud in any manner or degree whatsoever the title hereto, or restrict the sale and transfer thereof or the consideration to be received therefor, but said property may be, by any holder thereof, sold and transferred as freely in all respects as though this certificate or bond had never been issued, and the privilege of so selling and conveying said property to this company or its order at the date of maturity as herein above mentioned; and accepting the aforesaid sum of money in payment therefor, or of retaining and keeping the said lot or tract of land, free and clear of any liens or claims whatsoever of the company, shall be entirely optional with the person, firm or corporation who shall at the said time of maturity, be the lawful owner of the said property covered hereby, and the registered or otherwise lawful owner hereof.”</p>

      <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>Appellant contends that it makes contracts merely to buy real estate and that such contracts are not insurance; in the brief it is said “defendant’s contracts are real estate options”; that appellant agrees to buy the land if the bondholder wishes to sell it; that insurance involves payment against a risk or contingency not under the control of the insured, which, it is said, is wanting here. If there were nothing more than an agreement to buy the land, it would of course not be insurance. But the avowed purpose of the parties is, as appellant advertises, to eliminate the “risk of depreciation,” “to safeguard against loss,” to avoid “any risk to the principal.” An insurer guarantees against loss by an event that may or may not happen. The event specifically contemplated here, as appellant asserts, is depreciation in value of certain land below the price paid; the loss to be indemnified is the amount of that depreciation. In order that insurance may be practicable, it is necessary, in settling the terms on which a policy against property loss may be written, to determine how the amount of loss may be ascertained. In fire insurance, for example, the policy may state a maximum of insurance, leaving the burden of proof of loss on the insured, with recovery limited by the maximum. Or, a valued policy may be issued, generally subjecting the good faith of the valuation to challenge by the insurer if loss occur, unless otherwise limited by law (cf. Orient Insurance Co. v. Daggs, <a href="/us/172/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="172 U.S. 557" data-case-ids="3605193" data-case-paths="/us/172/0557-01">172 U. S. 557</a>, 565; also, see Richards, Insurance, 4th edition, page 36 et seq.) In marine insurance, to take another example, the determination of the amount of indemnity payable was found to be complicated by the difficulty of ascertaining promptly (frequently at a distance from the loss) whether the loss was total or partial and what the salvage might be. In consequence, there developed the right to declare a constructive loss, give notice of abandonment to the insurer, and claim for total loss, allowing the insurer to recover what, if anything, might be salvaged, (cf.

    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[275,611,1155,1561]]]'>Diversity of subject-matter necessarily creates differences in the practical conduct of insurance. Looking, now, at appellant’s contracts, in the light of the nature of insurance and the illustrations suggested, it is first to be noticed, that ordinarily there must be obvious difficulty in determining, in advance, what rates of premium will prove adequate to raise a fund from which, on principles of average-experience, losses resulting from the great variety of causes producing land-value depreciation, may be paid. It is a new subject of insurance. In addition, account must be taken of the difficulties otherwise frequently arising in proving loss in market value of land or depreciation from price paid for land. As the amount to be paid and received depends on indemnity, the arrangement, which the parties would seek to make, would be such that the insured might not make a profit by the insurance. These difficulties, which would bear on both appellant and its bondholders, they have eliminated from the problem, by agreeing in advance that, on notice at maturity by the holder of a bond that the market value of property has fallen below the price paid for it, instead of requiring the insured to prove the amount of depreciation, the holder will convey the land to the insurer, who (for example, as the insurer in the case of abandonment after constructive loss in marine insurance) must take it, pay the amount agreed on, and, if he choose, salvage as best he may. We think this is insurance and not a mere obligation to buy ten years after date if the holder desires to sell.</p>

It was held that such a contract was insurance. The application was “for an option sale contract of $- per acre......” The court said “We cannot conceive that the farmer’s primary object was to sell his crop. Ordinarily a man does not pay a premium for the privilege of selling his produce. Nor was it the primary purpose of the company to purchase the crop. From the very terms of the contract, it is certain that it must lose money upon all the grain it buys under the contract ......It was a contract by which the guarantor undertook to guarantee or assure the farmer a certain revenue from his land. How did the parties proceed to execute such a contract? It is well known to both parties that an acre of land in this state, farmed as the farmer contracts to farm it in this case, will produce a crop of a value far in excess of $5.00, and the value can be reduced to or below that figure only by the happening of one or more of the contingencies hereinbefore mentioned. But such contingencies may happen, and to be absolutely assured that his land will yield him at least $5.00 per acre, the farmer is willing to pay something......”</p>
