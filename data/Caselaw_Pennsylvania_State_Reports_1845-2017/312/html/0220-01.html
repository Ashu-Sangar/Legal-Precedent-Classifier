He used twenty-four motor trucks for this purpose. He reported gross receipts of $23,938.05. The tax at the rate of eight-tenths of one per cent amounting to $191.50 was assessed against him on November 27, 1931, by the Department of Revenue and approved by the Department of the Auditor General on November 30, 1931. Appellant filed a petition with the Department of Revenue alleging that the act under which the tax was assessed was unconstitutional and prayed for a resettlement of the tax. Both the Department of Revenue and the Board of Finance and Revenue negatived appellant’s contention and the case reached on appeal the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, where it was tried without a jury under the Act of April 22,1874, P. L. 109. That court held the taxing act constitutional and directed judgment to be entered in favor of the Commonwealth in the sum of $191.50, with interest from February 28, 1932, amounting to $11.49, and the Attorney General’s commission of 5 per cent or $10.15. Exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law were overruled on March 30, 1933, and on April 4,1933, judgment was entered against the defendant for $213.14.</p>
