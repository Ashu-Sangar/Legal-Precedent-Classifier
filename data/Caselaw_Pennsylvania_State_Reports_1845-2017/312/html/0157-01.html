This supposed widow, known as Mrs. Harold Wallace, or as Mrs. Jeanette P. Wallace, took out letters of administration on June 5, 1930. Her right to these was challenged by the second wife and the children. Negotiations concerning her status were carried on for approximately four months and ended on September 24, 1930, in an agreement providing, inter alia, that:</p>

It was also agreed that “such total shall be paid earlier than the installment dates herein designated if the condition of the assets of the estate conveniently permit and the parties of the third part hereby assign and transfer unto the party of the first part such portion of their distributive shares as may be necessary to meet the payments herein provided for to the party of <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>the first part, and expressly authorize the new administrator to make such payments on their behalf.”</p>

Some of these securities were deposited with a broker to secure a margin account, and others were hypothecated with a bank to secure a loan. The net value of the estate was then $78,000. During the time that Mrs. Wallace had been administratrix the value of these securities had greatly depreciated. At the request of the children she made no effort to sell them.</p>

They declared that they did not want a liquidation then because there would not be much left for their clients.- The next day they again met and Mrs. Wallace’s attorney insisted “on there being $21,000 at all times,” that “the estate be kept in a condition to make those payments.” He tes<a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>tified that Mr. Strong, the trust officer, said he “realized it was the duty of the administrator to convert” and the witness replied to him: “That is all I am asking you to- do.” On October 25, 1930, the liquidation of all the assets would have produced slightly more than enough to pay Mrs. Wallace. Mr. Maene testified that on the 27th and 28th of October, 1930, he again conferred with Mr. Melvin and “insisted that the assets should be liquidated and there should be kept at all times $21,000 and interest for the payment of Mrs. Wallace.” Mr. Melvin counselled delay in the hope that his clients might profit thereby. On November 6, 1930, Mr. Maene wrote the administrator as follows: “In view of a constantly descending trend in the market value of the securities comprising the estate, leaving at this time, however, sufficient in the estate to pay the amounts due to Jeanette P. Wallace, our client, under the aforementioned agreement [i. e., the one of September 24,1930], together with all debts, costs and charges, we are under the necessity of notifying you that our client will hold you liable for any loss to her occasioned by your failure to maintain the net value of the estate sufficient to pay her distributive share in full and we will expect you to maintain said value by liquidation of the assets if necessary.”</p>

On November 5, 1930, Ristine &amp; Co., stockbrokers, with whom some of the securities belonging to the estate were deposited in a margin account, informed Mr. Strong that “the account, to properly protect it, needs $8,000 and in view of the dangerous condition of the market we must ask that you give the matter immediate attention, as there is very little margin left.”</p>

The account was finally completely liquidated and netted $31.50.</p>

On November 6th it was $15,602.25. After liquidation the administrator received 50 shares of Central States Preferred, 40 shares of this corporation’s new preferred of 1929 and $2,500 Pennsgrove Water Supply 5s. The latter were sold in November1, 1931, for $1,118.75. The other stocks mentioned had not been sold. They could have been sold in November, 1931, for $3,480.

She set up a claim to them but, as the court below found, it was a “feeble claim,” and the administrator was unduly inactive in securing possession of them. Mrs. Mellier relinquished her claim to these securities on January 4,1932. They were worth <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>at decedent’s death, $8,000; on October 24, 1930, $4,106.

Exceptions were taken to this adjudication and the court below held that the administrator had no discretion to refuse the demand of Mrs. Wallace that the securities be sold immediately and that it should have complied with this demand on or before November 6, 1930. It surcharged the accountant with the amount of $18,260.18, which represented the full value of the securities as of November 6, 1930, less the debts. A decree affirming the judgment of the auditing judge was entered to that effect. Judge Henderson of' the court below said in his adjudication: “Its [i. e., the administrator’s] plain duty was a prompt conversion of the assets. This was demanded by the two large creditors, and as they were in a position to enforce their demands they were accorded such a conversion as saved them from any loss. Not so with the preferred distributee— Mrs. Wallace. She had no similar means of enforcing her demands, and counsel for the accountant urges that she and the children who took what was left, were equally the object of its concern. I cannot agree that they were ‘equally’ such object. By her assignment Mrs. Wallace had a preference and her demand was the voice of all.</p>

The secondary distributees insisted that the securities be held so that, when the market rises, they may yield sufficient to take care of their distributive share in the estate also.

The facts in that case differ so widely from the facts in this case as to make it of no value as guidance here. In that case (1) the executors were given the power to sell testator’s property “as soon as the same can conveniently be done with advantage to my [i. e., testator’s] estate.” (2) There was not, as this court said, “investment [by the executor] in a venturesome business.” (3) Two of the legatees wanted the property sold, but the other five legatees, when requested by the executor to sign an agreement that it should be sold, declined to do so. Appellant also cites Borell’s Estate, <a href="/pa/256/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="256 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1030730" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0523-01">256 Pa. 523</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%20953" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="100 A. 953">100 A. 953</a>, and Brown’s Estate, <a href="/pa/287/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="287 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="1099672" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0499-01">287 Pa. 499</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.%20112" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="135 A. 112">135 A. 112</a>.

They authorized the payment of $21,000 in cash to Mrs. Wallace out of the estate, on the date specified, or “earlier......if the condition of the assets of the estate conveniently permit” and they “assigned and <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>transferred” to her “such portion of their distributive shares as may be necessary to meet the payments herein provided for.” This was equivalent to their saying to Mrs. Wallace: “Your claim against this estate is paramount to ours.” This being the fact, the voice of Mrs. Wallace while perhaps not “the voice of all” (as the court below said it was) was certainly the voice of paramount authority. As a distributee of the estate she outranked the widow and the children, the latter three persons having conferred for a valuable consideration this higher rank upon her, and therefore the administrator was bound to obey the command of this superior beneficiary or distributee in exactly the same way he would have had to obey the commands of <em>all </em>the distributees <em>if all </em>had been of equal rank and <em>all </em>had joined in the demand for the sale of the securities. When Mrs. Wallace ordered the sale of the securities, they were then of sufficient value to satisfy her demand; by refusing to sell, in the hopes of a later rising market, the administrator was in effect gambling with her money to gain something for the claimants of secondary rank. This it could not do except at its own risk.</p>

This is a case of a demand upon the administrator by a person who had been given the status of a superior cestui que trust by the express agreement of all the other cestuis que trustent. When these other cestuis, i. e., the widow and the children, insisted that the administrator should <em>not </em>sell these securities, which at the then market price would yield only a sum far short of the widow’s and children’s earlier expectations, but should hold them for a hoped-for rising market, the obvious duty of the administrator was to offer the securities to these distributees at a sum sufficient to meet the claim of Mrs. <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>Wallace, and let <em>them </em>assume the risks of a speculative market.

The undertaking was of a hazardous nature. The ore was uncertain, both as to quantity and quality, and the cost of production was not known with even proximate certainty. The value of the ore when ready for the furnace was certain to be subject to the wide fluctuations of the iron market. The administrator, without consultation with creditors, and with no cautionary order from the court, and simply upon the advice of the next of kin, whose only hope for a share in the estate was in the preservation of the lease, expended a large amount of the money of the estate upon the leasehold. The business proved a failure and a large sum was lost to the estate. In that case this court said in an opinion by Mr. Justice <em>Dean </em>(page 130) : “Joseph A. and John K. Shinn, next of kin, examined the property, and they advised him [the administrator] to continue it in operation. It was their interest to do so......If it proved successful, there would be a surplus to go to them, the next of kin; if unsuccessful, they were no worse off, as the loss would fall upon the creditors. Yet the administrator took the creditors’ money and invested it in a wild speculation. He might, almost as safely, have invested it in stocks on the prospect of a rise. This was not ordinary business sagacity or prudent management.”</p>

Whatever the brokers required was obtained by sales of stock. The widow and three heirs consented at all times to the carrying of this speculative account by the administrator but at the end of January, 1893, another heir withdrew her ap<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>proval. It was held that the administrator was liable to the latter heir for the resulting losses after January 31,1893. The Supreme Court of Connecticut said (page 697) : “All the property of the estate, including these securities, was in a certain sense a trust fund in the hands of the administrators......The administrators had full knowledge that a part of that fund......was subject to the great hazards of the business of stock speculation......It was clearly their duty not to carry the speculative accounts for speculative gains, but to settle those accounts in a reasonable time, and thereby withdraw the securities from the perilous business in which they found themselves pledged. An administrator or an executor, in the absence of authority therefor, is not permitted to use any part of the estate in trade or manufacturing or stock speculation, or other business venture whereby the trust fund is put at hazard; and the doing by them of any of these things has generally been regarded as a breach of trust, rendering them personally liable for resulting losses, while incapable of sharing in accruing gains.....The administrators..... carried these accounts along as speculative accounts, for speculative purposes, in the hope of gains purely speculative and problematical......In doing so they clearly deviated from the strict line of their duty......They conducted the business of stock speculation in good faith and with ordinary care and prudence. But the law forbade them to enter upon or continue in that business, and, when charged with disobeying the law, it is no answer to say that the forbidden thing was done in good faith and with ordinary care and prudence. For loss resulting from this breach of duty the administrators are accountable to the widow and heirs, unless the acts which caused the loss were done with the consent and allowance of the widow and heirs.”</p>

It was, therefore, on that date that the administrator failed in its duty by disobeying the order of the one distributee whose fiat in this matter was “law.”</p>
