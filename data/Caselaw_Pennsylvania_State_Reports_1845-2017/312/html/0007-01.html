Corporation Real Estate Co. owned the Wellington Apartment House at the northeast corner of Nineteenth and Walnut Streets, Philadelphia, and an adjoining vacant lot to the east thereof. The borrower (Corporation Real Estate Co.) executed a bond, secured by a first mortgage on this property, to the lender (Penn Co.) as security for the loan. The loan was due December 31, 1932. This loan was guaranteed by the Philadelphia Company for Guaranteeing Mortgages, hereinafter referred to as the “Mortgage Guarantee Co.” The Penn Co. held no obligation of the Central Properties Co. for this debt. However, 78%% of the 315,000 shares of common stock of the latter company was owned by Reilly, Brock &amp; Co., Richard J. Seltzer, Inc., and Stroud &amp; Co., Inc.

    <p id="b41-4" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[178,542,1155,481]]]'>Presumably every surety has faith in the integrity and financial strength of his principal and has a reasonable expectation that he will never be called on to make good his commitment as surety for the principal, but no percentage of chance, however high, that the surety will not be called on to pay the debt he avows, can affect in the slightest degree the force of his legal obligation. Every one of a hundred or more sureties is equally a “debtor” of the person assured.</p>
    <p id="b41-5" data-blocks='[["BL_41.6",41,[175,1035,1158,1300]]]'>An indemnitor’s obligation is not immediate and absolute. It is born only on the happening of a contingency, that contingency being the default of the person whose favorable action the indemnitor guarantees. A surety’s obligation is a living thing subject to possible extinction : an indemnitor by his engagement has merely put himself in a position where he may in the future be shouldered with an obligation that can legally come into being only through another’s default. The obligation of Reilly and Brock to pay the Penn Co. came into being on the day they signed the bond, to wit, December 31, 1929. From that date onward and until the debt they with others obligated themselves to pay, was paid, whether by the Mortgage Guarantee Co. or by the Corporation Real Estate Co., they, i. e., Reilly and Brock, owed a debt and were under a liability to the Penn Co. within the meaning of those words as they appear in the phrase “all debts and liabilities now due or to become due by the said copartnership of Reilly, Brock &amp; Company” in. the assignment by Sidney F. T. Brock, individually, and as surviving and liquidating partner of the firm of Reilly, Brock &amp; Co. (assignor), made on October 24, 1930, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of June 4,1901, P. L. 404.</p>
