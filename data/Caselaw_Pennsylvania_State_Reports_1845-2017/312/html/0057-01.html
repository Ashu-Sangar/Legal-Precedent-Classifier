This negotiation, defendant insists, constitutes, under section 2 (a), “prima facie evidence that [plaintiff] was acting or attempting to act as a real estate broker within the meaning of this act.” The inquiry, then, is whether the record contains any averment by plaintiff that could be proved in rebuttal of the prima facie effect attributed by the statute to his conduct. What may be shown to rebut the presumption is fully stated in section 2 (c), supra. The statute does not require a license to sell real estate for another by one not a broker, as defined, if the sale is made by a “person holding in good faith a duly executed letter of attorney from the actual owner...... authorizing the sale......”; nor, in such case, will the absence of a license prevent the recovery of compensation, because such transaction is not within sections 6 and 16. But the right to make such unlicensed sales is limited by the legislature to persons who bring themselves within the class. As plaintiff obviously cannot bring himself within any of the excepted classes, he is bound by the effect attributed by the statute to his conduct.</p>

Numerous illustrations of the wrong to be corrected appear in reported decisions of both appellate courts, which, as the matter is familiar, need not be specifically referred to. The legislature concluded that the time had arrived when the subject must be dealt with. The Department of Public Instruction was therefore not only authorized to require information of the fitness of the applicant before issuing a license, but was vested with power, on its own motion, or on written complaint of the character described in section 10 (too long for quotation here) to refuse, suspend or revoke any license.

Plaintiff’s contention that the statute is penal and must therefore be strictly construed, overlooks the settled rule that “there is no impropriety in putting a literal construction on a penal clause and a liberal construction on a remedial clause” in the same statute: Com. v. Shaleen, <a href="/pa/215/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="215 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="948248" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0595-01">215 Pa. 595</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.%20797" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="64 A. 797">64 A. 797</a>. In considering its meaning, it is also important to note that the requirement of the license is in aid of the collection of the revenue payable by brokers pursuant to the Act of 1907, supra. It is settled that “statutes to prevent frauds upon the revenue are considered as enacted for the public good and to suppress a public wrong, and therefore, although they impose penalties or forfeitures, are not to be construed, like penal laws generally, strictly in favor of the defendant; but they are to be fairly and reasonably construed, so as to carry out the intention of the legislature”: United States v.

The more frequent such transactions were, the greater the loss of revenue. In addition, as a result of the application of the rule, then applied, that it was a question for the jury whether, under the facts of a particular case, a person was carrying on the business of a broker or not (Meyer v.

Unless a plaintiff can show himself entitled within one of the classes of authorized persons, he is within the sections prohibiting recovery of compensation. We understand section 2 (a), (b) and (c) to declare that every person engaged as defined (and as the plaintiff states that he was engaged) if even for a single transaction, unless he brings himself within the exceptions mentioned in 2 (c), must have a license; that sections 6 and 16 prevent recovery for services rendered by any person who cannot bring himself within 2 (c). By this construction of the statute, in harmony with the rules of interpretation quoted, all classes of persons are treated alike and the legislation is made effective within its terms.</p>
