Defendant denied the alleged waiver and averred want of presentment and notice. Plaintiff offered evidence to support its averment of waiver; in part, defendant’s evidence contradicted it, and, in part, supported it. Such evidence was necessarily for the jury (Sieger v.

    <p id="b417-8" data-blocks='[["BL_417.6",417,[179,1114,1156,1135]]]'>The first assignment of error is to the refusal to strike out about a page of the evidence of a witness, Yancey, relevant on the question of waiver. The evidence was received without objection; the answers were responsive to the questions asked; the reason given in support of the motion was that “it does not constitute waiver on the part of defendant or any evidence or notice of dishonor.” It was not offered as conclusive but to be considered with the other evidence in the case; it would have been error to grant defendant’s motion. The second, third and fourth assignments complain of instructions to the jury. The precise complaint is thus stated in the brief: “The fact that sufficient competent testimony was admitted on the trial to sustain the verdict does not render harmless the admission and submission of incompetent testimony......” As we think the evidence was relevant, these three assignments present no question requiring discussion. Taken with their context and considered in the light of the evidence and the issues on trial, we can find no error of which defendant can justly complain.</p>
