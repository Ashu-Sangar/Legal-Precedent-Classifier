Because we hold that Section 5304(c)(3) of the Retirement Code requires a SERS member to establish the existence of an employer/employee relationship with an agency or department of the United States government in order to purchase creditable nonstate service for retirement benefits, and because appellee has failed to demonstrate the existence of an employer/employee relationship with an agency or department of the United States government, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

This benefit formula places great importance on years of credited service because a member’s retirement benefit increases as he accumulates more years of credited service. The Retirement Code allows a member to purchase additional years of credited service for certain service known as “creditable nonstate service.” 71 Pa.C.S. § 5304. “Creditable nonstate service” is service performed by a member even though the member was not a “state employee”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> when that service was rendered. 71 <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>Pa.C.S. § 5102.

The Retirement Code allows a member to purchase credited service for purposes of his retirement benefit for service known as “creditable nonstate service,” which is service rendered while the member was not a state employee. The Retirement Code expressly limits what categories of creditable nonstate service a member can purchase. Appellee in this case sought to purchase creditable nonstate service for the time spent teaching in Egypt pursuant to a Fulbright Grant pursuant to Section 5304(c)(3) of the Retirement Code.

One provision of the Retirement Code which addresses the purchase of creditable non-state service is 71 Pa.C.S. § 5304(b). Section 5304(b) of the Retirement Code, which places limitation on eligibility for all expressed categories of approved creditable nonstate service, provides the following repeated references to a previous employer:</p>

Therefore, we conclude that Section 5304(c)(3), which must be read <em>in pan materia </em>with these two sections because they concern the purchase of creditable nonstate service, also requires the existence of an employer/employee relationship with an agency or department of the United States government.

Here, the Retirement Code defines “State service” as “service rendered as a State employee.” 71 Pa.C.S. § 5102. “School service” is defined as “service rendered as a public school employee and credited as service in the Public School Employes’ Retirement System.” <em><a href="/pa/546/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="684 A.2d 112" data-case-ids="466656,7346637" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0215-01,/a2d/684/0112-01">Id.</a> </em>A “service connected disability” is defined as “a disability resulting from an injury arising in the course of State employment.” <em><a href="/pa/546/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="684 A.2d 112" data-case-ids="466656,7346637" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0215-01,/a2d/684/0112-01">Id.</a> </em>Thus, these provisions of the Retirement Code evidence an intent on the part of the General Assembly to equate the term service with an employer/employee relationship.</p>

As described above, “state service” includes service rendered by the member while he is a “State employee.” The Retirement Code defines a “State employee” as a person employed by the State government, except for an independent contractor or a person compensated on a fee basis. <em>See </em>71 Pa.C.S. § 5102; Footnote 1, <em><a href="/pa/546/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="684 A.2d 112" data-case-ids="466656,7346637" data-case-paths="/pa/546/0215-01,/a2d/684/0112-01">supra.</a> </em>If the position advanced by appellee were adopted and no employer/employee relationship needed to exist in order to purchase creditable nonstate service under Section 5304(c)(3), this would allow a member to purchase service for time he spent as an independent contractor outside of the Commonwealth even though he could not do so if he were an independent contractor for the Commonwealth.

Moreover, this would lead to an absurd result since the limitations imposed by Section 5304(c) on the categories of creditable nonstate service that can be purchased by a member demonstrates that the main purpose of the Retirement Code is to provide a state employee with a retirement benefit for his state service rather than his years of service outside the state. See, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (in ascertaining intent of General Assembly, it is presumed that the General Assembly does not intend an absurd or unreasonable result). Accordingly, we conclude that a SERS member who desires to purchase creditable nonstate service pursuant to Section 5304(c)(3) for time he spent teaching at a university in a foreign country must demonstrate that he had an employer/employee relationship with an agency or department of the United States.</p>

This argument fails for two reasons. First, this Court has held that the inspection of the progress of the work does not necessarily require an inference of exclusive control over the manner or performance of the work, but rather only of an interest in the result. <em>Cox v. Caeti </em><a href="/pa/444/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="444 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1938621" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0143-01">444 Pa. 143</a>, 148, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%20756" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="279 A.2d 756">279 A.2d 756</a>, 758 (1971) (person engaged to install stone at a construction site was an independent contractor rather than an employee of construction company; evidence that construction company inspected person’s work did not require finding that construction company controlled that person’s work). Second, the evidence in this case demonstrates that no department or agency of the United States government exercised control over the manner in which appellee taught at Ain Shams University pursuant to his Fulbright Grant. Instead, the evidence found by the hearing examiner and the Board demonstrates that Ain Shams University, which has no affiliation with the United States government, determined the courses appellee taught, approved appellee’s syllabus, selected the textbooks used by appellee for teaching his courses and provided appellee with supplies and an office. Ain Shams University also determined the enrollment and registration of the students in appellee’s classes and dictated the method in which appellee was to test his students. Moreover, the evidence showed that Dr. Metwalli, the head of <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>the English Department at Ain Shams University, monitored and supervised appellee. Therefore, the control factor evidences that appellee was not an employee of a department or agency of the United States government’s because his day-today work was controlled by Ain Shams University.</p>
    <p id="b681-4" data-blocks='[["BL_681.4",681,[204,619,1154,964]]]'>Another factor to be examined under <em>Zimmerman </em>is the terms of the agreement between the parties. Here, the Terms and Conditions document provided to appellee when he was notified of receiving a Fulbright Grant explicitly stated that his acceptance of the grant did not transform him into an official or employee of the United States government. Appellee acknowledged this statement by signing the Terms and Condition document which stated that appellee’s signature evidences an understanding of the conditions imposed and an agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of a Fulbright Grant. Under Pennsylvania law, it is presumed that an adult is competent to enter into an agreement and that the signed document evidences an accurate expression of the intent of the signatories. <em>Estate of McGovern v.

    <p id="b681-5" data-blocks='[["BL_681.5",681,[205,1607,1152,475]]]'>Another factor <em>Zimmerman </em>requires this Court to review is which party supplied the tools. Here, no evidence demonstrates that the United States government supplied appellee with any tools to aid in his teaching at Ain Shams University.

The power to terminate the employment of another for cause is not by itself <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>sufficient to constitute an employer/employee relationship. <em>Cox, </em><a href="/pa/444/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="444 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1938621" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0143-01">444 Pa. at 148</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%20756" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="279 A.2d 756">279 A.2d at 758</a>. Also, the Terms and Conditions document specified that if appellee’s Fulbright Grant was terminated for any reasons other than physical and mental incapacitation, appellee had to repay his grant monies. In a traditional employer/employee relationship, a terminated employee does not normally have to repay income earned for services rendered to his employer. Thus, the termination factor in <em>Zimmerman </em>weighs against finding that appellee was an employee of an agency or department of the United States government.</p>
    <p id="b682-4" data-blocks='[["BL_682.4",682,[231,933,1162,892]]]'>Finally, this Court has often looked to how an alleged employer treats other employees in order to determine if a person is an employee of that employer. <em>See Zimmerman, <a href="/pa/513/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="513 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1802543" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0560-01">supra.</a> </em>Here, appellee was not treated like other federal employees. The evidence demonstrates that appellee was not assigned a “GS” salary rating, he did not accrue federal sick or vacation leave during his time spent teaching at Ain Shams University, and he was not eligible to participate in the federal pension system. Additionally, the evidence demonstrates that appellee was paid a monthly stipend rather than some form of salary like a typical federal employee. Moreover, appellee’s stipend was reported to him for tax purposes on an IRS Form 1099 instead of the traditional W-2 that is issued for the typical employee. Thus, the fact that appellee was not treated similar to other federal employees weighs against finding that appellee was an employee of an agency or department of the United States government.</p>
