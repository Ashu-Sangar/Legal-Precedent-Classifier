He was released on parole in December 1993. His aunt, Ms. Elizabeth Gease, permitted Appellant to live with her. Subsequently, Ms. Gease locked Appellant out of her home because she believed he had stolen from her. Around April 27, 1994, Ms. Gease’s body was found in her basement, bound and gagged. On April 28, 1994, Appellant confessed to the police that he killed his aunt.

Ms. Gease’s brother was contacted. On April 27,1994, Ms. Gease’s brother gained entry into Ms. Gease’s home and, after discovering its condition, he called the Yeadon police, who found Ms. Gease’s bound and gagged body in the basement. On April 27, 1994, Appellant was arrested in Philadelphia in an unrelated matter. While processing Appellant in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia police learned of the murder of Ms. Gease at the address where Appellant had been living. The Philadelphia police contacted the Yeadon police concerning Appellant. The Yeadon police went to Philadelphia and, <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>after advising Appellant of his rights, they questioned Appellant concerning the murder of his aunt. After some questioning, the Yeadon police requested Appellant’s permission to tape the questions and his responses thereto. Appellant agreed. During the course of the taped conversation, Appellant admitted to killing his aunt. At trial, the Commonwealth introduced the cassette tape and a corresponding transcript of that tape wherein the Appellant related the following.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[249,778,1163,1111]]]'>Appellant was previously incarcerated on unrelated charges and had been released on parole. Appellant’s aunt permitted him to stay with her following his release. During this stay with his aunt, Appellant had stolen money from her and she had found out about the theft. Fearful that she had informed his parole agent about Appellant’s stealing, Appellant confronted his aunt and accused her of informing someone about his stealing. During this confrontation, Appellant choked his aunt and then bound her hands and feet together with a telephone cord. He then dragged her downstairs into a bathroom located in the basement. Appellant then tied her hands and feet together with some rope and placed a portion of the rope around his aunt’s neck so that she could not fully extend her body. Appellant then closed the door to the bathroom and turned on the dryer so that no one could hear his aunt’s screams. Appellant then went upstairs to collect some items to sell. He returned to the basement to check on his aunt. He found that she had freed her hands from the rope. Appellant then tied her hands better and tied a nightgown around his aunt’s mouth and placed blankets over her. Appellant eventually left the house around 6:30 p.m.</p>

He spoke to his aunt. Appellant then turned on the dryer to drown out her screams. He returned upstairs to collect some more of his aunt’s belongings to sell. Appellant left the home and did not return until the following day. Upon his return, he went downstairs. Appellant stated that he could smell urine and feces emanating from his aunt. He saw that she was moving under the blankets. Appellant <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>then turned the dryer on again and left the residence. He returned the following day to pick up his check from the mailbox but did not enter the residence. Later that same day, Appellant returned to the home and removed his aunt’s television, with the help of a confederate, so as to sell it. Appellant then left the home and did not return again.

The visual aid was a posterboard which measured approximately 28 inches by 44 inches, upon which the prosecutor had affixed five black and white photographs. The five black and white photographs had all been admitted into evidence during the course of the trial. Each of the black and white photographs affixed to the posterboard measured approximately 8 inches by 10 inches. <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>The five black and white photographs depicted: 1) Ms. Gease lying face down with her hands bound behind her back and with her head covered with a rag; 2) the right side of Ms. Gease with her hands and feet bound together, lying next to the side of a toilet, her upper torso covered with rags; 3) a man holding a piece of cloth which was used as a gag that was placed in the mouth of Ms. Gease; 4) a close-up shot of the way in which the hands of Ms. Gease were bound; and 5) the face of Ms. Gease, which shows some deformity in the lower left lip area.

The prosecutor placed this posterboard in the courtroom in the same vicinity where he had, on previous days during the trial, placed other Commonwealth exhibits, which included diagrams of streets and a house. When defense counsel saw the back of the posterboard (to which the photographs were affixed) from the vantage point of the defense table, defense counsel stated that he thought the posterboard was one of the Commonwealth’s diagrams. Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 3/15/95 at p. 93. The posterboard with the photographs was visible to the jury given the location where the prosecutor had placed it. The posterboard was viewable by the jury for approximately one hour before the defense counsel became aware of its true nature, whereupon the jury was excused from the courtroom, and a side bar conference was conducted. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which was denied. N.T., 3/15/95 at pp. 85-87. The judge did order that the posterboard be removed from the view of the jury.</p>

Appellant alleges that he was denied a fair trial due to the prosecutor’s actions in placing the posterboard with the photographs within the view of the jury while the defense was putting on the testimony of one of its witnesses. The Appel<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>lant argues that such actions amounted to the prosecutor putting on evidence at the same time as the defense was attempting to put on evidence, and that this distracted the jury from the defense witness’ testimony. The Appellant characterizes the prosecutor’s actions as prosecutorial misconduct. Indeed, the Appellant alleges that the prosecutorial misconduct was so severe that its inescapable effect was to contaminate the entire decision making process and thus merits the reversal, not only of the first degree murder conviction, but also of the convictions of robbery and kidnapping as well.</p>

Appellant’s Brief to this Court at p. 13. Just after utilizing these two photographs, and a little while before the Commonwealth moved for the admission of the photograph depicting Ms. Gease’s face, the trial court gave the following cautionary instruction to the jury:</p>
    <blockquote id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[245,1201,1110,257]]]'>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the photographs are being offered for informational purposes only to illustrate a matter being submitted to you as evidence.

The first aggravating factor found was that Appellant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person. During the penalty phase of the trial, the Commonwealth incorporated all the evidence from the guilt phase into the record of the penalty phase. N.T., 3/20/95 at p. 74. During the guilt phase of the trial, upon rebuttal, the Commonwealth introduced the record of Appellant’s conviction for an unrelated robbery which was a felony conviction involving the use or threat of violence to the person. N.T., 3/15/95 at pp. 155-158. In addition to incorporating the evidence of the guilt phase into the penalty phase, the Commonwealth introduced, during the penalty phase, the record of Appellant’s previous unrelated conviction for the charge of riot, a felony conviction involving the use or threat of violence to the person. N.T., 3/20/95 at pp. 74-75. Given these convictions for riot and robbery which are a matter of record in the penalty phase, we find that there is sufficient evidence of record supporting the aggravating circumstance of a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[205,1577,1151,799]]]'>The second aggravating factor which the jury found was that the Appellant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, namely robbery. Appellant was convicted of robbery in the instant case because the jury found that he stole items from his aunt, Ms. Gease after he bound and gagged her and abandoned her in the basement. The record from the guilt phase which was incorporated into the penalty phase supports the fact that Appellant stole from Ms. Gease. Appellant took the stand in his own defense and admitted that while Ms. Gease was bound and gagged in the basement, he sold his aunt’s television, stereo, microwave and her jewelry. N.T., 3/14/95 at p. 155. Accordingly, we find sufficient evidence to support the aggravating factor that Appellant killed his aunt during the commission of a felony, namely, robbery.</p>
