The ladder was manufactured by Appellee John S. Tilley Ladder Company (“Tilley”) and was designed to accommodate ordinary household use restricted to a 200 pound weight bearing load.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Francis Spino testified that he purchased the ladder for a painting project and later used the ladder for household projects. Louise Spino testified that she used the ladder two or three times a year to wash windows or hang curtains.</p>

At trial, Mrs. Spino testified that while she reached her arm up in an attempt to clean the kitchen <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>ceiling, she heard a cracking sound, the ladder shook, and the next thing she remembers she was on the floor. Mrs. Spino was then taken to the emergency room and underwent hospitalization and surgery to repair a fractured tibia and fibula.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As a result, the Spinos instituted a product liability action against Appellees for Louise Spino’s injuries and Francis Spino’s loss of consortium. It was their assertion that the ladder leg cracked since it lacked an anti-split device. The Spinos initially asserted two theories of liability, common law negligence and strict liability pursuant to § 402A, Restatement (Second) of Torts. At the outset of trial, Appellants dismissed M.A. Buten and Son, Inc. from the case and abandoned any negligence claims, proceeding against Tilley on strict liability.</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[253,1105,1162,846]]]'>Prior to trial, the Spinos filed a Motion in Limine seeking preclusion of the admission of evidence provided by Tilley’s President, Robert Howland. Mr. Howland was expected to testify that there had been no similar accidents or claims with respect to this particular product in his thirty years of employment with the company and neither he, nor anyone at the company, had ever been informed of a failure similar to the one alleged by the Spinos. The Spinos maintained that allowing such evidence impermissibly injected negligence principles into a § 402A strict liability products liability action, and therefore, it is <em>per se </em>inadmissible. In response, Tilley maintained that the evidence was relevant to prove that the ladder had not failed as alleged and was not intended to prove that Tilley had been free of negligence in continuing to manufacture and market the type 3 ladder without providing an anti-split device.</p>

Moreover, the trial court noted that “a <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>sufficient proffer was made during the course of trial, in camera, to satisfy the Court of the reliability of Mr. Howland’s testimony.” (Trial Court Opinion dated 12/5/94, p. 13).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> After an in camera review, the trial judge found that Tilley maintained a chronological log of reported claims covering Tilley’s ladder products, including the type 3 ladder. The court was satisfied that the log was an authentic business record and was “comprehensive in its recording of all reports and claims of problems which the Company had received from any source.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The Spinos’ expert maintained that a split in the ladder leg occurring at the time of the accident caused the injuries, and further, the ladder’s design was defective in its failure to include an anti-split device of the type found on Tilley’s commercial and construction ladders. Furthermore, their expert testified that the lack of the anti-split device in the design of Tilley’s type 3 household ladder rendered the ladder unsafe for its intended use. In contrast, Tilley’s expert witness testified that the type 3 household ladder was not defectively designed, and based upon his examination of the same ladder, the crack in the ladder leg had occurred at some time prior to the accident.</p>

Following the verdict, the Spinos filed a Motion for Post-Trial Relief which the trial court denied. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, finding that Howland’s “no prior claims” evidence was relevant as to the issue of causation and the trial judge properly admitted such testimony. <em>Spino v.

In opposition, Tilley argues the lack of prior claims evidence should not be <em>per se </em>inadmissible as it is relevant to rebut evidence of causation. Tilley maintains that Mr. Howland’s testimony was offered solely to rebut the Spinos evidence as to causation and was admissible for that purpose.</p>

We believe that the same reasoning should be applied in Pennsylvania, and, therefore, we hold that evidence of the non-existence of prior claims is admissible subject to the trial court’s determination that the offering party has provided a sufficient foundation—that they would have known about the prior, substantially similar accidents involving the product at issue. Clearly, the determination of admissibility turns upon the facts and circumstances of the particular action.
