After approaching the vehicle and making the initial inquiries, Hutchinson learned that there were outstanding arrest warrants for the driver and the front-seat passenger. Hutchinson arrested these men and placed them in his police cruiser. He then returned to the stopped vehicle and spoke with Appellant. After checking the information Appellant had given him, Hutchinson learned that there was also an outstanding warrant for Appellant’s arrest.

This, quite simply, is <em>not </em>the stan<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>dard under which such evidence is to be evaluated. <em>See Riddle Memorial Hosp. v. Dohan, </em><a href="/pa/504/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="504 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1787686" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0571-01">504 Pa. 571</a>, 578, <a href="/pa/504/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="504 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1787686" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0571-01">475 A.2d 1314</a>, 1317 (1984) (held that an .appellate court should not superimpose its beliefs for that of the finder of fact so long as sufficient evidence was presented to establish that reasonable people may differ as to the verdict).</p>
    <p id="b849-4" data-blocks='[["BL_849.4",849,[189,681,1154,730]]]'>Specifically, the majority states that even though evidence was introduced that the $3,400.00 was bundled in a way drug dealers arrange their money, such an arrangement is equally consistent with an “innocent person’s attempt to simplify and promote precision in the counting of lawfully obtained funds.” Notwithstanding that the latter assertion is <em>dehors </em>the record and constitutes mere speculation on the part of the majority which I would disagree with (also <em>dehors </em>the record) the majority is ignoring the standard of review that the evidence must be viewed in the light <em>most favorable to the Commonwealth </em>and that even if there are two reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the same evidence, we are bound to adopt the inference most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner.</p>
    <p id="b849-5" data-blocks='[["BL_849.5",849,[189,1443,1157,955]],["BL_850.1",850,[256,344,1162,346]]]'>Again, the majority ignores the proper standard of review where a drug-sniffing dog alerted to the presence of drugs on the $3,400.00. Instead of viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the majority retreats again <em>dehors </em>the record and opines that “a completely innocent citizen of this Commonwealth could have in his or her possession, at any time, currency that happened to be involved in a drug transaction at some unknown time in the past.” Nowhere in the record does this assertion appear and nowhere is there introduced <em>any </em>evidence to support this assertion. In fact, Trooper Markley testified that from his trained dog’s reaction to the sniff search, there was a “strong odor” on the currency as opposed to a “little bit on one dollar or so.” (N.T. 55a) He also testified that “eventually if money has the odor of drugs on it it will lose the odor” and that if the currency “is left out in the air the odor permeates and dissipates.” (N.T. 57a) Therefore, not only is the majority not viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, but <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>also the majority is drawing inferences not arising from the record and exactly opposite testimony of record. In short, the majority ignores the proper standard of review, fails to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner and is substituting its evaluation of the facts for that of the trial court which is supported by substantial evidence of record.</p>
    <p id="b850-5" data-blocks='[["BL_850.4",850,[252,721,1161,768]]]'>The record contains sufficient evidence to support the finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that there was a nexus between the money and illegal drug activity. Since the Commonwealth established its <em>prima facie </em>case, appellant then had the burden to prove that the money was lawfully acquired and not unlawfully used or possessed. The trial court clearly, by its verdict, found that appellant’s self-serving uncorroborated testimony that such money was advanced to him by some uncalled person to buy food for an unestablished catering business, was simply not credible. Appellant was therefore unable to establish that he lawfully acquired the money and that it was not unlawfully used in the drug trade. Accordingly, I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court and allow forfeiture of appellant’s money to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
