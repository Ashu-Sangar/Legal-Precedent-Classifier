The order directed that appellant or an adult member of her household be personally served with both the scheduling order and a copy of the Petition to Set Aside on or before 5:00 p.m. on March 25, 1997. Because of difficulties in personally serving appellant, appellee sought court approval to effectuate alternative service on appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Commonwealth Court approved the request for allowing alternative service and permitted service to be effectuated by either posting the required papers at appellant’s residence or serving the person in charge of appellant’s place of business.

The Commonwealth Court also found that three pages of the Monroe County nomination petition were defective since the affidavit of the circulator for those three pages was completed by someone who was not a registered Democratic voter in Monroe County. Thus, because Section 912.1(8) of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 2872.1(8), requires a candidate for Justice of Supreme Court to have one thousand signatures on their nomination petition with at least one hundred signature from each of at least five counties, and the Monroe County nomination petition was one of only five county petitions submitted with one hundred signatures, the Commonwealth Court granted the Petition to Set Aside and directed the Secretary of the Commonwealth not to certify appellant’s name for the primary ballot.</p>

Also, Section 908 of the Election Code mandates that all persons signing nomination petitions be registered voters of the county therein and list their occupation, residence and date of signing the petition. <em>See also, In re Silcox, </em><a href="/pa/543/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="543 Pa. 647" data-case-ids="461507" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0647-01">543 Pa. 647</a>, 649, <a href="/pa/543/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="674 A.2d 224" data-case-ids="461507,7859316" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0647-01,/a2d/674/0224-01">674 A.2d 224</a>, 225 (1996) (Section 908 of the Election Code requires the elector who signs the nomination petition to <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>also personally add in his own writing his occupation, residence and date of signing).</p>

By doing so, appellant failed to have 100 signatures on her nomination petition from Monroe County. Appellant presents no evidence which suggests that the Commonwealth Court’s finding was not supported by the evidence. Thus, since Monroe County was one of the five counties wherein appellant needed to have over one hundred signatures to support her nomination for Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and since appellant had less than 100 qualified signatures on her Monroe County nomination petition, the Commonwealth Court correctly set aside appellant’s nomination petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Accordingly, appellant’s second issue is without merit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Also, as long as an objection has been made to signatures on the nomination petition, the challenging party can make other challenges to those signatures based on the Election Code during the hearing on the petition to set aside. <em>In re Nomination Petition of Cooper, </em><a href="/pa-commw/163/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="163 Pa.

Our review of the record demonstrates that nineteen out of the twenty signatures stricken by the Commonwealth Court were stricken for at least one of the reasons specifically challenged by appellee in her Petition to Set Aside. Thus, this argument fails.</p>
      <p id="b691-7" data-blocks='[["BL_691.6",691,[235,1962,1120,312]]]'>Appellant also argues that the Commonwealth Court should have allowed her to amend her nomination petition in order to cure any defects found. However, the Commonwealth Court found that fourteen of the signatures on the nomination petition were not of registered Democratic voters in Monroe County. Since this defect alone put appellant below the one hundred signature requirement of Section 912.1(8) of the Election Code and this is a defect which cannot be cured by amendment, appellant’s argument must fail.</p>

Appellant alternatively argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in setting aside appellant’s nomination petition because one of the <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>grounds alleged for setting aside the nomination petition (that the signature of the affidavit of the circulator of three pages of the Monroe County nomination petition did not match the signature on the Monroe County voter registration card) was defective since no actual registration card existed for that circulator. Since the grounds listed above were sufficient to independently support the Commonwealth Court's decision to set aside appellant’s nomination petition, this Court need not reach the merits of this issue.</p>

Because election matters are time sensitive, both parties were ordered to file their written briefs for this appeal on April 16, 1997. On the day this Court issued its order denying appellant's appeal, it was presented with an appellee's Application for Post-Submission Communications and appellant’s response thereto. In appellee’s Application, appellee seeks counsel fees and damages as allowed under Rule 2744 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure because it believes that appellant's appeal was frivolous and taken solely for the purpose of delay. While appellant’s appeal may not always have been the model of clarity and firmly grounded in the law, we find that appellant neither undertook this appeal solely for delay nor that her appeal was frivolous. Thus, we deny appellee’s Application for Post-Submission Communications.</p>
