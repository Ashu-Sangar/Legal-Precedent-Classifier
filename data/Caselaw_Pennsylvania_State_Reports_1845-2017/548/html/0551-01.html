      <blockquote id="b900-9" data-blocks='[["BL_900.9",900,[326,1810,1096,548]]]'>A buccal swab is a cotton or Dacron covered wooden stick [resembling a Q-tip] which is placed between the teeth and the inner cheek lining. The swab is then gently wiped against the surface of the cheek which loosens cells known as buccal epithelial cells. Those cells contain intact DNA which can be tested. The parties being tested each have four swabs collected which are then used to conduct six or seven tests. Each individual test is a genetic marker "system” and each "system" has a certain number of genetic markers contained in it. The DNA samples from both the alleged father and the child are mixed and used as the control standard. The genetic markers, or bands, of the alleged father, mother, child and the mix are then compared. If after testing all of the systems, two of the systems do not pick up the alleged father's bands in the child’s bands, then the man is considered excluded from paternity.</blockquote>

Washington County was the first Pennsylvania County to adopt the buccal swab method of obtaining DNA samples for paternity testing and we are unaware of any other county in Pennsylvania that exclusively employs the same method. Dr. Harris testified that buccal swabs have been used experimentally since 1982, however, it was not until 1993 that Roche secured its first major project using buccal swabs for DNA paternity testing. That contract was with the state of Arkansas. R.R. at 121a. Although this is a relatively new method of obtaining tissue samples, there is no evidence in this record tending to prove that it is more susceptible to tainting or faulty results than blood testing.</p>
