Richard, a public accountant, owned and operated his own accounting firm in Butler, Pennsylvania. Naomi was employed as an administrative assistant in the real estate and trust department of a small Virginia bank. In anticipation of the marriage, Naomi resigned from her employment, sold her home in Virginia and moved to Butler. On January 4, 1991, the day preceding their marriage, Richard and Naomi executed a written “pre-nuptial” agreement which had been drafted by Richard’s attorney. Richard and Naomi had discussed the substance of the agreement numerous times and Naomi reviewed the document with independent counsel prior to its execution.</p>

Despite Husband's repeated assertion that the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement clearly and unambiguously preclude Wife from receiving APL, his reading of the agreement is inconsistent. After arguing that Wife has waived any right to money, "which clearly must be alimony pendente lite,” he states that the terms "money” and "property” refer to Husband's assets while the terms "alimony” and "support" apply to periodic payments in any form.</p>

Husband also argues in his appellate brief that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding APL because there were no issues in dispute other than the APL claim itself, and therefore Wife did not need financial resources to litigate the case. However, this claim was not raised on direct appeal to the Superior Court or in the Petition for Allowance of Appeal to this Court and is therefore waived. Pa.R.A.P. 302.</p>
