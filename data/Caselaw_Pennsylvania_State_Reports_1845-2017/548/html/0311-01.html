    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[256,659,1163,777]]]'>The factual and procedural background of this appeal is as follows. Appellee Caroline Jones entered into an installment land sale contract with the Administrator of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) on June 28, 1984, for the sale of property owned by the VA in Chester, Pennsylvania, to her. The VA retained legal title to the property, with the promise to transfer the deed to Appellee upon her final installment payment. Appellee took immediate possession of the property and received equitable title. Appellant, a business trust organized pursuant to the laws of New York, took legal title to the property on February 23, 1989, by means of a recorded deed conveyance of the VA to Appellant of all of its interests and ownership rights. Thenceforth, Appellee made her installment contract payments to Appellant until she allegedly defaulted on her payments under the installment contract on November 1, 1991.</p>

Appellee filed preliminary objections to this complaint raising Appellant’s lack of capacity to sue, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(5), and sought dismissal of Appellee’s complaint on this basis. Specifically, Appellee asserted that Appellant is prohibited from bringing <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>an action in Pennsylvania by way of a penalty imposed by section 4141 because of Appellant’s failure to obtain a certificate of authority to conduct business in Pennsylvania pursuant to 15 Pa.C.S. § 4121(a).</p>

Appellant’s answer to Appellee’s preliminary objections simply averred that Appellant “falls” within the statutory exclusions to the requirement for a foreign business corporation to obtain a certificate of authority set forth at section 4122(a)(7) and (8) of the Law, 15 Pa.C.S. § 4122(a)(7) and (a)(8).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant’s answer to Appellee’s preliminary objections did not set forth with any detail the nature and extent of Appellant’s activities in Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In conducting our appellate review, we observe that preliminary objections, the end result of which would be dismissal of the action, may be properly sustained by the trial court only if the case is free and clear of doubt. <em>Greenberg v.

The trial court looked only to the legal issue of whether Appellant’s seeking to enforce the land sale installment contract it acquired from the VA was qualitatively the type of activity described in section 4122(a)(7) and (a)(8), and thus would qualify Appellant for an exclusion from the requirement to obtain a certificate of authority.

It is well-established that the test for whether a corporation is “doing business” in this Commonwealth is a question of fact, to be resolved on a case-by-case basis. <em>Wenzel v.

The Committee Comment further indicates that a single agreement or isolated transaction does not constitute the doing of business <em>if </em>there is no intention to repeat the transaction or engage in similar transactions.</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[258,637,1162,1304]]]'>Before concluding that Appellant’s acquiring an installment contract for the sale of land, and Appellant’s efforts to secure possession of the land when Appellee allegedly defaulted on her obligations under the contract, were not activities within the purview of section 4122(a)(7) or (a)(8), the trial court failed to offer findings as to whether Appellant’s reason for holding legal title to the real estate was strictly for investment or fiduciary purposes. Additionally, the trial court made no factual determination as to whether Appellant has regular, repeated, and continuing business contacts of a local nature; nor did the trial court make any finding on the question of whether Appellant intends to repeat the transaction or engages in similar transactions in this Commonwealth. The facts developed at the preliminary stage of the proceedings did not allow the trial court to make a determination on these factual details which are critical in determining whether Appellant is required to obtain a certificate of authority in this Commonwealth, especially if we should disagree with the trial court’s conclusion that the land sale installment contract at issue did not fall within the purview of the exclusions set forth at section 4122. Thus, there are no facts on the record to enable us to rule on the propriety of the lower court’s conclusion on whether Appellant lacks the capacity to sue in Pennsylvania.</p>

We have previously indicated that the practice of alleging in a brief facts on which a trial court has not passed is improper. <em>See Reilly by Reilly v. Southeastern Transportation Authority, </em><a href="/pa/507/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="507 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1792334" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0204-01">507 Pa. 204</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="507 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1792334" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0204-01">489 A.2d 1291</a> (1985). It is well-established that counsel must have <em>on record </em>all matters necessary to constitute proper assignment of error. <em>See Spitzer v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., </em><a href="/pa/348/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="348 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1220329" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0548-01">348 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20503" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="36 A.2d 503">36 A.2d 503</a> (1944). An appellate court may not rely on statements in Appellant's brief in order to establish the factual groundwork crucial to disposition of the pivotal legal issue of whether Appellant’s activities in Pennsylvania fall within the purview of the exclusions set forth in section 4122(a)(7) and (a)(8). <em>See Van Mastrigt v. Delta Tau Delta, </em><a href="/pa-super/393/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="393 Pa.
