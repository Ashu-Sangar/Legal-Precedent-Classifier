Appellant filed post-verdict motions, which the trial court denied on August 31, 1993. Sentencing was scheduled for October 1, 1993, but was continued because appellant, who had a history of mental illness, was found to be incompetent. On January 13, 1995, after appellant regained his competency, the trial court sentenced him to a mandatory sentence of five to ten years imprisonment. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9718 (relating to rape of a person under sixteen years of age).</p>

While there, appellant provided marijuana and alcohol to J.R., Beck, and another young man who was friendly with appellant, Duane Weiser. Appellant particularly encouraged J.R. to consume marijuana, at times refusing to allow her to “pass the joint” to others. Eventually, J.R. became so intoxicated as to be unable to move or speak. Indeed, eyewitness Beck described her as incoherent, “not paying any attention to anything that was going on around her,” and like “a vegetable.” It was at that point that appellant, while on the floor of his second floor bedroom, began fondling J.R.’s breasts and vagina. Beck observed this activity and informed appellant that J.R. was only fifteen years old, to which appellant replied that he has a daughter that age and that J.R. reminded him of his daughter. Appellant then ripped down J.R.’s pants and pro<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>ceeded to engage in sexual intercourse with her. J.R. testified that throughout the assault, she attempted to tell appellant to stop and believed that she, using her loudest possible voice, did indeed do so. However, the only sound audible from J.R. to the listeners was unintelligible mumbling. Beck questioned J.R. during the assault in an attempt to determine whether she was “okay,” but J.R. was wholly unable to respond. The young victim testified that she was unaware of the duration of the assault and for what reason the assault ceased. According to her testimony, appellant just stopped. In fact, appellant ceased the assault when Beck, who had repeatedly told appellant to stop and had stated that he was going to awaken appellant’s mother (who was asleep in another bedroom), finally threatened to call police and prepared to leave the premises to do so. J.R. could not recall putting on her pants, but she eventually dressed to leave the residence. Unable to walk, she slid down the stairs and, after sitting for a while in appellant’s living room, left the premises with Beck.</p>

She also spoke to appellant on the telephone, and he told J.R. that she had gotten what she deserved.

Rather, his argument is that he should be discharged because the victim had some sense of awareness of what was occurring during the assault, as evidenced by her recollection that appellant had touched her and had penetrated her vagina with his penis, and thus that the victim was not “unconscious” within the meaning of the statute. In determining the meaning of “unconscious” as used in the statute, we must construe that term according to common and approved usage. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1902(a). Moreover, our construction of the statute must be consistent with the legislative intent leading to its enactment. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921. In considering the legislative intent, we are mindful that the “essence of the criminal act of rape is involuntary submission to sexual intercourse.” <em>Commonwealth v. Karkaria, </em><a href="/pa/533/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="533 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1837455" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0412-01">533 Pa. 412</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="533 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1837455" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0412-01">625 A.2d 1167</a> (1993). Given these considerations, we decline to accept appellant’s implication that § 3121(3) protects only those individuals who were completely unaware of the event throughout the duration of the sexual assault upon them. Webster’s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition, defines “unconscious” as “not endowed with consciousness.” “Consciousness”, in turn, is defined as “the state of being conscious; awareness of one’s own feelings, what is happening around one, etc.” <em><a href="/pa/533/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="533 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1837455" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0412-01">Id.</a> </em>The term “conscious” includes “having a feeling or knowledge (of one’s own sensations, feelings, etc. or of external things); <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>knowing or feeling (that something is or was happening or existing); aware; cognizant ... [;] able to feel and think; in the normal waking state.... ” <em><a href="/pa/533/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="533 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1837455" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0412-01">Id.</a> See also </em>Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary, 9th ed. (defining “unconscious” as “not knowing or not perceiving: unaware”). Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, J.R., at times during the assault, was unconscious. When the assault began, she displayed no awareness of external events. As the crime progressed, she believed that she was shouting for appellant to stop, but was completely unable to perceive how she was <em>communicating—i.e., </em>that she was merely mumbling. She offered no response when Beck questioned her during the assault. Additionally, although Beck made several statements in J.R.’s presence which were audible to appellant in an effort to convince appellant to stop the assault, J.R., who had no knowledge of what ultimately brought an end to appellant’s actions, was unaware of those statements. Her complete lack of awareness of the duration of the assault further indicates that she was not conscious throughout its entirety. Thus, despite her ability to perceive some aspects of the incident, her lack of knowledge of much of what occurred supports the finding that she was unconscious during portions of the assault and was, therefore, unable to consent to sexual intercourse. Because there was ample evidence from which the jury could properly find that the victim, during at least portions of the assault, lacked knowledge or awareness of both her own sensations and external events, and was not in the normal waking state, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that she was unconscious within the meaning of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b819-5" data-blocks='[["BL_819.4",819,[193,1973,1154,257]],["BL_820.1",820,[259,331,1162,634]]]'>Because the evidence supports the findings that the victim was intermittently unconscious throughout the assault<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and was at all relevant times in such impaired physical and mental condition so as to be unable to knowingly consent, her submission to intercourse was involuntary. That intercourse, <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>therefore, is sufficient to constitute rape of an unconscious individual. This conclusion is consistent with the obvious legislative intent behind the statute: to punish sexual intercourse performed upon an individual physically or mentally incapable of consent. To conclude otherwise would mean that 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(3) does not proscribe intercourse with a person physically and mentally incapable of consent merely because that person, at certain times during the assault but not at others, was able to perceive to some degree what was occurring. Such a result is neither warranted by the plain language of the statute, nor consistent with legislative intent to protect a victim from sexual assault in such situations.</p>
