Allen (“the patient”) was admitted for in-patient treatment at Norristown State Hospital for treatment of mental retardation and psychosis after she suffered an adverse reaction to her medication that made it difficult for her <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>parents to control her behavior. On November 30, 1982, the patient was transferred to Montgomery Hospital for treatment of certain physical ailments pursuant to a contractual agreement through which Montgomery Hospital would provide medical treatment for mental patients from Norristown State Hospital. Dr. Paul Casey, Jr., was the patient’s attending physician at Montgomery Hospital. The initial diagnosis was that the patient was suffering from dehydration and a fever. The patient was admitted to a private room on the orthopedic floor of Montgomery Hospital.</p>

However, on December 5, 1982 at 2:00 a.m., a nurse at Montgomery Hospital discovered the patient hanging about six (6) inches above the floor between the side-rails and her bed with the posey restraint around her neck. The patient had managed to free one arm from the restraint and had apparently attempted to get out of the bed. The nurse called for aid in freeing the patient from the restraint and administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. The patient survived but tragically suffered permanent brain damage due to lack of oxygen.</p>

Moreover, as is evident from the General Assembly’s definition of “adequate treatment” and “treatment” in the MHPA, the General Assembly did not intend to limit treatment to that only directly related to a patient’s mental illness. Instead, treatment is given a broader meaning in the MHPA to include medical care coincident to mental health care. Medical care is commonly understood to include the prevention or alleviation of both physical and mental illness. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a) (courts must construe statutory terms not defined in statute in accordance with their common usage). Also, treatment under the MHPA broadly includes “care and other services that supplement treatment” in order to promote the recovery of the patient from mental illness. Therefore, applying the rules of statutory construction to the immunity provision of Section 114 of the MHPA, we conclude that the General Assembly decided to ameliorate certain risks by granting limited immunity to doctors and hospitals who have undertaken the treatment of the mentally ill, including treatment for physical ailments pursuant to a contract with a mental health facility to provide such treatment.</p>

Even if doctors or hospitals still provided treatment for physical ailments in such a situation, it could lead such providers of medical care to minimize their risks by placing the mentally ill patients in a more restrictive environment than is necessary or adopting other precautionary measures which would increase the costs of the medical care provided to the mentally ill.

The mentally ill require more specialized or intensive care than the non-mentally ill. In order to protect the mentally ill and provide them with adequate treatment in the least restrictive manner, ■ the General Assembly enacted the MHPA. Absent willful misconduct or gross negligence, the General Assembly provided immunity to health care providers of the mentally ill in order to ensure that this important government interest is met. Thus, the limited restriction on the right to sue in the MHPA bears a reasonable relation to a substantial government interest.</p>
