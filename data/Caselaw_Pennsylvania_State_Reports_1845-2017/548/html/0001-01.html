The widely divergent procedures for dismissal between that of Section 205(e) for a state trooper who has successfully served the probation period and that of Section 205(f) for a probationary state trooper shows that a probationary state trooper does not have the same substantial interest in continued employment as does a state trooper not on probation. Since we must interpret statutes in a manner which gives effect to all provisions, we must also conclude that these differing provisions show an intent on the part of the General Assembly not to bestow an expectation of continued employment upon a probationary state trooper.</p>

The Commonwealth Court also granted a motion by the Pennsylvania State Police to postpone filing the entire reproduced record in this case, including the transcripts and exhibits produced at the hearings before the Probationary Trooper Review Committee, since the question of whether the Commonwealth Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal is one of law. Since that is the only issue before this Court, the full record has not been forwarded to this Court.</p>

Section 761 provides the Commonwealth Court with original jurisdiction over actions against the Commonwealth except for applications for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>eminent domain proceedings, actions to which claims of immunity have been waived by the Commonwealth, and actions or proceedings conducted pursuant to the Board of Claims Act, 72 P.S. § 4651-1 <em>et seq. </em>It is clear from appellant's brief that his ar gument concerns an appeal of an agency determination pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 763. Accordingly, we need not reach whether the Commonwealth Court has original jurisdiction over this matter.</p>

A personal right or a privilege which will constitute an adjudication pursuant to Section 101 of the Administrative Law and Procedure Act will arise if the party claiming a privilege can establish either some right or privilege created by statute and characterized as such or some <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>constitutionally protected right or privilege. <em>Hecknauer v.Coder, </em><a href="/pa-commw/32/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="32 Pa.
