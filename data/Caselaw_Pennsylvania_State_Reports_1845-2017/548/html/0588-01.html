The sole issue in this appeal concerns the authority under which the attorney who prosecuted the case acted.</p>
    <p id="b935-9" data-blocks='[["BL_935.9",935,[182,1380,1156,852]]]'>At all relevant times, Shawn Wagner, the attorney representing the Commonwealth in this case, was employed as a deputy attorney general in the Harrisburg regional office of the Attorney General’s Drug Strike Force, Legal Services Section. He had previously been employed as an assistant district attorney in Cumberland County. District Attorney J. Michael Eakin testified that when none of his assistant district attorneys was available to attend the preliminary hearing in this case, rather than seek postponement of the hearing he asked Wagner to take over the prosecution of the case. To this end, he submitted a Personnel Action Form to the Cumberland County Personnel Office appointing Wagner as a “Special Assistant District Attorney (Unpaid)” for this case, and filed on the Miscellaneous Docket of the common pleas court a document captioned “Appointment of Assistant District Attorney.”</p>

In <em>Khorey, </em>said the court, the Commonwealth Attorneys Act was invoked and violated, because none of the conditions for a District Attorney to relinquish his authority was apparent on the record. In this case, the court held, the Act was neither invoked nor violated because Wagner did not prosecute the matter as an Attorney General.</p>

    <p id="b937-8" data-blocks='[["BL_937.7",937,[190,1671,1152,315]]]'>The flaw in this analysis is the expansive interpretation of the district attorney’s authority to appoint assistants under Section 1420 of the County Code, Act of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, § 1420, 16 P.S. § 1420.

Finally, Section 1424 authorizes <em>the court </em>to appoint a “district attorney for the time being” when the district attorney and his assistants are absent. Such an appointment is effective “until the regular district attorney or one of his assistants shall appear in person” to perform their duties.</p>

First, they clearly indicate that appointments under Section 1420 are “regular” positions, not transient assignments or appointments for a particular case. Section 1420, then, does not provide authority for the appointment of Wagner in this case.</p>
    <p id="b938-7" data-blocks='[["BL_938.6",938,[250,1294,1161,519]]]'>Second, they demonstrate that the legislature was cognizant of and provided for particular circumstances where a district attorney might need such temporary additional help. In Section 1422, those circumstances are limited to homicide and murder prosecutions.

Section 1423 is applicable only where there is no regularly appointed assistant and the district attorney is unavailable due to sickness or other cause.</p>

All parties agree that the Attorney General did not have authority under the Act to prosecute this case. The Attorney General’s authority to prosecute this case, however, is irrelevant because the District Attorney of Cumberland County, not the Attorney General, prosecuted the case. The Superior Court aptly noted this important distinction as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b940-5" data-blocks='[["BL_940.4",940,[295,966,1120,644]]]'>The record establishes the Cumberland County District Attorney appointed Deputy Attorney General Shawn C.

Rather than examining the language of Section 1420, the Majority has decided to concentrate its analysis on Sections 1421, 1422 and 1423 because Section 1420 “cannot be read in isolation from the other provisions with which it appears in part (b) of Article XIV of the County Code.” Majority op. at 1248.
