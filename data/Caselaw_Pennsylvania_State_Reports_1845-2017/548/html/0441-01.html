On June 28, 1985, Lark was convicted of first degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, terroristic threats, and kidnapping. On April 24, 1986, he was formally sentenced to death on the murder conviction and various terms of imprisonment on the other convictions. He appealed the conviction and the judgment of sentence to this court, and on May 17,1988, we affirmed. On August 19,1994, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed the warrant for Lark’s execution, and Lark then petitioned for collateral review. On July 21, 1995 the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia-Criminal Division (the PCRA court) heard argument to determine “whether or not there is [an] evidentiary hearing necessary on the PCRA petition.” N.T. 7/21/95, 2. After argument, the court took the case under advisement and ultimately <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>dismissed the petition without hearing on September 12, 1995.

    <p id="b793-5" data-blocks='[["BL_793.4",793,[182,489,1154,461]]]'>The facts underlying this case are that in late 1978, Lark robbed Tae Bong Cho while putting a gun to the head of the victim’s infant child. He was apprehended shortly after the robbery and was charged with the crime. Approximately two months later, Lark murdered Mr. Cho in order to prevent him from testifying against Lark in the robbery trial. No witness was able to identify the killer, because he wore a ski mask. However, Lark bragged to a number of acquaintances that he had killed “the Korean.”</p>

Thereafter, Lark repeatedly threatened the prosecutor in the robbery case and detectives investigating the Cho homicide. He was captured on January 9, 1980 after he took a mother and her two small children hostage. While he was barricaded inside the hostage’s house, he told police: “I’ll kill you all like that <em>[expletive </em>].... I’ll shoot you in the legs.”</p>

The first trial ended in mistrial as the result of an inadvertent question asked by the trial court, and after a second trial in June, 1985, as stated above, Lark was convicted of murder of the first degree and the other offenses.</p>

It is plain from an examination of the record that the court’s question was not an attempt to provoke a mistrial or to prejudice or harass the defendant. There was, therefore, no basis for barring prosecution at a second trial because of double jeopardy, and there was no ineffectiveness of counsel because of failure to appeal the Superior Court’s decision.</p>

The evidence, as summarized by Lark, was that an assailant entered the store which was operated by Mr. Cho, walked to the counter area and shot Mr. Cho, then left the store. From this evidence, Lark argues that an inference could be drawn that the murderer intended to rob the store. The claim is frivolous on its face. Where the record does not include any evidence of a lesser included offense of homicide, no instruction on the lesser included offense is required. <em>Commonwealth v.

An examination of the record indicates that counsel vigorously defended his client throughout a three week trial. Second, counsel offered the affidavit of Lark’s mother, which was stipulated to by the state. Third, Lark fails to state which witnesses, apart from himself, his mother and the clinical psychologist who examined Lark, should have been called or what they would have said. As to his own testimony, Lark also fails to state how he would have responded to cross examination on his extensive criminal record. His claim that his mother was not called is in error, since her testimony was received by way of stipulation. In this stipulation, Mrs. Lark testified as to Lark’s childhood history, the death of his father and brother, his time spent in foster care, and that he has a wife and three children. As to the clinical psychologist, Lark fails to explain how the testimony of the psychologist would have helped him. The affidavit of the psychologist described Lark’s childhood and describes him as having a negative self image and as a person who failed to develop internal controls over his feelings and emotions. Part of the psychologist’s testimony would have been cumulative with Lark’s mother’s stipulation. The balance of the <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>psychologist’s testimony, that Lark was a disturbed personality who lacked self-control, is not self-evidently helpful to Lark, for it appears that Lark addressed the problem of his lack of self-control and low self-esteem by engaging in a life of crime and the injuring of others.</p>

      <p id="b796-8" data-blocks='[["BL_796.7",796,[265,1857,1159,542]]]'>. Mr Justice Cappy, in a dissenting opinion joined by this author in <em>Commonwealth v. Buehl, </em><a href="/pa/540/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="540 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="472178" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0493-01">540 Pa. 493</a>, 516 fn. 1, <a href="/pa/540/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="658 A.2d 771" data-case-ids="472178,7872600" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0493-01,/a2d/658/0771-01">658 A.2d 771</a>, 783 (1995), expresses the view that although the PCRA adds that the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel must also have “so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place,” this statutory provision does not impose requirements additional to those stated above, for to hold otherwise would violate the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of effective assistance of counsel. We do not address the propriety of this view in this case because all of the claims presented by Lark fail either because there is no merit to the underlying claim, or there was a reasonable basis for counsel’s conduct, or there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for counsel's act or omission.</p>

This claim also includes the assertion of ineffectiveness in failing to object to the court’s failure to ask two jurors their views on the death penalty. As this court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Carpenter, </em><a href="/pa/533/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="533 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1837454" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0040-01">533 Pa. 40</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="617 A.2d 1263" data-case-ids="1837445,1837454" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0039-01,/pa/533/0040-01">617 A.2d 1263</a> (1992), the purpose of voir dire is to empanel a fair jury which will apply the law as instructed by the trial court. <em>Here as in Carpenter, </em>the jurors indicated on the record that they were willing to follow the court’s instructions. Moreover, the jury in this case deliberated over a two day period and asked questions of the trial court on two occasions. It is apparent that the jury deliberated before reaching a verdict and did not reach its conclusion automatically. Counsel was not derelict in failing to object to the panel.</p>

Lark’s claim that it was error for the trial court not to conduct an in-chambers colloquy in order to determine that he chose not to submit evidence of mitigation is waived. It is, in addition, without merit, since <em>Commonwealth v. Crawley, </em><a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">514 Pa. 539</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">526 A.2d 334</a> (1987), which requires such a colloquy, is applied prospectively, and is, therefore, inapplicable to the trial in this case. Finally, the claim that the court erred in failing to grant the motion to sever and in allowing evidence of other crimes is without merit, for that claim has been finally litigated on direct appeal to this court.</p>
