    <p id="b617-8" data-blocks='[["BL_617.8",617,[196,817,1155,800]]]'>This appeal raises two issues. First, whether a trial judge can enter summary judgment in favor of a mental health facility covered under the Mental Health Procedures Act (the Act)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> where an allegation of gross negligence has been offered? Second, assuming an affirmative answer to the first issue, whether in this case gross negligence has been demonstrated by the pleadings, reports, depositions, and records so as to preclude the entry of summary judgment on behalf of Appellee Abington Memorial Hospital (Appellee or the Hospital) and against Appellant John W. Albright (Appellant or Mr. Albright)? As a collateral matter, we must address the <em>res nova </em>issue for this court of what constitutes “gross negligence” for purposes of the Act. For the reasons which follow, we affirm the trial court’s granting of summary judgment in favor of the Hospital.</p>
    <p id="b617-9" data-blocks='[["BL_617.9",617,[198,1649,1153,475]]]'>In order to properly address the issues raised in this case, a detailed review of its facts and procedural history is necessary. In April, 1987, Elizabeth Jean Albright was involuntarily committed to Eugenia Hospital, and was subsequently discharged into an outpatient program after improvement of her condition. Again in August, 1988, Mrs. Albright was involuntarily committed to Thomas Jefferson Hospital. However, on September 6, 1988, it was determined that Mrs. Albright did not meet the standards for an involuntary commitment.</p>

After being treated with appropriate medication and therapy, Mrs. Albright’s condition improved so that a regime of 90 days of involuntary outpatient care at the Hospital was ordered by the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. The court’s order indicated that a failure to comply with the order would result in a return to inpatient status. The 90-day period began on September 28, and was to have elapsed on December 27,1988. Mrs. Albright was evaluated by Dr. George Buck, the Hospital’s psychiatrist on September 30, 1988. She was diagnosed as having a bipolar disorder, i.e., a manic depressive disorder.</p>
    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[250,994,1164,785]]]'>The arrangements for the outpatient treatment included therapy sessions once a month for three months. While Mrs. Albright refused to sign the consent to treatment, she did attend the first therapy session with her husband on October 13, 1988 and the second session on November 3, 1988. At both of these sessions, Dr. Buck re-evaluated Mrs. Albright. During these sessions Mrs. Albright indicated that she was not taking her medication, and that the medication was too expensive to take on a regular basis. Dr. Buck advised Mrs. Albright and her husband that she should take the medication as directed. Dr. Buck also suggested that Mrs. Albright see Audrey Moody, a social worker and clergywoman, in hope that Ms. Moody would provide supportive therapy and an insight as to the need for medication and compliance with the medical program.</p>

He was told that someone would return his call. Early the next morning, Mr. Albright called MCES, after failing to reach anyone at the Hospital. The person to whom he spoke promised to investigate. Mr. Albright testified that later that day, the Hospital’s doctor with whom Mrs. Albright had the appointment on December 8th called and stated that because Mrs. Albright had missed her appointment, there was nothing that the Hospital could do. The doctor did advise that he call MCES. However, in Mr. Albright’s follow-up telephone conversation with MCES, MCES explained that the Hospital would have to handle the problem. At that point, the individual that Mr. Albright spoke with originally at MCES called back and stated that the Hospital’s case management unit would handle the situation and that Mr. Albright was to contact Mr. Joseph Windish of the Hospital’s case management office.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[203,1461,1153,694]]]'>In a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Windish, Mr. Albright explained that Mrs. Albright was having a breakdown, was becoming manic, and was in need of medical help. However, Mr. Windish informed Mr. Albright that as the 90-day treatment period was almost at end, it would be highly irregular to have a patient committed that late in the treatment plan. Upon Mr. Windish’s request, Mr. Albright described Mrs. Albright’s behavior. He stated that his wife had let the dinner burn in the oven so that smoke was coming out of the oven when he arrived home from work. He explained that Mrs. Albright had been walking at night and was chain smoking. Finally, he described cigarette burns in six-month-old furniture, but was not sure when the burns were made.</p>

By that time Mr. Windish had spoken with his supervisor who indicated that nothing could be done as there was no time for a § 306 transfer and that the case was probably not strong enough to qualify for a § 302 commitment. Mr. Windish stated that he would call Mrs. Albright and schedule an appointment with her for December 28, the earliest available date. He also indicated that he would attempt to determine whether anyone had followed up on Mrs. Albright’s missed appointment.</p>

However, Mrs. Albright became verbally aggressive, indicated that she wanted to focus on Christmas with her family and that she was through with appointments. Mrs. Albright did tell Mr. Windish to call back after Christmas and that she might reschedule at that time.</p>

When the Albright’s son returned home at approximately 10:30 p.m., he engaged in an argument with <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>his mother.

Following oral argument, the trial court granted the Hospital’s motion on February 8, 1995. The trial court found that as a matter of law, the Hospital’s conduct did not rise to the level of gross negligence. On November 22, 1995, a unanimous panel of the Superior Court affirmed, finding that based upon Appellant’s deposition testimony as supplemented by Hospital medical records and notes of treating staff, Appellant failed to set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case of gross negligence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Moreover, the Superior Court determined <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>that the trial court did not err in taking the issue of the Hospital’s negligence from the jury or in finding that no reasonable jury could have found that the Hospital acted in a grossly negligent manner.</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[250,558,1159,613]]]'>With respect to the first issue on appeal, Appellant raises two subarguments. Appellant initially argues that, because both the Act and case law fail to provide a clear definition of what constitutes the difference between ordinary negligence and gross negligence, resolution of whether the Hospital’s conduct constituted gross negligence should have been left for the jury; therefore, this is a question which is inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment. Appellant also argues that if he alleges gross negligence and can establish even ordinary negligence on the part of the Hospital, then it is for the jury to decide whether the Hospital’s conduct constitutes gross negligence.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[248,1194,1160,197]]]'>To resolve Appellant’s first argument, we must interpret the Act’s qualified immunity provision. This section of the Act provides certain individuals and entities with the protection of limited immunity from civil and criminal liability:</p>
    <blockquote id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.7",622,[286,1405,1119,612]]]'>In the absence of willful misconduct or gross negligence, a county administrator, a director of a facility, a physician, a peace officer or any other authorized person who participates in a decision that a person be examined or treated under this act, or that a person be discharged, or placed under partial hospitalization, outpatient care or leave of absence, or that .the restraint upon such person be otherwise reduced, or a county administrator or other authorized person who denies an application for voluntary treatment or for involuntary emergency examination and treatment, shall not be civilly or criminally liable for such decision or for any of its consequences.</blockquote>

As Appellant does not assert willful misconduct on the part of the Hospital, our focus narrows to whether the Hospital’s conduct rises to the level of gross negligence. Obviously, the meaning of this phrase is critical to the determination of the Hospital’s immunity under the Act and the propriety of summary judgment in favor of the Hospital.</p>

Both the trial court and the Superior Court in the case <em>sub judice </em>relied upon the definition of gross negligence as stated by the Superior Court in <em>Bloom, v.

In reversing the granting of preliminary objections in favor of the psychiatrist, the Superior Court analyzed the limited immunity provision of the Act and in doing so, attempted to define the difference between ordinary negligence and gross negligence. After noting that the Act itself failed to provide a definition and determining that cases from this Commonwealth interpreting the Act failed to provide a workable definition to evaluate the complaint, the <em>Bloom </em>court turned to Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts, </em>Ch. 5, § 34 at pp. 210-11 (5th ed.1984) for an analysis of the common law.

Specifically, the Hospital, in an attempt to evaluate the possibility of commitment, asked Mr. Albright about Mrs. Albright’s condition. Mr. Albright informed the Hospital of the following. Mrs. Albright had not been taking her medication. She had missed her last appointment. She had a breakdown, was becoming manic, and was walking around at night. She had left a dinner burn in the oven. Finally, she was chain smoking and there were some cigarette burns on the couch, but it was not clear when the burns were made.</p>

This type of commitment involves the transfer of a person subject to involuntary treatment to another facility. However, if such a transfer entailed a greater restraint upon a person’s liberty, which would have been the case here in transferring Mrs. Albright to inpatient status, a court hearing and a finding of necessity was required. 50 P.S. § 7306(c).

A person is severely mentally disabled when, as a result of mental illness, her capacity to exercise self-control, judgment and discretion in the conduct of her affairs and social relations or to care for her own personal needs is so lessened that she poses a clear and present danger of harm to others or herself. 50 P.S. § 7301(a). Thus, the Hospital determined that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Mrs. Albright was a clear and present danger to herself or others as of December 22. Nevertheless, the Hospital suggested that Mr. Albright attempt such a § 302 involuntary emergency examination. This suggestion was rejected by Mr. Albright.</p>

Specifically, Appellant asserted that the Hospital ignored warnings of Mrs. Albright’s deterio<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>rating mental condition after being informed of her manic state by Mr. Albright, and failed to commit her as an inpatient when she declined to follow up her missed December appointment. Further, Mr. Albright informed the hospital that Mrs. Albright was not taking her medication and missed her last appointment. He told the Hospital that she had a breakdown and was becoming manic, walking around at night. He also indicated Mrs. Albright was chain smoking and that there were some cigarette burns on the couch. In response, the Hospital did not believe there was sufficient time to attempt an involuntary commitment as Mrs. Albright was in the 85th day of a 90-day outpatient treatment. Further, the Hospital believed that an emergency commitment was unsupportable.</p>

The Superior Court below suggests that this ease is at worst simply an exercise of poor judgement by the Hospital staff. However, I believe the jury should have been afforded the opportunity to make that ultimate decision.</p>
