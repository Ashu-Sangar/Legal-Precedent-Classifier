The Commonwealth Court viewed the amendment as a substantive change rather than a clarification of existing law and held that it could not retroactively apply the amendment. Accordingly, it found that Kapilian’s time as a graduate teaching assistant in Illinois was creditable nonstate service under the Code.</p>

The Board stated that the essential purpose of offering retirement benefits is to attract employees by offering individuals a more attractive compensation package. Appellee herself testified that retirement benefits would not be desired by prospective residents since they are most often significantly in debt and would not want any portion of their stipend withheld. Also, the classification of medical residents as state employees would increase the financial burden of state institutions where the residents serve because the hospitals would be required to fund retirement accounts of individuals who are essentially their students. There would also exist the additional administrative burden on SERS to enroll individuals in the system who would generally be employed by the state institution for only one year.</p>
