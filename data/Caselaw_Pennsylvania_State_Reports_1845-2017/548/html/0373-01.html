For the reasons which follow, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand to the Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Barbe, President of Quick Chef, Inc., executed a cognovit guaranty (the “Guaranty”) in favor of Appellee, Ohio Pure Foods, Inc. The Guaranty, which contained a confession <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>of judgment clause, was executed in conjunction with other financial obligations of Quick Chef, Inc. to Appellee.</p>
    <p id="b721-4" data-blocks='[["BL_721.4",721,[195,471,1154,740]]]'>On April 25, 1995, Appellee filed a Complaint in Confession of Judgment (the “Complaint”) seeking to recover certain payments from Appellant. In response to the Complaint, on May 31, 1995, Appellant filed a Petition for Rule to Show Cause Why Judgment Should Not Be Opened and to Stay Execution (the “Petition”). In the Petition, Appellant alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>forgery as a meritorious defense to the action. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County denied Appellant’s Petition on the basis that insufficient facts were alleged in support of Appellant’s defense. The Superior Court affirmed the lower court’s decision, likewise finding that Appellant failed to plead any factual allegations in support of the claimed defense of forgery. This court granted Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

However, the issuance of the rale to show cause is mandatory if the requisite <em>prima facie </em>requirements are met. <em>Continental Bank v.

In <em>Liberati, </em>this court found that testimony that an individual did not sign an agreement, that the signature was not hers, that she had not authorized anyone to sign on her behalf, that she did not appear before the notary and testimony that the notary did not remember her, required that the <em>judgment be opened </em>and that the matter <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>go to the jury pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 2959(e). Likewise, in <em>Long, </em>a rule to show cause was granted where the petitioner alleged that he had not signed a note, had not authorized any person to sign the note, or owed any debt to the creditor. <em>See also, Austen v. Marzolf, </em><a href="/pa/307/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="307 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="1138192" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0232-01">307 Pa. 232</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%2072" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="161 A. 72">161 A. 72</a> (1932)(allega-tion of signature being a forgery, made without knowledge, direction, or consideration, was sufficient for granting of rule to show cause); <em>Earley’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/90/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="90 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1065647" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0321-01">90 Pa. 321</a> (1879)(rule to show cause obtained on assertion that note was a forgery).</p>

Indeed, the allegations offered by Appellant in the case <em>sub judice, </em>are virtually identical to those in <em>Long </em>and substantially similar to those in <em>Liberati, </em>where this court found such facts sufficient to decide the ultimate issue of whether the judgment should be opened. Thus, in light of this court’s prior decisions, it is not difficult to conclude that Appellant has satisfied the threshold burden of stating <em>prima facie </em>grounds for relief for the issuance of a rule to show cause.</p>
    <p id="b723-5" data-blocks='[["BL_723.5",723,[195,1515,1153,360]]]'>While the lower courts found, and Appellee contends, that Appellant has failed to set forth sufficient factual allegations, it is unclear what more Appellant could have provided in her Petition.

    <p id="b723-6" data-blocks='[["BL_723.6",723,[196,1911,1153,312]]]'>Because Appellant satisfied her initial burden of setting forth <em>prima facie </em>grounds for relief, and was therefore entitled, as a matter of law, to the issuance of a rule to show cause, the order of the Superior Court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>
