The assistant house manager position was classified by AVS as a management staff position. Beginning early in his employment with AVS, claimant’s supervisors met with him repeatedly in order to counsel claimant on deficiencies in his job performance. Some of the issues brought to claimant’s attention were his failure to follow established routines, his inability to deal effectively with the staff, his failure to use good judgment at work, his deficiency in reporting information in a timely and accurate manner, and his inability to carry out his job responsibilities in a consistent and professional manner.</p>

In place of the assistant house manager position, AVS offered claimant employment as either a house manager aide or as a developmental care <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>specialist. Both of these positions included the same hours and non-monetary fringe benefit package that he had received in the assistant manager position. However, both of the offered positions required claimant to accept a reduction in salary as they only paid $6.76 per hour (approximately $14,000 per year). Also, neither of the offered positions was classified by AVS as a management staff position. On August 1, 1994, claimant refused AVS’s offer and terminated his employment.</p>
    <p id="b705-4" data-blocks='[["BL_705.4",705,[192,759,1152,362]]]'>Claimant then filed for unemployment compensation benefits with the Office of Employment Security. On August 19, 1994, the Office of Employment Security found that claimant had a necessitous and compelling reason for voluntarily terminating his employment with AVS and that claimant was eligible for benefits under Section 402(b) of the Unemployment Compensation Law.</p>
    <p id="b705-5" data-blocks='[["BL_705.5",705,[192,1144,1153,681]]]'>AVS timely appealed this decision and the appeal was assigned to an unemployment compensation referee. The referee conducted hearings on September 20, 1994, November 22, 1994, and December 20,1994. At these hearings, claimant testified that he did not believe he was demoted. Instead, claimant testified that he believed that he was discharged from the assistant house manager position and was offered reemployment in the other positions offered by AVS. Claimant stated that he did not accept any of the other positions because they provided significantly less compensation than he had previously received as assistant house manager. Claimant, however, admitted at the hearings that he had failed to perform his job duties on certain occasions.</p>

These persons included AVS’s house manager, its administrator, its residential services director and its personnel services director. These four witnesses testified about the counselling and consultation provided to claimant because of his continued inability to perform the responsibilities of his position as assistant house manager. Examples of some of the reasons offered by AVS’s witnesses for claimant’s demotion included claimant’s failure to follow established routines when presenting problems to his supervi<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>sors, his hasty and volatile reaction to employment situations and to his staff, his failure to keep accurate information concerning the residents, his inability to file timely reports required by AVS policy, his failure to adhere to AVS policy concerning how residents were to be treated, and his breach of the residents’ confidentiality.</p>

The referee also determined that AVS offered claimant continuing employment at a reduced wage and that claimant voluntarily terminated his position. The referee, however, concluded that the demotion and resulting wage reduction created a necessary and compelling reason for claimant’s voluntary termination. Thus, the referee affirmed the determination of the Office of Employment Security that claimant was entitled to unemployment compensation benefits under Section 402(b) of the Unemployment Compensation Law.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.5",706,[250,1320,1164,579]]]'>AVS timely appealed this decision to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (“Board”). On March 30, 1995, the Board, without holding further hearings and without the presentation of further evidence, essentially adopted the facts presented in the referee’s opinion. In addition to adopting the referee’s factual determinations, the Board opined that claimant had worked to the best of his abilities and concluded that claimant’s demotion and reduction in pay were unreasonable and unjustified since claimant had worked to the best of his abilities. Thus, the Board affirmed the referee’s decision to grant benefits to claimant.</p>

Because claimant made a showing of good faith in his job performance and claimant’s pay in this case was found by the referee to be substantially reduced, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the grant of benefits.</p>

When a claimant voluntary quits after being demoted, then, under the <em>Tune </em>line of cases, the claimant’s eligibility for benefits under the “necessitous and compelling” language of Section 402(b) of the Unemployment Compensation Law necessarily relates to the reason for the demotion. Accordingly, under <em>Tune, </em>if the employer was justified in demoting a claimant, the claimant had no necessary and compelling reasons to voluntarily quit and the claimant was deemed ineligible for benefits since his own actions brought about the demotion. Conversely, the <em>Tune </em>line of cases held that a claimant was eligible for benefits if he voluntarily quit after an unjust demotion because the unjust demotion constituted a cause of a necessitous and compelling nature. AVS contends that the <em>Tune </em>line of cases should be applied because these cases follow the intent of the drafters of the Unemployment Compensation Law.</p>

Instead, the <em>Old Forge </em>court developed a two part test to examine this issue. Under this test, the fact finder must first look to the reason asserted for the demotion. If the demotion was unjustified, the inquiry is ended since the claimant had necessary and compelling reasons to voluntarily terminate his employment. However, if the employer was justified in demoting the claimant for disciplinary or other valid business reasons, the fact finder must then examine whether the changes in the terms and conditions of employment were reasonably related to the reasons for the demotion. As recognized by the Commonwealth Court in the case <em>sub judice, Old Forge </em>is the law currently applied by that court in cases involving a claim for benefits based upon a voluntary termination after a demotion.</p>

Thus, interpretations of other provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law such as Section 402(b) must consider that a claimant can only receive benefits if he is unemployed through no fault of his own. Extending this rationale to Section 402(b) of the Unemployment Compensation Law compels us to conclude that the logical focus for determining whether necessitous and compelling reasons exist for a claimant to voluntarily terminate his employment after receiving a demotion is the justification for the demotion. Thus, a claimant does not have necessary and compelling reasons to voluntarily terminate his employment if the demotion was justified because the change in job duties and remuneration was the result of the claimant’s fault.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Moreover, the record established that, despite this counselling, claimant was unable to carry out the responsibilities of the assistant house manager position, that he consistently used poor judgment in his performance and that he continued to have problems supervising his staff. These factors demonstrated that AVS was justified in demoting claimant. Thus, claimant’s voluntary termination was the result of his own fault and, accordingly, he did not have necessitous and compelling reasons for voluntarily terminating his employment with AVS.

The Law clearly requires a review of such circumstances and the second prong of <em>Old Forge </em>satisfies that mandate. Under the second prong of the <em>Old Forge </em>analytical framework, the employee is at least given the opportunity, as required by the Law, to demonstrate that she had a necessitous and compelling reason to voluntarily leave her employment, i.e., that the demotion was so drastic or severe so as to be unreasonable.</p>

However, the demotion is draconian; it is to a position which requires a 90% salary cut and a loss of medical benefits. The employee is forced to “voluntarily” leave his new position. In essence, the employer has constructively discharged the employee, yet the employee is left without unemployment compensation benefits or recourse because the demotion was “justified.” The employer in this example would be able to violate the very purpose of the Law and escape having to pay benefits.</p>

If the demotion is justified, the employee who, after engaging in willful misconduct, voluntarily leaves his new position will be denied benefits. Conversely, if an employee is working to the best of his ability, yet still suffers from performance deficiencies, and his employer demotes him, the relevant inquiry will first be whether the demotion was justified, and if so, whether the demotion was reasonable.

The majority wants us to believe that if a tribunal examines any factor other than the justification for the demotion, then this would lead to “employers never demoting employees because of fear of being subject to claims for benefits,” and would result in “employers leaving incompetent people in positions they are incapable of performing.” These concerns are clearly without basis. Contrary to the majority’s assertions, under the <em>Old Forge </em>analysis, an employer would still be encouraged to demote an employee whose performance was unacceptable, i.e., the employer will not have to pay unemployment compensation benefits. However, the demotion would simply have to be justified and reasonable.

It is the employee’s burden to show a necessitous and compelling reason for leaving his employment, <em>Taylor, supra, </em>and such employee should be strictly held to this burden.</p>

I join in Mr. Justice Gappy’s dissenting opinion with the exception of his statements that a necessitous and compelling reason to voluntarily leave employment requires “the most drastic circumstances.” To the contrary, a necessitous and compelling reason to leave “results from circumstances which produce pressure to terminate employment that is both real and substantial, and which would compel a reasonable person under the circumstances to act in the same manner.” <em>Taylor v.
