Despite the fact that Appellant requested the psychiatric examination which Dr. Finken performed and later raised a diminished capacity defense during both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial, Appellant argues that his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was violated, since he did not receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to his examination by Dr. Finken. Furthermore, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred by permitting the Commonwealth to introduce information from Dr. Finken’s psychiatric report during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial.</p>
