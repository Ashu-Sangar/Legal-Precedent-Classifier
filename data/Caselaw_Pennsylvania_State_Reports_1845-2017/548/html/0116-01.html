Chance, a police officer, was on patrol in the 5900 block of Manning Street in Philadelphia. While the officer was speaking with a local resident, Dennis walked by and admitted to the police officer that she was drunk and could'not handle her liquor. Dennis continued to walk along the street, and after a few minutes, the officer resumed her beat, proceeding to 60th and Chancelor Streets where she saw Dennis driving a car at a high rate of speed. Dennis drove her car into a parked vehicle and continued to drive down another street. She eventually stopped and exited her car.</p>

While speaking with Dennis, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol on Dennis’ breath. She also observed that Dennis slurred her words when she spoke and was not well-balanced. Dennis admitted to the officer that she had consumed at least a fifth of a gallon of Thunderbird wine. The officer arrested Dennis for driving under the influence. At 9:15 a.m., seven hours after the accident, police conducted a breathalyzer test to determine Dennis’ blood alcohol content (BAG), which registered 0.0%.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Second, the Superior Court held that a plain reading of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(d)(1) expressly barred the Commonwealth from charging Dennis with violating Section 3731(a)(1) because Dennis’ BAG of 0.0% created an irrebuttable presumption that she was not under the influence of alcohol.
