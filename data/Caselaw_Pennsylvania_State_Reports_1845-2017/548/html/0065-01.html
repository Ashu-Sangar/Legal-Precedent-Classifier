The evidence at trial was as follows. Ms. Jones had been at Don’s Bar in Eddystone, Delaware County, with her boyfriend, John Murray, from approximately 6:00 p.m. until 8:30 p.m. on November 18,1994. Upon leaving Don’s Bar, the victim and John Murray visited with a friend, Helene Edwards, in the Sun Village area of Chester. Ms. Jones left Ms. Edwards’ home, and, when Mr. Murray attempted to accompany her, she told him she was going to a friend’s house. Mr. Murray last saw the victim at approximately 9:00 p.m. on November 18,1994, walking alone up Morton Avenue.</p>

Michael Smith observed the woman at the time this request was made and later identified the woman who accompanied the Appellant as Ms. Jones. Appellant did not appear to Michael Smith to be intoxicated or “high” on drugs at the time he lent Appellant his car. Appellant later returned the car keys to Michael Smith at approximately 12:30 a.m. on November 19, 1994.

In this statement, Appellant stated that he had borrowed his nephew’s car so that he could buy drugs, and that the victim had agreed to have sex with him in exchange for drugs. Appellant stated that he and the victim had gone to Sun Village Park.

Appellant admitted his guilt to third degree murder of the victim, and urged that this cocaine-induced psychosis evidence would allow the jury to mitigate the charge of first degree murder to third degree murder on the basis of section 308 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 308.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> When the defense proceeded with its case-in-chief, however, Dr. Woody was not present; thus, the defense called Dr. Berman to the stand.</p>

Dr. Berman testified that toxic psychosis, a condition that occurs due to cocaine intoxication, is a recognized psychiatric <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (DSM-4), which is relied upon by psychiatrists in diagnosing patients. Dr. Berman testified that toxic psychosis from cocaine intoxication can occur in individuals at varying dosage levels and cause hallucinations and delusions. Dr. Berman reviewed the autopsy reports and chemical analyses which were performed on the victim and interviewed Appellant. Dr. Berman opined that Appellant was suffering from a cocaine-induced psychotic disorder at the time that he strangled the victim to death. It was Dr. Berman’s expert medical opinion that Appellant was unable to form the specific intent to kill the victim. On cross-examination by the prosecution, Dr. Berman explained that his opinion was based on his review of the autopsy reports performed on the victim, as well as his interview of Appellant, Appellant’s statement, and the Affidavit of Probable Cause. Moreover, on cross-examination Dr. Berman testified that although he had no knowledge of the amount of cocaine Appellant ingested, the effect of a cocaine-induced psychotic experience is not determined by the amount of cocaine ingested by an individual but by an individual’s usage of the drug over a period of time and the manner in which it is ingested. Additionally, on cross-examination, Dr. Berman explained how, from the psychiatric standpoint, Appellant could have been aware that he was physically strangling the victim yet unable to “turn off’ his psychosis. Dr. Berman testified on cross-examination that Appellant’s ability to physically carry out his plans at the time of the killing did not affect his psychiatric opinion that Appellant was suffering from toxic psychosis.</p>

The defense informed the trial court that Dr. Woody would be “tied up in Center City Philadelphia” until after 5:00 p.m., and would come directly to the courtroom in Media. The defense requested that Dr. Woody be permitted to testify in the defense’s case-in-chief, offering Dr. Woody as the author of the section in the DSM-4 dealing with cocaine and psychotic disorders, and as a psychiatrist and an expert in the effect of controlled substances, i.e., <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>cocaine, on an individual’s brain. The prosecution objected that Dr. Woody’s proffered testimony would be cumulative of Dr. Berman’s testimony concerning the DSM-4 and the effects of cocaine on Appellant.

Dr. Cohn testified that cocaine-induced psychosis is dosage dependent, in that the amount of cocaine ingested by an individual and entering the individual’s blood stream is an important consideration as to whether a toxic psychosis would be produced. Dr. Cohn further testified that with a chronie cocaine user, it would take a higher dosage for him to be able to opine that the level would be consistent with a toxic psychosis. Dr. Cohn testified that, in view of the levels of cocaine and cocaine metabolites found in the victim’s blood arid urine, and, assuming that Appellant had consumed the same amount of cocaine as had the victim, it was impossible to conclude that Appellant had suffered a cocaine-induced toxic psychosis at the time of the killing. Additionally, Dr. Cohn opined that Appellant was not suffering from toxic psychosis at the time of the killing because he retained his physical abilities and recalled the events surrounding the killing with clarity. Dr. Cohn further opined that Appellant’s specific intent to kill the victim was not affected by his ingestion of cocaine. Dr. Cohn testified on cross-examination that he was not familiar with the DSM-4, mainly because he is not a psychiatrist.</p>

As Dr. Berman was offered by the defense to testify in Dr. Woody’s absence, Dr. Berman covered in his testimony the information which, apparently, the defense had planned for Dr. Woody to cover. Once Dr. Woody was present in the courtroom, after the defense had rested its case, there was nothing in the defense’s offer of proof for Dr. Woody’s testimony which would have shown his proffered testimony would not be merely cumulative of Dr. Berman’s testimony regarding the effects of cocaine ingestion on an individual’s brain.

    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[202,705,1156,856]]]'>The core issue during the guilt phase of the trial was whether appellant had formed the specific intent to murder the victim. The proffered testimony of Dr. Woody had a direct bearing on that issue. The significance of the issue was manifested by a question sent out by the jury during its deliberations: “Did Dr. Cohn say a toxic psychosis could have been possible in Wayne Smith’s case?” The question struck directly to the heart of the issue of appellant’s level of culpability in the murder. In this trial there was no dispute that toxic psychosis would negate the ability to form a specific intent to kill; the only debate was whether or not appellant was suffering toxic psychosis at the time of the killing. The information which Dr. Woody should have been permitted to present in surrebuttal was crucial to appellant’s defense and integral to the concerns of the jury reflected in the question submitted during deliberations.</p>
    <p id="b433-6" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[205,1600,1152,204]]]'>I therefore conclude that the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to permit Dr. Woody to testify in surrebuttal during the guilt phase of appellant’s trial. I would reverse the judgment of sentence and remand for a new trial.</p>
