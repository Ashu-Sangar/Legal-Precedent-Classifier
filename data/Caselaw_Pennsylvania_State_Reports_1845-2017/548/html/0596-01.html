Appellant was transported from the scene of the accident to the nearest hospital for treatment of his injuries. This hospital was Memorial Hospital, located in Cumberland, Maryland. Appellant was admitted to Memorial Hospital at approximately 11:10 p.m. suffering from a concussion, and numerous broken bones, including his jaw, nose, ribs, and legs.

When Trooper Bosch began to speak with Appellant, he noticed a strong odor of alcohol on Appellant’s breath. A second Pennsylvania State Police Trooper who had accompanied Trooper Bosch to the hospital read <em>Miranda </em>rights<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">2</a> to Appellant.

Appellant raised only one issue: whether the trial court erred in denying suppression of the blood test results when the evidence of intoxication and the blood were obtained in Maryland by a Pennsylvania State Trooper acting without a search warrant or authorization by the Maryland police? The Superior Court rejected Appellant’s argument that Pennsylvania’s Implied Consent Law was inapplicable to Appellant while he was being treated for his injuries in Maryland, reasoning that as a licensed driver in this Commonwealth, Appellant is subject to the provisions of section 1547(a). The Superior Court agreed with the trial court that Trooper Bosch was authorized by Pennsylvania’s Implied Consent Law to request that Appellant submit to chemical testing of his blood, and that, Appellant, after being appropriately advised by Trooper Bosch of the consequences of refusal to submit to chemical testing of his blood, had consented to such testing. The Superior Court thus affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence.</p>

The Opinion in Support of Reversal authored by Mr. Justice Zappala states that we have "failed to grasp the significance of the fact that Appellant was placed under arrest in Maryland by a Pennsylvania State <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>Trooper for the alleged commission of a misdemeanor in Pennsylvania. Under such circumstances, a Pennsylvania State Trooper lacks authority to place a suspect under arrest in Maryland." (Opinion in Support of Reversal, slip op. at 1-2) Mr. Justice Zappala finds that it is clear from the record that Appellant was in fact placed under arrest by Trooper Bosch. He bases this conclusion on a portion of Trooper Bosch’s testimony upon direct examination by the Commonwealth at the suppression hearing, in which Trooper Bosch indicated that he read to Appellant Chemical Test Warnings, which included the statement,</p>

I'm requesting that you submit to a chemical test of blood. It’s my duty as a police officer to inform you that if you refuse to submit to the chemical testing that your operating privileges will be suspended for a period of one year."</blockquote>

      <p id="b954-9" data-blocks='[["BL_954.4",954,[301,1530,1127,308]]]'>The record also reflects that, prior to reading the Chemical Test Warnings to Appellant, Trooper Bosch was investigating the accident at the Memorial Hospital Emergency Room, questioning Appellant there about the accident. When his questions were not providing any information, Trooper Bosch asked Appellant to submit to chemical testing of his blood, and read Appellant Implied Consent Warnings pursuant to section 1547, which were different from the Chemical Test Warnings which he then read to Appellant.</p>
