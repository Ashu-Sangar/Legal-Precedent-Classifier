In <em>Griffin, </em>the Court held that a warrantless search of a probationer's residence was "reasonable” and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The search was conducted pursuant to a state regulation which permitted warrantless searches of probationers if there are "reasonable grounds” to believe that contraband is present in their residence. The Court stated that the "special needs” of the state in supervising probationers justifies the departure from the usual probable cause requirements. The evidence recovered as a result of the search was therefore admitted in a subsequent criminal trial.</p>

The history of our counterpart to the Fourth Amendment, Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, indicates that the purpose underlying the exclusionary rule in this Commonwealth is two-fold. We have held that "the exclusionary rule in Pennsylvania has consistently served to bolster the twin aims of Article I, Section 8; to-wit, the safeguarding of privacy and the fundamental requirement that warrants <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>shall only be issued upon probable cause.” <em>Commonwealth v.
