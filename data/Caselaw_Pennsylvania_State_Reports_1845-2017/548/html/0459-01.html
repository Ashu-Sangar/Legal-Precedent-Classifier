During a routine examination on June 13, 1987, Dr. Silk discovered an enlargement of Evans’ left thyroid lobe. Dr. Silk determined that complete removal of Evans’ thyroid, a thyroidectomy, was required in order to avoid recurrent problems and determine malignancy. During a thyroidectomy, the laryngeal nerve, one of two which make up the vocal cords, must be exposed and protected to prevent injury due to its close proximity to the thyroid.</p>

Without another medical liability expert to present, a non-suit was entered against Appellants. Subsequently, Appellants filed Post-Trial Motions seeking removal of the non-suit and grant of a new trial, maintaining the proffered expert testimony was sufficient to proceed to the jury under a theory of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>The trial court denied Appellants’ Post-Trial Motions, finding the deposition testimony failed to demonstrate that Dr. Silk’s actions deviated from accepted medical standards.

In <em>Sedlitsky, </em>the issue raised was whether the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury as to <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>Similarly, in <em>Sedlitsky, </em>plaintiff experienced hoarseness after undergoing surgery to remove half of her thyroid <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>gland. After being examined by a physician, plaintiff was informed that the hoarseness was a result of permanent vocal cord paralysis. At trial, plaintiff produced expert testimony that the paralysis occurred during the operation and that the surgeon must have somehow stretched the vocal cord. Additionally, the expert testified that the injury is not the type to occur in the absence of negligence unless unusual circumstances were present and there was no evidence of unusual circumstances. Thus, the expert concluded the surgeon must have been negligent and breached the standard of care by failing to protect the vocal cords while operating. Based on this testimony, the <em>Sedlitsky </em>Court found that plaintiff produced sufficient evidence to raise an inference that it was more likely than not that plaintiffs injuries were caused by defendant’s negligence, and, therefore, the jury should have been instructed on the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Misquoting that testimony, the Superior Court stated that Dr. Bogdasarian explained that even if the surgery was performed in a non-negligent manner, the injury could still occur.

Again, <em>Sedlitsky </em>is instructive. There, the defense maintained that the recurrent laryngeal nerve was unusually adhered to the thyroid, so that when the thyroid was rotated out of plaintiffs neck, the nerve was unavoidably stretched through no fault of the doctor. However, the doctor’s operative report did not mention that the thyroid was attached to the nerve. Thus, the <em>Sedlitsky </em>Court held that the jury could conclude plaintiffs injury resulted from negligence since no mention was made in the report regarding nerve attachment and no unusual circumstances existed during the operation. <em>Sedlitsky </em><a href="/pa-super/400/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="400 Pa.
