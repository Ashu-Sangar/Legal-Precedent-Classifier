Where, as in the present case, negligence of the employer was alleged to have caused the death of an employee, preliminary objections raising the exclusivity provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 481(a), and the Occupational Disease Act, 77 P.S. § 1403, were properly sustained. Where it is clearly ascertainable from the pleadings that a claim based on the employer’s negligence is cognizable under the workmen’s compensation statute, it is desirable to dispose of the claim through preliminary objections rather than preserve the claim until administrative remedies have been fully pursued and the appellate process exhausted. To fail to dispose of such claims at the earliest possible stage is to expose the defendant-employer to an extended period of uncertainty regarding ultimate liability. This burdens the employer unnecessarily and can create ramifications for the employer’s business that are not warranted in light of the goal of the workmen’s compensation statute to proscribe the employer’s liability to such suits.</p>
