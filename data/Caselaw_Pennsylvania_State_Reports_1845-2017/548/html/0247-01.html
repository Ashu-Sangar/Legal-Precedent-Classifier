Before the amendment, hearing loss was compensable only if it was “complete.” After the amendment, partial hearing loss is also compensable as a specific loss. The amount of compensation remains 66% per cent of wages, but the duration of the payments is calculated as a factor of 260 weeks in the case of loss caused by long-term exposure to occupational noise or loss in both ears due to other causes such as acoustic trauma or head injury, or as a factor of 60 weeks in the case of loss in one ear due to causes such as acoustic trauma or head injury. The duration of compensation is determined by multiplying the maximum number of weeks by the percentage of hearing impairment as demonstrated by audiogram testing using the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. Thus a claimant whose audiogram test showed a 30% impairment in both ears would receive two-thirds of his wage for 78 weeks (30% of 260 weeks); a claimant showing a 30% impairment in one ear would receive two-thirds of his wage for 18 weeks (30% of 60 weeks) if the loss was <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>caused by a sudden loud noise, a blow to the head, or some occupational source other than long-term exposure.</p>

They argued that application of the Act to them would constitute an impairment of the obligation of contracts in violation of Article I, Section 17 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution.

After Agostin’s disability became total (on November 7, 1939), he filed a claim, on September 17, 1940. Although a substantial portion of our opinion was devoted to the question whether the applicable limitations period was the two year period of the 1937 Act or the one year period of the 1939 Act, which had repealed the 1937 Act, resolution of that question was not necessary to the decision of the case.</p>

We rejected this argument based on the language of the Act, stating that “[t]he time ... when total disability occurred was the date which began the running of the statute....” <a href="/pa/354/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="354 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="467414" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0543-01">354 Pa. at 551</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.2d%20680" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="47 A.2d 680">47 A.2d at 684</a>.

Accordingly, the one year period of the 1939 Act began to run on November 7, 1939, and had not expired when the claim was filed on September 17, 1940.

In 1981, the legislature enacted a benefits coordination statute that allowed employers to reduce workers’ compensation payments by amounts paid through other employer-funded sources. General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor Corporation took the position that the statute allowed benefits coordination with respect to workers injured before its effective date. In 1985, the Michigan Supreme Court agreed, holding that the statute applied to all payment periods after the effective date, and such application to persons injured prior thereto did not violate due process.

In response, in 1987 the Michigan legislature passed a bill requiring reimbursement of benefits that had been withheld as a result of coordination, thus putting employers who had coordinated benefits on the same footing as those who had not. Thus, General Motors and Ford were required to repay more than $25 million to persons who had been injured prior to 1981.

Put another way, the appellees have a recognizable interest in obtaining “reasonable compensation” for injuries arising in the course of their employment, not a right to compensation of a fixed amount. The right to receive compensation for hearing loss has not been impaired, only the remedy has been varied.</p>
    <p id="b607-7" data-blocks='[["BL_607.7",607,[177,1807,1154,584]]]'>The General Assembly’s decision with regard to retroactive application was a rational means to further a legitimate legislative purpose. The purpose of the changes, as described at the outset of this opinion, was to correct the inequities of application that followed in the wake of <em>Hartlieb </em>due to the subjective elements of proof with respect to this particular type of loss. One of the inequities to be corrected was the “all or nothing” nature of the decision. The legislative decision that the duration of compensation should be calculated according to an objectively determined percentage of impairment represented a rational means of correcting this inequity.</p>

Had the changes been made applicable only to claims filed after the effective date of the Act, claimants who were aware of the pending legislation would have been able to obtain an advantage over those who were not. By filing a claim before the Act became effective, such claimants could “lock in” the opportunity to seek a full 260 weeks of benefits for hearing loss that, under the new standards, would merit a shorter period of benefits. We cannot say that. the means chosen to avoid this potential windfall to some claimants was irrational.</p>

The appellants argue, and we agree, that the appellees' constitutional challenge to the statute is not a facial challenge. The Act can be said to have.a negative effect only as it is applied to some claimants—those who would have received 260 weeks of benefits for complete loss of - hearing under the "for all practical intents and purposes” standard but would receive benefits for a reduced period under Act 1. In the case of claimants who could show a percentage loss but not a complete loss of hearing for all practical intents and purposes, application of Act 1 <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>would have a positive effect. Such claimants would receive compensation for some period of time rather than being precluded from compensation entirely. In that situation, it be would the employers who would be adversely affected by retroactive application of the Act.</p>
      <p id="b603-8" data-blocks='[["BL_603.3",603,[221,2088,1121,314]]]'>The appellants are therefore correct in arguing that summary judgment in favor of the appellees was improper since resolution of the constitutional question in favor of any individual claimant depends upon a showing that the claimant would have prevailed under the old standard. Remand is unnecessary, however, because we determine that as a matter of law retroactive application of Act 1 was not unconstitutional and therefore the appellants are entitled to summary judgment in their favor.</p>
