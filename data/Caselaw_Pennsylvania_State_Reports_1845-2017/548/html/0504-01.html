Bulger, M.D., and his practice at Clays-burg Medical Associates, Inc. At that time, Dr. Bulger had obstetrical privileges at Nason Hospital but these privileges did not permit him to perform surgery at the hospital.</p>

She arrived at Nason Hospital at approximately noon and the nursing staff conducted an initial internal examination, which revealed that Welsh’s cervix was dilated five centimeters and that her membranes were intact. Dr. Bulger first examined Welsh at 7:55 p.m. and performed an amniotomy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which produced meconium stained fluid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He also placed an internal monitoring device on the fetus to monitor the fetal heart rate.</p>

The fetal monitoring device continued to show nonassuring variable deceleration patterns until approximately 9:38 p.m., when monitoring was discontinued.</p>
    <p id="b855-5" data-blocks='[["BL_855.4",855,[191,510,1153,623]]]'>At approximately 9:50 p.m., Welsh was transferred to the delivery room. Dr. Bulger vaginally delivered the child with forceps at approximately 10:35 p.m. Following the delivery, the child was dusky in color, was lacking in muscle tone, was without spontaneous respiration, and had a low heart rate. The child had Apgar scores of four at one minute after delivery and six at five minutes after delivery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> At approximately 11:25 p.m., the child was transferred to Altoona Hospital for additional care.

First, Welsh alleges that Nason Hospital is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of its staff in failing to monitor and to respond to an infant showing signs of fetal distress. Second, Welsh alleges that Nason Hospital is directly liable for its own negligence because it granted non-surgieai obstetrical privileges to Dr. Bulger without requiring a qualified surgeon to be available in case surgery was necessary and because its staff failed to notify the hospital that Welsh’s child needed a surgical delivery.</p>

Klavan, M.D., also concluded that the child’s injuries at birth resulted in the child’s death. Dr. Klavan explained that the presence of nonassuring variable deceleration patterns on the fetal monitoring readout indicated that the umbilical cord had become compressed and the fetus was not receiving sufficient blood flow. He opined that such a readout dictated that monitoring should not have been discontinued at 9:38 p.m. and that a surgical delivery, either vaginally or abdominally, should have been performed. Dr. Klavan concluded that “this infant’s permanent injuries relate to intrapartum asphyxia which would have been avoided had Dr. Bulger adhered to the accepted standards of obstetrical practice.”</p>

Bobbi Jo Welsh was a 16 year old prima gravida and her labor was progressing approximately normally for a prima gravida. By that estimate, it would have been at least two more hours before one would have expected delivery from the 20:30 hour time, which, of course, is what did happen. In fact, that is rather on the rapid side. The nurses must have known what was going on.

Dr. Warner also opined that the hospital’s failure to arrange for a cesarean section was a substantial factor in causing the harm to the deceased because if “the hospital had arranged for an appropriate cesarean section with the nurses’ input on this, there is every reason to believe that Kyle Allan Welsh would be an absolutely normal child today.” Therefore, Dr. Warner’s report is also sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>claim of corporate negligence against the hospital for failure to retain only competent physicians and for failure to formulate <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>and enforce policies to ensure quality care. <em>Thompson; Walls.</em>

    <p id="b862-8" data-blocks='[["BL_862.9",862,[276,871,1162,474]]]'>I concur with the majority’s holding that a plaintiff must present expert testimony in order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of corporate liability against a hospital pursuant to <em>Thompson v. Nason Hospital, </em><a href="/pa/527/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="591 A.2d 703" data-case-ids="1827759" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0330-01">527 Pa. 330</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="591 A.2d 703" data-case-ids="1827759" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0330-01">591 A.2d 703</a> (1991), unless the hospital’s negligence is obvious. I nevertheless dissent here because I believe that the plaintiff/appellant has failed to present sufficient expert evidence for purposes of surviving summary judgment on the corporate liability claims asserted against appellee, Nason Hospital.</p>
    <p id="b862-9" data-blocks='[["BL_862.10",862,[274,1369,1160,689]]]'>Initially, I note that like the majority, I believe that appellant suffered a tragic loss when her son died approximately eleven months after he was born. Also, I agree with the majority’s statement that experts are not required to use “magic words” when expressing their opinions. However, in order for appellant to defeat Nason Hospital’s motion for summary judgment, appellant must still produce a proper expert report to support her two claims of corporate liability. My review of appellant’s two corporate liability claims and her three expert reports leads me to the conclusion that appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to defeat Nason Hospital’s motion for summary judgment on either of the two claims of corporate liability.</p>
    <p id="b862-10" data-blocks='[["BL_862.11",862,[273,2083,1163,312]],["BL_863.1",863,[172,341,1154,517]]]'>Appellant first claims that when viewing her expert reports as a whole and in a light most favorable to her case, a material issue of fact exists as to her theory of negligence that Nason Hospital is corporately liable because its employees did not recognize and report the abnormalities in the delivery of appellant’s child to the hospital so that Nason Hospital could <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>have taken the appropriate action to prevent the harm suffered. A <em>prima facie </em>case for this claim of corporate liability involves a showing that a hospital employee had a duty to recognize and report abnormalities in the treatment of a patient, that the hospital employee should have informed the attending physician of the abnormality and that the hospital employee should have informed the hospital of the abnormality when the attending physician failed to act so that the hospital could have taken corrective action. <em>Thompson, </em>527 Pa. at 342-43, <a href="/pa/527/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="591 A.2d 703" data-case-ids="1827759" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0330-01">591 A.2d at 709</a>.</p>
    <p id="b863-5" data-blocks='[["BL_863.4",863,[169,884,1156,575]]]'>In this case, appellant presented three expert reports to support her theories of liability. The two expert reports of Warren E. Cohen, M.D. and Marshall Klaven, M.D. were not critical in any way of the hospital or its personnel for failing to obtain a surgical consult. However, the expert report of Dr. Warner stated that “the nurses must have known what was going on ... If Dr. Bulger had arranged for an appropriate cesarian section or the hospital had arranged for an appropriate cesarian section with the nurses’ input on this, there is every reason to believe that Kyle Allan Welsh would be an absolutely normal child today.”</p>
    <p id="b863-6" data-blocks='[["BL_863.5",863,[167,1483,1154,522]]]'>The majority here seizes upon the words that the “nurses should have known what was going on” to establish that the nurses had a duty to recognize the problem, inform Dr. Bulger of the problem and that they should have informed the hospital of Dr. Bulger’s failure to act so that the hospital could have arranged a cesarian section and avoided the injury. I believe that such a reading of appellant’s expert report strains itself beyond viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant in order to conclude that appellant’s expert report created a <em>prima facie </em>case of corporate liability.</p>

Because these omissions in appellant’s expert reports go beyond the mere failure to use “magic words,” I conclude that appellant, who bears the burden of proof at trial, has failed to produce evidence of facts essential as a matter of law to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of corporate negligence against Nason Hospital under <em>Thompson. </em>Accordingly, I would affirm the Superior Court’s order affirming the entry of summary judgement in favor of Nason Hospital based on this particular assertion of corporate negligence.</p>
    <p id="b864-5" data-blocks='[["BL_864.4",864,[273,1586,1161,797]],["BL_865.1",865,[196,335,1153,468]]]'>Appellant’s second claim is that her expert reports create a material issue of fact as to her theory that Nason Hospital is corporately liable for granting obstetrical privileges to Dr. Bulger without limiting the exercise of his privileges to circumstances where surgical expertise was readily available in the event that surgery was needed. Like the previous claim of corporate liability, the majority holds that a reading of Dr. Warner’s expert report in a light most favorable to appellant is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of corporate liability concerning the failure to limit Dr. Bulger’s obstetrical privileges to circumstances where surgical expertise was available in case of complications. In particular, the majority finds that Dr. Warner’s expert report, which stated that if “the hospital had arranged for an appropriate cesarian section with the nurses’ input on this, there is every reason to believe that <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>Kyle Allan Welsh would be an absolutely normal child today,” is sufficient to establish that the hospital had a duty to have a policy requiring a surgical consultant to be available where obstetrical privileges are limited and that the hospital’s failure to either have or follow such a policy resulted in the child’s death. Once again, I believe the majority strains itself beyond viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant in order to conclude that appellant presented sufficient expert evidence to support this theory of corporate liability.</p>
    <p id="b865-4" data-blocks='[["BL_865.4",865,[191,827,1159,1436]]]'>Here, the evidence clearly shows that Dr. Bulger was not qualified to perform surgery and that Nason Hospital did not grant Dr. Bulger surgical privileges. However, none of the expert evidence presented suggested that Nason Hospital was negligent in granting Dr. Bulger privileges because he was generally incompetent. Instead, the expert reports state that Dr. Bulger departed from acceptable medical practice by choosing not to undertake a surgical consult and a surgical delivery. Also, none of appellant’s expert reports set forth what standard of care Nason Hospital owed to its patients by not having another physician available to provide a consult, whether it was reasonable for a hospital to have such a policy in place requiring a physician with Dr. Bulger’s limited obstetrical privileges to consult with a surgeon about whether to perform a cesarian section and whether Nason Hospital should have known that such a policy was necessary to comply with a reasonable standard in conducting the hospital’s functions. Moreover, appellant’s expert reports, even when read in a light most favorable to appellant, fail to opine that the hospital’s failure to either have or to follow such a policy was the proximate cause of the injuries suffered. Thus, by these omissions in appellant’s expert reports, I conclude that appellant fails in her burden to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of corporate negligence against Nason Hospital. Therefore, I would also affirm the Superior Court’s order affirming the trial court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of Nason Hospital on this issue.</p>
    <p id="b865-5" data-blocks='[["BL_865.5",865,[193,2288,1151,96]],["BL_866.1",866,[264,339,1160,367]]]'>Accordingly, while I agree that expert testimony is necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of corporate liability <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>against a hospital, I believe that the expert testimony offered by appellant in this case was insufficient to defeat Nason Hospital’s motion for summary judgment. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent from the majority’s reversal of the Superi- or Court’s affirmance of the Blair County Court of Common Pleas order granting summary judgment in favor of Nason Hospital.</p>
