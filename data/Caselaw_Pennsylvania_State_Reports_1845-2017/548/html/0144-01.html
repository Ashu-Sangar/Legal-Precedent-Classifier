They have been involved in protracted litigation regarding the custody and support of their four children in the courts of Philadelphia County and Montgomery County, in Pennsylvania, and Kent County, Delaware. On August 18, 1994, Judge Allan Tereshko, Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, Family Court Division (Family Court) held a hearing on various petitions and motions filed by the parties. Appellant appeared <em>pro se, </em>and counsel represented Mrs. Franklin. After hearing testimony, the court made the following decisions: (1) granted Mrs. Franklin’s Petition for Special Relief seeking to enjoin the workers’ compensation carrier of Appellant’s former employer from disbursing any award of compensation to Appellant; (2) granted Mrs. Franklin’s Petition for Contempt based on Appellant’s failure to comply with the Family Court’s Order dated April 6, 1992, directing Appellant to pay $1,283.88 for Mrs. Franklin’s legal fees; (3) took under advisement Mrs. Franklin’s Petition for Additional Counsel Fees; (4) denied Appellant’s Motion for Recusal of Judge Tereshko; (5) denied Appellant’s Petition to Proceed <em>In For-ma Pauperis; </em>and (6) denied Appellant’s Petition to Rescind a Portion of the April 6,1992 Order.</p>

Appellant testified that he received the box and lid from the photocopying company that prepared his exhibits. Although he was aware that the word “DEATH” appeared on the lid when he received the box, he thought nothing of it. He had brought the box to court on previous occasions without incident.</p>

He did not know if the word “DEATH” was pointed in Mrs. Franklin’s direction because he did not set the box under the table. No witnesses testified that they noticed the word “DEATH” the lid of the box while the original hearing was taking place. When Appellant asked if he could open the box, the court recessed the proceedings so that a deputy sheriff could inspect the contents. When the hearing resumed, the deputy sheriff testified that the box contained briefs, petitions, other documents and a tape.</p>

At the conclusion of a hearing, Appellant left the courtroom leaving behind two boxes for his daughter to remove. The boxes were in the courtroom during the duration of the hearing. After a court staff member informed the trial judge that the word “DEATH” was written on the lid of one of the boxes, the judge reconvened the hearing to ask appellant about the box. Following testimony, the trial judge held appellant in criminal contempt. Madame Justice Newman, writing for the Majority, reverses the trial court’s determination, indicating “there is simply no evidence that Appellant intended to threaten the judge or anyone else by bringing the box lid into the courtroom.” Further, it appears the Majority is persuaded by statements made by appellant apologizing to the trial court and expressing regret <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>for the trial court misconstruing the meaning of the word “DEATH.”</p>

Although still on the bench, the judge did not hear the remark. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court determined the remark was made as a threat to the victim and found the defendant in criminal contempt. Madame Justice Newman, again writing for the Majority, affirmed the trial court holding that a statement directed to a victim as a threat, out of the ear-span of a trial judge physically present in the courtroom, was sufficient to establish criminal contempt.</p>

I fail to see how this written threat is any different from the threat uttered to the victim in <em>Falana. </em>In <em>Falana, </em>we reasoned, “Perhaps the best definition of [contemptuous conduct] is behavior that is inappropriate to the actor.” Falana at 129, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Garrison, </em><a href="/pa/478/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="478 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1740572" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0356-01">478 Pa. 356</a>, 372, <a href="/pa/478/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="478 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1740572" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0356-01">386 A.2d 971</a>, 979 (1978), and thus found that threatening the victim in a courtroom is inappropriate behavior. For apparent reasons, the word “Death” is intimidating, and is particularly unnerving to both a party involved in proceedings, as well as to a member of the judiciary and courtroom personnel.</p>
