Mr. Birch testified that he was sitting in the back of the courtroom, and that while the Appellant walked by the row where the victim was seated, he said, “I’ll be out one day.” The victim corroborated Mr. Birch’s testimony. Appellant, still represented by the attorney who represented him at trial, called his mother as a witness and she testified that the Appellant directed his statement to her, in response to a <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>question about when she could see him again.

Therefore, he argues that his words did not disrupt the proceedings, and accordingly he did not commit contempt. An obstruction of the administration of justice requires “a showing of actual, imminent prejudice to a fair proceeding or the preservation of the court’s authority.” <em>Garrison </em>at 372, <a href="/pa/478/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="478 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1740572" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0356-01">386 A.2d at 979</a>. By uttering a threat in the courtroom and in the presence of the judge, the Appellant indicated that his conviction and sentencing would not deter him from harming the victim. Through his words, he belittled the trial court’s attempt to administer justice and protect the person he had violently attacked. Furthermore, the fact that the Appellant threatened a witness who had just testified against him made it especially important that the court vindicate its authority by holding him in contempt. To have permitted the Appellant to use the courtroom to intimidate his victim, and thereby possibly deter others from testifying in the future, would clearly obstruct the efficient administration of justice and demean the court’s authority. Accordingly, we hold that threats made in a courtroom in the presence of a judge may constitute a sufficient basis for a finding of criminal contempt, even if the judicial proceeding has concluded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

We granted allocatur on the limited issue of whether the facts of this case provide a sufficient basis for a finding of contempt. Therefore, we do not reach the issue of whether similar conduct in the courtroom, in the presence of court officers, but not in the presence of the judge, may constitute contempt.</p>

As noted by the majority, 42 Pa.C.S. § 4132 limits a court’s contempt powers to cases of official misconduct of court officers, disobedience or neglect of or to the lawful process of the court, and misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice.</p>
