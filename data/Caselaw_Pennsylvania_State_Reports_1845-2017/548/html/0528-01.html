Ms. Miller’s estranged husband, Stephen Miller, was the father of her first child, Stephen Jr. Mr. Miller had arranged earlier that day to pick up Stephen Jr. at 7:00 p.m. for visitation. Hoping to avoid any conflict between her husband and Appellant, Ms. Miller asked Appellant to leave the premises until after Mr. Miller had departed. Appellant agreed and occupied himself at a local bar until 8:00 p.m. While at the bar, he consumed three to five beers and some whiskey. He then purchased two six-packs of beer and returned to Ms. Miller’s residence. He ate dinner with Ms. Miller and spent the evening watching television. During this time, Ryan slept on one of the couch cushions over which Ms. Miller had wrapped two blankets.</p>

At some point during the next several hours, she felt Ryan being lifted off of her.</p>

After learning that the call was for Appellant, she woke him up and inquired as to Ryan’s whereabouts. Appellant indicated that the child was on the couch, but Ms. Miller did not see him until she raised one of the blankets at the right end of the couch. She then found Ryan lying face down and not breathing.</p>

On direct examination, Dr. Ross testified that the child had died of cardiopulmonary arrest due to complications of asphyxia. <em>See </em>N.T. at 153. The asphyxia was caused by a combination of chest compression and suffo<a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>cation. <em>See id. </em>at 168. Further, Dr. Ross opined that the nature and position of certain marks on the child’s face indicated to him that the child had died while lying on its stomach, with a weight across its back and head such that the child’s mouth was pressed into a couch cushion near one edge and its nose, which was extended just over the edge of the cushion, was forced into the side of the cushion. <em>See id. </em>at 165-69.</p>
    <p id="b878-4" data-blocks='[["BL_878.4",878,[237,784,1161,895]]]'>Just after this, the Commonwealth asked Dr. Ross if a two month old child would be able, on its own, to maneuver his head into a position similar to the one Ross believed Ryan Miller had died in. Defense counsel objected, arguing that this was beyond Dr. Ross’s expertise. The objection was overruled, and Ross stated his belief that it was “extremely unlikely” that a two month old infant would be able, on its own, to move his head into the position in question. <em>Id. </em>at 173. The Commonwealth then asked Dr. Ross if, in his opinion, there would have to have been some “outside force” applied to the child’s body to create the facial marks he had described. After Ross answered in the affirmative, defense counsel again objected, arguing that the Commonwealth’s questions were beyond the scope of the involuntary manslaughter charge because they suggested that someone had intentionally put the child’s face between two of the couch cushions. This objection was overruled. <em>See id. </em>at 174-78.</p>
    <p id="b878-5" data-blocks='[["BL_878.5",878,[234,1705,1160,684]],["BL_879.1",879,[190,350,1153,203]]]'>Later, during cross-examination, Dr. Ross stated that in his opinion “somebody ... probably put their hand over the [child’s] back, put their hands on the back of the head, not in front of the face, and took the face and put it between the two cushions, and in that way suffocated [the child by] compressing the nose down in between and on one of the cushions.” <em>Id. </em>at 187. The Commonwealth then objected, arguing that Appellant was not indicted for an intentional killing, but that Ross’s statements on cross-examination were suggesting that conclusion. The trial court overruled the objection, concluding that the defense should be permitted to explore the area to rebut the testimony brought out on direct exam. <em>See id. </em>at 189. The defense then asked Dr. Ross if he thought someone <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>intentionally killed the child. Ross answered in the affirmative and stated that he believed that that was the case even though he knew Appellant had only been charged with involuntary manslaughter. <em>See id. </em>at 190.</p>
    <p id="b879-5" data-blocks='[["BL_879.4",879,[191,575,1152,302]]]'>At the close of Ross’s testimony, the defense requested that the testimony be stricken and that the jury be instructed to disregard it. The trial court granted this request, indicating that the jury would be instructed not to consider Dr. Ross’s opinion that the child’s death was the result of an intentional act. <em>See id. </em>at 221-22.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b879-6" data-blocks='[["BL_879.5",879,[189,907,1156,471]]]'>Defense counsel also requested a mistrial, arguing that the jury’s exposure to Dr. Ross’s testimony was unduly prejudicial. However, after a recess during which counsel conferred with Appellant at the court’s suggestion, Appellant indicated on the record that he was withdrawing the motion for mistrial. <em>See id. </em>at 223-25. Despite this, Appellant raised the issue in post-trial motions, alleging prosecutorial misconduct and/or trial court error in allowing the jury to hear the complained-of statements by Dr. Ross.</p>
    <p id="b879-7" data-blocks='[["BL_879.6",879,[191,1402,1154,409]]]'>The second error identified by Appellant concerns a conversation overheard by Sabrina Miller during a court recess. Ms. Miller heard two women outside the courtroom engage in a discussion concerning a prior case Appellant had been involved in: “one lady had said that she recognized [Appellant] from being in the paper with his charge that he’s serving for now. And the other woman had said that, yes, she was just thinking about that.” <em>Id. </em>at 231.</p>

During an in-chambers inquiry with prosecution and defense counsel present, Ms. Miller could provide no further information on the content of the conversation she had heard or on the women who were speaking. Although she “assumed” that the women were jurors, she was not positive. She stated that it was <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>“possible” that the women were simply observers in the courtroom. She could not recall whether either one was wearing a juror identification badge and she did not believe she would be able to identify either woman. <em>See id. </em>at 232-35.</p>
    <p id="b880-4" data-blocks='[["BL_880.4",880,[241,584,1159,626]]]'>The trial court offered to allow the defendant to voir dire the jury concerning the conversation and the jurors’ knowledge of it. After conferring with counsel, and despite the court’s indication that the matter would be waived if not addressed at that point, Appellant indicated with certainty that he wished to proceed “as is.” <em>Id. </em>at 243-45. Accordingly, the jury was not questioned, and the trial moved on. After his conviction, however, Appellant raised the issue in post-trial motions, where he alleged prosecutorial misconduct and claimed that the prosecution learned of the conversation the day before it was revealed to the trial court and to defense counsel.</p>

The entire claim is based on an assumption by Sabrina Miller. Ms. Miller could not positively identify the women as jurors, she simply “assumed” that they were. She then established the unreliability of this assumption by acknowledging that the women might have been nothing more than observers in the courtroom. Given this, any conclusion that Appellant’s claim of jury taint warrants the grant of a new trial would require this Court to engage in speculation.
