Inside, Appellant told Khadijah that he would shoot her if the police came. Khadijah testified that Appellant forced her to commit sexual acts. He also looked through Mrs. Majeed’s papers.

Although the statute does not define “licensed or privileged to enter,” the statutory defense to burglary does not depend on ownership. This distinction is illustrated in the context of a lease. The landlord, a legal owner of the property, grants possession to a tenant under a rental agreement that precludes the landlord from entering <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>the premises but for certain circumstances. Burglary may lie against a landlord who enters the leased premises with the intent to commit a crime therein. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Further, Mrs. Majeed and her children, alone, occupied the home. By Ms own admission, Appellant was living apart from his wife and children at the time of the PFA Order and burglary. Thus, Mrs. Majeed and her children were entitled to the exclusive right of possession against Appellant.

There is no indication in the record that he was prosecuted for indirect criminal contempt following his violation of the PFA Order. He argues, instead, that although a single course of conduct may constitute a violation of two statutory provisions, it does not follow that a violation of a PFA Order may create criminal culpability. According to Appellant, the Protection from Abuse Act was intended only to limit the <em>property </em>rights of an abuser, by excluding him from his home, not to limit his <em>liberty </em>interests, by subjecting him to a criminal prosecution based on a violation of a PFA Order. While indirect criminal contempt is the appropriate sanction for a violation of a PFA Order, 23 Pa.C.S. § 6114, allowing Appellant to escape liability for burglary would circumvent the purposes of the PFA Order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Here, Appellant voluntarily agreed to refrain from harassing his wife and children and from entering their home. Thus, the court, and the parties, specifically intended the PFA Order to protect Mrs. Majeed and her children from exactly the type of conduct Appellant committed. He forcibly entered the home with the intent to commit a crime or crimes therein. Moreover, his unlawful <em>entry facilitated </em>his harassment of Khadijah. If the only sanction for Appellant’s unlawful entry were an indirect criminal contempt, the purpose underlying the Protection from Abuse Act would be frustrated. Instead, application of the law of burglary (and the consequential restraint of liberty), under these circumstances, advances the purpose of the Protection from Abuse Act by discouraging domestic violence and unauthorized invasions of the home.</p>

The Texas burglary statute applicable in <em>Davis </em>defines "burglary'” as the entry of a habitation or building, without the consent of the owner, with the intent to commit a felony. V.T.C.A. Penal Code § 30.02(a). The statute defines "owner” as a person with title, possession, or a greater right to possession of the property. V.T.C.A. Penal Code § 1.07(a)(24). Thus, although the Texas statute differs from the Pennsylvania burglary statute, the principles articulated by the <em>Davis </em>court are germane to our discussion.</p>

That the PFA results from an agreement between private parties is of no significance to our analysis. Contrary to Appellant's assertion, a PFA is not merely an agreement between private parties in which the Commonwealth has no independent interest. A violation of a PFA is a violation of the law, a public wrong, punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both. 23 Pa.C.S. § 6114; <em>Commonwealth v. Atkins, </em><a href="/pa-super/422/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="422 Pa.

Because the Commonwealth has an interest in enforcing a PFA, Appellant’s contention that the Commonwealth is precluded from using a violation of the order to create an element of burglary is meritless.</p>
