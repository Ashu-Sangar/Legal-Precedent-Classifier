On June 22, 1993, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Moxham on the grounds that the Deficiency Judgment Act had no bearing on Moxham’s ability to liquidate the CD and to apply the proceeds to partially satisfy the outstanding debt remaining after the sheriffs sale of the real property pledged as collateral for the debt. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court reasoned that Moxham’s right to the CD arose out of a contract separate and distinct from the mortgage on the property securing the loan. Moreover, the trial court reasoned that the rights to the CD vested totally in Moxham on the date of default. Thus, the trial court found that the CD was no longer a personal asset of the Debtors at the time that the sheriffs sale occurred. Therefore, since the CD belonged to Moxham and it was not a personal asset of the Debtors, the trial court concluded that Moxham was free to liquidate the CD anytime after the loan default without having to comply with the provisions of the Deficiency Judgment Act.</p>

When the assignment documents for the CD were executed, Moxham became immediately vested in all of the Debtors rights in the CD. Also, since the loan Moxham extended constituted value and Moxham took the CD without notice of it being overdue or subject to any defenses, Moxham became a holder in due course of the CD. As such, the terms of the Assignment of Deposit gave Moxham the absolute right to enforce payment in its own name upon default. Therefore, the CD ceased being a personal asset of two of the Debtors after the Debtors defaulted on the loan secured by the CD. Accordingly, since the Deficiency Judgment Act is designed to protect a debtor’s personal assets and the CD was not a personal asset of the Debtors on the date of the sheriffs sale, the Deficiency Judgment Act does not apply to this situation and Moxham was free to liquidate the CD in accordance with the terms of the assignment agreement.</p>

In affirming the trial court, the majority found that in accordance with commercial paper division of the Uniform Commercial Code, 13 Pa.C.S. § 3101 <em>et seq,, </em>Moxham became a holder in due course of the CD. As a holder in due course, the majority reasoned that Moxham acquired all of Debtor’s rights in the CD upon execution of the assignment documents.
