      <em>See, e.g., </em>24 Pa.S. § 20-2002-A (1992) (establishing the State System of Higher Education and listing its constituent institutions); <em>see also Williams v. West Chester State College, </em><a href="/pa-commw/29/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="29 Pa.

Further, it was averred in Appellants’ Petition for Review filed with the Commonwealth Court, and admitted in the Answer, that Millersville is such an agency. <em>See </em>R.R. 15a, 56a.</p>
    <p id="b699-4" data-blocks='[["BL_699.4",699,[185,913,1154,852]]]'>However, although the Act states that “[e]very public record of an agency shall ... be open for examination and inspection,” 65 Pa.S. § 66.2 (1959), it is apparent that the information Appellants are asking Millersville to produce is not part of the university’s records. As found by Senior Judge Morgan, Millersville has no part in the ordering or selling of textbooks. The university neither solicits, compiles, nor retains information on course materials. <em>See </em>Commw. Ct. Memorandum Op., dated 5/12/95, at 3. Rather, this information is gathered and held by SSI, a non-profit organization legally distinct from the university itself. <em>See id. </em>at 2, 3. Thus, Appellants’ request that Millersville be compelled to produce this information must be denied. The Act does not authorize or contemplate a court order directing a state agency to compile and distribute information it did not solicit and does not possess.</p>

We disagree. SSI exists to provide students with services not furnished by the university, including the operation of the <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>bookstore and, <em>inter alia, </em>the maintenance of a pizza restaurant and game room. <em>See </em>R.R. at 396a. While SSI does receive certain services from the university, this assistance is paid for, either directly or through payment in kind. <em>See </em>R.R. at 382a-84a. And, as noted above, SSI is a self-sustaining corporation legally distinct from Millersville. <em>See </em>Commw. Ct. Memorandum Op., dated 5/12/95, at 2, 3; R.R. at 388a. In sum, the fact that SSI must work closely with the university in order to carry out its stated purposes does not, in our view, eliminate its status as an independent entity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
