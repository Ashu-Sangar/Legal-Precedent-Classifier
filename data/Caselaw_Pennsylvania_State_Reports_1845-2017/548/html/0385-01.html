Indeed, a judicial “ruling” that is not necessary to the decision of a case amounts to nothing more than mere obiter dictum. <em>Sproul v. Gambone, </em><a href="/f-supp/34/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="34 F. Supp. 441" data-case-ids="4190771" data-case-paths="/f-supp/34/0441-01">34 F.Supp. 441</a> (W.D.Pa.1940); <em>see also In re Estate of Cassell, </em><a href="/pa/334/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="334 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1190751" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0381-01">334 Pa. 381</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%2060" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="6 A.2d 60">6 A.2d 60</a> (1939). As this court reviews judgments or orders and not the reasons advanced by the lower courts in support of their judgments, <em>Millili v. Alan Wood Steel Co., </em><a href="/pa/418/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="418 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1896079" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0154-01">418 Pa. 154</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=209%20A.2d%20817" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="209 A.2d 817">209 A.2d 817</a>, (1965), and as the judgments of the lower courts are correct based upon the failure of the Township to comply with its own ordinance as the majority apparently concedes, <em>see </em>Majority op. at 259 n. 3, it is unnecessary to the decision of this case to reach the issue of the preemptive effect of the LTEA. As the ruling of the majority is not necessary to the decision of this <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>case, I consider it mere obiter dicta, and as such, I cannot join.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Therefore, I am constrained to concur in the result only.</p>
