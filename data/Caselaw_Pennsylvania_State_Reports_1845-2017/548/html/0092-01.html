In the fall of 1987, Met-Ed decided to have several of <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>its electrical substations painted. Appellant, Steven Takes (“Takes”), had thirty years experience as an industrial painter, including painting electrical powerstations.

Takes and his crew completed painting five of the substations and started to work on the Dock Street substation in Easton, Pa. Unbeknownst to Takes, the substation had been de-engerized except for a 4,800 volt capacitor which was not roped off nor were any warning signs posted. Takes climbed the capacitor’s structural housing and was painting it when an enormous electric shock knocked him off his perch, causing him to fall ten feet to the ground.</p>

Since neither negligence nor gross negligence can support an award for punitive damages, Met-Ed needed to bring this error to the attention of the tried court.</p>

It is necessary to emphasize that the central thrust of this action involves an issue of substantive rather than procedural waiver. If MetEd had simply failed to include the flawed punitive damages issue in its Post-Trial Motions, then the trial court could elect to disregard the waiver and the reviewing appellate court would be bound to do so as well. <em>American Association of Meat Processors v. Casualty Reciprocal Exchange, </em><a href="/pa/527/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="527 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1827735" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0059-01">527 Pa. 59</a>, 67, <a href="/pa/527/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="527 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1827735" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0059-01">588 A.2d 491</a>, 495 (1991). In <em>American </em>this Court clarified that the purpose of Pa.R.C.P 227.1 is to effect the waiver doctrine in <em>Dilliplaine, </em>to bring errors to the trial court's attention for correction. Yet, in this action Met-Ed’s counsel failed to bring the flawed charge to the attention of the trial court. The waiver did not result from a mere procedural rule violation but from a violation of the substantive law as contained in <em>Dilliplaine.</em>

In <em>James </em>and <em>Smith, </em>the lower courts chose to address issues on the merits simply because the trial court chose to do so, despite the fact that the issue was waived. However, in none of those cases did the deference provided implicate the <em>Dilliplaine </em>rule since the trial court decision was affirmed without creating the "dress rehearsal” problem sought to be avoided. In contrast, here the consequence of deference is a new trial, in direct conflict with the policy behind this Court's declaration in <em>Dilliplaine.</em>
