The Redland Plaintiffs allege that the Army’s disposal of hazardous materials at a site formerly part of the New Cumberland Army Depot (Depot) in south-central Pennsylvania caused them harm. They are seeking, among other things, a medical monitoring trust fund and attorney fees. The Court of Common Pleas of York County granted summary judgment in favor of the Army, and the Superior Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case for further proceedings.

From 1917 until sometime in the 1950’s, the Army used four to five acres of a fourteen-acre <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>tract in the southeastern comer of the Depot as a landfill to dispose of various kinds of waste.

Fairview Township employees converted the tract into Marsh Run Park (Park) by grading the site and adding a layer of topsoil. Soccer fields were placed in the Park, and Redland Soccer Club and its members used the fields for soccer practices and games from 1982 until 1987.</p>
    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[204,975,1153,469]]]'>The Army began environmental testing in the Park in April of 1987, as part of the Defense Environmental Restoration Program. After preliminary testing indicated that hazardous substances were present, the Army closed the Park in August of 1987. Further testing revealed that the Park was contaminated with numerous toxic materials, including volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, and metals. Subsequently, the Army began a program to remediate the contamination.</p>

Department of the Army, </em>No. 1:CV-90-1072 (M.D.Pa. Feb. 12, 1992). In a second Opinion, the District Court dismissed the HSCA medical monitoring claim without prejudice, holding that CERCLA, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 9613">42 U.S.C. § 9613</a>(h), prohibited it from exercising jurisdiction of that claim while a cleanup operation was ongoing. <em>Redland Soccer Club, Inc. v.

On April 21, 1994, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Army, holding that although HSCA permits a claim for medical monitoring, the Redland Plaintiffs failed to meet their <em>prima facie </em>burden under HSCA because they did not present sufficient evidence of exposure to the hazardous materials in the Park.

Section 6020.1115(b) provides that a court in a private citizen suit “may award litigation costs, including reasonable attorney and witness fees, to the prevailing or substantially prevailing party whenever the court determines such an award is appropriate.” 35 P.S. § 6020.1115(b). The Army, however, characterizes the Redland Plaintiffs’ suit as an action brought pursuant to section 6020.702. It argues that since the Redland Plaintiffs are seeking a medical monitoring <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>trust fund under section 6020.702, and that section does not specifically authorize attorney fees, then they cannot recover attorney fees.

Section 6020.702 specifies various categories of relief for which a defendant may be liable under HSCA. A plaintiff cannot bring a citizen suit under section 6020.702. Instead, a plaintiff must bring a citizen suit under section 6020.1115 and may seek the relief available to private plaintiffs included in section 6020.702, which, as previously discussed, encompasses a medical monitoring trust fund. Although section 6020.702 is silent concerning attorney fees, section 6020.1115(b) explicitly empowers a court to award attorney fees to the prevailing or substantially prevailing party if the court determines that such an award is appropriate. Thus, a plaintiff filing a citizen suit under section 6020.1115, seeking equitable relief in the form of a medical monitoring trust fund under section 6020.702, can also seek attorney fees under section 6020.1115.</p>
