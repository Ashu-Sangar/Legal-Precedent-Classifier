After meeting with counsel, the attorney informed the court that he was responsible for forging the judge’s name. We noted that the attorney acted dishonestly by committing forgery and lying to the court, and that his “conduct demonstrates a callous disregard for the very integrity of the judicial process and calls for the most severe sanction.” <em><a href="/pa/533/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="533 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1837546" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0078-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/533/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="533 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1837546" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0078-01">at 83</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="533 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1837546" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0078-01">619 A.2d at 1056</a>. In the instant matter, the Board determined that the Respondent’s behavior was more egregious than Holston’s because it involved a course of dishonest conduct rather than an isolated incident.

At the disciplinary hearing, the Respondent testified that the reason he inflated his clients’ incomes on loan applications was to assist members of the Korean community to obtain loans.

Accordingly, I must dissent as I believe that the five-year suspension is far too lenient. Instead, I believe that respondent should be disbarred because his conduct clearly demonstrates an unfitness to practice law.</p>
