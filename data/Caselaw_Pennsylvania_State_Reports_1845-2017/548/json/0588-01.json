        "text": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nFollowing trial by jury in Cumberland County, Thomas Lawson was found guilty of violating the Controlled Substance, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), for having delivered 7.5 grams of cocaine to an undercover officer of the Harrisburg Police Department who was working with agents from the Bureau of Narcotics Investigation and Drug Control of the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The sole issue in this appeal concerns the authority under which the attorney who prosecuted the case acted.\nAt all relevant times, Shawn Wagner, the attorney representing the Commonwealth in this case, was employed as a deputy attorney general in the Harrisburg regional office of the Attorney General\u2019s Drug Strike Force, Legal Services Section. He had previously been employed as an assistant district attorney in Cumberland County. District Attorney J. Michael Eakin testified that when none of his assistant district attorneys was available to attend the preliminary hearing in this case, rather than seek postponement of the hearing he asked Wagner to take over the prosecution of the case. To this end, he submitted a Personnel Action Form to the Cumberland County Personnel Office appointing Wagner as a \u201cSpecial Assistant District Attorney (Unpaid)\u201d for this case, and filed on the Miscellaneous Docket of the common pleas court a document captioned \u201cAppointment of Assistant District Attorney.\u201d\nEakin also testified that he consulted with Wagner\u2019s supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Eric Noonan, before formalizing the appointment, to verify that Wagner would be reporting to Eakin and not the Attorney General\u2019s Office with respect to prosecution of this case. Noonan testified similarly that it was understood that for purposes of this assignment Wagner answered to the District Attorney.\nIn his Omnibus Pretrial Motion, Lawson included a \u201cMotion to Compel Removal of the Attorney General or Any Agent Thereof.\u201d The common pleas court denied this motion, finding\nthat Eakin appointed Wagner as a Special Assistant District Attorney for Cumberland County, and that Wagner did not prosecute this matter as an Attorney General. First, Eakin never relinquished his authority to prosecute this case. Second, Wagner was under the District Attorney\u2019s direction and supervision as Eakin made all important strategic and tactical decisions concerning the prosecution.\nOpinion at 5. The court found the appointment to be \u201cin accordance with our County Code,\u201d citing to 16 P.S. \u00a7 1420. It distinguished Commonwealth v. Khorey, 521 Pa. 1, 555 A.2d 100 (1989), where the District Attorney relinquished his power over the prosecution to the Attorney General pursuant to a request under the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-205(a)(3). In Khorey, said the court, the Commonwealth Attorneys Act was invoked and violated, because none of the conditions for a District Attorney to relinquish his authority was apparent on the record. In this case, the court held, the Act was neither invoked nor violated because Wagner did not prosecute the matter as an Attorney General.\nSuperior Court likewise observed that the District Attorney here\ndid not invoke the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, which delineates in what instances the attorney general may prosecute county criminal actions, but rather relied on the authority set forth in 16 Pa.C.S. [sic] \u00a7 1420, Assistant District Attorney; Number; Compensation, granting the district attorney the power to appoint assistant district attorneys or special assistant district attorneys to assist him in his duties.\n442 Pa.Super. at 102-03, 658 A.2d at 804. Quoting our analysis of the Commonwealth Attorneys Act in the appeal of Commonwealth v. Trputec, which was consolidated for decision with Khorey, the court identified the following as \u201ccritical for disposition of the issue in this case,\u201d 442 Pa.Super. at 102, 658 A.2d at 803:\nThe delegation of authority from a district attorney to a deputy district attorney is characterized by a different relationship than would be a \u201cdelegation\u201d of authority to the attorney general. While a district attorney has control over deputy or assistant district attorneys because they are subordinates, such would not be the case with the attorney general, who would not be subject to the same supervision. In the absence of such control, the attorney general cannot be said to be a mere agent of the district attorney.\n521 Pa. at 19-20, 555 A.2d at 110.\nThe lower courts essentially reasoned that anyone licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth may be employed as a special assistant, and the Commonwealth Attorneys Act is not implicated when a deputy attorney general acts in that capacity because it is the district attorney rather than the Attorney General who controls the litigation. The appellees echo this same analysis in their briefs.\nThe flaw in this analysis is the expansive interpretation of the district attorney\u2019s authority to appoint assistants under Section 1420 of the County Code, Act of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, \u00a7 1420, 16 P.S. \u00a7 1420. That section cannot be read in isolation from the other provisions with which it appears in part (b) of Article XIV of the County Code.\nSection 1421 provides for the designation of a first assistant when more than one assistant district attorney is appointed, and for the devolution of duties from the district attorney to first assistant and further where necessary. Section 1422 allows the appointment of special assistants, in seventh and eighth class counties, and in sixth class counties \u201cwherever no regular assistant district attorney has been appointed under [Section 1420] ... to aid in the preparation and trial of any indictment for homicide or murder....\u201d\nSection 1423 provides a further circumstance where an interim appointment is authorized: where there is no regular assistant and the district attorney is unable to attend to his duties, he may appoint a deputy for a term of court but no longer. Finally, Section 1424 authorizes the court to appoint a \u201cdistrict attorney for the time being\u201d when the district attorney and his assistants are absent. Such an appointment is effective \u201cuntil the regular district attorney or one of his assistants shall appear in person\u201d to perform their duties.\nThese provisions, especially Sections 1422 and 1423, are significant for two reasons. First, they clearly indicate that appointments under Section 1420 are \u201cregular\u201d positions, not transient assignments or appointments for a particular case. Section 1420, then, does not provide authority for the appointment of Wagner in this case.\nSecond, they demonstrate that the legislature was cognizant of and provided for particular circumstances where a district attorney might need such temporary additional help. In Section 1422, those circumstances are limited to homicide and murder prosecutions. Even then, a special assistant may be appointed only in the smallest counties, where regular assistant district attorneys are either not authorized or have not been appointed. Section 1423 is applicable only where there is no regularly appointed assistant and the district attorney is unavailable due to sickness or other cause.\nBecause this was a prosecution involving a drug offense, in a county of the fourth class, and there were regularly appointed assistant district attorneys in the county, neither of these sections provides authority for Wagner\u2019s appointment.\nThe district attorney, and the Attorney General as amicus curiae, point out that deputy attorneys general serving as special assistants in this fashion is a practice that has been used in a number of cases around the Commonwealth. They argue that cooperation of this sort between local and state agencies should be encouraged, and that district attorneys should be recognized as having the authority to enlist the aid of qualified individuals whom they know and trust in furtherance of their duties.\nThese policy arguments are better directed to the legislature than to this Court. Although there is no impediment to a district attorney\u2019s consulting with other attorneys regarding particular cases or his duties in general, the General Assembly by law has limited the situations in which other attorneys may be employed to actually perform those duties. Cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Shumaker v. New York & Pennsylvania Co., Inc., 378 Pa. 359, 106 A.2d 239 (1954).\nIn the Trputec appeal, where the case was prosecuted by an attorney without proper authority under the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, Superior Court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded for a new trial, 363 Pa.Super. at 247, 525 A.2d at 811, and our Court affirmed, 521 Pa. at 20-21, 555 A.2d at 110. We find the same result appropriate in this case, which was prosecuted by an attorney without proper authority under the County Code.\nAccordingly, the judgment of sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the court of common pleas for a new trial.\nNIX, Former C.J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nNEWMAN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which CASTILLE, J., joins.",

        "text": "NEWMAN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe Majority holds that District Attorney J. Michael Eakin lacked authority to appoint Deputy Attorney General Shawn C. Wagner as a Special Assistant District Attorney for the purpose of prosecuting this drug case. Because the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-101, et seq. (the Act), does not prohibit the appointment, and the District Attorney acted within his statutory authority pursuant to 16 P.S. \u00a7 1420 in making the appointment, I must respectfully dissent.\nThe Act lists specific categories of circumstances where the Attorney General may prosecute cases in the county criminal courts and prohibits the Attorney General from prosecuting under circumstances not expressly enumerated in the Act. Commonwealth v. Khorey, 521 Pa. 1, 555 A.2d 100 (1989). All parties agree that the Attorney General did not have authority under the Act to prosecute this case. The Attorney General\u2019s authority to prosecute this case, however, is irrelevant because the District Attorney of Cumberland County, not the Attorney General, prosecuted the case. The Superior Court aptly noted this important distinction as follows:\nThe record establishes the Cumberland County District Attorney appointed Deputy Attorney General Shawn C. Wagner as a Special Assistant District Attorney for Cumberland County to prosecute defendant\u2019s case. The Cumberland County District Attorney did not invoke the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, which delineates in what instances the attorney general may prosecute county criminal actions, but rather relied on the authority set forth in 16 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1420, Assistant District Attorney; Number; Compensation, granting the district attorney the power to appoint assistant district attorneys or special assistant district attorneys to assist him in his duties.\nCommonwealth v. Lawson, 442 Pa.Super. 98, 102-03, 658 A.2d 801, 804 (1995). Moreover, the trial court specifically found that Wagner prosecuted this case in his capacity as Special Assistant District Attorney rather than as Deputy Attorney General. The trial court stated:\nWe find that Eakin appointed Wagner as a Special Assistant District Attorney for Cumberland County, and that Wagner did not prosecute this matter as an Attorney General. First, Eakin never relinquished his authority to prosecute this case. Second, Wagner was under the District Attorney\u2019s direction and supervision as Eakin made all important strategic and tactical decisions concerning the prosecution. [S]ince Wagner did not prosecute this matter as an Attorney General, the Act was never invoked, nor violated.\nTrial Court slip. op. at 5-6.\nThe Majority tacitly concedes that there was no violation of the Act here. Instead of contesting this point, the Majority focuses on the District Attorney\u2019s authority to appoint assistants pursuant to 16 P.S. \u00a7 1420 and concludes that the District Attorney had no authority to appoint Wagner as a Special Assistant District Attorney. Rather than examining the language of Section 1420, the Majority has decided to concentrate its analysis on Sections 1421, 1422 and 1423 because Section 1420 \u201ccannot be read in isolation from the other provisions with which it appears in part (b) of Article XIV of the County Code.\u201d Majority op. at 1248. None of those sections, however, expressly or impliedly limits the authority granted in Section 1420. Therefore, I believe the Majority has- erred by disregarding the letter of Section 1420 under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nThe proper focus of the inquiry should be on the plain language of Section 1420, which is the only section the District Attorney has invoked. Section 1420 provides as follows:\n\u00a7 1420. Assistant district attorneys; number; compensation\nThe district attorney may appoint such number of assistants, learned in the law, to assist him in the discharge of his duties, as is fixed by the salary board of the county. The salary board shall fix the salary of such assistants.\n16 P.S. \u00a7 1420. Thus, Section 1420 gives a district attorney broad authority to appoint assistants, requiring only that the assistants be learned in the law and approved by the salary board. If the legislature desired to place greater limits on the power of district attorneys to appoint assistants, it would surely have done so.\nHere, Wagner is clearly capable to practice law and the Salary Board of Cumberland County approved his appointment. Because District Attorney Eakin fully complied with 16 P.S. \u00a7 1420 when he appointed Wagner as Special Assistant District Attorney, Wagner\u2019s prosecution of Lawson was proper. Accordingly, I would affirm the Order of the Superior Court.\nCASTILLE, J., joins this dissenting opinion.",
