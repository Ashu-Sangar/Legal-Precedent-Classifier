See Commonwealth v. Ahlborn, 548 Pa. 544, 699 A.2d 718 (1997).\nMcGuire filed a pro se PCRA petition on October 6, 1989, and an amended petition was subsequently filed by appointed counsel. A hearing on the petition was held on August 31, 1993. On April 1, 1994, McGuire was fully discharged upon the expiration of his parole. On May 18, 1994, the PCRA petition was denied.",
