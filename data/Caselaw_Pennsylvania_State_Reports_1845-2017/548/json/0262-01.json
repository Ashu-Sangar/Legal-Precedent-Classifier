        "text": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis case involves a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for loss of hearing filed in September of 1992. The workers\u2019 compensation judge denied benefits, finding that the claimant had not proven loss of hearing for all practical intents and purposes. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed. While the claimant\u2019s appeal was pending in Commonwealth Court, the legislature amended the hearing loss provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The issue presented here is whether these changes are applicable to this claim. We hold that they are and remand for further proceedings.\nAt the time the claim was filed in this case, Section 306(c) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the \u201cspecific loss\u201d section, established benefits for \u201ccomplete loss of hearing\u201d: two-thirds of wages for two hundred sixty weeks in the case of complete loss of hearing in both ears and for sixty weeks in the case of complete loss of hearing in one ear. By case law, \u201ccomplete\u201d loss of hearing was interpreted not literally but as complete \u201cfor all practical intents and purposes.\u201d\nAct 1 of 1995 amended this section to provide benefits for permanent partial hearing loss, indexing the duration of benefits to the percentage loss as measured by audiogram tests. In section 3(2) of Act 1 the legislature provided that these changes \u201cshall apply retroactively to all claims existing as of the effective date of this act for which compensation has not been paid or awarded.\u201d In Bible v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Labor and Industry, 548 Pa. 247, 696 A.2d 1149, filed this same day, we held that this retroactive application was not unconstitutional as an impairment of contract or violation of due process.\nBy its terms, the retroactivity provision makes Act 1 of 1995 applicable: compensation had not been paid or awarded at the time the Act became effective. Indeed, the parties agree that the claim falls within the language of Section 3(2). The employer\u2019s only argument is that the claimant waived the issue by failing to raise it while his appeal was pending in Commonwealth Court.\nAct 1 became effective on February 23, 1995, the day after the claimant had filed his Commonwealth Court brief. The employer notes that the claimant failed to bring the Act to the court\u2019s attention pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2501 during the three months that the court had the matter under consideration. Rather, the applicability of the Act was first raised in the claimant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal. The employer argues that under the waiver doctrine we should not consider the issue because it could have been but was not first presented to the lower court.\nUnder the circumstances of this ease, we do not believe strict application of the waiver analysis is appropriate. Although the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision affirming the denial of benefits on the record before it cannot be characterized as error, it was the manifest intention of the General Assembly that the changes to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act be applied to existing claims \u201cfor which compensation has not been paid or awarded,\u201d which this concededly is.\nThe Order of the Commonwealth Court is vacated and the matter is remanded to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board for further proceedings.\nNIX, Former C.J., and NEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.",
