A mill-yard connected with a sawmill, near the centre of the tract, containing some two acres, was reserved from mining operations. Plaintiff drilled wells on lands adjoining the mill-yard lot. Defendant acquired the title of the lessor and' then conveyed his interest in the mill-yard lot to Hue et al., for oil mining purposes, and the latter drilled three wells on the lot in the spring of 1886.

The evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses as to the value of his leasehold estate was visionary, speculative and unsatisfactory. In fact the evidence of the plaintiff and one of his principal witnesses finally agreed with the defendant’s theory that the usual method of fixing the market value of a producing leasehold upon which there were no other locations for drilling was to ascertain the daily production, and that this was worth from three hundred and fifty to six hundred dollars per barrel.

I have resided in the oil regions' since the Drake well was drilled, and my observation and experience is such that, in my judgment, the evidence of two intelligent witnesses that the wells on the mill-yard did reduce the market value of the plaintiff’s leasehold about one fourth, far outweighs the testimony of many witnesses to the contrary.</p>
