The report of viewers laying out the road, filed Dec. 11, 1886, stated among other things that “ no one appeared and claimed damages, we have assessed no damages ; ” also that “ before the said view, public notice of the time and place of meeting of the viewers was given by advertisement put up according to law at the most public places in the vicinity, ten days before said meeting.” The report was confirmed absolutely at March Sessions, 1887.

We think his order, however, was too broad. While it was entirely proper to set aside the report of the jurors for the reason that they made no effort to obtain releases of damages from the property owners, we see no reason why the entire proceeding should have been dismissed. The petition was in proper form, and the fact that the report of the viewers did not comply with the requisites of the law is no reason why another view may not be had upon the same petition.</p>
