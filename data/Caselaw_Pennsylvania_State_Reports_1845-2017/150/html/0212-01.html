Inasmuch as the election of the widow takes away half of the present fund for distribution, and the total of the legacies is far beyond the amount of the remaining half, they cannot be fully paid out of this fund. The disappointed devisees would in this way be ruled out of this distribution. This is the executor’s first account. There are yet personal assets in his hands, and also real estate, which is available, if necessary, to satisfy the claims of those whose rights are superior to the residuary legatees. But even as to these the devisees would be dependent on the contingency of there being a surplus above the legacies on the view taken by the legatees.</p>

The doctrine of our later Pennsylvania cases is, that the abatement of devises and legacies is always a question of intention to be gathered from the will. And this, we think, applies as well to abatement among each other as for the payment of debts: Hallowell’s Estate, <a href="/pa/23/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="23 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="974070" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0223-01">23 Pa. 223</a> ; Sandoe’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=65%20Pa.%20316" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="65 Pa. 316">65 Pa. 316</a> ; Grim’s Ap., <a href="/pa/89/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="89 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1063221" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0333-01">89 Pa. 333</a>.</p>

They are all simply general pecuniary legacies, and there is nothing to show that the testator meant any more certainly that they should take without abatement, than that the devisees should take without encumbrance; hence the general rule must prevail.</p>

No more, however, is claimed for the devisees than that, to the extent of their just demand for relief, they shall he permitted to come in upon this fund <em>pro rata </em>with the legacies. In deciding upon the method to be employed to work out the equity of the devisees, the auditor has been unable to get help from any of the cases. It would seem that either of two methods could be employed. Mrs. Evans, the widow, is sixty-four years of age. The natural expectation of her life might be taken and a gross sum equal to the supposed future payment of dower to be made by the devisees on this basis might be awarded them. This, however, would, in the nature of the case, be more or less contingent and speculative. It seems to the auditor that it would be more equitable to all parties interested in the matter that a fund should be set apart, to remain in the executor’s hands, such as, at the ruling rate of interest, would produce the amount paid out as dower,—the income of such fund to be paid to the devisees in proportion to dower paid by them, and the arrangement to continue until further or otherwise ordered by the court. This fund would at all times be under the control of the court, and could be so handled as to work out the equities of the case; and by this plan it would seem that exact justice could be done to all parties in interest. It will, therefore, be adopted.</p>

The amount thus due up to the present time could be definitely ascertained, and, following the principle adopted as to the rest of their claim, a dividend on this sum, pro raía with the legatees, out of the present fund, awarded them; leaving the rest to be made up in future distributions. In strictness, this would be their right now. Inasmuch, however, as it is impossible to foretell exactly when this present distribution, if confirmed, will actually be made, and hence to ascertain the precise period at which the benefits from the fund directed to be invested for these devisees will begin to come, there would still remain a period, running from the present time up to that time, to be provided for in the next distribution. . Since this question would, therefore, in any event, have to come up again, we think it better, as a matter of convenience, to leave the whole subject to be disposed of at <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>that time, when the amount due them can be precisely ascertained.

    <p id="b244-7" data-blocks='[["BL_244.9",244,[263,804,1167,497]]]'>It is the settled rule in Pennsylvania that where a wife elects to take against her husband’s will, equity executes the substituted devises and bequests to the wife as a trust in her for the benefit of the disappointed claimants to the amount of their interest therein, and the court will assume jurisdiction to sequester the benefit intended for the refusing wife in order to secure compensation to those whom her election disappoints: Sandoe’s Ap., <a href="/pa/65/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="65 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="430671" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0314-01">65 Pa. 314</a>; Gallagher’s Ap., <a href="/pa/76/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="76 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="1038851" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0296-01">76 Pa. 296</a>; Young’s Ap., 108 Id. 17; Ferguson’s Est., 138 Id. 208; Batione’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="136 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="819992" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0307-01">136 Pa. 307</a>.</p>
    <p id="b244-8" data-blocks='[["BL_244.10",244,[263,1314,1168,855]]]'>This was precisely what was done, as we understand it, by the learned auditor and court below. The testator died August 28, 1889, leaving a widow but no lineal descendants. By his will he gave to his widow his household furniture, horses, carriages, etc., $2,500, absolutely, his dwelling-house and the income of $50,000 for life. Pie gave a large number of pecuniary legacies which he directed to be paid within one year after his decease. He then devised three farms to his brother, John James Evans, for life, with remainder to the four daughters of said brother. He also devised -three farms to his brother, William Watson Evans, for life, with remainder to his three daughters. He also devised a farm, to his nephew, Robert A. Evans, and another to a grand-nephew. These devises are also for life, with remainders over. He then gave all the rest, residue and remainder of his estate, of every kind, to his brother, John J. Evans, and his sister, Clementina E. Locher, their heirs and assigns, as tenants in common in equal shares.</p>

    <p id="b245-8" data-blocks='[["BL_245.8",245,[140,708,1165,390]]]'>The amount for distribution in the present account was $109,538.90. Of this sum the auditor awarded to the widow $54,769.45, leaving for distribution among the legatees, $54,769.45. Of this latter sum the auditor set apart the sum of $21,240, which he directed to be invested, and the income thereof paid to the respective devisees, whose lands had been charged with dower, until further ordered by the orphans’ court.</p>
    <p id="b245-9" data-blocks='[["BL_245.9",245,[144,1118,1163,338]]]'>It was contended by the appellant that the proceedings in the orphans’ court were invalid, and that in any event the action of the auditor, and the court below, in relief of the devisees on whose land the dower was charged, was premature ; it being alleged that this was but a partial account, and that these equities should have been arranged upon the final settlement of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b245-10" data-blocks='[["BL_245.10",245,[145,1475,1164,238]]]'>In regard to the first objection, it is sufficient to say that the proceedings in the orphans’ court, by which the dower was assigned, are not before us. We cannot, in a collateral proceeding, review a decision of that court from which no appeal has ever been taken.</p>
    <p id="b245-11" data-blocks='[["BL_245.11",245,[140,1731,1171,695]],["BL_246.1",246,[271,411,1159,402]]]'>Nor do we think the order complained of was prematurely made. The election of thé widow to take against the will creates an actual, present disappointment on the part of the devisees. The lands which they take under the will are actually charged with the dower. At present there is no disappointment on the part of the legatees. There may or there may not be such disappointment upon the final settlement of the estate. Should there be, the orphans’ court, in the exercise of its equity powers, can readjust the distribution of the estate so as to do exact equity to all parties concerned. It will be observed that the order complained of is made only until the further order of the court. It is obvious that had not this sum of $21,240 been set apart now, a state of facts might exist at the final settlement of the estate which would render the court <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>powerless to protect the devisees. For if this sum were now distributed to the legatees, and no further assets come into the hands of the executors, no order could be made in relief of the devisees. If, upon final settlement, the legatees should be disappointed, it will be the duty of the court below to adjust the equities between them and the devisees in such manner that each shall bear his proper proportion of the loss, and no more. We will not now anticipate what may never come to pass.</p>
