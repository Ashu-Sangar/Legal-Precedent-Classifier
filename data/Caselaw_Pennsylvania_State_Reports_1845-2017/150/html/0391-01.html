It was a mere proposition or offer in which the name of the purchaser was not disclosed. Had the defendants accepted the proposition upon the terms proposed, or had accepted the purchaser upon modified terms, it is possible, under the authority of Kees v. Johnson, supra, the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover. Be this as it may, it is clear from the evidence that he did not procure Mr. Doty, either as a purchaser or bidder. The evidence is uncontradicted that Mr. Doty had been in treaty for the property with the defendants themselves for several months prior to this transaction, at one time offering $300,000 and at another $250,000. The latter offer was made upon the same day as the proposition of the plaintiff, but varying somewhat in its terms. It appears that a Mr. Alexander, a telegraph operator at Bedford, had in some way become aware that Mr. Doty was in treaty for the property. Acting upon this information, he informed the plaintiff on Saturday morning, the 13th of August, that he could find a purchaser, without, however, according to the evidence, informing the plaintiff that Mr. Doty was the person. The plaintiff thereupon agreed with Alexander to allow him $1,000 out of the commissions for his services. This was upon a Saturday. Upon the following Monday evening the plaintiff made to the defendants the proposition referred to. The plaintiff alleged and so testified that at the time the proposition was made he had no knowledge that Doty was in treaty with the defendants. We must assume this to be so, at the. same time we regard it as a striking coincidence. It is not material whether or not he had such knowledge. Assuming that the defendants should have accepted the offer, it is clear the plaintiff did not bring them together. He rendered them no service by bringing <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>them a proposition from a man who had. been negotiating with them since the preceding February. Hence, the good faith of the offer is immaterial and the want of it could harm no one but the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[294,614,1160,246]]]'>This view of the case renders it unnecessary to discuss the question, whether the defendants, under the terms of the agreement with plaintiff, would have been entitled to insist upon a cash offer. We are of opinion that the plaintiff had no case, and that it was not error to so instruct the jury.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.6",422,[337,869,356,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
