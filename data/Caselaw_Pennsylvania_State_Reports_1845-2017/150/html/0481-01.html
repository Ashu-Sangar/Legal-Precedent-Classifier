On the trial before Willson, J., the evidence was to the following effect: Defendants were dealers in sugar in Cuba. Perkins &amp; Welsh, in New York, were their general factors. Plaintiffs were manufacturers of sugar in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1889, defendants sold plaintiffs through Perkins &amp; Welsh, property described as “about twenty-five hundred tons of sugar.” Sugar advanced soon after a cent and a half a pound. Deliveries were made which were paid for, except $1,830.48. This mipaid balance was the difference between the estimated and the actual weight delivered on the Wylo’s cargo. Then a dispute arose as to whether the deliveries were in compliance with the contract in respect of quantity. Defendants contended that, under a usage that defines the meaning of the word “ about,”- they had an option to deliver only ninety per cent .of the quantity named in the contract. After some correspondence they informed plaintiffs, through Perkins &amp; Welsh, that they would send seventy tons to complete the delivery. This quantity was the exact shortage if their view of the meaning of the word “ about ” was correct; if it was not, the shortage was three hundred and twenty tons. At the time they sent the seventy tons, by the brig Sagua, they instructed Perkins &amp; Welsh not to deliver the bill of lading unless plaintiffs accepted a draft from Perkins &amp; Welsh for the balance due on the sugar delivered, and the price of the seventy tons delivered. The seventy tons were shipped invoiced to plaintiffs but the hill of lading was indorsed to Perkins &amp; Welsh or order. They offered to deliver this on compliance with the conditions exacted by defendants but plaintiffs refused to make the payment, and began suit by foreign attachment, under which they seized the seventy tons <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>on board the brig Sagua, and also the balance in their own hands. Perkins &amp; Welsh claimed the property attached on a general lien, for advances made from time to tiriie, on all sugars sent and on all the proceeds of sugar sold. The advances theretofore made exceeded the value of the property attached.</p>

Biller, L. R. 25 Ch. Div. 31. A consignment of goods to fill sales already made is consistent with a lien on the goods, where delivery was not to be made until payment. Delivery to appellants would have shifted the' lien from the sugar to the price. Appellees would have been in the position of a banker who cashes a draft accompanied by a bill of lading of goods to order, indorsed to him, where such goods are forwarded to fill a contract with the person on whom the draft is drawn. The goods need not be delivered until acceptance of draft; until then he has a lien. Though the original advances here were general, after the promise that they should be secured by the sugar shipments had been performed, the lien became special. The goods were sent under the contract to pay advances, or they would not have been sent to appellees, or the purchase money would have <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>been directed to be paid to themselves rather than to appellees. The cases to the effect that right to receive proceeds of sale of goods does not confer right to lien thereon, are where right to receive proceeds was in one person and the possession and title were in another.</p>

The agreement is inconsistent with a lien. So here the bill of lading states that the goods are shipped at plaintiff’s risk, the invoice is to plaintiff, and the letter of instructions states that they are delivered to fulfill the contract with them under the letter of August, 1889, the sugar is to be delivered to plaintiff, the molasses to be sold; the lien is confined to the molasses or its proceeds.

This would have been in accordance with the general arrangement or mode of business between Perkins &amp; Welsh and Mora, Ona &amp; Co. The proceeds of the accepted draft would not have gone to Mora, Ona &amp; Co. at all, and there was nothing, as we understand, in the letter of August, 1889, from Mora, Ona &amp; Co., to Perkins &amp; Welsh, taking the cargo of the Sagua out of the operation of the contracts for the (about) 1500 tons and 1000 tons respectively so far as tlie subject of the present contention is concerned. The seventy tons shipped by the Sagua were. <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>as Mora, Ona &amp; Co. claimed, the whole of the remainder of the sugar they were bound to deliver under the original contracts. The plaintiffs claimed they were entitled not only to the seventy tons but to damages for non-delivery of the full amount of the 2500 tons. The mode, of settlement and payment for the whole quantity of sugar to be shipped was to be the same for all. At the conclusion of the letter of March 2, 1889, from Perkins &amp; Welsh to Harrison, Frazier &amp; Co., which contained the terms of the contract for the 1000 tons, it was stipulated as follows: “ payment to be made against documents as heretofore in similar cases.” We can see nothing in any of the letters which changes, as to the cargo of the Sagua, the terms of the contract or the usual course of dealing between Perkins &amp; Welsh and Mora, Ona &amp; Co. The language of the letter of August, 1889, from Mora, Ona &amp; Co. to Perkins &amp; Welsh, to wit: “The Muscos per Brig Sagua complete our contract with Harrison, Frazier &amp; Co.,” was the mere announcement of the fact as they understood, and clearly did not indicate, either directly or inferentially, any change in the course of dealing between them. The remainder of the letter related to another subject. It is argued for the appellants that this letter and the one of July 17th, from and to the same parties, show that there was an intention on the part of Mora, Ona &amp; Co. to give a lien only on the price and therefore there could be no lien on the goods. We fail to perceive the force of the contention. The letter of July 17th was, first, a confirmation of previous letters, second, a declaration that the writers would stand by the previous assertion of their right, that is, that they were only bound to ship the additional seventy tons under their contract, and, lastly, that Perkins &amp; Welsh should place the bill of lading when the sugar was delivered with a draft which would include the balance due on the Wylo’s cargo. We cannot possibly see in this any proof of an intention to deprive Perkins &amp; Welsh of the right to their customary lien upon the goods. Certainly there is nothing in the correspondence showing, or tending to show, that a new contract was intended to be created between Mora, Ona &amp; Co. and Perkins &amp; Welsh. The right to their general lien to protect their advances was too important a matter to be frittered away by an inference from a correspondence which gave no intimation of such a purpose on the part of either.</p>

That letter announces to the plaintiffs that Perkins &amp; Welsh have received invoice and bill of lading for 53 hhds. and 212 bbls. of sugar per Brig Sagua on account of contract of Mora, Ona &amp; Co., and further that in accordance with instructions Perkins &amp; Welsh draw on Harrison, Frazier &amp; Co., for amount of invoice together with balance due on Wylo’s cargo. They add also that their instructions are not to deliver the documents (sugars) unless draft is accepted. How this letter can be held to afford evidence that Perkins &amp; Welsh had abandoned their right to a lien on the goods as between them and Mora, Ona &amp; Co., or that they had not the intention to exercise or to claim such a right of lien, we cannot understand. If the goods were received and draft accepted of course the proceeds would go to Perkins &amp; Welsh and that would be the end of the matter. They would credit Mora, Ona &amp; Co.’s general account to the extent of the proceeds in accordance with their uniform mode of dealing. But because the goods were not received and the draft was not accepted it is claimed that the whole effect of the transaction as between Perkins &amp; Welsh and Mora, Ona &amp; Co. was changed. We cannot perceive the sequence of the reasoning. The necessary contention of the appellants is that the goods, when they were refused by Harrison, Frazier <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>&amp; Co. became tbe property of Mora, Ona &amp; Co., so that they could be attached as belonging to them. And this notwithstanding the fact that the bill of lading had been transferred to Perkins &amp; Welsh who then held it. . If Perkins &amp; Welsh and Mora, Ona &amp; Co. did not intend any such result it cannot be argued that an ownership of the goods resulted to Mora, Ona &amp; Co. by virtue of an intention that Perkins &amp; Welsh should not have their customary lien on the goods, because all proof of such an. intention is utterly wanting. Mora, Ona &amp; Co. were not parties to this letter of August 14th, and therefore cannot be held to have made any expression on the subject. Certainly it cannot be contended that Perkins &amp; Welsh intended to give up their lien on the goods which they had, both by virtue of their uniform mode of dealing with Mora, Ona &amp;• Co., and by possession of the bill of lading, transferred to them. Nothing in the letter indicates a shadow of such an intention and they certainly did not say so directly. Moreover, Harrison, Frazier &amp; Co., being attaching creditors of Mora, Ona &amp; Co., have no higher rights to the property in question than their debtors, Mora, Ona &amp; Co., had. This is perfectly familiar law in Pennsylvania. Without multiplying authorities we refer only to the language of Agnew, J., in Baugh v. Kirkpatrick, <a href="/pa/54/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="54 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="1006383" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0084-01">54 Pa. 84</a>, viz.: “ The attaching creditor stands upon no higher footing than his debtors in relation to the garnishee. What right would the debtor himself have to say to the garnishee ‘ you shall not sell,’ without tendering him his advances and making him whole? Even an execution cannot be levied of goods in pawn so as to take them out of the pawnee’s possession without tendering him the money for which he holds them in pledge. So here the garnishees as factors to sell having made advancements had a power coupled with an interest which was irrevocable except upon a tender of their charges.”</p>

By the undisputed evidence in the case they were very largely indebted to Perkins &amp; Welsh for advances on general account to be protected by subsequent consignments. By the uniform mode of dealing between them and Perkins &amp; Welsh the latter had the right to appropriate the proceeds of all sales of goods made by <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>them for Mora, Ona &amp; Co., to the credit of their general account. They held the bill of lading for the cargo of the Sagua, and this entitled them to the possession of the goods. They had the undoubted right to sell the goods and appropriate the price to the credit of Mora, Ona &amp; Co.’s general account. As a matter of course the latter could not take possession as against their bill of lading without tendering whatever charges Perkins &amp; Welsh had against them. And if they could not do this, Harrison, Frazier &amp; Co., as their creditors, could not do it.</p>

The jury found, under the charge of the court leaving to them the question of fact as to what the relations were between Perkins &amp; Welsh and Mora, Ona &amp; Co., that there was no property of Mora, Ona &amp; Co. in the hands of Perkins and Welsh, the garnishees, and that the cargo of the Sagua was held by them to secure debts due them by Mora, Ona &amp; Co. for advances. The oral testimony was delivered by one witness, Mr. Osgood Welsh, one of the members of the firm of Perkins &amp; Welsh, and was not contradicted by any other witness. The character of the relation between the two firms was described by him in reply to questions on that subject. He was asked: “ Q.

That merchandise necessarily was shipped ? A. It was shipped to us. Q. Shipped on bills of lading? A. Shipped on bills of lading consigned to us. Q. The bills of lading were to your order ? A. Yes, sir. Q. When that merchandise was sold and the drafts were paid what was done ? A. The bill of lading was indorsed by us and turned over to the person who paid for the cargo of sugar. Q. How would they pay and to whom would they pay ? A. Pay to us. Q. What would you do with the money? A. Pass it to the credit of Mora, Ona &amp; Co. Q. Was that done in this case? A. Yes, sir; here are all the items. Q. There were several bills of lading for parts of this contract? A. Yes, sir. Q. When those bills of lading came here were they to your order? A. Yes, sir. Q.
