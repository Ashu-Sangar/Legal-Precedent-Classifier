J.: On the forenoon of a clear day in August, plaintiff was going down south Second street, Harrisburg, with <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>his horse and wagon loaded with produce and truck. The electric street railway of defendant company was located on this street, and at that time extended to Hanna street, about a half mile below Mulberry street. About 800 feet below Mulberry street, the Reading railroad have an overhead bridge, and about 100 feet below the bridge the street railway makes a short curve to the west into Vine street. Immediately beyond this curve, crossing said Second street diagonally, are several tracks of the Pennsylvania railroad, over which were passing and repassing, at the time, two engines shifting cars into sidings. Plaintiff testified -that seeing that he could not go on with safety, that he might get caught between the shifting railroad cars and the street car at the curve, he determined to pass over the street car track immediately below the bridge, to the other side of the street, and there tie his horse. Before passing under the bridge he leaned out of the side of the front part of the wagon and looked up Second street as far as he could, which was as far as Mulberry street, a distance of about 800 feet (the foliage of the overhanging trees preventing a more distant view), and could see no car; none was in sight, nor could he hear anjr. Plaintiff testified that as there was but one ear running on that branch of the road at that time, he thought the car was beyond the curve, and might come out of Vine street at any moment, and therefore, having looked up, he now looked downward to the curve. After driving on about 60 feet he turned to cross the tracks obliquely. When his horse was fairly on the track he heard the gong but kept looking for the car towards Vine street, and before he got over he was struck and injured. Plaintiff’s witnesses estimated that the car was running from 12 to 20 miles per hour. The evidence was conflicting as to the distance plaintiff went after looking and listening before he tried to cross, whether he could have seen the car when he looked, how far he could see, and the rate of speed and the time within which the car ran any given distance.</p>

As it was plaintiff’s duty to look and listen, he ought to have done so where he could have done it in an effectual manner. If he had waited until he got under the bridge, a train might have been passing with so much noise that he would not be able to hear the street car, if one was coming, and his horse would have been so uneasy from the noise that he could, not have looked out with safety, and he therefore did what a prudent man should do, viz.: look and listen before entering under the bridge.

In attempting to cross the defendant company’s road upon this street, his wagon was struck by a moving car, causing the injury for which this suit was brought. He was driving down the street in the same direction as the car, and, when about fifty or sixty feet from the track, according to his testimony, he looked out but did not see a car coming. He then drove his horse, to use his own expression, “ cati-cornered ” across the track, and without looking out again before he crossed it. When seen by the motor-man in charge of the car, his wagon was moving in the same direction, and the accident was evidently caused by pulling his horse directly across the track in front of the car.</p>
    <p id="b211-10" data-blocks='[["BL_211.12",211,[144,1685,1170,708]]]'>The degree of care requisite to be observed in crossing the track of a steam railroad has been the subject of repeated decisions. In Railroad Company v. Beale, <a href="/pa/73/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="73 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1032299" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0504-01">73 Pa. 504</a>, it was held to be the duty of the traveler to stop, look and listen before crossing the track. The rule was declared to be an unbending one, and a failure to observe it is negligence <em>per se. </em>The doctrine of this case was much criticised at the time, but is now generally accepted as the law in this country. Subsequent reflection and experience have only strengthened our view of its wisdom. We have no doubt that in many instances it has been the means of saving human life. If strictly observed, accidents at railroad crossings would be as rare as they are now frequent. No rule, however wise, can avert the consequences resulting from negligence.</p>

It is therefore necessary to define nearly as may be the relative duties of street car companies, and citizens at street crossings, or other places.</p>
    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[285,661,1173,1157]]]'>There is this distinction to be observed between steam railroads and street railways. In the case of the former, they have the exclusive right to the use of their tracks at all times and for all purposes, except at road crossings. Street railways have not this exclusive right. Their tracks are used in common by their cars and the traveling public. While this common use is conceded, and is unavoidable in towns and cities, the railway companies and the public have not equal rights. Those of the railway companies are superior. Their cars have the right of way, and it is the duty of the citizen, whether on foot or in vehicles, to give unobstructed passage to the cars. This results from two reasons; first, the fact that the car cannot turn out, or leave its track, and secondly for the convenience and accommodation of the public. These companies have been chartered for the reason in part, at least, that thejr are a public accommodation. The convenience of an individual, who seeks to cross one of their tracks, must give way to the convenience of the public. It would be unreasonable that a car-load of passengers should be delayed by the unnecessary obstruction of the track by a passing vehicle. On the other hand, it is the duty of the companies to see that their motor-men shall be on the alert, not only at street crossings, but everywhere upon the tracks, to see that citizens are not run down and injured.</p>

A person driving a vehicle has but to use his eyes to avoid such accidents. There is no danger, as in the case of steam roads, of stopping a horse at the very edge of the track. When, therefore, a citizen attempts to cross such track, it is his duty when he reaches it to look in both directions for an approaching car. It very rarely, if it ever happens, that the street is so obstructed that the car may not be seen as the citizen approaches the track. It is his duty to look at that point, and if there is any obstruction, to listen, and his neglect to do so is negligence <em>per se. </em>This is an unbending rule to be observed at all times, and under all eircum<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>stances. In the case of steam roads, a question, sometimes arises as to the proper place to stop, look and listen. Where there is a fair doubt upon this question, we have held that it must be submitted to a jury. But no such case arises in the case of city railways. If the citizen looks just before he crosses, he avoids all danger of accident.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[141,712,1171,756]]]'>Applying these principles to the case in hand, it is manifest the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. He never looked in the direction of the approaching car at the time he turned the head of his horse across the track. When he' did look he was fifty or sixty feet away with a loaded wagon, and his horse walking slowly. Moreover he did not cross directly, but in an oblique direction, which would add considerably to, the time of crossing. During that period an electric car would travel a considerable distance. The conductor may not have anticipated that the plaintiff would attempt to cross the track immediately in front of his car. Be that as it may, and conceding the negligence of the company, the contributory negligence of the plaintiff was so palpable that the court below should have so declared it as a'matter of law, and instructed the jury to find for the defendant.</p>
