March 80,1888, an ordinance was passed fixing the compensation of city assessor at three dollars per day. On Jan. 7,1889, that Act was declared unconstitutional, in Ayars’ Ap., <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>. The Act of May 8,1889, P. L. 133, re-classified the cities of the state and York fell into the third class. The Act of May 13, 1889, P. L. 196, declared the <em>defacto </em>councils of cities to be and to have been legally constituted, and validated and declared to be in full force all ordinances duly passed by them. On May 23, 1889, P. L. 277, a general Act for the government of cities of the third class was passed. Art. 15, § 1, provides for the election of city assessors. Art. 19, § 2, provides that “ all ordinances of any of said cities heretofore legally passed not inconsistent with such provisions are hereby made valid and shall be and remain in full force and virtue until altered or repealed.” In February, 1890, plaintiff was elected city assessor. On Oct. 14, 1890, an ordinance was passed fixing the salary of city assessor at $2.50 per day, the total compensation not to exceed $225 in any year. Plaintiff claimed for 201 days at $3 per day, but defendant refused to pay more than $225.</p>

I regard that ordinance as a valid exercise of legislative powers by the defendant, the city of York, in this case, and that it did fix the compensation which this plaintiff is entitled to recover. The defendant concedes that under that ordinance the plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $225 with lawful interest from the first Monday of April, which was the terminus of the first year of his incumbency of the office.</p>

    <p id="b237-8" data-blocks='[["BL_237.10",237,[152,711,1176,1315]]]'>When the ordinance of March 30,1888, was passed it had apparently all the Requisites of validity, passage in due form, by the regularly elected councils of a city of the fifth class under the Act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 204. All of these elements existed <em>defacto, </em>and were supposed to exist <em>de jure. </em>Under this supposition the city organization had been made, officers elected, their compensation fixed, and the general business of a city put in operation. .When the Act of 1887 was declared to be unconstitutional, in Ayars’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>, the result was intolerable confusion. Public measures which had been undertaken, and rights which had been acquired in the utmost good faith were set aside and ended on the instant. This condition of affairs existed all over the state, and called imperatively for relief. The Legislature met the crisis promptly and effectually by the Act of May 13, 1889, P. L. 196, by which the existing councils were declared to be and to have been legally constituted councils, and their ordinances were validated and declared to be in full force. The intent of this Act is perfectly clear. It was to make all the <em>de facto </em>municipal bodies <em>de jure, </em>and to render all their acts, done in their <em>de facto </em>capacity, valid and effective in law. It was a universal statute, making no exceptions, as there was no room for any. No foresight, legislative or other, could have discriminated among the vast mass of ordinances in all the cities similarly situated, which would be required to bring order out of this chaos. The Legislature did not attempt it. It validated them all.</p>

Both fail together by the failure of the foundation on which they rested alike. The Legislature at once restores the ordinance and says it shall be “ valid and in full force,” and immediately after restores the office and makes it also <em>de jure. </em>When the office was thus reinstated it found an ordinance applicable to it, already existing. The order of dates of the two statutes is entirely <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>immaterial. They are parts of the same legislative effort, to repair the mischief which the invalidity of the previous Act had brought about, and to ratify everything that had been done under it, as broadly and as conclusively as if it had been legally authorized in the first instance.</p>
    <p id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[274,656,1160,398]]]'>Even if there were a doubt on this point, the same result would be reached by the force of article 19, sec. 2, of the Act of 'May 23, 1889.
