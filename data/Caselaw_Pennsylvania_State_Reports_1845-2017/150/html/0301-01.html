Fredericks, auditor on exceptions and to distribute the third account of John Good, executor of George Good, deceased. Testator died in 1875, leaving an estate of some $30,000. The will directed the executor to sell the mansion house at public sale upon the widow’s death, and authorized him to be a bidder. He did so bid, and the property was knocked down to him at $3,000, but he refused to comply, denying that he had purchased and alleging spoliation by the other heirs. The auditor found that he had purchased the property and surcharged him with $3,000, and interest to date of filing account, but refused to include interest to date of confirmation of auditor’s report, citing McElhenny’s Ap., <a href="/pa/46/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="46 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="420603" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0347-01">46 Pa. 347</a>, which holds that interest is not <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>chargeable on the funds while an account is pending before an auditor.

Upon citation the executor admitted that no such investment was made, but that the fund was secured in a mill property purchased by him from testator but not conveyed to him, and on which $9,550 purchase money was still due. On April ’22, 1881, the court ordered the accountant to insure this property “ as additional security for the moneys in: his hands,” or file a bond with sureties. The auditor charged the accountant with interest on the $10,000 up to the date of filing the account, but refused to charge interest beyond that date. [3]</p>

This claim was opposed by the heirs, but was allowed by the auditor on the ground that the words in the will, above quoted, were not imperative, and that the fund, being a trust fund, the trustee was entitled to a commission outside of his executorship, citing Spangler’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%20336" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 Pa. 336">21 Pa. 336</a>.

The accountant claimed the right to apply Mrs. Ault’s share in the distribution to partially repaying himself the advances made for her benefit.

This may now be their view of it, but the agreement says, ‘ Out of any assets in his hands as said executor‘due or to become due’ to us or either of us.’ This certainly did not mean out of only such money as was then due, or the words ‘ to become due ’ would not have been added; but if the executor would advance it, it was to come out of any fund which he might have at any time as executor. It was well known at that time that $10,000 was left in the estate and the day would come when it was to be distributed, so the agreement was worded so as to include it; and it was certainly proper that it should, as otherwise Mrs. Smith and Mrs Ault would receive more than their, share of the estate. It is not probable that they would demand more of their father’s estate than the other heirs were to receive, as the will directed that the shares should be equal.

    <p id="b332-9" data-blocks='[["BL_332.15",332,[253,1308,1172,909]]]'>The fund, the interest of which was paid to the widow of testator, was a debt of the executor and trustee to the estate, yet its existence in that form did not necessarily, or in fact as the auditor found, involve any breach of duty. It was not a debt in the ordinary general sense, but unpaid purchase money for the mill property, the equitable title to which was in the executor and trustee under articles of purchase from the testator, the legal title however remaining in the latter up to the time of his death, partly at least, as would appear, from an inability to make a clear title during the continuance of an outstanding dower. While therefore the executor’s allowing this debt to stand, and treating it as the security for the interest to be paid to the widow during her life, was not an investment of the fund such as the will directed, yet it served the purpose safely, was practically agreed to by the acquiescence of the heirs, and was in effect sanctioned by the orphans’ court in its order of April 22,1881, requiring the insurance of this property “ as additional security for the moneys in his hands.”</p>

The executor who also acted as trustee administered it for a period of fourteen or fifteen years, during the life <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>of the widow, so far as appears, safely and prudently. He accepted the responsibility of advancing money to save a home for one of the heirs, Mrs. Ault, who is now here as an appellant.</p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[96,552,1176,403]]]'>These facts are all that are necessary to show that the general rules as to the charge of interest upon debts of the executor to the estate, down to the time of actual payment, and as to the allowance of commissions under such circumstances, as established in the cases cited by the appellants, do not necessarily apply. For the discussion of the particular items we are content to rest the case on the report of the learned auditor, and the opinion of the court. *</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[143,965,1126,43]]]'>Appeals dismissed at the costs of the appellants respectively.</p>
