Breneman and wife executed a deed of assignment to Joseph Miller, his brother-in-law, for the benefit of Breneman’s creditors, the estate consisting of 221 acres of farm land, heavily encumbered, and the personal property thereon. The assignee accepted the trust and carried on the farming operations for a year, assisted by the assignor and his wife, who retained possession of the dwelling and were paid wages, the assignee paying all expenses including household expenses for the assignor, and returning in his account $2,293.71 as the produce. The assignor also raised a crop of tobacco on several acres of the land, using the horses and farm implements of the estate with which to do at least a part of the cultivation of the tobacco; but it did not appear that the estate in anywise contributed toward the work or expense of raising or marketing it.</p>

It was offered at public sale, but not by order of court, and bid up to $140 per acre. This would not pay off the liens. The property was withdrawn and offered at private sale. Philip Frank offered $141 per acre but gradually raised to $144.25, which he told the assignee was his outside bid. The assignee finally sold to one Hoffman for $144.50. A few days afterwards Hoffman resold to Frank at an advance of $2,000. Before the articles of'agreement between Hoffman and the assignee were signed, Waller, the appellant, a creditor, protested against the sale <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>and asked the assignee to offer it again at public sale. The assignee declined to do this without indemnity against loss. Frank bought up judgments against the property to the amount of $18,174.25. The assignee executed a deed to Hoffman and received the balance of the purchase-money over and above the judgments which Frank, bought up, and powers of attorney to satisfy those judgments. Hoffman immediately executed a deed to Frank, who settled with him according to the terms of their agreement. The auditor found that the assignee acted in good faith, and without supine negligence or willful default, and accordingly refused to surcharge him.</p>

As to this claim the auditor reported: “ The evidence in. support of this claim shows that Mrs. Breneman received out of her father’s estate about $4,900, in addition to a note of $300, with $108 interest, held by her father’s estate against her husband, and which was at her and his request deducted from her share by her father’s administrators. This sum of $408 is part of the debt for which this judgment was given. It is also shown that at the request of her husband, she paid a note of $300, given by him for mules, and a note of $600, given for horses, out of her separate monej^s. These payments with two years’ interest, amounting to $1,008, were included in the judgment.</p>

    <p id="b525-9" data-blocks='[["BL_525.11",525,[144,1468,1162,643]]]'>A careful examination of the numerous specifications fails to disclose error. The attempt to surcharge the account of the assignee with the sum of $2,000, and interest thereon, for the reason that he should have sold the real estate for that much more than he actually received, was ungracious. The evidence shows that he acted with prudence, and that he endeavored to get the best possible price for the property. It consisted of a large farm, heavily encumbered, and failing to get a satisfactory bid at public sale, he sold it afterwards at private sale for $144.50 an acre, which was an advance over previous offers. The fact that the purchaser resold it at an advance of $2,000 is no reason why the assignee should be surcharged with that sum.</p>

The assignment was made on March 26, 1888, a time of year when it is practically impossible to sell a farm, and extremely difficult to rent it. The assignee took upon himself the labor and risk of farming the place for the year, and has <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>accounted for the proceeds. He permitted the assignor to remain in the house, and allowed him to cultivate one of the fields with tobacco. -The crop thus grown by the assignor, was subsequently sold by him for $1,107.48, and with this sum the creditors now seek to surcharge the assignee. The absurdity of this attempt to surcharge is apparent. The tobacco was the result of the labor of the assignor and his family, with perhaps the aid of hired help. It belonged to him, and neither the assignee nor the creditors had any rights in it. The most that the assignee could be surcharged with, if he were liable to a surcharge at all, would be the rent of the ground upon which the tobacco grew; but it is well settled that the assignee is not liable to be surcharged with even this. In Detwiler’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20Pa.%20828" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="96 Pa. 828">96 Pa. 828</a>, it was held that a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors does not impose upon the assignee any duty to let the real estate, and, where the assignee permits the assignor to remain in possession, and use the real estate, he is not chargeable with the rental thereof. This is good law as well as common sense. It applies with especial force where the subject-matter of the assignment consists of a large farm, and the assignment itself is made at a time of the year when the farm can neither be sold nor rented. What is the assignee to do in such case? The assignor has a right to remain until the farm is sold. The deed of assignment authorizes its sale, and while this might include the power to lease under some circumstances, it is rarely if ever done, as assigned estates are usually closed up within the year. It would have been as reasonable to surcharge this assignee with the market value of the vegetables, raised by the assignor in his garden, as to surcharge him with the price of the tobacco, raised in the field. The latter was a. mere mode by which the assignor was able to obtain bread for his family, pending the settlement of his estate.</p>
