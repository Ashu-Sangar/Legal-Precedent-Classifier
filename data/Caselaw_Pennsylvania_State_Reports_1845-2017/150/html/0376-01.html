There is no evidence here which, in our judgment, we could submit to the jury sufficient to base a verdict upon, as required by this point. There is not sufficient evidence of the intention to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of Joseph Kitchen by the confession of this judgment and the issuing of an execution thereon. It is not sufficient to create a suspicion, and where fraud is alleged to set aside legal process, and the process which the law recognizes as the means of collecting a debt from a debtor, he who alleges there is fraud must prove by substantive proof the fraud that he complains of, and when the acts of which he complains are such as are recognized by the law when standing separate and apart by themselves, unless they are accompanied by other acts and declarations which clearly show collusion and a combination to cheat and defraud, and hinder and delay other creditors, the jury could not be justified in finding a verdict and the court could not enter a judgment on <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>a verdict of that kind, and we believe it is our province to say so, that there is not sufficient evidence in this case to justify us in submitting this question to be passed upon by you, and that there is not sufficient evidence of an illegal combination to hinder, defraud and delay other creditors of Joseph Kitchen.

Nothing that transpired between Simon Pennington and the plaintiff after the horse was levied on, as shown by the testimony in this case, could transfer a right of action to the plaintiff to maintain this suit in his own name for the horse, and plaintiff cannot recover for said horse in this action. <em>Answer: </em>These two points just read cover the transaction with reference to the brown horse after the constable’s sale and at the time the writ was put into the sheriff’s hands against Joseph Kitchen. The evidence in the cause, which is uncontradicted, is that Andrew L. Kitchen had agreed to and did sell this brown horse to Simon Pennington, and that Simon Pennington paid and 'delivered the money for him to Kitchen; that the same evening, if I am not mistaken, the same even<a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>ing or the next, if it was not the same evening at least the next day, the sheriff levied upon the horse. Simon Pennington, after the levy, the same day as I remember his testimony, went to Andrew L. Kitchen and told him that the horse was levied upon and asked for his money. There was some talk between them that evening about Joseph Kitchen making some arrangement. That arrangement was not consummated and carried out, but before the sheriff’s sale, whether it was the next day or whether it was three days before the sheriff’s sale is not clear here, but at least before the sheriff’s sale some days, Simon Pennington returned this horse and received his money from Andrew L. Kitchen. The money was refunded. The sheriff had taken possession of the horse. The sheriff took this horse at the time of the levy out of the possession of Pennington and took him to Mr. Jose’s, I believe, or to some place else, took him out of the possession of Pennington, so that at the time that the money was returned by Andrew L. Kitchen the horse was neither in the possession of Pennington nor Kitchen, but was in the charge and custody and control of the sheriff. Now, under these circumstances, we are asked in these two points to instruct you that the plaintiff cannot recover for the value of that horse. Gentlemen of the jury, we may be in error about this, but we cannot agree with the contention set up by these points. The trespass which was begun by the levy made by the sheriff was not complete until the time of the sheriff’s sale, and at that time the property and title to the horse had become revested in Andrew L. Kitchen, and while there might be no possible claim for the detention and taking away of the horse, between the time of the levy and the sale, we think that the plaintiff in this case'is entitled to recover for the value of that horse. The sale to Simon Pennington was simply nothing more or less than the exchange of horse for money, and when the title was attacked and Mr. Pennington demanded his money back Mr. Kitchen refunded the money within a few days after the demand was made and thereby, we think, became invested with the full title to this horse, and that before the sheriff’s sale, and therefore would be entitled to recover the value of that horse.

Kitch<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>en v. Joseph Kitchen was obtained, as detailed by the justice, the manner in which the sale was conducted, as to who the persons were who were present, and the bidding, etc., and if the jury is satisfied from the evidence that the judgment, and sale in pursuance of it, were fraudulent, and intended to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of Joseph Kitchen, their verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Gentlemen of the jury, we cannot affirm that point, because, in the view we take of this case, after all that would be submitted to you, there would not be sufficient submitted to you to establish fraud or collusion, or a combination to hinder and cheat and defraud the creditors of Joseph Kitchen by what occurred there, and therefore no judgment could be entered on your verdict if you were to find and base a verdict upon those acts. As we stated before, when fraud is alleged it must be proven by substantive proof. The presentation of acts which are at most suspicious are not sufficient. The proof of fraud must be sustained by testimony that is of sufficient character to bear with it a conviction of the alleged fraudulent acts, and we do not think that in this case there has been proof of such acts which would justify us in submitting the question of fraud to the jury, so that that leaves but one single question for you to pass on, namely, what was the value of those two horses ? . . . . Plaintiff is entitled to recover, we think, in this case, the value of the property, and whether or not you will allow anything additional to that is a matter which we leave entirely with you.” [4]</p>

Kitchen and Pennington after the levy, when Kitchen refunded to Pennington the money which Pennington had paid him for the horse, was a rescission of the sale of the horse by Kitchen to Pennington. As between them Kitchen thereby became entitled to the possession of the horse and also to the property in him. Pennington did not have the possession as the horse had been taken by the sheriff under his levy. When he accepted from Kitchen the monej' for the price of the horse, he no longer had any title in the horse or any right of possession. The property in the horse, after the rescission, was vested again in Kitchen, and the right to have the possession followed the title and could be asserted as against any wrong-doer. No actual delivery of possession by Pennington to Kitchen was necessary to perfect Kitchen’s title. Creps v. Dunham, <a href="/pa/69/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="69 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1026501" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0456-01">69 Pa. 456</a>. The authorities cited by the learned counsel of the appellant in his argument upon the first and second assignments are undoubtedly correct and certainly apply in all cases where there was a levy and no change of title between the levy and the sale. But the sale by the sheriff, of goods levied upon by him and claimed by a stranger, is a distinct and substantial trespass which entitles the real owner to his remedy by action of trespass. In the present case the sale was not made until after Pennington had parted with his title by the rescission of the contract of purchase between Kitchen and Pennington. He no longer had any kind of title in the horse and Kitchen became the owner of any title which Pennington had prior to the act of rescission.

It is clear that Pennington could maintain no action against the sheriff in such circumstances, and we know of no reason why Kitchen might not assert his right of property by an action based upon the act of trespass committed by the sheriff in selling the horse thereafter.</p>

White Sewing Machine Co., <a href="/pa/128/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="128 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="567035" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0397-01">128 Pa. 397</a>, we held that to maintain trespass for a mere levy upon the goods of a stranger the plaintiff must have had, at the time of the levy, either actual possession or the right to take possession, but for a sale of the goods an action may be supported upon a reversionary or conditional right of possession. In that ease Dinkle as agent for the plaintiff claiming the goods—organs—had made conditional sales in the form of leases, under which the organs had been delivered to the proposed purchasers and were in their possession at the time of the levy. They ha.d been levied on by Dinkle’s creditors, who claimed they were his property. The sheriff returned that he had levied on Dinkle’s interest in them and had sold only that interest, and it was claimed for the defendant, the sheriff, that as only Dinkle’s interest was sold, and that, at the time of the levy, the goods were in possession of other parties, the conditional purchasers, the action could not.be maintained. Our brother Mitchell, meeting this objection, and recognizing the familiar doctrine that the plaintiff in an action of trespass must have the possession or right of possession at the time of the levy, said: “But Dinkle either for himself or as agent of the plaintiff had still a title in the organs, to which a reversionary and conditional right of possession attached, and a sale of the goods themselves by the sheriff would be such an interference with this title and consequent right of possession as would support an action.” This distinction is quite correct and would seem to be applicable to the rather unusual facts that are present in this case. At the time of the levy, Pennington was the owner and in possession, and if there were no change in the situation, no action could have been maintained by Kitchen. But his action was not brought until after the sale by the sheriff, and at that time, he, if he was the true owner of the horse, is the only person injured and his injury was occasioned by the sale. Pennington had <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>no interest of any kind either in the possession, or in the property at the time of the sale, or at the time of the action brought. Kitchen was the owner, if his title were good, and being the only person injured he was clearly entitled to bring the action. No action had been brought by any one for the disturbance of the possession by the levy, and as the sale was an undoubted trespass, as against Kitchen, he alone had the right of action. The first and second assignments of error are not sustained.</p>

The third point of the defendant is undoubtedly sound, and might have been affirmed as a mere abstract proposition. The only reason why it was not affirmed was because the learned court below was of opinion that there was no evidence in the cause which would have justified the submission to the jury of the question of fact which was involved in the point. After a most careful reading of the testimony we are of opinion that the learned court was entirely correct in this view of the testimony. We really cannot see any foundation of fact in the testimony upon which to base either a charge of an intent, in the confession of the judgment, to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of Joseph Kitchen, or that there was fraud in fact either in the giving of the judgment, or in the sale under the execution. There is not a scrap of testimony to impugn the full actual consideration of the judgment. The magistrate who entered the judgment testified fully to every fact and circumstance attending its confession and entry. He said the defendant in the judgment called upon him and said he was indebted to his brother, A. L. Kitchen, that he could not pay him and wanted to make as little costs as possible and therefore he wanted to confess a judgment in his favor for the amount of the debt. The justice inquired as to the consideration and was informed as to the whole of it, that the defendant owed his brother for three notes he held against him and a book-account. The amount was footed up and judgment confessed for the whole. Afterwards on the same day he met the plaintiff and inquired of him about it and said he would require the notes to be delivered to him, the justice, as they were “ docket property.” On the same evening A. L. Kitchen brought him the notes and left them with him and directed him to issue an execution the next day. <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>The notes themselves were produced in court and given in evidence. They are all judgment notes, given at different times, for different sums, all of which were small, and executed under seal. One of them w-as given to the wife of A. L. Kitchen and by her transferred to her husband. There was not a fragment of testimony in the cause to impeach the consideration of the notes or of the judgment. Being executed under seal they imported consideration. We discover nothing in the circumstances attending the confession of the judgment, in any degree suspicious or inconsistent with perfect good faith. It was the right of the defendant to confess the judgment in favor of his brother if he honestly owed him the money, and equally the right of the brother to receive the confession and issue execution for the collection of the money, without being chargeable with fraud because the defendant was his brother.</p>

Byers, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20Pa.%20816" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="94 Pa. 816">94 Pa. 816</a>, Mr. Justice Gordon, in the case of a transfer of real estate from a son nearly or quite insolvent, to his father, said: “Business dealings between parents and children and other near relatives, are not <em>per se </em>fraudulent. They must be treated just as are the transactions between ordinary debtors and creditors. As in the latter case, where the <em>bona </em>fides of such transactions is attacked, the fraud alleged must be clearly and distinctly proved, so likewise in the former.” The judgment of the court below was reversed because the question of fraud was submitted to the jury, when in the opinion of this court there was no evidence sufficient to warrant such submission.</p>

Kitchen came to the office of the justice alone and without any books and papers when he confessed the judgment, that only a few persons were present at the sale, a- part of whom were near relatives, that there was a dispute about one or two bids, that the horses sold were worth considerably more than they brought at the sale, and that the sale was completed in about twenty minutes. Such facts as these constantly transpire at judicial sales, but unless there is some kind of proof showing, or tending to show, actual fraud in the transaction, they are not of the slightest significance and of themselves prove nothing worthy the consideration of a jury. <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>The solemn judgments and executions of creditors are not to be swept away by any such testimony as this without some kind of substantial proof. The third and fourth assignments are not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b412-4" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[255,597,1162,440]]]'>The fourth point of the defendant asked the court to charge that the constable’s sale was void in law, because there were no persons present at the sale, “ but the plaintiff and defendant who were brothers, and their brother and nephew, the constable and his clerk.” As a matter of course such a point could not have been affirmed without grave error and it was therefore refused. In point of fact other persons were present at the sale and so testified. The fifth assignment is not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.6",412,[255,1056,1166,552]]]'>Sixth assignment. The only object of the offer to give other judgments against Joseph R. Kitchen in evidence, was to show that he was in debt to other persons at the time he confessed the judgment. As the mere fact of other indebtedness would not invalidate, or even tend to invalidate, the judgment confessed to A. L. Kitchen, without some other evidence tending to impeach the good faith of the transaction, the offer was not competent. As we have often held, one who is in debt to different persons may give a preference to any one, and the fact of the other indebtedness weighs nothing against the validity of the preference. The sixth assignment is not sustained.</p>
