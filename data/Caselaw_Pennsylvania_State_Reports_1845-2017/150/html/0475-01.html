This Act is <em>pari materia </em>with the Acts of 1812 and 1853, and the logs must be put into the river and taken up while floating or lodged upon an island.</p>

This Act authorizes the owners of any logs, put or intended to be put into the West Branch of the Susquehanna to be run, driven or floated to the Susquehanna booms at Williamsport, to mark the same and furnish a copy of the mark to the prothonotary of the common pleas of Lycoming Co., etc. As to these logs, so marked, and while above the Susquehanna booms, the Acts of 1812, 1853 aiid 1855 are repealed. When once past the booms, the common law seems to have been no longer adequate, and the statute proceeds to say: ‘ And for the purpose of encouraging persons to catch, take up and secure logs floating down the Susquehanna river, below the Susquehanna booms, it is made lawful to take up and secure logs so found floating down the said river ’ with the right to charge fifty cents per thousand feet, board measure, for so doing, and seventy-five cents per thousand for logs taken up below Columbia bridge. This increase of compensation is only given for taking up and securing logs found floating down the river. No provision is made for stranded logs. Thé Act of 1853 was necessary to extend the provision of the Act of 1812 to logs lodged upon islands. The 5th section of the Act of 1855 was necessary to make that Act include logs lodged upon islands. The Act of 1862 has no such provision and does not apply to stranded logs. The Act is penal in its character and should be strictly construed. Logs taken up while found floating cannot be construed to mean logs lodged upon islands, especially when before this, in other Acts upon the same subject, the legislature has particularly mentioned such logs when it was intended to embrace them within the provisions of any of the acts. The fact that these Acts are <em>pari materia, </em>makes the want of a provision in reference to stranded logs the more conspicuous for its absence. The case of Etter v. Edwards, <a href="/watts/4/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 63" data-case-ids="1842793" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0063-01">4 Watts, 63</a>, cited above seems to leave no doubt on the subject.] [1]</p>

Simply because they do not refer to stranded logs. The reference to floating logs in the first section of the Act of 1866, has no'more reference to the subject than the mention of floating logs in the second section. He is evidently speaking of that part of the first section which construes the Act of 1812 and declares the true intent and meaning thereof to be that any saw logs may be taken up under its provisions, ‘whether the same be put into the stream intentionally or otherwise.’</p>

The various acts of assembly referred to in this opinion deal: 1st, with the way the logs get into the river; 2d, with salvage for floating logs; 3d, with salvage for logs lodged upon islands.

Some were taken while floating and others taken that were stranded upon islands, in the spring of 1868. There were two cases, No. 18 and No. 68. The plaintiffs obtained a verdict in both cases, but took a writ of error in No. 18 because they believed they were not permitted to recover enough, and the defendants took a writ of error in No. 68, as well as in No. 18. The first case, No. 18, involved logs floating and logs stranded. The second case, No. 68, involved only logs stranded. The defendants claimed, under the Act of 1866, as an independent statute dispensing with the lodging of a list with a justice and with notice. The court below seems to have taken their view of it and would not permit the plaintiffs to recover for logs taken while floating, but held that the Act of 1866 did not embrace logs lodged upon islands, and permitted a recovery in both cases for the value of such logs. The Supreme Court held that the Acts of 1812,1853,1855,1862 and 1866 <em>were pari materia, </em>that the provision for notice in the Act of 1812 was not repealed, and as no notice was given, as required by that Act, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover for the logs floating as well as the logs stranded upon islands.</p>

The legislature may however authorize the taking up of logs, whether put into the river intentionally or otherwise, and fix the compensation of the salvor, provided due notice be given so the owner may pay the salvage and take his logs, before the title is forfeited for non-payment.</p>

The question is, what has the legislature provided?
