Her legacies and debts, including municipal improvements and collateral inheritance tax, amounted to about $75,000. The income from the real estate was less than $1,800, the tax over $3,000.</p>

That would be, under this will, (1) wholly for her own use and benefit, and (2) subject to her control. As the construction is strict, and a power to sell, lease or improve must be plainly conferred (see authorities cited in Lindsay v.

The residue, including real estate and possible lapsed legacies, is given “ absolutely and in fee simple.” This gives the legal title and the right of sale. The succeeding words, relied upon by appellee, do not show a clear intent to create an equitable estate. The property shall be free from the control or debts of her husband, subject to her own control and wholly for her use. What marital rights do they bar ? If she took a fee, her hus<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>band could neither control it nor render it liable for his debts. If it is a separate use, a trustee may be appointed. How could she then have it under her control? While testatrix must be presumed to know the law, we must also assume that she knew a mere declaration of her desire as to the husband would not change a legal into an equitable estate. If her intent were clear this argument would not prevail. But where it is not, the court will consider that an expression of desire which would be fully met by giving the natural effect to her words creating a legal estate will not be used to force an intent to create an equitable estate. If the legal estate can stand, with the subsequently expressed desire of exclusion of even supposed marital rights, there is no good reason why the court should use that expression of desire as showing a clear intent to change the nature of the estate granted. Especially is this so when the practical result would be to make the apparent benefit a real burden.</p>

L. 88. (2) The clause shows a desire that the homestead should be kept as a home, unencumbered. This strengthens our construction.

The power to sell or mortgage as executor to pay debts was not necessary if appellant could sell as devisee. This provision for payment of debts, etc., shows she had the circumstances of her estate in view. It provided for payment by sale of realty, without touching the bequests to plaintiff, amounting to $70,000, or the homestead valued at $200,000. Plaintiff was asked to hold the homestead “as long as she possibly could,” but there was no limitation upon its use. Properly handled, her estate would produce $15,000 income. With this in mind, testatrix made the residuary clause. If she meant a fee she would have stopped with the first sentence. Had she stopped with the provision as to the husband’s ' debts, a fee might have remained, it being conceded that a wife’s separate property is free from her husband’s debts. But to make her intention certain she added the clause as to separate use and control. A fee may be cut down to a life estate by subsequent words in a will: Urich v. Merkel, 2 W.

And it is my will that said Mathilda Gross MacConnell shall take and hold the property hereby given to her, free from the control of her present or future husband, and without any liability for any debts, liabilities or engagements of such husband, but wholly for her own use and benefit, and subject to her own control.”</p>

It is proper to say, however, that the question pressed upon us at that time was the effect of the Act of 1848, and the Married Person’s Property Act of June 3, 1887, upon separate use trusts. The intention of the testatrix, as gathered from the whole will, and from the circumstances surrounding her and her estate, was entirely overlooked or ignored in that case. This sufficiently appears from the report of it in 131 Pa., and especially from the very able and elaborate opinion of our late brother Clark, in which he shows in a very conclusive manner that it was not intended by the Acts of Assembly referred to to abolish separate use trusts. Seven pages of that opinion were devoted to this subject, while only a part of a page referred to Mrs. Gross’s will. It may be conceded that the words “ And it is my will that the said Mathilda Gross MacConnell shall take and hold the property hereby given to her free from the control of her present or future husband, and without any liability for any debts, liabilities or engagements of such husband, but wholly for her .own use and benefit, and subject to her own control,” if standing alone, are sufficient to create a separate use.

Gross, of the city of Pittsburgh. Mathilda Gross MacConnell was her adopted daughter, and the principal object of her bounty. By the second paragraph of her will she gave to her said adopted daughter all her personal property, consisting of notes, bonds, mortgages, stocks (except certain bank stock), moneys, plate, jewelry, diamonds, pictures, household furniture, and all other personal estate whatsoever. Then follows a number of legacies and gifts to collateral relatives and others, including some charitable bequests. By the sixth paragraph of her will, she devised the homestead property, of which she <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>was entitled, containing about ten acres, to her said adopted daughter, and concludes the devise with these words: “And it is my desire and earnest request that she shall retain and occupy the same as a homestead for herself and family, as long as she possibly can, and I direct that the said homestead shall not be sold, or in any manner made liable for the payment of my debts, or for the payment or discharge of any legacy or other liability, created by this will.”</p>

The nature and character of said estate, as it existed at the time of her death, fully appears in the case-stated. From that we learn that she left personal estate, consisting of money, mortgages, notes, and bank stock, amounting in the aggregate as per appraisement to $86,807.62. She also left unimproved real estate in the Twentieth ward of the city of Pittsburgh, consisting of twenty-six different tracts, which, prior to the death of the testatrix, she had laid out into lots. This property is extremely valuable, but yields little income. For the six years prior to the death of Mrs. Gross, the city and county taxes on this property averaged nearly $2,000 per year. Since her death, the taxes have been increased, amounting in 1891 to $8,485.01, while the income derived therefrom has at no time exceeded $1,800 per annum. In addition, claims for municipal improvements to a large amount have been filed against the property. The collateral inheritance tax due upon it at Mrs. <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>Gross’s death amounted to $10,384, which was subsequently-paid. The practical result is, that the personal estate bequeathed to Mrs. MacConnell has been entirely exhausted in the payment of the general legacies, collateral inheritance tax, debts, and the expenses of the • administration, leaving Mrs. MacConnell with a large and expensive homestead to keep up, not only without any income to do so, but with large annual charges for taxes, etc., against unimproved property, in addition to municipal assessments.</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[276,856,1165,653]]]'>Assuming, as we have a right to do, that Mrs. Gross was thoroughly cognizant of the condition of her estate when she made her will, the inquiry suggests itself, whether it is probable she intended to embarrass the estate by creating a separate use. It will be observed, that in the seventh paragraph of the will, the clause which it is claimed creates the separate use, is preceded by a devise of the estate to her adopted daughter, “absolutely and in fee simple.” This language is certainly very emphatic, and when we consider' that the sixth section preceding, contains a broad and absolute power of sale, with the provision that the purchasers shall not be bound to look to the application of the purchase money, the intention of the testatrix to create a separate use, may be more than doubted.</p>
