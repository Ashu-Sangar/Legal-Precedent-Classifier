J., was to the following effect: Plaintiff agreed to'supply defendant’s hotel with a steam heating apparatus necessary to heat certain rooms and all the halls and entries on all the floors, guaranteeing seventy degrees of heat in zero weather, except in the entries, which were to have no less than sixty degrees. Plaintiff testified that the apparatus would furnish the heat required if properly managed, that he had estimated the heating surface and that it was sufficient, and had made a test in January and found heat enough, but he did not try the thermometer to see what it was outside. Plaintiff further testified that he put no radiator on the fourth floor, but that the plant would furnish sufficient heat there as he had arranged it. Defendant gave evidence to show insufficient heat.</p>

The contract on which suit was brought having provided that all the apartments to which heat is furnished are to have automatic air valves, nickel plated, and the hall or entry on the fourth story of the back building being one of the said apartments, and to which plaintiff admitted heat was to <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>be furnished, and plaintiff having admitted that he put no air valves or heating apparatus of any kind in the s.aid hall or entry, he cannot recover in this action, and the verdict must be for the defendant. If the jury find from the evidence that there was a hall or entry on the fourth floor, necessary under this contract to be heated by a radiator, pipes, valves, etc., and the required heat was not produced therein, the plaintiff having testified that he put no heating apparatus there to heat it, there can be no recovery.
