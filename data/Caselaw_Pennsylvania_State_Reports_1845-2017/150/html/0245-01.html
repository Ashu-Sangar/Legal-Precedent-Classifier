Its chief office and treasury are in the city of New York. Its treasurer and other principal officers are, all of them, residents of said city.

Neither those statutes nor the New York statutes, which constitute the charter of the company, contain any provision requiring it to collect and be responsible for any tax upon bonds and mortgages issued by it, whether held by residents of Pennsylvania or otherwise, nor requiring it to deduct any Pennsylvania state tax from interest paid upon such mortgages; but the said statutes are, all of them, entirely silent upon that subject.</p>

By the terms of the bonds and the mortgages whereby they are secured, the principal and interest is payable in the city and state of New York at the general office of the company; and the interest is, and was, in 1890, there paid by the treasurer of the company, who is a resident of the state of New York. The said bonds were all issued prior to the year 1885. They are all coupon bonds. Neither bond, nor coupon, nor mortgage, contains any provision for the withholding from the interest of any state tax, or for any deduction whatever from the interest required by the terms of said mortgage, bonds and coupons to be paid.</p>

Such evidences of indebtedness, when issued by individuals, or by foreign corporations not doing business in Pennsylvania, are, when held by residents of Pennsylvania, required by various statutes to be assessed by the local assessors of the district in which the owners reside, at their actual value in cash for which they would separately <em>bona fide </em>sell; but, in the case of bonds issued by a domestic corporation or by foreign corporations doing business in this state, a different method of assessment and collection is provided by § 4 of the Act of June 30, 1885, which requires that the treasurer of each corporation shall, upoA payment of interest, assess a three-mills tax upon the nominal or par value of the bond and withhold the same from the interest paid to the bondholder; and, instead of paying it to the bondholder, turn it over into the state treasury of Pennsylvania. Although the act designated the treasurer as the person to assess and collect the tax, the account is rightly settled against the corporation. Said Clark, J.: ‘We are clear in our convictions that if there is any constitutional authority to impose the tax under the fourth section of the act, the settlement by the accounting officer was rightly made against the company. The act constitutes the company, or its treasurer as such, the collector of the tax, and, upon failure to discharge the duty imposed by law, the settlement is properly made against the company whose servant he is, as in the case of the default of any other officer of the government upon whom a like duty is imposed. The obligation rests upon the company; <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>but, as the company can only act through its officers, the default of the officers is a scheme for the default of the company and the penalty is visited upon them: ’ Com. v.
