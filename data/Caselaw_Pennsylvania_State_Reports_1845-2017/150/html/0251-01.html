T. S. Lewis, one of the defendants, on Dec. 31, 1888, demanded of plaintiff one fourth of the year’s crop which had been stored in the granary but had not been divided or set apart, alleging that he was co-tenant with Ziegler and wife for a moiety of the farm. Plaintiff denied Lewis’s right and declared that he held under Ziegler and wife and was accountable to them only; but informed Lewis how many bushels he had raised. Thereupon Lewis, with the other defendants, against the protest of plaintiff, broke open the granary and counted out and took away one fourth of the crop. Ziegler and wife had been in exclusive possession of the farm for twenty-five years under claim of title, and plaintiff had occupied it as their tenant under divers leases for eight years, and accounted to them alone.</p>

(8) If he was the landlord he has no right to enter upon these premises to take this property. Notice of non-payment of rent gave right of distress, and not of forcible entry and seizure of these goods.

The declaration following the writ charges that defendant did enter and break the barn of plaintiff and carried away the property of plaintiff. Plaintiff having averred in his declaration that defendant broke and entered his barn and there carried away his grain, defendant may show that the barn was not the barn of plaintiff, as is alleged in the declaration, but, on the contrary, that he had as much right to enter the barn as plaintiff himself had, because it is proposed to show by the conveyance offered in evidence that Thomas S. Lewis, one of the defendants, was an owner in common of the land with the party under whom plaintiff claims. This being so, as the action now stands, we think that it is proper evidence to give to the jury to enable them to determine whether the entry of defendant was unlawful or not, and for these reasons we overrule the objections and admit the evidence. Exception, and bill sealed. [1]</p>

He had a paper title by deed made in 1866, the trespass complained of took place in 1888, and there was no pretence that he had been in actual possession of the land between those dates. On the contrary the legal possession was in the Zieglers under claim of exclusive title, and the actual occupation was by plaintiff as their tenant.</p>
    <p id="b280-7" data-blocks='[["BL_280.10",280,[288,1222,1163,755]]]'>Even under defendant’s claim of title, plaintiff was in lawful occupation of the whole of the land, for his lessors’ possession was <em>per mie et per </em>tout, though they and perhaps he might be liable to an account for plaintiff’s share of the profits. Plaintiff’s occupation of the land being lawful, his title to the crops which had been severed and become personalty, was clear and exclusive. If defendant claimed adversely as joint owner of the land, then there was no contract with him as to rent and his only right was to mesne profits, or for use and occupation, in either case an unliquidated claim that could not be enforced by summary caption of the goods. If on the other hand he claimed as landlord in affirmance of the lease from his co-tenants, then he clearly had no title to the grain, for it had not yet been divided or set apart: Burns v.

The statement is as much a narr in trespass <em>de bonis asportatis </em>as in <em>quare clausum </em>fregit, and the gravamen of the action is the carrying away of the grain. As that was without legal justification the defendants became trespassers <em>ab </em>initio, and the jury should have been directed to find for plaintiff.</p>
