He was addicted to the use of liquor, but was nevertheless of thrifty and saving habits. For the past twenty-five years he has lived in the borough of South Bethlehem, and during twenty-one years of that period has been employed at the blast furnace of the Bethlehem Iron Co. His wife and five children are all dead, his wife having died in 1879. Out of his earnings he accumulated enough to buy a lot of land in South Bethlehem upon which he built five tenement houses. Four of these were rented to tenants who paid rent aggregating on an average about twenty-eight dollars per month, the fifth he occupied himself. Ellen McConlogue, one of the defendants, was a niece of the plaintiff’s wife, her maiden name being Ellen Nolan. When she was fourteen 3’ears of age she went to live with her aunt, and since that time up to the commencement of this suit, being a period of about seventeen years, lived in the family of plaintiff or in his house with him. In September, 1885, she was married to James McConlogue, the other defendant. After the death of her aunt, Ellen McConlogue, then Ellen Nolan and about twenty-one years of age, became plaintiff’s housekeeper and performed all the labor connected with the management of the <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>household affairs. It was the plaintiff’s habit during this period to deposit all the money earned by his labor as well as that derived from the rental of his houses in a drawer of the bureau in one of the rooms of his house. To this money the plaintiff and Ellen McConlogue had equal access and apparently equal control over its disbursement. Out of this fund taxes, insurance premiums, store bills and general household expenses were paid by both or either of them as it might happen, and out of its accretions plaintiff, after his wife’s death, built two of his houses. While these relations existed between them, plaintiff, oh March 10, 1883, made his will in which he left all his property to the said Ellen McConlogue, describing her as his ‘ esteemed adopted daughter.’ Two years later, on Eeb. 14, 1885, he made and delivered to the defendant Ellen McConlogue a fee simple deed of all his property above mentioned. It is explained by the plaintiff, and is doubtless, true primarily, that the deed of Feb. 14, 1885, was made by him because of a suit threatened to be brought against him as one of the trustees on the bond of a defaulting tax collector. In the following year, 1886, on August 10, Ellen McConlogue, then married to her co-defendant, reconveyed the said real estate to the plaintiff. Matters stood thus in July, 1887. Somewhere about the first of July, the exact date not being fixed by any of the witnesses, plaintiff had a stroke of paralysis. He was attended by a physician who paid him five visits, and who describes the attack as ‘ only a partial attack.’ In the first week of this illness, plaintiff went up and down stairs, dressed and undressed himself, and went once to church alone. About two or three weeks after this stroke plaintiff executed a deed bearing date July 19, 1887, conveying all his real estate to Ellen McConlogue. The consideration named in the deed is ‘five hundred dollars, and natural love and affection and services rendered me as my housekeeper from the death of my beloved wife,’ but no money was in point of fact paid to plaintiff by Ellen McConlogue. The deed was prepared by John Kline, Esq., an- attorney at law, its execution was witnessed by him, the only witness, and the acknowledgment taken by him as notary public. It is alleged on the part of the plaintiff that at the time of the execution of this deed he was not in the full possession of his mental faculties, and <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>that, owing to the enfeebled condition of his mind and the fraud and imposition practiced on him by Ellen McConlogue, the deed was improperly obtained and that he did not know what he was doing. After the deed was executed and delivered to Ellen McConlogue, plaintiff continued—up to the time of the bringing of the suit and the taking of the testimony—to collect the rent of the houses conveyed by the deed and exercised all the rights of ownership. It is claimed on the part of the plaintiff that he did not know the contents of the deed executed by him on July 19, 1887, and did not discover its import until long after. This is denied by the defendants. On Jan. 28, 1889, after a conference with Ashton C. Borhek who was a creditor of plaintiff, plaintiff met the defendant Ellen McConlogue and A. C. Borhek, at the office of John Kline, Esq. At that interview Ellen' McConlogue executed and delivered to Mr. Borhek a mortgage on the premises in dispute to secure the payment of $681.75, a debt due Borhek from the plaintiff. This was done at plaintiff’s request. It is also asserted by the defendants, but denied by plaintiff, that at the same time the plaintiff stated that the deed in controversy was his voluntary act, and upon his acknowledging that the signature was his genuine signature or mark, Borhek added his name as a witness thereto. The bill in this suit was filed March 28, 1889.”</p>

The plaintiff says that a long time before the deed was actually made Ellen McConlogue asked him to deed this property to her and that he then announced to her his determination to give her half and his niece Mary Ann the other half. He says that Mrs. McConlogue then began to cry and he walked away. Under the decisions this is not undue influence. Mrs. McConlogue recites the same conversation substantially, but says that it was on the morning the deed was made and that it ended in plaintiff’s consenting to make the conveyance and directing her to send for the attorney to prepare the instrument.

This was the case of an agreement between a woman of great age and impaired mind, by which she relinquished a testamentary charge upon her son’s farm, which was her sole support, in consideration of his payment to her annually of a sum of money which was about • one twelfth the amount she was entitled to receive, and which was insufficient to provide her with the bare necessaries of life. In that case there was no proof whatever that the mother had any well settled purpose to add to her son’s worldly situation which found expression in the agreement. There was the relationship of mother and son. There was a finding of fact that her mind was impaired. And most important and significant of all, to cite the language of Justice Sterrett, “the testimony discloses a case of gross misconduct on the part of the appellant, in attempting to overreach his mother by taking advantage of her weak and helpless condition, such as no court in equity can sanction and encourage.” In the case at bar, as the master has already pointed out, there is absolutely no testimony tending to show any misconduct on the part of Ellen McConlogue or her husband.</p>

In this case the court find that the grantee stood in the relation of parent to the grantor. The property conveyed was of the value of $13,000; the consideration was fifteen dollars. There was no other consideration. The conveyance was virtually a gift, and the court concludes its opinion in the case in the following language: ‘ Unless there is something suspicious in the circumstances, or the nature and amount of the gift is such that it ought not to have been accepted even if freely tendered, the donee will not be called upon to show that the transaction was in all respects fair and honest, and in no respect tainted by fraud or undue influence.’ It is also authority for the doctrine that ‘ where the question agitated is a gift, the rule would seem to be more stringent than where the advantage flows from a contract or mutual arrangement.’</p>

    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[275,664,1162,643]]]'>In reference to the question of confidential relation, we are clearly of opinion that no such relation existed. The undisputed testimony shows that Mrs. McConlogue was, for the greater part of the time, the servant of Mr. Gardner, and, from the time of his wife’s death, his housekeeper. In her capacity as servant she performed all the menial services required from a person occupying such a position, attended to all the cooking, washing, scrubbing and other household duties which devolved upon her, until the time of her marriage. From that time Gardner seems to have merely lived with the defendants as a boarder, upon consideration that they were to occupy the house without any charge for rent, and that he was to furnish the fuel consumed in the house.</p>
    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[280,1325,1161,591]]]'>While it is true that Mrs. McConlogue was, to a certain extent, in custody of the rent and other moneys which were received by or for Mr. Gardner, it is also true that he had entirely free access thereto and the use thereof, and continued in the reception of the income of the property until the time of his death. There is no evidence that she, at any time, appropriated any portion of these moneys to her use, and there does not appear to be any allegation or proof that she was paid any money by way of compensation for her services. We fail to discover any evidence establishing a relation of trust or confidence on her part other than such as would exist between a master and a faithful servant.</p>

After some further conversation, Kline went out and got a blank deed and brought it back, and wrote the deed in the old man’s presence, and he testified: “After the deed was written, I read it over to him. Q. The whole deed? A. Yes; and explained it to him. I told him what it contained, and he expressed satisfaction. Q. What did he say ? A. He said it is all right, she is the only one I care anything for.” He described the execution of the deed and its acknowledgment, and testified that, in his opinion, Gardner was, at the time of executing the deed, of sound and disposing mind.

He also made at least one will in her favor, giving her all his property, and finally made the deed in question at a time when he supposed he had not long to live.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[143,1034,1172,1055]]]'>In addition to the foregoing, he most distinctly confirmed and ratified the deed, by having Mrs. McConlogue and her husband execute a mortgage upon this very property, to secure a debt of $600 which he owed to A. C. Borhek. This gentleman was examined as a witness and testified that he had some hesitancy about accepting the mortgage, because the deed of July 19, 1887, only had one attesting witness, and thereupon Gardner acknowledged, in January, 1889, to Borhek and Kline, that he had executed the deed, and Borhek signed it as an attesting witness. Kline also testified to the same facts, and, in view of this testimony, the finding of the master that this was a ratification of the deed, was not only justified, but peremptorily required by the overwhelming weight of the evidence. The mortgage was a direct asserting of the title of the mortgagors, and that title was literally created by the very deed which the grantor is seeking by this proceeding to have set aside. He certainly could not be permitted to do this as against the mortgagee, whom he induced to accept the mortgage as a valid security for his debt. As a distinct act of ratification, it was just as efficacious as between him and his grantee in the deed.</p>

In this finding, also, we concur. It was not at all necessary that there should have been an original contract to compensate Mrs. McConlogue for her services in order to sustain the validity of the deed. It is quite sufficient if it appear, as it abundantly does, that services were rendered by the grantee to the grantor, and, by the recital in <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>the deed, these services were distinctly recognized as, at least, a part of the consideration upon which the deed was executed. In addition to that, the grantee voluntarily, but at the request ■of the grantor, encumbered the property with a mortgage to secure a debt of the grantor to the extent of $600, and that was, in any point of view, a valuable consideration in support of the conveyance, although it occurred after the deed was made. This transaction was binding upon the grantor by wa,y of ratification of the original deed, by way of estoppel, both as against the creditor who accepted the mortgage upon the faith of the title, and as against the grantee who assumed a pecuniary obligation of the grantor, and as an added consideration to the original consideration of services long-continued and valuable in their character, rendered by the grantee to the grantor.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[275,1124,1181,1061]]]'>All the features we have thus referred to establish a wide difference between this case and those which usually appear in the books, in which courts of equity do occasionally, and for reasons specially operative, exercise the very delicate power of setting aside executed obligations and conveyances of property. We do not consider that any of the persuasive reasons which influence courts in the exercise of this power are present here. For in this case the grantee was not a volunteer, but a meritorious party, who had actually furnished a valuable consideration in the form of substantial personal services for a number of years, of which the grantor had received the full benefit. Added to this, she assumed a pecuniary obligation of the grantor at his request to the amount of $600, and conferred a distinct lien upon the property to that extent. The principles upon which a voluntary conveyance are set aside in equity have no application in such a case. It is, moreover, absolutely certain that the grantor knew thoroughly well what he was doing when he executed the deed in question, and thereby did precisely what he intended to do, and had done twice before, both by deed and. by will, and it therefore cannot possibly be said that he acted in ignorance of the consequences of the transaction.</p>
    <p id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[276,2193,1164,247]],["BL_141.1",141,[138,408,1163,452]]]'>But, in addition to this, it is testified most positively by the legal adviser who drew the deed, that he received and literally carried out, the specific instructions of the grantor in the preparation of the deed; that he read over the deed to the grantor and explained its contents to him before it was signed, and that <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>he had been, and was, in the habit of rendering professional services to the grantor on other occasions, and had ample reason to suppose he was doing so ill this instance. Therefore it cannot be said that the grantor did not have the benefit of independent legal advice. There is not the slightest reason to discredit the testimony of the legal adviser who performed this service. He is entirely disinterested, and a thoroughly reputable gentleman and lawyer, and there is not a shred of testimony in the case impugning either his veracity or his integrity.</p>
    <p id="b141-6" data-blocks='[["BL_141.6",141,[137,867,1163,964]]]'>To cap the climax of the mass of testimony tending so powerfully to establish the validity of the deed in question, there is entirely undisputed evidence of an explicit act of subsequent ratification eighteen months after the execution of the deed. This included, not merely a fresh consideration given, but a new and specific declaration of the formal execution of the deed, and a new attestation of it by another and independent witness. The testimony on this subject is of the most satisfactory and conclusive character, it is entirely trustworthy in every respect, and no court could possibly disregard it in the just performance of its duty. There is no pretence that the grantor was not at this time perfectly conscious of the act he was doing, that he was not in the full possession of his faculties, or that he was in any degree influenced against his will or his desire. On the contrary, the giving of the mortgage for his own debt by the grantee in the deed and her husband, who were not subject to any legal obligation to do so, was done at his personal instance and desire, and for his own personal benefit and advantage.</p>
    <p id="b141-7" data-blocks='[["BL_141.7",141,[138,1838,1161,399]]]'>It is only necessary to add, that the account given by Gardner, who was examined as a witness, of the circumstances occurring at the execution of the deed, is simply absurd, and quite unworthy of belief. It is interested testimony, at the best, and is so incredible in its details, and so entirely opposed to all the other testimony as to the same transaction, that no court or jury could give it credence. It was not believed by the master or court below, and it is not believed by us.</p>

    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.6",142,[274,511,1162,603]]]'>Nor do we consider that there was any unreasonable importunity on the part of Mrs. McConlogue in obtaining the execution of the deed. We discover no evidence of anything more than a moderate and proper solicitation, and but little of that. As she had rendered him valuable service through many years, and as he had once before conveyed the whole property to her, which she had reconveyed at his request, she had a reasonable right to expect that, in making another deed to her, he would do the same as he had done before, and if she had gone beyond any solicitation appearing in the testimony, she would have been fully justified in doing so, and within the limit allowed by the law.</p>
    <p id="b142-7" data-blocks='[["BL_142.7",142,[268,1122,1164,1059]]]'>Upon a review of the whole of the testimony, we quite agree with the master and court below, in finding that Jeremiah Gardner was mentally competent to convey his property on June 19, 1887, that no fraud or imposition was practiced upon him in the procurement of the disputed conveyance, and that he was not influenced to execute it by any undue solicitation ; that the defendant, Ellen McConlogue, had rendered much valuable service to Gardner during a long period of time, which was duly recognized by him, and which constitutes a good consideration for the deed in controversy; that she was not disqualified from receiving the deed by any relation of trust or confidence to him; that there was a distinct and emphatic subsequent ratification of the deed, and an additional consideration then furnished in support of the deed by Mrs. McConlogue, and that there is no sufficient reason why a court of equity should interfere to set aside the deed in question. The report of the learned master in the court below is an extremely able, exhaustive and calmly judicial review of all the evidence in the case, and of the law applicable in the consideration of this class of cases, and we think the learned court below was entirely justified in its disposition of the exceptions to the report.</p>
