There was no competent evidence to overcome the prima facies of the plaintiffs’ case. The contention that the grantee named in the deed, never accepted it, and hence that there was no delivery, is not sustained by the evidence. There was no proof of non-acceptance. The uncontradicted testimony shows that John P. Ingles and his wife signed, sealed and delivered the deed in the presence <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>of two witnesses on the 7th day of April, 1853, and on the same day acknowledged it in due form of law before a justice of the peace of Fayette county, and that it was recorded in the recorder’s office of Fayette county on the 16th day of April, 1853. This was prima facie evidence of execution and delivery. In Rigler v.

    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[113,974,1172,1105]]]'>Nor do we see any force in the contention that George H. Ingles, the vendee, did not enter into actual possession under his deed, and that the statute of limitations was a bar to the plaintiffs’ claim. It was said in Olwine v. Holman, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20Pa.%20284" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="23 Pa. 284">23 Pa. 284</a>, that a vendor, after conveyance and delivery of possession, is to be regarded as a trustee for the vendee, so far as regards the possession, just as he was a trustee of the title before conveyance. If he wishes to change the character of the possession, he must manifest his intention by some act of hostility to the title of his vendee, plainly indicating to the latter the intention to deny his right, and to hold adversely to it. The same doctrine is asserted in Buckholder v. Sigler, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 154" data-case-ids="481805" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0154-01">7 W. &amp; S. 154</a>. This well established rule applies with special force between a father and his son. In such instances, it is not unusual for the vendee to leave the vendor in possession for an indefinite period, or for life. Such transactions are often arrangements to suit the family convenience. The possession of the vendor is the possession of the vendee, and until some unequivocal act is done by the vendor, the knowledge of which is brought home to the vendee, tending to show that the former holds adversely, no question of the statute of limitations can arise.</p>
