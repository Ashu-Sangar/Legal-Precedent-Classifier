N. 181. The purpose was entirely legitimate and the cestuis que trust, with one exception, appear to be willing that it shall be carried out on the lines indicated by the testatrix. The way is stopped, however, by two legal principles. One is that the gift of an absolute estate carries with it every incident of ownership. The testatrix infringed 'this principle when she gave such an interest to the donees and then tied up their hands from exercising any proprietary rights. She might have cut down the absolute estate to a life interest by a simple direction that the donees were to have the use and income for life, as in Urich v. Merkel, <a href="/pa/81/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="81 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="1044098" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0332-01">81 Pa. 332</a> ; or by a formal trust, as in Sheet’s Estate, <a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">52 </a><a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a><a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">Pa. 257</a>. Her intent, however, was not to reduce the original estate, but to fetter it; and to fetter it moreover with a trust of indefinite duration. On this point, Strong, J., said in Sheet’s Estate, supra, ‘ No principle is better settled than that if a testator in one part of his will give to a person an estate of an inheritance of lands, or an absolute interest in personalty, and in subsequent passages unequivocally shows that he means the devisee or legatee to take a lesser interest only, the prior gift is restricted accordingly. ' Subsequent provisions will not avail to take from an estate, previously given, qualities that the law regards as inseparable from it, as, for example, alienability; but they are operative to define the estate given, and to show that what without them might be a fee, was intended to be a lesser right.’ And he adds what seems directly applicable here : ‘ It is difficult to see how the executor could convert an estate into money which had been absolutely and unconditionally given to the testator’s children. It is more than difficult, it is impossible.’ The rule is concisely stated by Mr. Gray, in his work on Perpetuities, § 120: ‘ When a person is entitled absolutely to property, any provision postponing its transfer or payment to him is void; ’ and it has but one exception, in separate use trusts for married women. That the testatrix intended simply to postpone the enjoyment of the estate taken by the first takers and not to substitute a lesser interest, is evident not only from the absence of any limitations over, but from her direction to the trustee to pay over all moneys, principal as well as income, from time to time, to the parties to whom she had given the absolute estate. The trust was therefore directly in conflict with the principle which forbids the non-alienability of such an estate, and it was also obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities. The trustee was at liberty to exercise his functions until two thirds of the persons interested under the will should see fit to order a sale. These were not necessarily children of the testatrix, but might be remote descendants who were not living at her death. But until that demand was made, there was a mere power to sell; nothing short of an imperative direction to sell, irrespective of contingencies and independent of discretion, being able to <em>work </em>a conversion: Peterson’s Ap., 7 Nor. 403. Hence the power might have continued to subsist beyond a life or lives in being <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>and twenty-one years thereafter. It is not necessary to inquire whether or how an effective trust might have been created which would have subserved the purpose which was contemplated by this will. Mr. Gray says: ‘If a term is given to trustees to pay debts and, subject to the term, the property is devised to A, the interest of A is vested, and, like all vested interests, is not obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities: ’ Sec. 415. In such case the payment of debts is not a condition precedent, but the vesting is immediate, and the trustees will be regarded as holding in trust for A, subject to the payment of debts. Nothing of the kind was attempted by this testatrix, and we are of opinion that the trust was void, and that the exceptant is entitled to immediate payment.”</p>

    <p class="author" id="ASL" data-blocks='[["BL_609.8",609,[432,698,561,38]]]'>Mb. Chief Justice Paxson,</p>
    <p id="b609-7" data-blocks='[["BL_609.9",609,[145,749,1174,599]]]'>While this is a close case, we are of opinion' that the auditing judge was correct in his conclusions, and that the court below erred in overruling him. I understand it to be conceded that the trust created by the will of Emily W. Cooper was an active trust, and that its purpose was entirely legitimate. The cestui que trustent, with a single exception, are willing that the trusts shall be carried out as directed by the testatrix. The learned court below, however, held that it could not be done, because it was in contravention' of two legal principles. One is that the trust is engrafted upon a fee, and the other is that it creates a perpetuity. The important clause of said will is as follows:</p>
    <p id="b609-8" data-blocks='[["BL_609.10",609,[147,1367,1176,348]]]'>“ I give, devise and bequeath all my property, real, personal or mixed, of whatsoever nature or description, to my children who may be living at the time of my death, share and share alike; if any one of my children shall have died before me leaving children, then the share of such a one shall go to such children; all the said property to be subject to the control of my executor and trustee as hereinafter set forth.”</p>
    <p id="b609-9" data-blocks='[["BL_609.11",609,[149,1724,1176,661]]]'>By the next clause in her will the testatrix appoints her son (appellant) executor of her will and “ trustee of all my property, real, personal or mixed.” She then proceeds to confer upon her executor and trustee certain powers in regard to the management of the real estate, the particulars of which I need not specify further than to say that he is authorized to receive the rents, pay debts and encumbrances ; to'sell the real estate at either public or private sale, and generally to “ do everything whatsoever which may be requisite and necessary in reference to the management ” thereof; and when “ two-thirds of the persons interested in my estate shall so demand to sell my property real or personal and divide the proceeds among those interested under the provisions of this will.”</p>
    <p id="b609-10" data-blocks='[["BL_609.12",609,[193,2394,1131,41]],["BL_610.1",610,[269,392,1170,195]]]'>It will be noticed that the estate is impressed with the trust <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>by the same paragraph which contains the devise to the children. We think the intention of the testatrix, as gathered from the four corners of the will, was accurately stated by the auditing judge in the following paragraph of his opinion :</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[267,595,1172,606]]]'>“ While she bequeaths and devises all her estate unto her children living at her death, and the children of any who were dead leaving children, yet she did not intend to give them an absolute vested interest payable to them and to the possession of which they shall be immediately entitled upon her death. But this vesting in possession she postponed until two thirds of the persons interested in her estate shall demand a final distribution, in which event the executor and trustee shall convert all her estate into cash and divide among those interested under the will. Until this event occurs, however, she placed all her property under the control of her executor, whom she expressly appoints as trustee.”</p>
    <p id="b610-6" data-blocks='[["BL_610.6",610,[263,1209,1176,1069]]]'>It being clear from the terms of the will, that it was the intention of the testatrix to create a trust for a lawful purpose, and for the management of the estate, the court ought not to interfere, unless it involves a violation of an inflexible rule of law. The manner in which the trust is imposed is not material if the intention can be clearly gathered from the will. No particular form of words is necessary to create a trust. It was said by Lord Eldon in King v. Denison, 1 V. <em>&amp; </em>B. 273, that the word “ trust ” not being made use of is a circumstance to be attended to, but nothing more, and if the whole frame of the will created a trust, for the particular purpose of satisfying which the estate is devised, the law is the same, though the word “ trust ” is not used. In Vaux v. Parke, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 19" data-case-ids="481735" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0019-01">7 W. &amp; S. 19</a>, there was an absolute gift which was cut down to a spendthrift trust by a subsequent clause of the will, and this was held valid. In Briggs v. Davis, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20470" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="81* Pa. 470">81* Pa. 470</a>, a trust was imposed after an absolute devise. We do not regard this trust as in any way an illegal restraint upon alienation, for the reason that there is a vested interest in the devisee which he can sell or dispose of at pleasure, and it is only the time of enjoyment of the profits of the same which is provided for.</p>

The mere fact that no time is fixed within which the power of sale must be <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>exercised, does not of itself create a perpetuity. It is sufficient to say that a power to sell and distribute the proceeds, created by a will, must be exercised within a reasonable time. It is always within the power of the orphans’ court to control the exercise of a discretion in such cases upon the application of the parties in interest. A power of sale is good, although no time be limited for its exercise: Marshall’s Estate, <a href="/pa/138/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="138 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="11251516" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0260-01">138 Pa. 260</a>. Aside from this, it was competent for all the parties in interest at any time to defeat the power and to take the property discharged thereof. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trust created a perpetuity.</p>

    <p id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[127,1060,1178,136]]]'>The decree is reversed at the costs of the appellee, the adjudication is affirmed, and distribution ordered in accordance therewith.</p>
