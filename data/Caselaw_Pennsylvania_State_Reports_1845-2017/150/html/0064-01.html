L. 74. The purpose of appellant company complied with this Act. The investment of capital in the purchase and sale of goods manufactured by others was in efféct found by the court to be incidental to and in aid of the manufacturing business. It was in the line of the legislative exemption, and certainly would not defeat the exemption. The laws of New York and New Jersey favor their corporations by grading the tax according to the percentage of capital stock invested in the state. The proviso to the Act of 1889 was in the same direction. The Act of 1874 provides that iron and steel manufacturing companies shall open mines, etc. They make their own coke or mine their own coal, limestone, etc. Yet clearly the proviso to the Act of 1889 was designed to encourage such corporations.</p>

There was some reason for using the terms employed in the latter Act. The “ custom of apportionment ” was undoubtedly sought to be abolished by the Act of 1889. The experience of the commonwealth under the Act of 1885 was fresh in the minds of the Legislature. It knew how corporations organized for different purposes had escaped taxation by this custom. The only legitimate construction of the Act of 1889 is to keep those corporations within their proper limits. If their chartered powers are not exclusively for manufacturing purposes and they have-not disclaimed or surrendered these powers that are other than manufacturing, they are not exempt, or if they are chartered for partly manufacturing purposes, but invest their stock in other business, they are not entitled to the exemption, as they ought to be held to be doing that for which they are organized to do.

It was simply a printing and publishing business, and applied to the printing and publishing of books and newspapers. Defendant does not come under the class mentioned and intended in either of these Acts. Its charter must have been granted under § 2, clause 18 of the Act of 1874, P. L. 74. If so it was^ chartered or organized for a different purpose from that set forth in § 12, and it cannot be claimed that it comes within the provisions of the Act of 1851. Applying the principle that exemptions from taxation must be strictly construed, the claim of defendant cannot be allowed under the exemption clause of the Act of 1889.

Upon these findings the court was of opinion that the company did not come within the last proviso to the 21st section of the Act of June 1, 1889, exempting from taxation “ corporations, limited partnerships and joint stock associations organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes, and actually carrying on manufacturing within the state,” and therefore held it liable to taxation upon its entire capital. The appellant contends that upon the court’s finding it was within the proviso, and therefore exempt from taxation, or, if not wholly exempt, that it was at most taxable on that part, only, of its capital which was not employed in manufacturing. This contention raises the question of the proper interpretation of the phrase “ organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes ; ” and a further question of construction of the whole proviso.</p>

An organ is defined to be an instrument or medium by which an action is performed or an object accomplished.

A corporation being thus organized is of course organized for a purpose, not aimlessly and indefinitely, but necessarily for a purpose which it has capacity to accomplish. Being the creature ’ of law it has capacity to accomplish that only which it is expressly or by necessary implication authorized by its charter to do : Commonwealth v. E. &amp; N. E. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/27/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="27 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="979639" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0339-01">27 Pa. 339</a>. The defendant’s charter authorized it to manufacture blank books and stationery, and, what may be considered necessary incidents to that business, to print, lithograph and sell its products. Nothing more being expressed, everything else was excluded. It was therefore organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes, and as it was found to have been actually carrying on manufacturing within the state during the tax year, it was within the proviso exempting manufacturing companies from taxation.</p>
    <p id="b97-6" data-blocks='[["BL_97.6",97,[168,1468,1162,960]],["BL_98.1",98,[267,402,1166,752]]]'>But it does not follow that a company which is organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes and which actually carries on manufacturing within the state but which employs part of its capital in other than its strictly manufacturing operations is wholly exempt from taxation. To so hold would be to offer a premium to such companies for transgressing their charters, and to give them an advantage over others with which they might come in competition outside of their legitimate field of operations, which the legislature cannot be presumed to have intended. The 20th section of the Act of June 30, 1885, would seem to be more sweeping than the proviso under consideration. It was therein enacted “ That the taxes laid upon manufacturing corporations by and under the revenue laws of this commonwealth, be and the same are hereby abolished as to such corporations, and the laws under which such taxes are laid and collected be and the same are hereby repealed so far, and so far only as they apply to manufacturing corporations.” The difference between the two being that the proviso of 1889 <em>ex vi termini </em>excludes from the exemption <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>manufacturing companies not exclusively organized as such, while the Act of 1885 by its letter relieves from the burden of taxation all manufacturing corporations whether they are exclusively such or not. Under the latter it was held, in Commonwealth v. Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal Co., <a href="/pa/129/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="129 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="568026" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0346-01">129 Pa. 346</a>, that a company whose principal business was the manufacturing of steel rails, but which had invested part of its capital in mining property, city lots, bonds and mortgages and store goods was not exempt from taxation on that part of its capital that was so invested otherwise than in its strictly manufacturing operations. The reasons given in support of that judgment apply with equal force to the present ease and need not be repeated here. They require that the present defendant pay tax upon so much of its capital as is employed outside of its legitimate field of operations.</p>
    <p id="b98-6" data-blocks='[["BL_98.5",98,[267,1164,1163,194]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and judgment is now entered in favor of the commonwealth and against the William Mann Company for the sum of three hundred and seventeen dollars and ninety-nine cents and costs.</p>
