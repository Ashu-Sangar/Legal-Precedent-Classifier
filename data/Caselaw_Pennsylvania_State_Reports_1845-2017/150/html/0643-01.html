That said railway company filed a written acceptance of the ordinance of July 7, 1857, whereby it became liable for the costs of maintaining, paving, repairing and repaving said street. That about 1858, said railway company tore up the macadam pavement then existing on said street, laid its tracks and paved with cobble stones for the space of eighteen feet in width. That said railway had repaired and kept said paving in repair and had also repaired the macadam road, and entered into a contract with the Frankfort &amp; Bristol Turnpike Co.

The prayers were for an injunction restraining (1) paving, (2) filing claims and collecting cost from property owners, (3) paying cost of intersections out of city funds, and (4) further relief.

I am not able to discover any such reason. Indeed, in my judgment, all doubt upon that point should be regarded as out of place in view of the case of the <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>city of Pbila. v.

One ground of defence was that it was the duty of the passenger railway company occupying the street to pay for the paving. That company by the terms of its act of incorporation, was made subject ‘ to the provisions of all ordinances heretofore or that may be hereafter passed by the councils of the city, regulating city passenger railways.’ It is to be taken as a fact that the company entered into the same sort of obligation to comply with the provisions of the ordinance of 1857 as that which was entered into by the railway company occupying Frankford avenue. Such an obligation was required by that ordinance, and it is to be presumed that it was given.</p>

By the act of April 23, 1829, P.

A clear distinction has been recognized between a mere artificial road-bed and a paved road-bed. This was expressly stated in the act of April 1, 1864, P. L. 187, in which it was provided that, upon the petition of a majority of the owners of the ground on any of the streets in certain wards not already paved, councils might direct that the said streets ‘ shall be macadamized in a suitable manner, instead of being paved.’ Four years later the act of March 13, 1868, P. L. 316, also extended the provisions of prior statutes, authorizing the owners of a majority of feet upon any street to have the same paved, to macadamizing or turnpiking streets in the rural wards of the city.

It would be an unreasonable interpretation of the ordinance which ■would subject the company to the expense of an entirely new pavement for either the whole or a part of the width of the street, simply because it had voluntarily paved a portion of it and maintained it for its own advantage, but doubtless to the convenience of the public as well.. If it was not bound to pave that portion of the street, it is difficult to see how its voluntary act could have created any greater liability than would otherwise have existed. If that paving had been done at the cost of the city or the property-owners, I should regard the point taken as meritorious—at least, to the extent of so much of the proposed contract as would cover the portion of tbe street so paved. The fact, however, being different, I cannot perceive any merit in the position.</p>
