A. Some days he would come in; he owned a farm in Bucks county; had money enough to buy the whole row. Q. He would say that? A. Yes, sir. Maybe next day he would come in and put out a poor mouth; he hadn’t any work and wasn’t able to work, and his family did so and so, gone back on him, and he couldn’t work. I said, ‘ What is the use of working ? ’ ‘ Aint got one cent to rub against another.’ That would be the way most of the time. When he came there I would run out of the house, because if you did not coincide with him, say yes or no to everything he said, you would have a fuss. That was the kind of a man he was. Q. What else can you recollect? A. It would take a volume to hold it. Banshees and witch-crafts and one thing another. That was all his conversations. You couldn’t get shut of him. Q. What did he say about banshees and witchcrafts ? A. He said one time he was putting up in Ireland under a bridge and the carpenters were there, and there was a banshee up on top the bridge throwing stones down on the carpenters. [Q.

These persons were intimately acquainted with Martin Gray, Coleman for six and Colket for twenty years immediately preceding his death. They had frequent and friendly intercourse with him and abundant opportunity to observe his condition and note the changes in it during the last years of his life. From this acquaintance and observation they formed opinions respecting his sanity at the time of .the execution of the contested will, which they were allowed to express on the trial. These opinions were admitted under objection by the appellants and it is now argued that a sufficient foundation was not laid for them in the testimony of the witnesses concerning the actions of the testator and their acquaintance and conversations with him. In this contention we do not concur. We cannot say that the testimony affords no basis for an inference that he was of unsound mind. We have carefully examined it and are satisfied that in the admission of the opinions complained of in the third and fourth <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>assignments no error was committed. These opinions were proper for the consideration of the jury and it was their duty to scrutinize and weigh them in connection with the facts on which they were formed.

    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[269,709,1161,1208]]]'>The last question and answer in the testimony of James Murphy and embraced in the seventh assignment were clearly inadmissible. A belief respecting the sanity of a testator founded on a provision in his will is neither satisfactory nor competent evidence. In this case the witness was asked whether he believed the testator “ would have cut his only child off with fifty dollars if he had been in his sound mind,” and the reply was “ I do not, as his son is worthy of his property, being a poor working man.” Certainly the right of a citizen to dispose of his property as he chooses cannot be frittered away on such testimony as this. It is proper to say that the counsel for the appellee do not contend that the evidence complained of was competent, but they allege that it was not excepted to, and for that reason cannot be considered here. In this contention they are not sustained by the record. It shows that the deposition was read, that objection was made to the opinions therein expressed, and to the question relating to the testator’s declaration about the division of his property, and that an exception was taken to the ruling of the court, upon the objections. It does not show that any portion of the deposition was rejected or omitted. The remark of the learned judge referred to the order rather than to the competency of the testimony and was to the effect that the evidence as to acts should precede the opinions based on them.</p>
