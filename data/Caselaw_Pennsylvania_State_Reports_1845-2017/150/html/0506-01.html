Stuart, the exceptant, who is a subsequent judgment creditor, has any standing to contest the validity of the judgment taken upon the Zug mortgage so far as relates to the $800 included therein as the amount to be recovered under the five per cent commission clause in the mortgage. It is said in McNaughton’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%2055" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 55">101 Pa. 55</a>.0, that ‘ the general and well-established rule is, that an auditor, in the distribution of money in court, cannot inquire into the validity of a judgment regular on its face ; but it is equally well settled that a collusive judgment may be attacked collaterally by judgment or execution credi<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>tors who would otherwise be defrauded thereby. Whenever such a judgment, or the execution issued thereon, thus comes in conflict with the claims of creditors, they may avoid its effect by showing that, as to them, it is a nullity: Dougherty’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20196" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 196">9 W. &amp; S. 196</a>; Lewis v.

    <p class="summary" id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[143,754,1168,1268]]]'>“ There is no allegation that there was collusion between the plaintiff and defendant, either in the petitions presented on behalf of Joseph A. Stuart, the subsequent judgment creditor, asking the court to open the judgment to let him into a defence as to the $800 in question, or in the petition presented on his behalf, asking that the money be paid into court that it might be distributed by the auditor. The only allegation is, practically, that the amount of $800, included in the judgment, taken on account of commissions, is excessive. Nor has the auditor found that there was any collusion between the plaintiff and the defendant in the scire facies on the mortgage, which led to the addition of this $800 to the amount of the judgment on the mortgage, and we have not been able to find anything in the evidence which would have warranted the finding that there was collusion. Some evidence was introduced for the purpose of showing that the attorneys of the ^plaintiff and the defendant had some agreement or understanding with respect to a division or appropriation of this commission, but there was no evidence from which the auditor could find, or did find, that there was any agreement or collusion between the plaintiff and the defendant, and it is well settled that the commission, reserved by a clause such as was contained in this mortgage, belongs not to the attorney of the plaintiff, but to the plaintiff, and nothing which might be done with respect to it by the plaintiff’s attorney could, without her consent, affect her rights.</p>
