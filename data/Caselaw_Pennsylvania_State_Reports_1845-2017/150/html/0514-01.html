The evidence in regard to the service of the writ, however, would be taken into consideration by the court, on a question of discretion in regard to opening the judgment, if the defendant’s evidence showed that they had a just defence. The petition and evidence shows that David Heiser, the husband of Catharine M. Heiser, was <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>the owner of stock, or, in other words, was a stockholder in the association, plaintiff, to the amount of f4,200, and that he bought out, or obtained, a loan in the regular way that business is transacted in such associations, paying a premium therefor. A mortgage, the one in suit in this case, was executed by Mr. Heiser and his wife upon her separate real estate to secure this loan with interest, premium and fines. It is contended that if the plaintiff can recover at all, it can only recover the amount actually loaned, with legal interest, as Mrs. Heiser was a married woman at the time she executed the mortgage upon her separate estate, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Wolbach et ux. v. Lehigh Building Association, <a href="/pa/84/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="84 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1053527" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0211-01">84 Pa. 211</a>. But the case of Juniata Building and Loan Association v. Mixell et ux., same book, page 813, rules the present case. In that case it was decided that ‘where a married woman unites with her husband in executing a mortgage on her separate property to secure a loan to her husband which he, as a stockholder, procured from a building and loan association, it is a valid mortgage on her separate property, and under the Act of 1859 covers the premiums due by him as such stockholder, and the fines incurred by reason of his default in the payment of dues.’ That decision is binding upon this court, and so far as this branch of the case is concerned, it must be decided against the defendants. . . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b541-3" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[119,1615,1168,444]]]'>“ This judgment was taken in accordance with the practice and the law, to take judgment for the amount of the penalty in the bond recited in the mortgage, but of course no more can be collected than the real debt or sum for which it was given to secure, and it is usual and right in issuing executions to direct how much money the sheriff is to collect. As that was not done in this case, a question of costs may arise, but with that we have nothing to do at present, as another writ must issue in order to collect the real debt due.</p>
