In respect to bills, notes and other commercial paper, the rule is even more stringent, the law casting on the holder the burthen of disproving an apparent, material alteration on the face of the paper. . . . The ground of the .rule is public policy, to insure the protection of the instrument from fraud and substitution.”</p>
    <p id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.6",55,[99,709,1176,657]]]'>In Craighead v. McLoney, <a href="/pa/99/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="99 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="446075" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0211-01">99 Pa. 211</a>, Chief Justice Sharswood said: “ My own opinion is that the courts have gone far enough in permitting writings to be tampered with...... It is evident that any tampering with the instrument which imposes upon the party a burden or a peril, which he would not else have incurred, is an injury to him, and therefore material. It is a mistake to infer that whether .the pecuniary liability is increased, or the time of payment changed, is the test. In these respects the party may be no worse, yet his rights and •remedies on the instrument may be seriously affected. Wherever this is so, it does not matter that the alteration was entirely honest, with no fraudulent intent.” The same doctrine was held and enforced in Marshall v. Gougler, 10 S. &amp; R. 164.</p>
    <p id="b55-9" data-blocks='[["BL_55.7",55,[104,1374,1172,1117]]]'>In the present ease not the slightest attempt was made to show that the alteration in the time of payment was made with the knowledge or consent of James Corboy, the defendant. In point of fact, lie was examined as a witness and testified that he had no such knowledge, and no testimony in contradiction of this was given. The whole testimony presented the case of a deliberate attempt to change and alter the contract of indorsement, made by the defendant, upon a note payable at four months to one payable at ninety days, entirely without his consent. It matters not the least whether the alteration was made innocently or in the belief that such a change could lawfully be made without the consent of the indorser. It is against public policy to permit such things to be done, and the law will not tolerate it. The facts in the case of Kountz v. Kennedy, <a href="/pa/63/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="63 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1018934" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0187-01">63 Pa. 187</a>, have no analogy to those of this case. This indorser might have been willing to indorse a note at four months and not willing to indorse one at three months, and as there is not the slightest evidence that he ever agreed or consented to the alteration in the contract he did make, or even had knowledge of it, the indorsement is invalidated as to him, and there can be no recovery against him. The assignments of error are all sustained. Judgment reversed.</p>
