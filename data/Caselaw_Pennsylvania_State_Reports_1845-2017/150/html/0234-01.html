The Act of June 1,1889, § 27, is merely a reenactment and continuation of § 10 of the Act of June 7,1879, which re-enacted § 6 of the Act or May 1, 1868, all of which imposed the same tax upon the net earnings of the class of corporations specified. But it was expressly decided in Phila. Contributionship for Insurance v.

Justice Sterrett, delivering the opinion of the court, said: ‘ It may be conceded that the bonds, as such, are not taxable by the commonwealth; but the tax in question is not laid on the bonds. It is a tax on the corporate franchise of the plaintiff in error, measured by its net earnings. The right of the state to impose a tax on the franchise of any corporation that is indebted to it for existence and protection is too clear for argument. If the right exists, as it undoubtedly does, the manner of its exercise must be left to the wisdom of the Legislature; and perhaps no standard or measure of taxation can be adopted that will operate more justly and equitably than a per centum on net earnings or income. . . . But, as already intimated, the tax is not laid on the money and other receipts of the company. Its net earnings or income is resorted to simply as a just measure of the tax to be paid for the enjoyment of its corporate franchise.’</p>

The Legislature did not impose any condition that defendant should act as assessor and collector of state taxes, when it admitted the corporation to do business in the state.

The fund which it is here sought to reach is not property in Pa. Hence the proceeding is in the nature of garnishment, to which a foreign corporation is not subject: Rorer, Inter-State Law, 128, 129; 8 A. &amp; E. Ency. L. 302. Defendant’s business, under the 8th finding, is inter-state commerce; and, if the obligation to collect this tax is a condition of its doing business here, it conflicts with the commerce clause of the U. S. Const.: N. &amp; W. R. R. v. Pa., <a href="/us/136/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="136 U.S. 114" data-case-ids="1217857" data-case-paths="/us/136/0114-01">136 U. S. 114</a>.
