S. Lancaster Co., Nov. T., 1890, No. 57, to review proceedings locating bridge and changing and laying out public roads approaching same.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum and Hevdriok, JJ.\nProceedings to locate county bridge and approaches under Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 560, and local Act of April 28, 1857, P. L. 338.\nThe record discloses the following state of facts: The petition for appointment of viewers asked for a county bridge \u201c over Conestoga creek at the place where the public highway to the city of Lancaster crosses the said creek near Rank\u2019s Mills, owned by the city of Lancaster, on or at said creek on the line between the townships of Lancaster and East Lampeter,\u201d etc. The order to viewers directed them to view, and, if they saw occasion, to locate the same, and, if necessary, to change the road approaches, to lay out a new road and vacate the old one, etc. The viewers reported in favor of a bridge in the language of the petition, and \u201c having respect to the best site for such bridge in such manner as to do the least injury to private property, .... we are of opinion that a change or variation in the bed or route of said road is necessary and would be an improvement and a substantial benefit, and a saving of expense in the erection of the aforesaid bridge, and we therefore report that it is necessary that the route of said road should be changed, and we change and lay out the said approaches to said bridge in connection with the proposed site for said bridge as follows.\u201d Then follows a description of the courses and distances of the new road, beginning in a public road, then crossing the creek by the proposed bridge and ending \u201cin Orange street as extended.\u201d A draft was attached to the report. The report concluded : \u201cWe had no claim made to us for damages, and taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages to the owners of the land through which said road approaches pass as laid out by us to said bridge, no damages are due and none are awarded. We had the further assurance of the representatives of the owners that no damages were claimed.\u201d\nExceptions were filed by two parties, whose interest is not stated, alleging, inter alia, (1) that the viewers not merely change the approaches but unnecessarily and unlawfully lay out two new roads, one on the east side of the creek almost half a mile long, and one on the west side over one eighth of a mile, and vacate no part of the old highway; (2) the road so laid out does not connect with a public road on the west; (4) the proposed bridge does not cross the creek at of near where any public road crosses; (5) failure to endeavor to procure releases and to report thereon; (6) variation between location recommended and draft and courses and distances, being over one eighth of a mile.\nThe exceptants asked to be allowed to show by depositions that \u201c Orange street extended \u201d was not a public road, but the court, Patterson, J., refused to admit the depositions as offered out of time, dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report. Exceptants then took this writ.\nErrors assigned were (1, 2, 4-6) dismissing exceptions, quoting them, and (3) refusing to hear depositions.\nSimon P. Ehy, for plaintiffs in error; John A. Ooyle, Wm. D. Weaver with him, for defendant in error.\nJuly 13, 1892."
