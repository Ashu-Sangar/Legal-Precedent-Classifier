The witness was asked on direct examination his recollection of what Gns Kontos, one of appellant’s co-defendants, had said upon hearing a radio report that the victim had died. Over objection, the witness responded, “Gus said, oh, no.” Citing <em>Roberts v.

In granting retroactive effect to its <em>Bruton </em>decision, the Supreme Court in <em>Roberts </em>succinctly interpreted the teaching of <em>Bruton </em>to be that, “despite instructions to the jury to disregard the implicating statements in determining the co-defendant’s guilt or innocence, admission at a joint trial of a defendant’s extrajudicial confession implicating a co-defendant violated the codefendant’s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.” <a href="/us/392/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="392 U.S. 293" data-case-ids="6169495" data-case-paths="/us/392/0293-01">392 U.S. at 293</a>.

Although, chronologically speaking, these requests cannot be strictly classified as motions for <em>pretrial </em>discovery,- we cannot ignore our case law and rules on pretrial discovery. Particularly relevant is the last sentence of Pa. R. Crim. P. 310, which provides: “In no event, however, shall the court order pretrial discovery or inspection of written statements of witnesses in the possession of the Commonwealth.” <em>See, Com. v.

In our opinion, we deem <em>Smith </em>to be dis-positive of this appeal and that Rule 310 must be strictly interpreted. <em>Cf., Lewis v. Lebanon Court of Common Pleas, </em><a href="/pa/436/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="436 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="1926044" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0296-01">436 Pa. 296</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=260%20A.2d%20184" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="260 A.2d 184">260 A. 2d 184</a> (1969).</p>
    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[195,732,1152,1633]]]'>In the first place, such a distinction is functional, inasmuch as the traditional rationales for limiting or prohibiting pretrial discovery in criminal cases do not extend to the at-trial situation. Foremost of these rationales has been the fear that more liberalized pretrial discovery would enable the criminal defendant to construct a perjured defense. As Chief Justice Vanderbilt once declared: “In criminal proceedings long experience has taught the courts that often discovery will lead not to honest fact-finding, but on the contrary to perjury and the suppression of evidence. Thus the criminal who is aware of the whole case against him will often procure prejured testimony in order to set up a false defense.” <em>State v. Tune, </em><a href="/nj/13/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="13 N.J. 203" data-case-ids="1329547" data-case-paths="/nj/13/0203-01">13 N.J. 203</a>, 210, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%20881" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="98 A.2d 881">98 A. 2d 881</a>, 884 (1953). The traditional opposition to criminal discovery has also expressed a concern that such advance disclosure might in some cases lead to the attempted intimidation or killing of witnesses for the prosecution. <em>See, e.g., Discovery in Criminal Cases, </em><a href="/citations/?q=44%20F.R.D.%20481" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="44 F.R.D. 481">44 F.R.D. 481</a>, 485 (1968). Even assuming for the moment that these fears have any substantial basis whatsoever, a view which is open to much doubt, it is clear that they have no place in the context of the disclosure at trial of the prior statements of Commonwealth witnesses. Once the Commonwealth’s witnesses have appeared at trial, their personal safety and freedom from potential intimidation are in no way enhanced by denying to the defendant access to their pretrial statements. Nor would the granting of such access to the defendant heighten his opportunity for successful perjury.</p>

In the course of the prosecutor’s direct examination of a Joseph Graciano, the first witness whose prior statement was made available to the defense, Mr. Graciano testified that one' of appellant’s co-defendants asked, “What if he killed the. lady?” . Although Mr. Graciano initially testified that another co-defendant, Gus Kontos, did not reply to this question, with prodding by the prosecutor, this witness later testified that Gus Kontos stated, “If the.old lady dies, I’m not worried”.

The prosecution’s work product and the identity of non-testifying secret informants need not be disclosed. In addition, disclosure is not required for matters where it would involve a substantial risk of grave prejudice to national security. Finally, the trial judge is given a general power- to restrict or defer discovery in exceptional cases upon a showing of cause.</p>
