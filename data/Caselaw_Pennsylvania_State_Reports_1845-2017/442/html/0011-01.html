He was survived by his widow, Frances Anderson, appellee herein, and six minor children.

An amicable settlement of $9500 was reached and approved by the Mercer County Court. The employer filed with the Workmen’s Compensation Board a petition for suspension requesting a determination of the distribution to be made of the settlement among the various beneficiaries and the allocation of credit against compensation to which the employer was entitled under §319 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, which provides for the subrogation rights of an employer.</p>

If he had been survived by a widow and no children, the payment would have been $30.50; if a widow and one child, $36.50; and if a widow and two children, $43.00. Of the amount received in settlement from the third party ($9500), $175 is subtracted for the purpose of this subrogation action, that being the difference between the actual funeral expense ($925) and the statutory burial allowance ($750). This is done because the employer is entitled to credit only for the actual amount it paid toward the funeral expense. The remaining $9325 was distributed to the beneficiaries in accordance with the intestate laws, the widow receiving one-third ($3,-108.33) and the children one-ninth each ($1,036.11).</p>

During that period three of the six children will attain the age of eighteen, and after that period the other three are entitled to receive payments until they reach that age. The parties have agreed that the compensation payable to each of the three younger children, from the expiration of the three hundred fifty week period until their eighteenth birthdays, should be applied against the share that each of them received in the settlement. As to the $47.50 per week payable during the three hundred fifty week period, appellee argues that such amount is hers alone and that, therefore only her one-third share of the settlement counts as the “recovery” which is treated as an advance payment under §319. Appellant argues that the $47.50 is payable in part to the widow ($30.50) and in part to the children ($17.00) and that the whole amount of the settlement should be treated as an advance payment under §319. The Workmen’s Compensation Board held that the employer would only receive credit, or be subrogated, to the extent of the widow’s share of the settlement.

They are said to generate enlarged payments to a widow, or to be entitled to payments on their own, when no eligible widow survives, only upon a showing that they are the deceased’s children and are under the statutory age limit. <em>Smrekar v.

The doctrine of subrogation thus implies the need for some identity between the fund created by the insurance agreement and the fund created by the cause of action against the tortfeasor. . That is, there is implicit in subrogation an equatability between the obligation of the compensation payor and the obligation of the tortfeasor payor, so that the two funds are going to satisfy the same duty, liability or obligation to the same person. Here, appellee’s children are not generating compensation payments on their own behalves and in their own right, even though the compensation payments may be allocable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Recoveries by the children in a wrongful death <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>action, however, are in their own right, upon a showing of damages, while enlarged compensation payments are made without any proof of dependency by the children. <em>"Nordmark v.

The essence of this action is that the compensation carrier is attempting to recover from the wrongful death fund created by the children in their own right Workmen’s Compensation payments it made to the widow which the children could not recover in an action of their own. The obligations satisfied by the funds are not equatable; the parties permitted to recover are not the same.
