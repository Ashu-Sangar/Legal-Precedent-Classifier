(2) if they are liable, is the extent of their liability measured by the actual loss to the authority or the amount of the bond?</p>

On the basis of these plans and specifications, the Authority invited contractors to submit written bids for the accomplishment of the work. Prospective bidders were instructed that each bid must be accompanied by either cash, a certified check or a bond <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>in an amount representing five (5%) per cent of the bid; if a bond was furnished, the surety was subject to approval by the Authority. Bidders were further instructed, in writing: “The successful bidder, upon his failure or refusal to execute and deliver the contract and bonds [performance, labor and materialmen] within ten days after he has received notice of the acceptance of his bid, shall forfeit to the [Authority], <em>as liquidated damages </em>for such failure or refusal, the security deposited with his bid.” (Italics supplied).</p>

On August 21, 1968, the Authority awarded the contract to Gateway at its bid price and notified Gateway of its intention to hold it responsible on its bid. Gateway refused to enter into the contract and was declared in default. The work was then readvertised for bids by the. Authority, Gerl bid $1,220,-366.78 (approximately $217 less than its original bid) and the contract was awarded to Gerl.</p>

After a jury trial, a verdict in the amount of $45,000 was returned in favor of the Authority and against Gateway and Maryland. Motion for a new trial having been refused, an appeal was taken from judgment entered on the verdict.</p>

The thrust of this argument is that, had the court permitted the jury to consider these questions, it could have found that the only harm caused by Gateway’s refusal to enter into the contract was the cost involved in the readvertising for new bids and additional legal expenses which amounted to approximately $1,000 and, therefore, the amount of the bid bond was a penalty and not liquidated damages. With this contention we do not agree.</p>

The instructions to bidders clearly and expressly provided that the amount of the bond should, in the event of default, be considered <em>as liquidated damages </em>and the court below correctly so concluded. It so happens, if appellants’ argument is factually sound, in the case at bar that the actual damages incurred by the Authority <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>was less than the amount of the bond.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Had the actual damages been more than the amount of the bond, the Authority would have been limited to recovery only of the amount of the bond.

The testimony indicates that Gateway’s superintendent, in making up the bid tabulation, had estimated rock excavation at $14 per yard; later Gateway’s president, unknown to the superintendent, changed the $14 per yard to $4 by erasing the “1” and expected the additional $10 per yard to be used in the “pipe” tabulation, thus making up the difference; the ■error was not caught and the total bid was based on the $4 per yard for rock excavation without the $10 difference being made up on the “pipe” tabulation. Gateway and Maryland called an expert witness who testified that, in his opinion, anyone who opened and examined the bids and accompanying bid tabulation should have realized an error had been made. The jury chose not to accept the opinion of this expert.</p>

The Authority had reserved a period of 75 days within which to accept or refuse bids, the purpose obviously being to allow adequate time to ascertain the entire cost of the project for which financing had to be secured. The financing was dependent on the municipal bond market and a grant of Federal funds. Whether such financing resulted in greater cost due to Gateway’s refusal' of the contract was not shown upon the instant record because of the court’s interpretation that the amount of damages was the amount of the bond. Moreover, it is highly questionable whether this additional cost could have been shown with any reasonable accuracy.</p>
