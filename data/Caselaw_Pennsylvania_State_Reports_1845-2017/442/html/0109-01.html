I did it and that’s all there is to it.”’ This conversation took place prior to the actual trial and the imposition of sentence. However, the lower <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>Court made no finding or decision on this point or issue.</p>
