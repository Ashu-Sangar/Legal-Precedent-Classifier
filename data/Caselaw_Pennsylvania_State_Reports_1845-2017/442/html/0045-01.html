After several meetings between the Finance Director and representatives of the said Court, the sum was reduced to $16,488,263, and, on April 1, 1970, this amount was finally sent to City Council by the Mayor in Ms proposed annual operating budget message. On May 4, 1970, President Judge Carroll, Judge D. Donald Jamieson (now President Judge), and Administrative Judge Frank J. Montemuro, together with several members of their administrative staffs, gave extensive testimony before City Council, seeking to document their requests. The Court at this time also requested an increase of $5,-230,817 over the amount proposed in the Mayor’s aforesaid budget of April 1st. Of this sum of $5,230,817, $2,-012,801 had not previously been requested of either the Finance Director or the Mayor prior to the time the Mayor submitted his budget. City Council denied this additional request and approved by ordinance, on May 28, 1970, the amount recommended by the Mayor, i.e., $16,488,263. This total was divided and allocated as follows:</p>

Montgomery, of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, was specially designated by this Court to hear and decide this case. Judge Montgomery promptly held a pretrial conference, at which time the legal issues were delineated and an agreement was worked out by the parties that defendants would hold and keep available sufficient funds to pay any sums ultimately awarded to the Court. On July 27, 1970, Judge Montgomery issued a Pretrial Order, ordering the parties to argue and brief certain issues and temporarily enjoining the defendants from enforcing a “job freeze” ordered by the Mayor against the Court, and also from reducing the Court’s budget. Oral argument was held on August 4, 1970, and Judge Montgomery filed a “Supplemental Pretrial Order” on August 12, 1970. In this Order, Judge Montgomery ruled, inter alia: (1) the Court had the burden of proof to establish the reasonable necessity of its financial requests and none of the parties could take advantage of the usual presumption of reasonableness by virtue of their public office; (2) defendants, as a defense to plaintiff’s demand for additional funds in this action of mandamus, could not “reopen” the earlier budget figures, which had been approved by the Mayor and for which appropriations had been made by the City Council, in order to prove that the present appropriation was being used inefficiently or that a more efficient use of present appropriations would cover some or all of the additional requested items; and (3) defendants had a right to a jury trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">*</a> The record was closed on August 21, 1970, after extensive testimony had been taken and exhibits produced.

Stated differently, the majority essentially holds that whatever amount is “reasonably necessary” for judicial administration must be awarded <em>even though the Gity may have no available funds. </em>With this proposition I cannot agree; in my opinion, the computation of a “reasonably necessary” amount must consider the financial resources available to the city. However, the record demonstrates that these additional funds have already been set aside and that the City of Philadelphia will not be forced into “involuntary bankruptcy.” It is for this fact that I am able to concur.</p>

Unless that majority is prepared to nominate the Judiciary for a <em>primus inter pares </em>status, this question must be answered in the negative. Although the Executive, unlike the Judici<a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>ary, is ofttimes able to resolve these difficulties in the political arena, I would be most reluctant to rely on the mercurial world of politics as the Executive’s only recourse.</p>

The Judiciary has the power to command reasonably necessary funds, not only because of its intended status as an independent and co-equal branch of government but also by virtue of the clear mandate of Article 1, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides: “All courts shall be open; <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>and every man for an injury done Mm in Ms lands, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice admiMstered without sale, denial or delay. . . .” It is evident that these fundamental guarantees could not be honored if the Judiciary were without reasonably adequate resources.</p>

These deprivations are especially unjustifiable in view of the fact that many of those who are accused of crime and jailed before trial are eventually acquitted. In Philadelphia alone, over twenty-five percent of those accused who are imprisoned prior to trial are eventually discharged of all criminal liability, and many more accused spend more time in <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>jail prior to their trial than they would have had to if they had been released and then tried, convicted and sentenced.

The project was modeled after a similar program operated in 1966 and 1967 under the sponsorship of the Philadelphia Bar Foundation. In eighteen months of operation, the Bar Foundation program secured the release of 878 defendants on their own recognizance. Of that group, 229 were eventually discharged from all criminal liability.

In welcome contrast to these figures, Fred Rosenbloom, Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Philadelphia Bar Foundation bail project, testified that that project <em>saved </em>the City of Philadelphia approximately $500,000 by reducing needless pretrial incarceration.

Much more could, of course, be written about the financial problems of Philadelphia which give rise to this controversy, about the details of the request for additional funds made by the Court of Common Pleas upon the City, and the nature of and need for the activities and facilities they represent. More could and perhaps should be said concerning the difficulties and dangers of this sort of litigation in our framework of government, involving as it does a type of confrontation between the legislative and judicial branches of government in a major metropolitan area, which should be avoided wherever possible, and resorted to only when all else <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>has failed.

I think it should be made clear, however, that the erosion referred to cannot be laid at the door of the defendants in this case, nor can the reappraisal of the judicial processes and system, even in Philadelphia, be considered their sole responsibility. The imperative reexamination which the Court has called for is, as I view it, one which must engage the attention and energy of all branches of government and of the public as well, but remain a principal preoccupation and responsibility of the members of the judiciary, particularly this Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> and of the bar.</p>

This determination appears from the record to have been responsibly made. As our opinion indicates, the record likewise substantiates the trial judge’s holding that the Court of Common Pleas had carried its burden of proof that the activities in question (with the exception of the disallowed items<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_6" id="ref_footnote_4_6">6</a>) were “reasonably necessary to enable it to perform its continuing functions as the judiciary of the City.” Indeed, the City introduced no evidence to the contrary. <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>In light of the groundswell of criticism and the remedial efforts briefly noted above, the judge’s conclusion seems eminently sound.</p>

There has been a 100% increase in the amount of appropriation for the courts in the last six years and a maintenance of the same relative position in the total city budget for at least the last ten years (i.e., around 3.5% of the total city budget has been allocated to the courts during this period). It must be acknowledged also that critically important needs, especially in the large cities, are competing strenuously for a share of tax revenues, and this in a period of serious inflation. No evidence is required to establish that governments at all levels are experiencing severe financial strains. As the opinion of the Court points out, however, the court system in Philadelphia is not just another competing cause or need; it is itself a separate branch of government, coequal with the executive and legislative branches headed by the defendants in this case. The distinction is one not of degree, but of kind. No doubt the courts must be mindful, in making the estimates of their financial needs, of the needs of the total community and of the problems of the legislative branch in funding them; but the courts having made their determination as being reasonably necessary to performance of their constitutional functions, it is not for the legislative branch to deny the reasonableness or the necessity on the ground that something else is more urgent or more important.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_7" id="ref_footnote_4_7">7</a>

Nevertheless, the interest of orderly budget planning for the entire city government and the court system, a complicated task involving in excess of f500 million for the current fiscal year, would seem to require that the court, whether or not deemed a governmental “agency” within the meaning of Section 6-105, cooperate to the utmost with the fiscal officers of the City in the budget-making process.

This figure includes courts, <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>police, prosecution and corrections and encompasses both civil and criminal law administration. About 6Ó per cent is devoted to police protection and prosecution, some 20 per cent supports the courts and 20 per cent is spent for corrections.

This is not a meaningful comparison, however, because. in this state the cost of the judicial establishment is largely borne by the counties and the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The state expenditure is principally for judicial salaries. On a consolidated basis, the only figures presently available to the writer are those ’ which are contained in Professor Schulman’s work, <em>Toward Judicial Reform in Pennsylvania, supra, </em>for the year 1957. While now out of date, the author’s unofficial estimate relative to that year is worth citing: “The cost of the judicial system in Pennsylvania in 1957 was approximately 30 million dollars, not counting the cost of correctional and penal institutions. The state’s share was approximately 4% million, the balance being borne by the counties and the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.” <em>Ibid, </em>at 181.</p>

Weis, <em>A New Name and a New Financial Policy for the Courts, </em>41 Pa. Bar Assn. Quarterly 189 (1970). The author there concludes: “It seems obvious that the time has come to implement the unified court concept on a statewide fiscal, as well as administrative basis. The Commonwealth should assume all the costs of operating the courts in this state, just as the federal government finances all the courts of the United States.”</p>
