A year and five days after commencement of the action, in June, 1965, plaintiffs complaint was filed alleging negligence on the part of defendant Mary Bakaitis in the driving of the automobile in which plaintiff had been a guest passenger, and negligence on the part of Bart Bertocci, Inc., a contractor doing construction work in a public highway at the point of accident, for failure to give warning and erect a proper barricade at the work site.</p>

Tn addition, Bart Bertocci, Inc., alleged under new matter that there was no corporation known as “Bart Bertocci, Inc.”; that at the time of the occurrence there was a partnership known as Bertocci Construction Company which was engaged in highway construction at the location indicated; that this partnership had been succeeded in May, 1963, before suit was brought, by a corporation known as Bertocci Contractors, Inc.

Pleasant Hills Realty Co., </em><a href="/pa/357/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="357 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="472067" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0023-01">357 Pa. 23</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%2073" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="53 A.2d 73">53 A. 2d 73</a> (1947) : •“. . . whether the right party was sued but under a wrong designation, or whether a wrong person was sued and the amendment was designed to substitute another and distinct party.” Amendment after the period of limitations is permissible in the former situation; in the latter it is not. <em>Gozdonovic </em>also supplies the answer to the question in the instant case, for the facts were basically the same: a defendant first sued as “Pleasant Hills Realty Company, a corporation;” thereafter, upon discovery that the company was not a corporation but a partnership, amendment allowed to describe it as such. After stating the question as above, the opinion of this Court continues: “It is to be noted that plaintiff did not attempt to bring in as defendants the individual members of the partnership; this clearly would not have been permissible (Girardi v. Laquin Lumber Co., <a href="/pa/232/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="232 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="977834" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0001-01">232 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.%2063" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="81 A. 63">81 A. 63</a>). The defendant newly named under the amendment was merely the partnership <em>entity. </em>It is always permissible to prosecute an action against a partnership in its firm name instead of against the individuals trading as the partnership: Pa. R.C.P. 2128(a) ; see also Pa. R.C.P. 2132(a) ; in such case the judgment obtained does not impose liability upon the individual partners nor permit of execution being is<a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>sued against their individual property: Tonge v.

The amendment as allowed, therefore, did not substitute any new parties upon whom liability could be imposed; the action was still directed against the entity which was Kartub’s employer, and the designation of that entity could properly be changed from that of corporation to partnership: McGinnis v.

We consider next the refusal of the court to allow the filing of the replies (or, more precisely, the court’s granting of the motions to strike the replies). Pa. R.C.P. 1026 provides that a pleading shall be filed within 20 days after service of a preceding pleading. This rule is not mandatory but permissive. We have held that late pleadings may be filed “if the opposite party is not prejudiced and justice requires. <em>Mitch must be left to the discretion of the lower court.” Fisher v.

(Em<a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>phasis added.) In our view the lower court in the present case cannot be said to have abused its discretion. In the case of Bakaitis, the reply came a year and seven months after the answer; in the case of Bertocci, 13 1/2 months after the duplicate answer (with notice to plead). A motion for judgment on the pleadings had already been filed by one defendant. No excuse for delay of such extraordinary duration is apparent from the record or offered in appellant’s brief. It is not enough for appellant now to argue that defendants have not shown prejudice; the interests of expeditious and efficient administration of justice by reasonable adherence to the rules of court were adequate grounds for the lower court’s refusal to graiit an indulgence of such magnitude in this case.

The court then had before it the undisposed of motion of Bertocci for judgment on the pleadings. One of the grounds for this was the nonexistence of the corporation named as defendant, which, as above indicated, will be eliminated by the amendment of the caption. The other" ground is the release given by plaintiff to defendant Bakaitis. There is no discussion in the court’s opinion as to the release defense, and it is unclear whether and to what extent the court’s entry of judgment on the pleadings was based on one or both of the grounds in the motion. It is similarly unclear on what basis the court entered judgment for defendant Bakaitis, who had filed no motion for judgment, perhaps in the mistaken thought that her co-defendants’ motion would automatically extend <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>to her.
