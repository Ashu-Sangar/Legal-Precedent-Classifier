On August 22, 1963, Dr. Hutchinson, assisted by three orthopedic residents, <em>i.e., </em>medical doctors who were then receiving specialized training, performed the surgery in the operating room of St. Francis Hospital. These residents were selected from the hospital staff for this particular operation by the operating room supervisor, who was employed, as were the residents, by the hospital. After Dr. Hutchinson removed the disc and performed the related surgery, he left the operating room as he allowed the residents to close the surgical incision and remove the remaining sponges. As there was no general improvement in plaintiff-appellee’s condition, a subsequent operation was performed by a Dr. Watson, who found a surgical sponge which was admitted by the appellant’s decedent to be one of the sponges employed in the operation of August 22, 1963.</p>

In the case at bar, the testimony of Dr. Hutchinson, taken on deposition, was oral in nature, even though transcribed when presented at the trial, and showed that after the surgery involved in the removal of the disc was completed by Dr. Hutchinson, he left the operating room, leaving the removal of the sponges and the closure of the surgical incision to the resident surgeons. If believed by the jury, this testimony would tend to rebut the presumption of any direct negligence on the part of Dr. Hutchinson unless the fact that he left the operating room before the removal of the sponges and closure of the incision constituted negligence as a matter of law.

Because plaintiffs testimony in <em>De Bose </em>failed to sufficiently identify that which was taken from her body post-operatively as a “pad” or a “sponge” used by the operating surgeon rather than the piece of gauze inserted by the assisting surgeon, this Court upheld the entry by the court below of the nonsuit against the plaintiff.</p>

This concept was next employed in <em>Benedict v. </em>Bondi, <a href="/pa/384/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="384 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1263094" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0574-01">384 Pa. 574</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="122 A.2d 209">122 A. 2d 209</a> (1956), to remove a nonsuit entered on behalf of a surgeon where a nurse negligently burned the patient during the course of the operation. Later, it was used to affirm a jury verdict against a doctor who permitted a resident intern to operate in his stead when the patient was injured through the failure of others to inform either the intern or the doctor of the patient’s allergy to penicillin in <em>Yorston v. Pennell, </em><a href="/pa/397/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="397 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1286234" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0028-01">397 Pa. 28</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.2d%20255" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="153 A.2d 255">153 A. 2d 255</a> (1959). The utilization of this doctrine was continued in the companion cases of <em>Rockwell v.

Our most recent pronouncement on this concept occurred in <em>Collins v. Hand, </em>431. Pa. 378, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20A.2d%20398" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="246 A.2d 398">246 A. 2d 398</a> (1968), as we reversed a judgment against a psychiatrist for the alleged negligence of others, who, we concluded, were not under the control or supervision of the psychiatrist when the alleged acts of negligence took place. Briefly summarized, the “captain of the ship” doctrine imposes liability on the surgeon in charge of an operation for the negligence of his assistants during the period when these assistants are under the surgeon’s control, even though the assistants are also employees of the hospital. Stated differently, the “captain of the ship” concept is but the adaptation of the familiar “borrowed servant” principle in the law of agency to the operating room of a hospital.</p>

Both <em>McConnell </em>and <em>Benedict </em>involved the propriety of a nonsuit entered on behalf of a doctor— effectively the exact opposite of the procedure employed by the court below. Particularly relevant is the closing paragraph of the <em>McConnell </em>opinion: “In the present case the court erred in entering a nonsuit. <em>It is for the jury to determine whether the relationship between defendant and the interne, at the time the child’s eyes were injured, was that of master and servant. </em>If such was the relationship, defendant is legally liable for the injury caused by the interne’s alleged negligence. In determining whether the interne was defendant’s servant at that time, the mere fact that he was then in the general employ of the hospital would not prevent the jury from finding that he was also at that same time <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>the servant of defendant if he was then subject to his orders in respect to the treatment of the child’s eyes with the silver nitrate solution.” (Emphasis added) <a href="/pa/361/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="361 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="476376" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0355-01">361 Pa. at 366-67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20243" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="65 A.2d 243">65 A. 2d at 248</a>. It seems illogical to require a jury determination in the <em>McConnell </em>situation and not in this one. The opinions in <em>Torsion, Rockwell v. Stone </em>and <em>Rockwell v. Kaplan, </em>did not present the instant problem as this Court was aided by jury verdicts indicating that the doctor in charge of the operation was indeed the “captain of the ship.” It appears to us that the question whether these residents were Dr. Hutchinson’s deckhands is one of fact that ought properly be left to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[204,1067,1157,1146]]]'>In addition, we note that this doctrine was announced before the decision of this Court in <em>Flagiello v. Pennsylvania Hosp., </em><a href="/pa/417/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="417 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1894073" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0486-01">417 Pa. 486</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20193" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="208 A.2d 193">208 A. 2d 193</a> (1965), discarding the immunity from liability in tort previously enjoyed by public hospitals. In enunciating the “captain of the ship” theory in <em>McConnell, </em>it was no coincidence that this Court noted, “if operating surgeons were not to held liable for the negligent performance of the duties of those then working under them,- the law would fail in large measure to afford a means of redress for preventable injuries sustained during the course of such operations.” <a href="/pa/361/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="361 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="476376" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0355-01">361 Pa. at 364</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20243" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="65 A.2d 243">65 A. 2d at 247</a>. Thus, any willingness to characterize a head surgeon as the “captain of the ship” in order to financially restore the patient should be clearly negated in light of the <em>Flagiello </em>opinions. If, in fact, the residents were negligent, either the hospital or the head surgeon could be vicariously liable, depending, of course, on whether the residents were “borrowed.” Hence, this factual determination is well nigh dispositive of the case and should be decided by the jury.</p>
