Therefore, for this appeal, we will deem the following allegations in appellant’s complaint to be true.</p>
    <p id="b271-3" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[198,957,1148,486]]]'>Appellant, Mellon Square Garage, Inc., operates a parking garage in the City of Pittsburgh as a tenant of the Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh. By the terms of an agreement dated May 1, 1961 whereby appellant acquired the rights to operate the garage, both appellant and the Authority agreed that their sub-lessor-sublessee relationship was to be controlled by a 1953 sublease that had existed between the Authority and a prior tenant.</p>
    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[199,1454,1148,652]]]'>The sublease requires that Mellon Square Garage pay the Authority varying percentages of its annual “gross receipts” as rent. In 1955, the sublease was amended to include the following: “Gross receipts shall include all amounts actually received by the tenant for all services rendered and commodities sold by it. . . . The amount of sales or other similar tax required to be collected by the Tenant or Subtenants as collecting agent for a taxing authority upon any sale or activity conducted by Tenant or Subtenants shall not be included in determination of gross receipts.” The amendment was incorporated into the 1961 agreement.</p>

    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[220,567,1157,540]]]'>Between 1963 and 1968, Mellon Square Garage did not deduct the parking tax in computing its “gross receipts” for purposes of determining the proper rent to be paid the Authority. Then in 1970 appellant filed a complaint in assumpsit demanding $45,732.52 from the Authority, which is the difference between the amount actually paid to the Authority and the amount that would have been paid as rent had Mellon Square Garage deducted the parking tax from its “gross receipts” figure each year.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[216,1120,1157,539]]]'>The Authority filed a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer. The court of common pleas sustained the demurrer, holding that the parking tax is not a “sales or other similar tax” and therefore is not excludible from “gross receipts” by the terms of the sublease. The court also noted that from 1963 to the date of this action, the parties had agreed on the interpretation of the sublease which did not treat the tax as a deduction in computing “gross receipts.” It is the correctness of this holding that we must evaluate.</p>
    <p id="b272-6" data-blocks='[["BL_272.6",272,[213,1672,1156,254]]]'>The task of characterizing a particular tax is not new to this Court. Here, we have two realistic choices: the City of Pittsburgh parking tax is either a “sales or other similar tax,” or else some species of mercantile tax.</p>
