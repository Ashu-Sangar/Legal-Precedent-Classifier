The Secretary of Banking agreed to request an opinion from the office of the Attorney General to determine if the Banking Department had the authority to reconsider its decision in light of the protests. The protesting banks also requested the right to have a hearing on their protests and access to the branch application and supporting data to help them in preparing their protests.

After additional investigation, the Secretary of Banking issued a second Letter of Authority on May 19, 1969, approving the application for the branch bank.

They further complain that supplementary findings that circumstances had changed— made by the Department after it learned of the protesting banks’ intention to bring this appeal—were too little and too late.

Where it has been possible to characterize that private interest (perhaps in oversimplication) as. a mere privilege subject to the Executive’s plenary power, it has traditionally been held that notice and hearing are not constitutionally required . . .

This Act was an amendment to the Admin?strative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, P. L. 1388, as amended (71 P.S. §1710.1 et seq.) and provides for appeals from “agencies of the Commonwealth” as defined by that law. Section 2 of the Admin<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>istrative Agency Lavy defines “agency” as “any department, departmental administrative board or commission”, etc., “having Statewide jurisdiction, empowered to determine or affect private rights, privileges, immunities or obligations by regulation or adjudication . . .” This would include the Department of Banking. The general appeal provisions of the Administrative Agency Act, Sections 41 through 44, which apply to agencies listed in Section 51, do not apply, by virtue of Section 46, “to any adjudication which under existing law may be appealed to a court other than the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County”. The Department of Banking is not listed in Section 51 and, as noted on page 1, adjudications by it are appeal-able to the Supreme Court under the Act of 1963. By virtue of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, which became effective September 11, 1970, jurisdiction in such cases now lies with the Commonwealth Court. The case at bar, however, was commenced and appealed in the period January 1, 1969, to September 11, 1970. The appeal was thus properly brought in this Court as a matter of right. Appeals of this nature filed subsequent to September 11, 1970 will be to the Commonwealth Court as provided In Section 403(1) of the new Jurisdiction Act.</p>

Moreover, in this case, as we have seen, the Legislature is not required to provide, nor has it provided for hearings at the Department level. The denial of a Judicial or a public or adversary hearing before the Department of Banking or even before a Banking Board is not a violation of procedural due process or of any other Constitutional right; nor is the refusal to permit (a) the inspection of applications and supporting material, or (b) the divulging of information [footnote omitted] by the Secretary of Banking or by any officer or employee of the Department, a violation of any Constitutional right which is possessed by a bank.”</p>

American’s initial Application for a branch bank cited a substantial increase in demands for service from customers in the Lancaster area. This demand had developed since the denial of American’s previous Application in 1965. The present Application noted further that American was <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>unable to make requested loans to customers in the Lancaster area because it had no depositors in that area to support the loans. The Application also noted, the increasing traffic and congestion in the Lancaster área and stated that not only would the proposed bank have three “drive-in” windows, but also there would be convenient parking facilities at the new location to make banking easier for the public.</p>
    <p id="b351-3" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[206,795,1150,746]]]'>The investigators’ report set forth inter alia these reasons for granting the Application for this branch. The report stated. that the proposed location would “provide for the first time more convenient banking services to the present customers [of American].” In addition, the investigators’ report noted that several other local banks in Lancaster were conducting negotiations intending to merge with other banks nearby. They especially noted the proposed merger of the Lancaster County Farmers Bánk with banks in Reading and York. They concluded that if these mergers were to take place, competition in the Lancaster area would be maintained on a more favorable level if the proposed branch bank were allowed.</p>
    <p id="b351-4" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[206,1562,1148,753]],["BL_352.1",352,[214,361,1151,98]]]'>All these facts and factors were presented to the Department before the first authorization was granted. When that authorization was withdrawn at the request of the Protesting Banks, additional evidence was then presented by American, as well as by the Protesting Banks. <em>The evidence presented by American stressed more fully the changes and circumstances since the denial of American’s prior Application in 1965. </em>In particular, the report stressed that the so-called “conservative” city banks <em>were not adequately serving </em>the Lancaster area and that allowing American to open a branch in Lancaster would provide competition which would improve banking services in the area generally. The report also noted the rapid growth of Lancaster <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>County and the extensive urban renewal project designed to promote economic growth in the City.</p>

I have studied the record carefully and am convinced that thé evidence presented by American to establish a need for this branch bank adequately and amply demonstrated that circumstances had changed since its prior Application, and that there was. a definite need for this branch bank.</p>

It is only where an Application is disapproved that findings must be made. Banking Code of 1965, Section 905(c). This Court noted in <em>Cement National Bank v.
