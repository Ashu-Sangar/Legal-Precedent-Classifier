Well, I guess we arrived around 12:40 p.m., I walked west on Sears Street, at 7th Street, I went up and knocked on the door.

And then, according to your testimony, someone lifted up the blinds? A. Yes, sir. Q. Could you tell whether that was male or female, sir? A. I couldn’t tell. I believe there were curtains behind the blinds. I couldn’t see who it was. Q. Then the blinds dropped, sir, is that correct? A. That is correct. Q.

But even in these circumstances this might be entirely innocent “for countless legitimate reasons.” Appellant’s wife, for example, testified that it was she who peered through the window and that her delay in responding was occasioned by her being attired in a nightgown and having to go to the kitchen to put on a robe.

The search warrant authorized seizure of quickly destructible lottery paraphernalia. The officers seeking to execute the warrant believed the records would be on rice paper, which dissolves on contact with water. They announced themselves as police officers who had a search warrant. They heard voices inside the house. Just after their announcement they saw a window blind on a window next to the front door of the house raised and someone within look out the window. The blind was then lowered. The two officers who testified both at the suppression hearing and at trial were uncertain how much time elapsed thereafter before they broke open the door. They estimated it variously as between five and twenty seconds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Asked where her husband was when the officers came in, she answered that when he heard “the crash” (i.e., the door being broken) he jumped up, and went to the kitchen. (One of the officers had previously testified that when they entered the defendant was in the kitchen holding white paper under the tap water.)</p>

The question there was whether there were any “exigent circumstances” that would justify dispensing with the announcement of purpose. It was held that the lapse of twenty seconds after an inadequate announcement (“the police”) was not such an exigent circumstance because it was not long enough “to constitute support for a belief that evidence was being destroyed.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In the present case dual warning of authority and purpose <em>was </em>given.
