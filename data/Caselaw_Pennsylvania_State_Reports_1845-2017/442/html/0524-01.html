The charges all arose out of a purse snatching, the victim of which identified appellant as her assailant. The Commonwealth’s case against appellant was strengthened by the discovery, by the victim, of a card <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>•with appellant’s name on it among her credit cards when her handbag was returned to her. Sometime before October 27,1967, appellant’s counsel and the prosecuting attorney reached an agreement whereby appellant would plead guilty and the Commonwealth would recommend to the judge that appellant be sentenced to eleven and one-half to twenty-three months on the robbery bill and to a year’s probation on the assault and battery bill.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[214,848,1154,433]]]'>On October 27, 1967, appellant’s guilty plea was entered and accepted. Before accepting the plea of guilty, appellant responded to an on-the-record inquiry by the assistant district attorney and stated that no one—his own attorney, the Commonwealth’s attorney, or the court—had promised him any specific sentence if he pleaded guilty and that he understood that if he pleaded guilty, he “could be sent away . . . for a long time.”</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[213,1291,1155,597]]]'>The trial court first heard evidence as to the offense and evidence as to appellant’s background, including his prior juvenile record, and his history of being a slow learner who had been to a number of different schools and correctional institutions. Although the prosecuting attorney later testified that he had mentioned his promised recommendation to the judge at a side-bar conference, no recommendation of a sentence was made on the record at that time. The trial court decided to defer sentence pending preparation of a presentence report.</p>

Appellant had then been in jail seven months since his arrest. The other participants had been more active. The prosecuting attorney who had handled the case in its earlier stages, including negotiation of the plea bargain, was no longer assigned to it. The judge, who had probably handled hundreds of cases in the meantime, gave no in<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>dication that he was aware of any Commonwealth recommendation as to sentence. The prosecuting attorney now assigned to the case mentioned on the record that there was a recommendation but for some reason, either his timidity or the manner in which the hearing proceeded, was never able to state what the recommendation was. After again interviewing appellant as to his background, the court sentenced him to eighteen months to fifteen years on the robbery bill. Appellant’s counsel suggested a shorter minimum and the assistant district attorney suggested that both the minimum and the maximum be shortened, but at no time did the assistant district attorney make the specific recommendation which his predecessor had promised would be made.</p>

Appellant testified that on the morning of trial, the assistant district attorney and his lawyer told him that if he pleaded guilty, the assistant district attorney would recommend a sentence of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months.</p>

As he wrote: “While the record, fails to disclose whether any specific recommendation was made, it does show that, at the time of sentencing at a subsequent hearing, the Court’s attention was called to the fact that a recommendation had been made at the time of the entry of the guilty plea.”</p>

A. I think that you are confusing the word, promise.

But he hasn’t vindicated [sic] with his Honor what promises fully fit the category. I am saying a promise of recommendation; you know, when the judge says, Were any promises made? Anything told to you that you might get something in return?’ A. I think again you are confusing that word. Me. Katrys : Well, if something is given in return, if something is promised whether it is to give something or a little less something the assurance would be better if the recommendation is something. Now, if you take the word promise and confuse that; didn’t you know that you were going to be confronted with the situation and the judge asking the defendant, Were any promises made?’ And the defendant having to respond. The Cotjet: Well, just ask the question. The question the judge asked was ‘Had he promised you’— Mr. Sweeney was the one that put it—‘Has he promised you any particular sentence if you pleaded guilty?’ So that the answer was honest when he said, ‘No, sir.’ There were no promises of any particular sentence.”</p>

United States, <a href="/f2d/315/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="315 F.2d 667" data-case-ids="172761" data-case-paths="/f2d/315/0667-01">315 F. 2d 667</a>, 670 (9th Cir. 1963).” <a href="/pa/439/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="439 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1930960" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0021-01">439 Pa. at 31</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20643" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="264 A.2d 643">264 A. 2d at 647</a>. In the instant appeal, the appellant, dissatisfied with his “unexpectedly severe” punishment, now wants to take his chances with a full scale trial or another guilty plea even though he was “eleven and one-half to twenty-three months guilty.” This type of thinking goes beyond the outmoded concept sometimes termed the “sporting rules of justice” as it would remove all skill or thought and substitute a casino-like game of chance.</p>

Accordingly, I cannot accept the assumption implicit in the majority’s rationale that the bargained sentence so infected the guilty plea that the plea should be invalidated. With all deference to the majority of other jurisdictions and the position taken by the prestigious American Bar Association, <em>see, Com. v. Alvarado, </em><a href="/pa/442/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="442 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1935419" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0516-01">442 Pa. 516</a>, 519-20, <a href="/citations/?q=276%20A.2d%20526" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="276 A.2d 526">276 A. 2d 526</a>, 528 (1971), I do not believe that withdrawal is in order when an accused’s complaint is essentially directed to the punishment and not to the charges. Moreover, we unanimously refused to permit withdrawal in <em>Alvarado; </em>instead we modified the sentence in accordance with the plea bargain.</p>

As noted by the majority, “[bjefore accepting the plea of guilty, appellant responded to an on-the-record inquiry by the assistant district attorney and stated that no one—Ms own attorney, the Commonwealth’s attorney, or the court—had promised him any specific sentence if he pleaded guilty and that he understood that if he pleaded guilty, he ‘could be sent away . . . for a long time.’ ” By a series of decisions culminating in <em>Com. ex rel. West v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/428/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="428 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1912346" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0102-01">428 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20A.2d%20196" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="237 A.2d 196">237 A. 2d 196</a> (1968), we have consistently stressed the importance of an on-the-record inquiry, preferably by the trial judge, on the voluntariness of the guilty plea. Moreover, the comments to Pa. It. Grim. P. §319 suggested questions including: “(6) Is the defendant aware of any plea bargain or other arrangement; (7) Is thé defendant aware that the judge is not bound by any plea bargain or other arrangement between defense counsel and the attorney for the Commonwealth?” The record discloses that these questions were asked and <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>the appellant <em>negatively </em>responded despite the fact that an agreement had been negotiated and that <em>all </em>concerned, except the trial judge, were well aware of the bargain. Thus, it was the attorneys who grossly abused their discretion and not the trial judge or the PCHA judge. As demonstrated by the majority, the court should have been made aware of any bargains or promises. When a court of law is duped, those parties responsible for this travesty, either by commission or omission, should be strongly reprimanded. <em>See, Com. v. Alvarado, </em><a href="/pa/442/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="442 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1935419" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0516-01">442 Pa. at </a>520 n.*, <a href="/citations/?q=276%20A.2d%20526" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="276 A.2d 526">276 A. 2d at </a>528 n.*.</p>
    <p id="b575-3" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[133,959,1154,982]]]'>We extensively analyzed plea bargaining in general in <em>Com. ex rel. Kerekes v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/423/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="423 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1903177" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0337-01">423 Pa. 337</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20699" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="223 A.2d 699">223 A. 2d 699</a> (1966), and gave our imprimatur while realizing that, “the awesome effect of a guilty plea and the sensitive nature of the bargaining process makes certain safeguards essential.” <a href="/pa/423/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="423 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1903177" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0337-01">423 Pa. at 349</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20699" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="223 A.2d 699">223 A. 2d at 705</a>. Whenever a trial judge is informed by the accused of a desire to plead guilty, any proposed bargains should be brought to light before a guilty plea is entered. At that juncture, the judge may take evidence if he believes that concessions are unwarranted. If the judge then concludes he will not follow the agreement he should then so inform the accused before receiving any guilty plea. There is nothing sinister about plea bargaining, especially when the ends of justice are best served. By keeping the bargain a secret, the accused, his counsel and the assistant district attorney have frustrated the ends of justice.</p>
