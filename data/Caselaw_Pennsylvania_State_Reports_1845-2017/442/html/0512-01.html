He was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. No post-trial motions were filed, nor was an appeal taken.</p>
    <p id="b553-10" data-blocks='[["BL_553.14",553,[195,1588,1149,475]]]'>On December 11, 1968, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §1, as amended, 19 P.S. §1180-1, on the grounds (1) that his attorney induced his plea, (2) that his attorney was ineffective, and (3) that he was denied his right to appeal. The petition was dismissed after an evidentiary hearing at which petitioner was represented by the Public Defender. This appeal followed.</p>

The court made no specific finding on this <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>point, but denied the requested relief on the ground that in light of the guilty plea, the only issues 'which could be raised on appeal were the voluntariness of the plea and the lawfulness of the sentence imposed. The court, having found that the plea was voluntary and that the life sentence was legal, concluded, “We find nothing from which petitioner can appeal. He may nevertheless appeal from this decision and thus protect his right.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[210,861,1155,1039]]]'>In so holding the learned trial court inadvertently overlooked the important distinction, insofar as appeal rights are concerned where a defendant has pleaded guilty to murder generally, between a conviction of murder in the first degree and a conviction of murder in the second degree. While in the latter case it is quite true that the voluntariness of the guilty plea and the legality of the sentence are the only matters susceptible of challenge on appeal, where the conviction is murder in the first degree not only those elements but the sufficiency of the evidence which raised the crime from second to first degree murder may also be tested. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <p id="b555-6" data-blocks='[["BL_555.6",555,[194,1414,1149,777]]]'> We find that there has been some confusion both in the mandates of this Court and the practice in the various trial courts as to whether appeals from convictions of murder in the first degree which followed from a plea of guilty to murder generally should be taken directly from the judgments of sentence to this Court, or should be preceded by post-trial motions filed and disposed of in the trial court, with the appeal then being from the denial of such motions. Compare, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Waters, </em><a href="/pa/441/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="441 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="1933791" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0511-01">441 Pa. 511</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=273%20A.2d%20329" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="273 A.2d 329">273 A. 2d 329</a> (1971) with, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.

We have concluded that the preferable practice, since it may narrow the issues on appeal or perhaps obviate an appeal entirely, is to file post-trial motions in any first degree case where error is asserted, whether the conviction follows a full trial or only a degree of guilt hearing held after a plea of guilty.</p>
