Cartwright did, and the air conditioning apparatus still would not work, and . . . Cartwright then turned the said thermostat so that it would not operate the air conditioning system, and [Eckborg] then returned to check the circuit and while doing so, the air conditioning system started and as it started, it caught[Eckborg’s] right hand, injuring Ms said right hand, and as a result thereof, [Eckborg] lost the second and third fingers at the first joint of his right hand.</p>
