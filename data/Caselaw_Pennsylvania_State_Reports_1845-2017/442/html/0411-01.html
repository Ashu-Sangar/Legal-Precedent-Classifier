A cloud of witnesses testify that “justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.” Without the appearance as well as the fact of justice, respect for the law vanishes in a democracy, As most recently observed by one of our colleagues on the federal bench, “Even casual followers of the news media during the past few months must be aware of the fact that the nation is experiencing a deep crisis of confidence in its judiciary. [There is á] widespread impression that the courts are falling far short of discharging their duty to provide both justice and the appearance of justice.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> We have but lately had occasion to remark the erosion of confidence in our courts in a case involving the functioning of the very court of which Judge Greenberg is a member.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Without suggesting that this definition is sufficiently inclusive for the modern era,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> we have no hesitation in holding that the federal crime of using the mails to defraud is clearly within the ambit of the <em>Shaver </em>classification. If removal of a judge from office is within the contemplation of this section of the Constitution, it is, <em>a </em>fortiori, within the scope of Article Y, Sec. 18. Moreover, the action here taken, because of the pendency of appeal, is not removal but the lesser penalty of suspension.</p>

What we seek to do is to maintain the integrity of the office of judge to the end that that office, and through it the administration of justice, will deserve and receive the support not only of litigants and lawyers but of the public as well. It may be granted that the problem would be aggravated had the crime been committed while Judge Greenberg was holding judicial office, but this does not alter the facts before us: the crime for which the judge stands convicted covered a period of almost four years and ended only within a month of the time he ascended to the bench; it was, moreover, a crime involving fraudulent use of the mails; and it carried the potential prison sentence and fine noted in footnote 5. It is no answer to say that Judge Greenberg is not now presiding in a courtroom in the trial of cases; he is doing judicial work of equal importance, and his success therein is because, in addition to his other attributes, he occupies the status of judge. There is no such thing as nonjudicial phases in the work óf a judge who is functioning <em>qua </em>judge. For the purpose of upholding the dignity of the judicial office and the integrity of the judicial process, we cannot place judicial duties or activities <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>into compartments; they are of one pattern and one cloth.</p>
