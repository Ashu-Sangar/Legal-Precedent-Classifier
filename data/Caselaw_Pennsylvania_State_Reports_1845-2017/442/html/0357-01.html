Shortly thereafter the appellant, Gus Kontos, was arrested and charged with the crime, to which he confessed. On October 8, 1966, Kontos, represented by private counsel, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and at a subsequently held degree of guilt hearing before a three-judge court, he was found to be guilty of murder in the first degree. The sentence imposed was life imprisonment. No appeal was taken.</p>

L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §1180-1 et seq., alleging that his guilty plea was not knowingly entered because it had been primarily motivated by a constitutionally infirm confession. Following a counseled hearing, at which testimony of Kontos and his trial counsel was presented, the hearing judge entered an order denying relief. This appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[200,1848,1148,487]]]'>Neither in his PCHA petition nor at the hearing thereon did appellant assert that his trial counsel was incompetent in any manner. Moreover, our independent review of the record satisfies us that counsel acted competently in assessing appellant’s case, advising a plea of guilty, and making appellant aware of the consequences of entering such a plea. Accordingly, appellant’s assertion that he should now be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea must fail.</p>

In this regard, the record reveals that on the evening'of Kontos’ arrest he made oral statements to the police indicating he had planned the Hazel Deere robbery at least one week in advance and that he, with others, actively participated in the robbery during which the injuries causing Miss Deere’s death were inflicted. Following a suppression hearing conducted between September 6 and September 19, 1966,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> it was held that these oral statements would be admissible at Kontos’ trial.- Our review of the record of that hearing compels the conclusion that the confession would not have been admissible at trial, because Kontos was never adequately advised by the interrogating police officers of his right to the assistance of free counsel, ■if-indigent, as dictated by <em>Miranda v.

See 1 Henry, Pennsylvania Trial Evidence §§418, 419 (3d ed. 1940). And, an insistence on compliance with this procedural regulation serves a legitimate state interest. However, an individual foregoes the privilege of asserting a claim of violation of constitutional rights only if he knowingly and intelligently decides not to insist thereon, or if his counsel for purposes of trial strategy decides not to raise the question.” See also <em>Commonwealth v.

We can only conclude, in light of the strong Commonwealth case quite apart from appellant’s confession,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> that counsel’s failure to object was a deliberate decision of trial strategy.
