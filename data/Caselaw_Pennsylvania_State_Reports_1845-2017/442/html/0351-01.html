    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[203,553,1149,967]]]'>On January 9, 1961, the appellant, represented by counsel, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally. Following a degree of guilt hearing at which the District Attorney certified to the court that the crime rose no higher than murder in the second degree, appellant was found guilty of that crime by the trial court. No appeal was taken. In 1969 the appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §§1180-1 et seq. alleging (1) that his guilty plea was primarily motivated by an involuntary confession, (2) that his guilty plea had not been knowingly entered, (3) that the evidence adduced at the degree of guilt hearing would not support any verdict greater than voluntary manslaughter, and (4) that his right to appeal had been unlawfully obstructed. Counsel was appointed and, following a hearing, relief was denied. This appeal followed. We shall discuss these claims seriatim.</p>

In addition to showing these factors, a defendant in order to be entitled to relief must also prove “serious derelictions on the part of counsel sufficient to show that his plea was not, after all, a knowing and intelligent act.” <em>McMann v.

Based on our review of the record we find that counsel’s assessment of the case was indeed reasonable and his advice as to plea well founded. We have no hesitancy in concluding that appellant has failed to prove the “serious derelictions” on the part of counsel which are necessary to support his claim. Accordingly, petitioner’s claim that he should now be allowed to withdraw his plea because it was primarily motivated by his involuntary confession must fail.</p>

As previously noted, this allegation was contradicted by trial counsel’s testimony. The hearing court accepted counsel’s version, and found that appellant had not carried his burden of proof on this issue. See <em>Commonwealth v. McBride, </em><a href="/pa/440/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="440 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="1932320" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0081-01">440 Pa. 81</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="269 A.2d 737">269 A. 2d 737</a> (1970). Absent some error of law, this conclusion of the hearing court will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Young, <a href="/pa/433/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="433 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1921118" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0146-01">433 Pa. 146</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20559" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="249 A.2d 559">249 A. 2d 559</a> (1969).

    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[204,640,1167,1298]]]'>(3) Appellant’s third claim, that the Commonwealth did not introduce sufficient evidence at the degree of guilt hearing to raise the crime above voluntary •manslaughter, is likewise lacking in merit. When an accused pleads guilty to an indictment charging him with murder, he admits that a murder has been committed and that he is the perpetrator thereof; the plea in and of itself is sufficient to support a verdict of second degree murder. <em>Commonwealth v. Dillinger, </em><a href="/pa/440/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="440 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1932155" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0336-01">440 Pa. 336</a>, 339, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20505" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="269 A.2d 505">269 A. 2d 505</a> (1970); <em>Commonwealth v.

Although it is true that the plea admits that the Commonwealth has sufficient evidence to support a conviction for second degree murder, the accused nevertheless may introduce evidence to show that the crime in fact rises no higher than voluntary manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth v. Walters, </em>431 Pa; 74, 80, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20757" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="244 A.2d 757">244 A. 2d 757</a> (1968). In the case before us, although it had no burden to do so, the Commonwealth introduced adequate testimony to support a finding of second degree murder. The appellant’s evidence, on the other hand, even if believed, was not sufficient to reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter.</p>

At the PCHA hearing this contention was corroborated by <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>the testimony of Ward’s trial counsel. Since the appellant wag convicted of second degree murder following his plea of guilty to murder generally, he may contest on appeal only the validity of his plea and the lawfulness of his sentence. Because those issues are fully cognizable in collateral proceedings, a denial of a defendant’s right to appeal is nonprejndicial and, standing alone, does not afford a basis for relief. See <em>Commonwealth v. Dillinger, supra, </em>at 341, and cases cited therein.</p>
