Brittingham pleaded guilty to the charges of receiving stolen goods and not guilty to the remaining indictments. His guilty plea was accepted, and he was found not guilty on the other charges after a trial without a jury. He was sentenced to a total of from three and one half to seven years.</p>

Thus the gravamen of his argument is not that he did not know of his right to appeal but rather his waiver of appeal was not voluntary in that he was deterred from appealing by the desire to submit his application for parole at the earliest date of his parole eligibility.

There, although appellant was accused of murder, he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. His court-appointed counsel actively discouraged taking an appeal, advising appellant that a retrial might result in a conviction of first degree murder. We held this to be an invalid waiver because appellant’s conviction of the crime of the lower degree operated as an acquittal of the crime of murder, and thus his acquiescence in the decision to forego appeal was unintelligent.

Yet, having reviewed decisions in other jurisdictions on similar issues,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> we are persuaded that Brittingham knowingly and voluntarily waived his appeal rights.</p>

We do not believe the burden of having to delay an application for parole if appellant chooses to file an appeal can in any way be considered a meaningful deprivation of or encroachment upon the right to appeal. If eligibility for parole and the pendency of a collateral appeal coincide, it is usually due to factors within appellant’s control. Here, Brittingham delayed filing his POHA petition until almost four years after judgment of sentence was entered. That the time for appealing from the denial of his PCHA petition and the time of his earliest eligibility for parole coincided was due solely to his actions.</p>
