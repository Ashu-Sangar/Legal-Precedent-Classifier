    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[225,1561,1159,757]]]'>Applying these principles to the instant case, we nóte that the Commonwealth possessed substantial evidence of appellant’s guilt at the time of his plea, including a statement from one James Napier directly incriminating him and a statement from another individual placing him at the scene of the crimes. It was after interviewing Napier that appellant’s original counsel recommended a guilty plea, and his second counsel testified that appellant seemed aware of the nature of the charges against him and of the consequences of his plea. In these circumstances it cannot be concluded that appellant was prejudiced by the tardy appointment- of his second counsel or that he was otherwise denied the effective assistance of counsel. • -</p>
