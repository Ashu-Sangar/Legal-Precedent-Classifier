L. 956, No. 411, §1, 18 P.S. §3742 (Supp. 1970). We must decide whether, under the Act, a person other than a receiver can testify as to the contents of a telephone conversation if he overheard the call by means of an amplification device without the consent of the caller. We believe the testimony is inadmissible.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[244,698,1154,480]]]'>The factual background is not in dispute. At approximately ten o’clock on the evening of Saturday, July 29, 1967, Donald Palace received an anonymous telephone call at his home advising him that the caller had a “contract” to kill him but was willing to “reverse” the contract for $800. Palace suggested that the caller telephone him again in an hour, which he did, reiterating the threats. The calls were repeated throughout the night and the following day.</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[244,1188,1156,739]]]'>Subsequent to the first call, Palace summoned the police. While awaiting their arrival he arranged an induction coil device around the receiver portion of the telephone handset. The device, although not physically attached to the receiver, permitted conversations passing through that particular telephone to be recorded on a tape recorder and simultaneously to be amplified so that they were directly audible to anyone in the room. The coil was in operation when the second and later calls were received. The resulting conversations were recorded and also were overheard by two police officers, Mrs. Palace, and Palace’s brother-in-law, Irving Homer, who also answered some of the telephone calls.</p>
    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.6",276,[244,1948,1155,428]],["BL_277.1",277,[177,360,1149,425]]]'>Eventually the calls were traced. Appellant Kenneth Papszycki and one William McCoy were indicted on charges of blackmail, conspiracy, malicious use of the telephone, and attempted extortion. Prior to trial, defendants applied to the court to have evidence suppressed that allegedly had been obtained by unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment and also by unlawful wiretapping in contraven<a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>tion of tbe Pennsylvania anti-wiretapping statute. Hearing was held, and the court ruled on the basis of the Pennsylvania statute, that any evidence through the testimony of the police officers, Mrs. Palace, or even Palace or Homer, which they did not personally hear directly through the telephone receiver itself as the immediate party engaged in the particular telephone communication was inadmissible and must be suppressed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

No person shall divulge or use the contents or purport of a communication intercepted in violation of this act. . . .

He also contends that even if no technical interception occurred, the amplification and overhearing of a conversation by third persons without consent of both parties to the conversation is a violation of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[220,1020,1153,424]]]'>The record demonstrates that an interception occurred. To operate the amplifier, the telephone receiver had to be held in one hand, and the transducer was held around the earpiece with the other hand. Hence, the message necessarily passed through the transducer before reaching the intended receiver’s ear, although the overhearing by third persons was undoubtedly simultaneous due to the amplification.</p>

However, this restriction to the consent of only one party was decisively rejected in the House by a vote of 128 to 61.

A mere passing acquaintance with the daily newspaper suffices to substantiate the existence of a widely felt and insidious threat to individual privacy posed, not only by technological advances, but also by the evolution of contemporary social structures. A jealous regard for individual privacy is a judicial tradition of distinguished origin, buttressed in many areas by the imperative mandate <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>of constitutional guarantees. Protection of individual privacy, however, appears frequently to reduce the methods available to law enforcement agencies in the detection and prosecution of crime.

By so doing, no one denies the Legislature decided that the right of any caller to the privacy of his phone conversation was more important than the interest served by permitting police or anyone else to tap wires.” Id. at 57-58, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="223 A.2d 102">223 A. 2d at 112-13</a>.</p>
