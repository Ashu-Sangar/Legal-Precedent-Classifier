At his trial on February 4, 1957, appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally, with a certification by the Commonwealth that the crime would rise no higher than murder in the second degree. Appellant was represented by two attorneys when he entered his guilty plea, but there was no on-the-record colloquy concern<a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>ing the crime or the guilty plea or the voluntariness of the confession.</p>
    <p id="b147-3" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[172,462,1148,268]]]'>After hearing all the evidence, the trial Judge found the appellant guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced bim to not less than <em>7y2 </em>nor more than 20 years in prison. No direct appeal from the judgment or imposition of sentence was taken.</p>
    <p id="b147-4" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[172,740,1149,600]]]'>In March of 1969, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act asserting (1) a denial at trial of the right to appeal; (2) the admission at trial of a coerced confession; (3) ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) the trial Judge improperly permitted the guilty plea to stand after hearing the evidence; and (5) the Court erred in reviewing the appellant’s juvenile record prior to adjudicating the degree of guilt. On September 3, 1969, the hearing Judge, after hearing the testimony, rejected the appellant’s contentions and dismissed the petition. Defendant then appealed.</p>
    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[173,1350,1148,708]]]'>In this appeal, appellant presents two contentions. Appellant first contends, relying upon <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/395/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="395 U.S. 238" data-case-ids="1771759" data-case-paths="/us/395/0238-01">395 U.S. 238</a>, that his guilty plea was not voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently made. While <em>Boy-kin </em>sets forth the requirement of an “on-the-record examination” to establish that a guilty plea was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently entered, we have held that this decision was not retroactive. <em>Commonwealth v. Godfrey, </em><a href="/pa/434/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="434 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="1922576" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0532-01">434 Pa. 532</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=254%20A.2d%20923" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="254 A.2d 923">254 A. 2d 923</a>. Since appellant’s trial took place in 1957 and the effective date of <em>Boykin </em>was June 2, 1969, the <em>Boykin </em>requirement of “on-the-record examination” does not apply to the present case.</p>

A careful review of the record establishes that the appellant has failed to carry this burden. At the P.C.H.A. hearing, Mr. Minisi, one of appellant’s able trial attorneys, testified that he had reviewed with the appellant all of the possibilities and consequences which could result from a guilty plea. The appellant’s testimony was to the contrary. This raised a question of credibility and the P.C.H.A. hearing Judge exercised his discretionary right and chose to believe the testimony given by Mr. Minisi. <em>Commonwealth v. Holl, </em><a href="/pa/434/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="434 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1922658" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0312-01">434 Pa. 312</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=254%20A.2d%2011" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="254 A.2d 11">254 A. 2d 11</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

Our Court set forth the guidelines for testing effectiveness of counsel in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v.

    <p id="b149-3" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[185,478,1149,921]]]'>A careful review of the record clearly establishes that the appellant was afforded effective assistance of counsel. The Commonwealth had twelve witnesses who were extensively interviewed by appellant’s attorneys. Appellant’s attorneys also called witnesses in an attempt to establish that the appellant was intoxicated at the time of the killing and also to show the facts pertaining to the killing and the relevant circumstances which led up to or caused it. Appellant’s attorneys succeeded in bargaining with the Commonwealth for a second degree murder certification when a first degree murder conviction was a real possibility. Additionally, appellant’s attorneys succeeded in procuring a sentence less than the maximum for the appellant. In the light of all the facts and circumstances, appellant undoubtedly failed to prove that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>
