    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[190,395,1150,488]]]'>In 1961, appellant, then a 15 year old boy, charged with the slaying of a lifeguard at a community swimming pool, was certified from juvenile court to criminal court in Philadelphia. Represented by two court-appointed counsel, appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally. After a degree of guilt hearing before a three-judge court, James was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. No post-trial motions were filed nor was an appeal taken.</p>
    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.7",403,[188,893,1158,710]]]'>In May, 1966, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966,, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §1180-1 et seq. (“the Act”), in which he claimed: (1) that his confession, obtained when he was unrepresented by counsel, had been coerced and was wrongfully introduced into evidence; (2) that Ms guilty plea was unlawfully induced in that counsel had advised him to plead guilty because of Ms confession; and (3) that his trial counsel had been ineffective. A two day hearing was held on this petition, at which appellant was represented by counsel and testified in his own behalf. The petition was deMed, and no appeal was taken.</p>

      <em> </em>In this petition appellant raised all constitutional claims above noted, and, in addition, for the first time asserted that he was not told of his right to' appeal from the dismissal of his first PCHA petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (At no time has appellant claimed that he was denied his right to appeal from his conviction and sentence. ).</p>

He held, first, that appellant’s three claims of constitutional infirmity (coerced confession, unlawfully induced guilty plea and ineffectiveness of counsel) had been either finally litigated or waived within the meaning of §4 of the Act. He noted that no direct appeal from the judgment of sentence had been taken, and that the issues raised and heard before him had been litigated in the first PCHA proceeding, with no appeal taken from the adverse determination. While observing that the proper challenge to’ the decision denying the first PCHA petition was through appeal and not collateral attack, the court nevertheless went on to consider the case on its merits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
      <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>He determined, both from the trial record and the transcript of the first post-conviction proceeding, that appellant’s confession, judged by <em>pre-Miranda </em>standards, was valid and that the guilty plea was valid. The judge did not explicitly consider the charge of ineffectiveness of counsel (although noting that appellant had been “represented by two able lawyers” when he tendered his plea), but did so implicitly, since that charge was bottomed on the first two propositions.</p>
