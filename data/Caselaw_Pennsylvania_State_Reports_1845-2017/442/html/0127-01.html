The second codicil’s fourth paragraph expressly revokes paragraph 9 of the will and, in lieu thereof, directs that “distribution of the principal” shall be made “per stirpes and not per capita.” In the new paragraph 9, testator seeks to interpret what he means by stating that, upon occurrence of the events which require a distribution of principal, the principal shall be divided “among the then living descendants of my children, <em>but </em>the descendants of any of my grandchildren who shall then be deceased shall only take and have such part or share as [the] deceased parent would have taken if . . . living.” (Emphasis added) Appellees argue this “but” clause clearly reveals an intent to mandate per capita distribution to the children of testator’s children, <em>i.e., </em>living grand<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>children, and limits stirpital distribution to the descendants of such of testator’s grandchildren then deceased. This argument would interpret the word “descendants” in two ways: when it comes to “living descendants” of testator’s children, “descendants” would mean “children,” <em>i.e., </em>grandchildren, but when it comes to “living descendants” of grandchildren, “descendants” would mean those persons in the line of inheritance from the deceased grandchild or grandchildren. See: <em>Strunk Estate, </em><a href="/pa/369/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="369 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="1232387" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0478-01">369 Pa. 478</a>, 480, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20485" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="87 A.2d 485">87 A. 2d 485</a>, 486 (1952).</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[189,952,1149,815]]]'>The ascertainment of testator’s intent, to be garnered from the language of the testamentary writings, is not without difficulty. The result reached by the court below is that the testamentary writings clearly evidence that a per capita distribution was intended to be made within one class, <em>i.e., </em>living grandchildren, and a stirpital distribution to be made within another class, <em>i.e., </em>living children of deceased grandchildren. Examining the changes made in paragraph 10, the result reached in the court below is difficult to reconcile. Paragraph 10 in the will clearly stated: “No one,” regardless of class, should take by representation or per stirpes; the first codicil, revoking paragraph 10, clearly dictates that “all” [testator’s] children and their descendants” shall take per stirpes and not per capita.</p>

It is not at all unusual for a testator to give income to his children until the death of the last surviving child and principal per capita to the succeeding generation or generations. In <em>Rosengarten Estate, </em><a href="/pa/349/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="349 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="459298" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0032-01">349 Pa. 32</a>, 37, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20310" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="36 A.2d 310">36 A. 2d 310</a>, 313 (1944), <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>this Court said: “A study of the philosophy underlying this principle will disclose that when a testator makes a gift to a group of individuals of the same class, he is not mentally dividing them stirpitally, and increasing or decreasing their shares depending upon the fecundity of their parent.

To ascertain such intent, we must look to the language of the testamentary writings; rules of construction are of no consequence unless and until we find that the language of the testamentary writings fails to reveal, with clarity, testator’s intent. As this Court said, in <em>England Estate, </em><a href="/pa/414/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="414 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1890397" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0115-01">414 Pa. 115</a>, 118, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20897" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="200 A.2d 897">200 A. 2d 897</a>, 898 (1964): “If the language employed by the testator in disposing of his estate is plain and clearly discloses his intention, the will interprets itself, and no rules of construction are necessary to aid in its interpretation. ...

The Tin-equivocal testamentary mandate, contained in paragraph 10 of the will, that “no one,” <em>i.e., </em>of any generation, should take by representation was completely changed by the first codicil. Paragraphs First, Second and Third of the first codicil, read in conjunction with paragraph Fourth thereof, direct distribution per stirpes and not per capita of the income unused by testator’s widow, of the corpus of the widow’s trust and of the income from the residue of the estate insofar as <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>testator’s grandchildren are concerned. Ignoring, momentarily, the “but” clause contained in paragraphs First, Second and Third of the first codicil, the intent of testator as to distribution among the grandchildren is clear beyond question because of the direction “that all my Grandchildren shall take by representation, that is per stirpes and not per capita.” Moreover, even though paragraph 9 of the will is not mentioned in the first codicil, the language of the Fourth paragraph of that codicil, revoking paragraph 10 of the will, containing the direction of per stirpital distribution to <em>all </em>grandchildren, would indicate that, even as to the distribution of the principal of the trust, distribution to the grandchildren would have been per stirpes. Had testator died in 1922—subsequent to the first and prior to the second codicil—subject, of course, to the testamentary provisions for his widow, distribution of income would have resulted in a per capita distribution to his living children<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and a per stirpital distribution to all the children of any deceased child or children. This change would seem to have been brought about by the fact that the testator realized that, with a large increase in the number of grandchildren and the fact that his own children were tweuty-one years older than when he made his will, the possibility of inheritance by his grandchildren dictated a method of distribution which would have insured equality among the family units rather than a distribution based on the fecundity of his children. One fact is most evident, <em>i.e.} </em>that under the first codicil, grandchildren would take only per stirpes and not per capita.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

The second codicil differs from the first codicil in the following respects: (1) paragraph 9 of the will is specifically referred to and revoked and the direction of a per capita distribution of the principal of the trust is changed to a stirpital distribution; (2) while the “but” clauses are retained in the second codicil, unlike the first codicil which directed distribution “equally among all my children who shall be living at the time of [testator’s] decease and the child or children of any children of mine who may be then deceased,” the second codicil directs distribution “among all my then living children and the then living descendants<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> of any children of mine who may then be deceased;” (3) whereas the Fourth paragraph of the first codicil directs a stirpital distribution to “all” testator’s grandchildren, the Fifth paragraph of the second codicil directs that “all my [testator’s] children and their descendants<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> shall take by representation, that is to say per stirpes and not per capita.” Fully cognizant that “every word in a will must be given effect if it is reasonably possible so to do” <em>(see, e.g., Ludwick’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/269/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="269 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1063475" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0365-01">269 Pa. 365</a>, 371, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%20543" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="112 A. 543">112 Atl. 543</a>, 544 (1921))., we have endeavored to ascertain what testator intended by the use of the words “my living children.” Testator certainly could not have intended to refer to his own children because, having a common ancestor, they could not take by representation or per <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>stirpes and, moreover, the event upon which the principal was to be distributed could not take place until all testator’s childi'en were deceased. Unless we translate the word “children” to mean “grandchildren,” the direction of distribution by representation in the Fifth paragraph of the second codicil would be senseless and the only way to render meaning to the words “my living children” is to find that testator intended to use “children” in the more extensive sense of “grandchildren.” Under our case law, we have authority to make such an interpretation. <em>Taylor Estate, </em><a href="/pa/384/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="384 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1263023" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0550-01">384 Pa. 550</a>, 557, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="121 A.2d 119">121 A. 2d 119</a>, 123 (1956); <em>Clark Estate, </em><a href="/pa/359/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="359 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="473084" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0411-01">359 Pa. 411</a>, 420, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20109" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="59 A.2d 109">59 A. 2d 109</a>, 114 (1948) ; <em>Joyce’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/273/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="273 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1070760" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0404-01">273 Pa. 404</a>, 408-09, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="117 A. 90">117 Atl. 90</a>, 91 (1922) ; <em>Puterbaugh’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/261/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="261 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1042266" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0235-01">261 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20601" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="104 A. 601">104 Atl. 601</a> (1918). <em>See, also, Pemberton v.

We cannot, as appellants urge, treat this clause as unnecessary, as a superfluity or as lacking impact on the language which precedes it. In our examination of the “but” clause, in juxtaposition to that which precedes it in the Fourth paragraph, we note that: (a) when the events occur upon which distribution of principal is to take place, <em>i.e., </em>death of testator’s last surviving child and the attainment of twenty-one years by the youngest grandchild living when testator’s last child dies, none of testator’s children then would be living and “descendants” could include only grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other more remote generations; and (b) that the “but” clause provides that only “descendants” of deceased grandchildren shall take by representation and have such part or share as the parent would have taken. The “but” clause, read literally, refers to a per stirpes distribution only among deceased <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>grandchildren’s descendants living, inferring a different distribution among the grandchildren. When the second codicil was written, testator’s children were twenty-three years older than when he had drawn his will, he had twelve grandchildren and one of the grandchildren had married, raising the expectancy of a great-grandchild or great-grandchildren. The “but” clause would indicate that the Fourth paragraph contemplated a distribution to living grandchildren—encompassed in the term “living descendants of my children”—per capita and to great-grandehildren—encompassed in the term “descendants” of deceased grandchildren—per stirpes, so that the “but” clause, standing alone and isolated, would indicate an intent to differentiate between the two classes of descendants. We do not deem controlling the prefatory clause of the Fourth paragraph in view of the diversification between classes by way of distribution so evident in the “but” clause.</p>

The event which compels the distribution of principal is not only the attainment by testator’s youngest grandchild, living when testator’s last surviving child dies, of the age of twenty-one years but also the death of testator’s last surviving child. Until the class comprised of testator’s children is extinguished by death, paragraph 9, set forth in the Fourth paragraph of the second codicil, does not become operative and distribution thereunder could not take place. Unless we are to completely ignore the phrase “all my living children” as meaningless, we cannot reach any other result than to treat the word “children” as “grandchildren” and find testator intended distribution per stirpes not only among his great-grandchildren but his grandchildren. Reading paragraph Fifth, in the context of paragraph 10 <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>of the will and. paragraph Fourth of the first codicil, as a statement of testator’s general intent as to the manner of distribution of his entire estate, we conclude that he intended a stirpital distribution among his grandchildren as well as his great-grandchildren. Such an interpretation squares with the Fourth paragraph of the first codicil, renders intelligible and meaningful the Fifth paragraph of the second codicil and brings about equality between the several classes of descendants.</p>

It is appellants’ position that the three children of Mrs. Jenkins should now receive in equal shares the one-sixth (1/6) interest of their mother, that the six children of Lyda Thompson should each receive a one-thirty-sixth (1/36) interest, that the three other remaining grandchildren—one child of Louise Howland, one child of Eugene Grimm and one child of Stella Blair—should each receive a one-sixth (1/6) interest, and the one great-grandchild should receive the interest which her father would have had had he lived, to wit, a one-sixth (1/6) interest.</p>
