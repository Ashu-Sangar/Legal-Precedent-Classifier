      <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>The only other alleged ineffectiveness is counsel’s failure to inform the court, prior to its acceptance of Alvarado’s plea, of the prosecutor’s promise not to seek the death penalty. It is undoubtedly the much better practice for the court to be made aware of the existence and nature of any plea bargain prior to the plea itself. See ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty §1.5, Commentary (Approved Draft 1968); Note, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20865" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="112 U. Pa. L. Rev. 865">112 U. Pa. L. Rev. 865</a>, 894-95 (1964). The potential benefits of disclosure are substantial. The court would be on notice to instruct the possibly confused defendant that the prosecutor’s recommendation or lack of recommendation is in no way binding on the court. Moreover, an on-the-record disclosure of the plea bargain would serve both to protect the defendant in the event that the prosecutor does not subsequently abide by the plea bargain and to protect the Commonwealth against later false claims of unkept bargains. <em>People v. West, </em>3 C. 3d 595, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20385" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="91 Cal. Rptr. 385">91 Cal. Rptr. 385</a> (1970). We are not at this time, however, disposed to fashion a rule that counsel’s failure to disclose a plea bargain per se constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. In the instant case, there is ample indication that Alvarado understood that the court might not be swayed by the prosecutor’s failure to seek the death penalty, and the Commonwealth admits the existence of the promise not to seek the death penalty. Absent any demonstrable prejudice, counsel’s silence respecting the plea bargain did not in itself render his assistance of Alvarado constitutionally defective.</p>

This responsibility is, of course, shared concurrently by the prosecutor and by the court itself. In this regard, we are in substantial accord with the American Bar Association’s recommended standard. “The <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>court should not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first determining that the plea is voluntary. By inquiry of the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel, the court should determine whether the tendered plea is the result of prior plea discussions and a plea agreement, and, if it is, what agreement has been reached. If the prosecuting attorney has agreed to seek charge or sentence concessions which must be approved by the court, the court must advise the defendant personally that the recommendations of the prosecuting attorney are not binding on the court. The court should then address the defendant personally and determine whether any other promises or any force or threats were used to obtain the plea.” ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty §1.5 (Approved Draft 1968).</p>

Thus we turn to Alvarado’s remaining contention that the Commonwealth did not abide by the plea bargain, and in this claim we find much merit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The record discloses that the prose<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>eutor never specifically urged or expressly recommended the death penalty. But neither did he stand mute. When asked by the court whether he had any comments to offer on the question of sentence, he replied that he had and proceeded to make a series of statements, including the following: “During the course of the testimony that the Commonwealth presented, there was testimony that this defendant helped carry the stretcher containing the victim down the stairs, and at that time before the testimony came in I think your Honors felt that this was an act of mercy showing that this was remorse or sorrow. Later through all the testimony we found that this was not an act of remorse, but was part of the actions which this man undertook calculated to deceive the family and his friends. He had given the story and the information of the 3 men that he saw. He didn’t beg the family for forgiveness or for mercy, but he came back specifically to try to fall (sic) and deceive and send the police out on a false track. The purpose (sic) we are here today is to judge a man. <em>What kind of man is he? Is he showing this Court any remorse? Has he begged this Court for mercy himself? He has had nothing to say. Would he show any mercy to this girl? . . </em>.” (Emphasis added.) “. . . In conclusion, your Honors, I would just say that in your discretion in deciding what the penalty should be in this case the question should be asked <em>have you ever observed in your experience, have you ever seen a crime as vicious as this one has been? Can you ever forget the pictures you saw? </em>From the pictures I think the Commonwealth could show a specific intent to kill in this case.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

That may be so—but a review for what purpose?

See Act of June <em>24, </em>1939, P. L. 872, §701, as amended, 18 P.S. §4701.

It is of course possible that the prosecutor may have intended to promise only that he would not <em>explicitly </em>urge the death penalty. However, the prosecutor’s subjective understanding of his promise is immaterial. To determine the content of a plea bargain we must consider what the defendant might have reasonably interpreted it to be. Cf. <em>In re Valle, </em><a href="/mich/364/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="364 Mich. 471" data-case-ids="1883389" data-case-paths="/mich/364/0471-01">364 Mich. 471</a>, 477-78, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20N.W.2d%20673" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="110 N.W.2d 673">110 N.W. 2d 673</a>, 677 (1961).

As so interpreted, that promise was clearly violated.</p>

As the Commonwealth did not breach any promise until <em>after </em>Alvarado had been found guilty of murder in the first degree, a life sentence rather than death was the <em>most </em>benefit he could have derived from fulfillment of the prosecutor’s promise. No consideration of fairness or sound judicial administration dictates that he now be given an opportunity to withdraw his plea, stand trial, and possibly escape criminal liability altogether.</p>

If appellant misled the court of his own volition, we would be most hesitant to grant any relief. If, however, appellant’s negative answers were “coached” by his counsel, he should not be made to suffer because of counsel’s questionable advice. Furthermore, as set out in part I of this opinion, the conspiracy of silence respecting the plea bargain extended even to the prosecutor who sat idly by while the court was misinformed, concerning the circumstances attending appellant’s decision to plead guilty.</p>
