No appeal was taken. Subsequently appellant, acting as his own counsel, filed a habeas corpus petition which was dismissed without a hearing. . The order of dismissal was affirmed by this Court. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Sprangle v.

The trial record being silent on this point, the burden in the post-conviction proceeding was upon the Commonwealth to establish that the appellant knew both of his right to appeal and of his right, if indigent, to be represented by counsel free of charge to him. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Freeman, <a href="/pa/438/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="438 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1929240" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0001-01">438 Pa. 1</a>, 5, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20403" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="263 A.2d 403">263 A. 2d 403</a>.

Appellant’s court-appointed trial counsel testified at the PCBLA hearing that both he and the trial judge had informed appellant of his right to appeal. Counsel also testified, however, that he had told appellant that he personally would not prosecute an appeal on appellant’s behalf. There is no testimony of record to prove that appellant was ever informed of his right, if indigent, to free counsel on appeal. On this record the Commonwealth has not carried its burden of proof; therefore appellant is entitled, with the assistance of free counsel, to file post-trial motions as though timely filed.</p>
