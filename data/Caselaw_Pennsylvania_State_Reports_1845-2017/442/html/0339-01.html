The judgment of sentence was affirmed on direct appeal.

In 1965 appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Following a hearing at which appellant was represented by counsel, the petition was denied^<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Approximately three years later appellant again sought relief by filing the present Post Conviction Hearing Act petition alleging: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, (2) the use of perjured testimony at trial, (3) the Commonwealth’s suppression of exculpatory evidence, and (4) the discovery of exculpatory evidence subsequent to trial. None of these issues were raised in the 1965 habeas corpus proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The petition was dismissed without a hearing, and this appeal followed.</p>

The PCHA court dismissed the instant petition on the theory that the issues presently asserted were waived by appellant’s failure to raise them in his 1965 habeas corpus petition and by his failure to allege any extraordinary circumstances. We do not agree.</p>

Thus, absent clear and direct evidence that a petitioner had abused the writ by seeking to liti.gate his claims in a piecemeal fashion as a means of vexation, harassment and delay, the failure to raise an issue in a prior habeas corpus petition did not foreclose judicial consideration of the merits of that issue in a subsequent proceeding.

The court cannot permit itself to be placed in the position where it must either perform the research which should be done by the public representative of a habeas corpus respondent or accept the petitioner’s contentions and release him on bail pending appeal. We have on other occasions directed prosecuting attorneys to show cause, why they should not be suspended from practice in this court for such inexcusable neglect.
