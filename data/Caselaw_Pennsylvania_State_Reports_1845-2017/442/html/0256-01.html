    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[204,789,1156,539]]]'>On May 25, 1963, Seaboard entered into a written assignment of lease agreement whereby Seaboard acquired the rights to mine, reclaim and remove coal from certain deposits owned by the Blue Ridge Real Estate Company. Thereafter, in September Seaboard and Blue Ridge entered into a lease directly between themselves under which Seaboard was entitled to the same rights, and was to pay Blue Ridge a royalty of 35 cents a ton. The lease was predated May 27, 1963, and was to run for ten years.</p>
    <p id="b298-6" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[201,1341,1156,374]]]'>Seaboard commenced to reclaim and mine the coal in June, 1963. At that time, John D. Howley was the president. He continued in office until July, 1963, when Walter F. Joachim assumed control and management of Seaboard. Prior to Joachim’s becoming president and treasurer, Seaboard’s operations had been profitable.</p>

He also said that a proposal would be submitted to Blue Ridge involving the anticipated change in operations either on the basis of a new royalty fee or else the outright purchase of the coal deposits <em>by Joachim.</em>

Monaco attended the meeting and, as he had assumed the office of Secretary of the corporation, recorded the minutes. The three other shareholders, comprising seventy-five percent of the voting stock, instructed Joachim to enter into negotiations with Pagnotti for the construction of a plant.</p>
    <p id="b299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[205,974,1148,421]]]'>On December 2, 1963, Joachim, with the knowledge and consent of Monaco, submitted to Blue Ridge a written offer to purchase on his own behalf Blue Ridge’s interest in the same coal and refuse deposits that were the subject of the May 27, 1963 lease between Blue Ridge and Seaboard. On December 27, 1963, Blue Ridge delivered its letter of intention to sell to Joachim.</p>

On February 10, 1964, Joachim subleased the right to mine the land to Pagnotti for a royalty of $1.40 per gross ton. Monaco again assisted Joachim with these arrangements.</p>

      <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>The next Seaboard shareholders’ meeting was held on February 12, 1964. Monaco and Joachim each communicated that they had carried out the instructions received at the November meeting. They stated that Pagnotti was paying a royalty of $1.00 per gross ton, rather than the actual amount of $1.40. They also indicated that instead of paying the entire royalty directly, Pagnotti would pay $.65 per ton to Seaboard and $.35 per ton would be paid to the “owner” of the coal deposits.</p>
    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.4",300,[200,922,1154,374]]]'>At the same meeting Monaco displayed an “agreement” which he had prepared purporting to be a contract between Pagnotti and Seaboard concerning the installation of the plant and the mining of the coal. In actuality, the writing was not a legal agreement, and Seaboard acquired no rights in exchange for the execution of the writing.</p>
    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[199,1308,1155,430]]]'>Earlier the same day, Monaco had received from Joachim an assignment of $.10 per gross ton of all commercial coal produced from the Blue Ridge deposits then owned by Joachim. Presumably this assignment was a reward for Monaco’s services to Joachim in perpetrating the seizure and exploitation of Seaboard’s above described corporate opportunity to purchase the Blue Ridge coal banks.</p>
    <p id="b300-6" data-blocks='[["BL_300.6",300,[199,1748,1154,367]]]'>Shortly after February 12, 1964, Monaco billed and received from Seaboard $7,500 for legal services allegedly rendered to Seaboard in connection with all the negotiations between Pagnotti and Seaboard, when in actuality the negotiations had been between Joachim, Blue Ridge, and Pagnotti. However, the chancellor allowed this fee.</p>

In fact, Monaco borrowed. $18,000 in his own name and turned these funds over to Joachim.</p>
    <p id="b301-3" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[191,517,1148,591]]]'>The above partial recitation of the facts clearly demonstrates that during the period in question, the opportunity to purchase Blue Ridge’s interest in the coal banks, and the opportunity to acquire the benefit of the Pagnotti agreement and the later Corréale agreement were all available to Seaboard.

The record clearly reveals that Monaco’s actions were intertwined with Joachim’s from the outset in a common design to utilize their corporate positions to obtain unjust personal gain. Monaco failed to disclose at the February 12, 1964, Seaboard meeting that the Seaboard-Blue Ridge lease had terminated, that Blue Ridge had sold its interest in the coal banks to Joachim, and that Joachim had entered into an agreement with Pagnotti. Furthermore, Monaco displayed a ivorthless agreement to the other shareholders and represented that it Avas a binding agreement between Seaboard and Pagnotti. His affirmative assistance and active participation in depriving Seaboard of corporate opportunities permeate this entire saga.</p>
