Peirce took the oath of office and filed the requisite bond on December 8, 1970.

On December 16, 1970, President Judge Eelenbogen held that the appointment of Peirce was proper, lawful and effective, that Peirce had duly qualified for the office and was entitled to exercise the duties thereof until a successor is elected and shall qualify.

Second, if the Gov<a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>ernor has such power, has he exercised it in accordance with the Constitution and laws of this Commonwealth? Our answers are that the Governor had power to appoint to fill the Barrett vacancy, and that he properly exercised it. We accordingly affirm the decision of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b46-4" data-blocks='[["BL_46.4",46,[778,734,29,32]]]'>I.</p>
    <p id="b46-5" data-blocks='[["BL_46.5",46,[210,829,1165,1194]]]'>We start with the Constitution. Having established the required officers of county government, Article IX, Sec. 4 goes on to provide that (except for public defenders) the officers shall be elected at the municipal elections “and shall hold their offices for the term of four years, beginning on the first Monday of January next after their election, and until their successors shall be duly qualified; <em>all vacancies shall be filled in such a manner as may be provided by law.” </em>(Emphasis added.) As noted above, if a vacancy occurs in the office of clerk of courts of a county of the second class, the law (Second Class County Code) provides that the deputy to the clerk shall “perform all the duties of” the clerk “until a successor is qualified”. 16 P.S. §3408. Ritenour has been performing such duties as acting clerk of courts since Barrett’s death, and asserts he is entitled to continue to do so until Barrett’s successor is qualified <em>by election. </em>The heart of the controversy before us, therefore, is whether Peirce, the appointee of the Governor, is a successor who has qualified, or whether only a person elected at the next municipal election can be such a successor.</p>
    <p id="b46-6" data-blocks='[["BL_46.6",46,[209,2045,1154,321]]]'>Ritenour’s argument that a successor to a clerk of courts must be chosen by election is based on the Second Class County Code provision for the election of county officers, including clerks of court, and which stipulates that the term of office is “. . . four years and until his successor is elected and qualified. . . .” (Em-</p>

In practical effect, this would mean the first Monday of January, 1972, since the next municipal election will occur in November, 1971.</p>
    <p id="b47-4" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[179,812,1149,543]]]'>Such a reading of the Act of 1953 is fallacious. Section 1301 of the Act speaks only to the length of the term of office of a county officer and provides for election to such offices every four years. The words “until his successor is elected and qualified” are normal and customary words to indicate that the four year term may be extended if for any reason a person is not elected at the election preceding the expiration of the term, or if for any reason a person who is elected does not become qualified.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Ritenour confuses the <em>power to act </em>in the case <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>of his principal’s absence, death or resignation, which he was rightfully exercising until December 8 last, with the <em>right to hold the office </em>itself. The section of the Code immediately following that defining the right of .a deputy1 clerk to act provides in relevant part: “In case of a vacancy happening by death ... in any county office created by the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth, and where no other provision is made by the Constitution or by the provisions of this act to fill the vacancy, it shall be the duty of the Governor to appoint a suitable person to fill said office. . . .”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> It is clear to us, reading these sections together, that the legislature was maldng provision both for a temporary filling of a vacant office by a first deputy, and for a permanent filling (until the next municipal election) by appointment of the Governor or, absent such appointment, by election.</p>
    <p id="b48-4" data-blocks='[["BL_48.4",48,[226,1306,1156,706]],["BL_49.1",49,[178,369,1147,255]]]'>The Second Class County Code enacted in 1953 was preceded by the Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1278, which contained similar provisions relative to the duties of a deputy clerk. That Act, in turn, repealed the Act of February 12, 1874, P. L. 43, 17 P.S. §1512. The 1874 Act authorized the deputy to discharge the duties of his principal “until <em>the appointment and qualification of his successor. . . </em>.” (Emphasis added.) From the elimination in the later statutes of the words “appointment and”, appellant argues that the legislature in 1929 and again in 1953 showed its intention to eliminate also the right of appointment of a successor. On thé contrary, the amendment referred to broadened the <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>manner in which a successor clerk might be chosen. “Appointment” was a restrictive word in the Act of 1874; its deletion in the subsequent statutes allowed a successor to be selected either by appointment or by election.</p>

Article IX, Section 4, dealing with County Government, after establishing the officers of counties, their terms of office and manner of election, provides that “all vacancies shall be filled in such a manner as may be provided by law.” The applicable law is again Sec. 409 of the Second Class County Code, quoted <em>supra, </em>which explicitly provides for appointment by the governor in case of a vacancy. As noted in footnote 8, “Such appointee shall be confirmed by the Senate if in session.” At the time appellee was appointed, December 1, 1970, the Senate was not in session; hence confirmation was not required.</p>

This section authorizes the Governor, during the recess of the Senate, to fill vacancies happening, <em>inter alia, </em>“in any . . . elective office he is authorized to fill.” The section then further provides as follows: “If the vacancy happens during the session of the Senate except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, he [the Governor] shall nominate to the Senate, before its final adjournment, a proper person to fill the vacancy.” Since Barrett’s <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>death, occurred at a time when the Senate was in session, appellant argues, the Governor had the power to make an appointment only with Senatorial confirmation. We do not agree; the appointment here challenged was valid even if Article IY is applicable, as to which we express no opinion. The Governor did nominate a person to fill the Barrett vacancy before the Senate’s adjournment; the Senate took no action in the following nine months prior to its adjournment; during the ensuing recess of the Senate the Governor made the appointment. In so doing he did all that he was required to do under Article IY, Section 8, and there is no indication in the Constitution that nonaction by the Senate while it is in session operates to foreclose the Governor from exercising the right, granted by the same constitutional section, to appoint during the recess of the Senate.

This limitation is applicable only with respect to “vacancies happening in offices to which he [the Governor] appoints”. The office of clerk of courts is, as indicated at the outset, an elective one.
