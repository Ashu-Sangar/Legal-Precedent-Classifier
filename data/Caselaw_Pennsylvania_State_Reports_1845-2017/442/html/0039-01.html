The kill<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>ing took place in. the presence of numerous witnesses.

    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[217,592,1158,475]]]'>The casé came up for trial on April 23, 1963. A jury was impaneled and defendant was represented by private counsel, Byrd B. Brown, a member of the Bar with extensive experience in the trial of criminal cases. Defendant then pleaded guilty and was thereafter adjudged by the trial Court guilty of murder in the second degree. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of ten to twenty years and is presently serving that sentence.</p>
    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[212,1089,1160,1084]]]'>Defendant now appeals from the denial of relief which he sought at the hearing of his Post Conviction Hearing Act petition, at which he was again represented by counsel. The sole issue which defendant-appellant raises is whether his plea of guilty at the time of trial was voluntarily and understanding^ made. The test for the voluntariness of a plea of guilty has been iterated numerous times, although at times in slightly different language, and may be thus stated: To be Constitutionally valid, a plea of guilty must have been voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently made by defendant, i.e., with an understanding of the nature of the charges against him, his right to a jury trial and an awareness of the consequences of his plea. <em>Commonwealth v.
