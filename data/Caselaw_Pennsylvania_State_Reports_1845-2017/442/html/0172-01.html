In this vein we are not persuaded by the initial placative conclusion of the lower court that by the testator’s appointment of appellant Clara Leonard as <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>“first administratrix”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> lie essentially “include [d] her in his will ... by entitling her to fees and commissions directly from the estate.” To accept this reasoning would ignore the basic concept that the commission payable to a personal representative is purely a <em>fee for services performed </em>and does not constitute a legacy in any sense of the word—the amount of the commission must be commensurate with the services actually performed by the personal representative. <em>See, e.g., Thompson Estate, </em><a href="/pa/426/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="426 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1908645" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0270-01">426 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=232%20A.2d%20625" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="232 A.2d 625">232 A. 2d 625</a> (1967); <em>Wallis Estate, </em><a href="/pa/421/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="421 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1900323" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0104-01">421 Pa. 104</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20732" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="218 A.2d 732">218 A. 2d 732</a> (1966).

The court below merely employed the technique, long utilized by the courts of this Commonwealth when faced with a document which clearly albeit ungrammatically, expresses the intent of a testator, of transposing a sentence in order to effectuate the testamentary purpose.

At common law it was said: “Where the gift is to a class, the class must be such that all the members of it must necessarily be ascertained and take absolutely vested interests within the period.

Specifically, we are confronted with “gifts to a class, the membership of which is still subject to increase at the expiration of the period,” Commission’s comments to subsection (b), which is explicitly covered by Section 4(b) of the statute: “any interest in members of a class the membership of which is then subject to increase shall be void.” Accordingly, “[u]nder the statute, the class must actually close within the period, even though it might not have.” Bregy, <em>Intestate, Wills and Estates Acts of 1947, </em>§4(a) and (b) at 5278 (1949).</p>

As correctly noted by the lower court, the respective interests devised and bequeathed to testator’s brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces must necessarily vest within the period provided by the Rule Against Perpetuities and are valid: (1) the brothers and sisters because the previous death of testator’s parents ensures that testator can have no other brothers and sisters; and (2) the nephews and nieces because no other nephews and nieces can be bom after the death of the last surviving brother or sister, and the interest of the nephews and nieces must vest, if not immediate<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>ly, within the period enunciated by the Rule Against Perpetuities. The. thought implicit in this rationale is that only the brothers and sisters could qualify as measuring lives since the prior demise of their parents precludes the. possibility of a “fertile octogenarian” adding yet another member to the class of brothers and sisters. Leach, <em>Perpetuities in a Nutshell, </em><a href="/citations/?q=51%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20638" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="51 Harv. L. Rev. 638">51 Harv. L.

However, under the common law rule, the. nephews and nieces could not be measuring lives since there was a <em>possibility </em>of “fertile octogenarian” parents (brothers and sisters) giving birth .to an..additional nephew and/or niece after testator’s death. Thus, any interest to follow the interest of the nephews and nieces, including the remainder over to. the charities, if contingent, would fall victim to the. Rule Against Perpetuities. It is toward the prevention of such results that the General Assembly enacted the “wait and see” version of the Rule Against Perpetuities.-. In our view, three possible situations could occur by waiting, and seeing.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[217,1500,1155,595]]]'>First; if no. additional nephews and nieces are born, not only do the brothers and sisters qualify as measuring lives <em>but also </em>the six nephews and nieces. Thus, the interest given to the grandnephews and grandnieces must necessarily vest within twenty-one years following the -death of the last surviving nephew or niece since membership in the class of grandnephews and grandnieces could not, thereafter, increase.

It was the theory of the lower court that the intended distribution of trust income after the extinction of testator’s nephews and nieces, along with the gift over in remainder to the charities, violated the Rule Against Perpetuities and that, upon the death of the last surviving nephew or niece, the corpus would pass by intestacy. Again the court below ignored the Estates Act of 1947. Section 5(c) of that Act provides: “Other void interests. Any other void interest shall vest in the person or persons entitled to the income at the expiration of the period described in section 4(b) (‘Wait and see’).” Act of April 24, 1947, P.
