In its petition for distribution accompanying its first and final account, the administrator proposed distributing the entire estate to decedent’s only child in derogation of the rights of his surviving spouse, who claimed her intestate share under Section 2(2) of the Intestate Act of 1947 (Act of April 24, 1947, P.

Although appellant returned but once to remove her furniture, appellant and decedent dated intermittently.

Read literally, this statement is technically incorrect since mere withdrawal or separation does not always constitute desertion. <em>See, e.g., Lodge’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/287/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="287 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1099599" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0184-01">287 Pa. at 186-87</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%20472" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="134 A. 472">134 Atl. at 473</a>; <em>Fellabaum v.

Reviewing the opinion of the court below, we sense the <em>possibility </em>that the court below erroneously relied on this loose language of <em>Archer Estate. </em>Even if the court below erred in so doing, it would not be reversible error if there is sufficient evidence of desertion without cause or consent. Whether such is the case can best be determined by reference to appellant’s three main contentions insofar as appellant argues: (1) she did not intend to desert; (2) the separation was consensual; and (3) even if she deserted decedent she had reasonable cause.</p>

In order to buttress this contention, appellant testified to the effect that she offered to return if and when the stepchild departed. However, in light of appellant’s removal of her furniture and her failure to return at any time, we are led to the obvious conclusion that appellant intentionally deserted decedent. Additionally, we cannot characterize the proviso to her offer to return as a reasonable condition in view of the fact that her stepchild was only sixteen years old when appellant departed. <em>Cf.

Indeed, this point was not strenuously argued before this Court or in appellant’s brief. This lack of emphasis reflects the rule that, “[i]ntent is presumed when either party with<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>draws from the residence of the other without cause or consent: [citations omitted].” <em>Lodge’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/287/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="287 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1099599" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0184-01">287 Pa. at 187</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%20472" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="134 A. 472">134 Atl. at 473</a>.</p>

Although appellant and decedent continued to date and although decedent meekly nodded his head when appellant announced her departure, these facts are nullified by the stepchild’s testimony, contradicting appellant, that decedent frequently - asked appellant to return and was rebuffed. Moreover,, decedent eventually stopped seeing appellant when he learned she was dating other men. Nor. will we consider the basis for the divorce action tq be controlling.
