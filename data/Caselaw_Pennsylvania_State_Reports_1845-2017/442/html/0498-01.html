The complaint, seeking to compel the Philadelphia Civil Service Commission (Commission) to reopen appellant’s appeal concerning his separation from City employment, was filed more than two years after the appellant had withdrawn his appeal and had been permitted to resign from the City service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

    <p id="b539-6" data-blocks='[["BL_539.8",539,[184,1148,1150,878]]]'>The appellant was employed as a recreation leader in the Department of Recreation from October 7, 1963 to December 5, 1966, on which latter date he was dismissed for various reasons. The appellant filed a timely appeal from his dismissal to the Commission. A hearing was held on November 7, 1967, at which time appellant was represented by counsel. After the City presented all of its evidence, on the suggestion of appellant’s counsel and one of the Commissioners, appellant withdrew his appeal and submitted his resignation, which was accepted, the dismissal being removed from appellant’s employment record. Five days later, appellant requested by letter that his resignation be withdrawn and his appeal reopened. On December 11,1967, the Commission denied the request and refused to reopen the appeal.</p>

The Commission filed preliminary objections which were sustained and. the complaint was dismissed on August 5, 1970. Reasons given by the court below for sustaining the preliminary objections are the following: (1) mandamus does not lie to compel the exerfeise of essentially deliberative and discretionary acts; (2) review of. the Commission’s' action is limited to jurisdictional or procedural grounds and may not be had on'the-merits; and (3) the appellant’s action was not timely filed.</p>

However, if the lower court were correct in its holding that the requested action by the Commission is deliberative and discretionary, then mandamus will not lie and the complaint was properly dismissed. <em>Martin v.

"Upon such review, both the appealing employee and <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>the appointing authority involved shall have the right to be heard publicly and to present evidence . . .”. It is clear from this that the Commission, if requested by a dismissed employee, must grant him a hearing at which he is afforded an opportunity to present evidence and be heard. Appellant had that opportunity and waived his right to conclude the hearing and to a decision on the advice of counsel. The Commission thus provided for appellant the remedy as required of it by the Home Eule Charter.</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[159,912,1155,643]]]'>Accepting as we do the definition of “ministerial duty” as set forth earlier in this opinion, we conclude that a request to reopen an appeal to the Philadelphia Civil Service Commission after the employe has been given an opportunity to have a hearing and has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right, does not call for a ministerial act, but, if allowable at all, is a request for relief that is purely discretionary. Particularly is this so where the petition is for action which is not specifically mandated or otherwise required to be performed either by the Home Eule Charter or by any ordinance.</p>

R. C. P. No. 4 was not applicable or its application would be a denial of constitutional due process. In view of our holding, however, that the duty of the commission was so discretionary that this action in mandamus would not lie, we do not reach these other two questions.</p>
