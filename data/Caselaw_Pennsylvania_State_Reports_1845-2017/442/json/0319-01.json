        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThe controlling issue presented in this appeal is whether a news story headlined \u201cSlay Trial Bares Story of Bizarre Love Triangle\u201d published by the Philadelphia Daily News is actionable as libel or is privileged as a matter of law either as a fair and accurate report of a judicial proceeding or as a constitutionally protected publication under the First Amendment. We affirm the granting of defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\nNo dispute exists as to the facts surrounding the alleged libel. On July 8, 1968, a trial commenced in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to determine whether William McClurg was guilty as charged of the murder of James McClure, who died on the morning of June 24, 1967, from gunshot wounds of the chest. David Racher, a reporter for the Daily News, was assigned to cover the McClurg trial. Due to other assignments, he did not remain in the courtroom throughout the first day. Rather, at his request, the prosecuting attorney, Anthony Bateman, telephoned him at home on the evening of July 8,1968, and summarized for Racher the day\u2019s proceedings, which included Bateman\u2019s opening statement to the jury and the testimony of the first Commonwealth witness, Robert Diehl.\nRacher then telephoned the night city editor with his story. The article ivas assigned to a rewrite man, Thomas A. Fox, Jr., who proceeded to compose the story based on Racher\u2019s facts. The article appeared the following day and is set forth in its entirety in the margin. \u25a0\nOn reading the article, appellants Neil and Carolyn Binder requested the Daily News to print a retraction, but none appeared. The Binders subsequently instituted an action for defamation and invasion of privacy, requesting $2,000,000 in punitive damages against appellee, Triangle Publications, Inc., owner of the Daily News at that time.\nAfter pleadings and the taking of depositions, both parties asserted there was no material issue of fact and moved for judgment on the pleadings or in the alternative, for summary judgment pursuant to Rules 1034 and 1035 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. A hearing was held on the motions on December 22, 1969, and on February 13, 1970, summary judgment was granted in favor of Triangle Publications. This appeal ensued.\nAppellants contend that the article was not privileged and also that the First Amendment does not protect appellee\u2019s publication in this instance. While we agree the article was not absolutely privileged, we find a qualified privilege existed. Hence we need not reach the constitutional issue presented, for it is not essential to a determination of this case. See Nelson v. Miller, 373 F. 2d 474 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 924, 87 S. Ct. 2042 (1967) ; Lynch v. Owen J. Roberts School District, 430 Pa. 461, 244 A. 2d 1 (1968); Shuman v. Bernie\u2019s Drug Concessions, Inc., 409 Pa. 539, 187 A. 2d 660 (1963); Altieri v. Allentown Officers\u2019 and Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 368 Pa. 176, 81 A. 2d 884 (1951).\nAll communications pertinent to any stage of a judicial proceeding are accorded an absolute privilege which cannot be destroyed by abuse. See Taliaferro v. Sims, 187 F. 2d 6 (5th Cir. 1951); In re Universal Lubricating Systems, 150 F. 2d 832 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 326 U.S. 744, 66 S. Ct. 58, rehearing denied, 326 U.S. 808, 66 S.

Lynett, 409 Pa. 595, 187 A. 2d 586 (1963). Thus, statements by a party, a witness, counsel, or a judge cannot be the basis of a defamation action whether they occur in the pleadings or in open court.\nThe reasons for the absolute privilege are well recognized. A judge must be free to administer the law without fear of consequences. This independence would be impaired were He to be in daily apprehension of defamation suits. The privilege is also extended to parties to afford freedom of access to the courts, to witnesses to encourage their complete and unintimidated testimony in court, and to counsel to enable him to best represent -his -client\u2019s interests. Likewise, the privilege exists because the courts have other internal sanctions against defamatory statements, such as perjury or contempt proceedings. See generally, Prosser, Torts, \u00a7109 (3d ed..l964); Developments in the Law\u2014 Datamation, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 875 (1956).\nHowever, this absolute privilege does not apply to newspaper accounts of judicial proceedings, for none of the. policy considerations noted above are applicable to a news story. Rather, a newspaper possesses a qualified privilege to. make a fair and accurate report of the proceedings, and .if the article is not published solely for the purpose of causing harm to the person defamed, no responsibility attaches, even though the contents of the'article are false or defamatory. See Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Co., 441 Pa. 432, 273 A. 2d 899 (1971); Sciandra v. Lynett, supra at 600, 187 A. 2d at 589; Williams v. Kroger Grocery and Baking Co., 337 Pa. 17, 10 A. 2d 8 (1940); Restatement, Torts, \u00a7611.\nA- qualified privilege, is one that can be lost by abuse, such as ov\u00e9rly embellishing an account of a proceeding. See Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Co., supra at 452, 273 A. 2d at 909; Sciandra v. Lynett, supra at 600, 187 A. 2d at 589; Boyer v. Pitt Publishing Co., 324 Pa. 154, 188 Atl. 203 (1936).\nThus, our inquiry in this case is directed to wh\u00e9ther the Philadelphia Daily News account of the first day of the trial is fair and accurate. It is not essential that the newspaper set forth the judicial proceeding's verbatim, A summary of substantial accuracy is all that is required. Sciandra v. Lynett, supra at 600, 187 A. 2d at 589. Prosser, supra, \u00a7110.\nThe first day of trial included the opening statement of the prosecuting attorney, Bateman, and testimony of six Commonwealth witnesses. At the outset, Bate-man outlined the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the killing, which was that the deceased had been slain in a quarrel over the affections of Carolyn Binder. Bateman announced that he intended to prove that the deceased had lived in the same apartment with Carolyn Binder and her husband for several weeks prior to his death, but eventually the husband drove him away. Bateman continued by alleging that the deceased had had a date with Carolyn Binder on the night in question, but Mrs. Binder never put in an appearance. The prosecutor further stated he would prove the deceased then became jealous and angry, and began searching and telephoning the bars with his friend, Robert Diehl, in an attempt to locate Mrs. Binder.\nBateman also alleged that the deceased eventually found Mrs. Binder and. had a lengthy and heated telephone conversation with her and defendant McClurg, with whom she had been all evening. The prosecution concluded by summarizing the various events that led up to a supposed confrontation between the deceased, McClurg and Carolyn Binder.\nRobert Diehl was the first Commonwealth witness to take the stand. He testified that the deceased had a date with Carolyn Binder the evening of the night he died, which was not kept. He told of the deceased\u2019s frustration and anger, for the deceased apparently believed she was out with someone named Bud Kola. He also recounted their search of the bars for Mrs. Binder, and the angry telephone conversation. Although, according to Diehl, the deceased was relieved to find Mrs. Binder was not with Bud Kola, heated words and threats were still exchanged between the deceased and McClurg.\nAppellants stress that the jury acquitted McClurg, and that therefore - none of the above described events may have, in fact, occurred. Yet, as noted above, the truth or falsity of the underlying facts in the article do not affect the privilege so long as the story was a fair and accurate summary of the judicial proceedings. See Sciandra v. Lynett, supra at 600, 187 A. 2d at 589.\nHere, the only portion of the article which even arguably abuses the qualified privilege is the phrase \u201cbizarre love triangle\u201d. Yet, certainly the prosecuting attorney\u2019s opening statement provided ample foundation for terming the situation a \u201clove triangle\u201d.\nWe are brought then to the word \u201cbizarre\u201d. \u201cBizarre\u201d is pertinently defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language (2d ed. 1954) as \u201c [s] trildngly out of the ordinary or out of keeping, esp. as to fashion, design, color, or the like . . . involving sensational contrasts or striking incongruities.\u201d\nWe do not believe it is unfair or inaccurate to describe the situation as presented by the prosecuting attorney in his opening statement as \u201cbizarre\u201d. The unusual aspect of the case as viewed by the Commonwealth was that the love triangle existed not between a husband, wife, and lover, but rather between a wife and two, or possibly three, paramoiirs. This, coupled with the fact that one of the alleged lovers (the deceased) lived with Mrs. Binder and her husband for several weeks is sufficient to provide a fair factual foundation for the Daily News\u2019 characterization of the situation as a \u201cbizarre love triangle\u201d. An action for defamation cannot be premised solely on defendant\u2019s style or utilization of vivid words in reporting a judicial proceeding. As was stated in Sellers v. Time, Inc., 299 F. Supp. 582 (E.D. Pa. 1969), aff\u2019d, 423 F. 2d 887 (3d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 830, 91 S. Ct. 61 (1970) : \u201cWe disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the article loses its privilege by reason of the alleged \u2018flippant\u2019 and \u2018smart alecky\u2019 style of writing which was utilized by Time to create reader interest.\u201d Id. at 585.\nAppellants also urge that liability be imposed because the Daily News reporter did not attend all of the trial but rather received his information from the prosecuting attorney. We are not persuaded.\nBacher did not act unreasonably, for he had found Bateman to be a reliable source in the past. Additionally, how a reporter gathers his information concerning a judicial proceeding is immaterial provided his story is a fair and substantially accurate portrayal of the events in question.\nThe order of tbe Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia granting summary judgment is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case.\nMcClurg was eventually found \u201cNot guilty\u201d by tbe jury. See discussion infra, p. 326.\n\u201cSlat Tbial Babes Stobt of Bizaebe Love Triangle\nBy Dave Racher\n\u201cA jury of nine women and three men is hearing the murder trial of William McClurg, a truck driver charged in a fatal shooting growing out of a bizarre love triangle.\n\u201cMcClurg, 44, of Mutter St. near Cumberland, is charged with the June 24, 1967, shooting death of James McClure, Jr.,' 30, of 4433 Pearson St., in the rear of McClure\u2019s apartment building.\n\u201cAssistant District Attorney Anthony Bateman said the shooting climaxed a telephone quarrel between McClurg and McClure over the affections of Mrs.- Carolyn Binder, '24, of 3736 Westhampton Dr.\n\u201cA Witness, Robert Diehl, 31, of 3588 Teton Rd., testified he was with McClure the night of the shooting and McClure was upset because Mrs. Binder had broken \u00e1 date with him that evening.\n\u201cDiehl said he accompanied McClure on a round of bars in search of Mrs. Binder before learning the woman was at Mickey Finn\u2019s, a midcity bistro.\n\u201cDiehl said that on learning of Mrs. Binder\u2019s whereabouts, McClure was so upset he went to her ear, which was parked in the rear of McClure\u2019s apartment house, and ripped out the distributor wires.\n\u201cDiehl' said McClure then returned to Diehl\u2019s apartment, telephoned Mickey Finn\u2019s and spoke to Mrs. Binder.\n\u201cHe Quoted McClure as using obscenities against Mrs. Binder and saying, \u2018I just don\u2019t care anymore.\u2019\n\u201cDiehl said McClure then spoke to Mrs. Binder\u2019s date, a man McClure called \u2018BUI.\u2019\n\u201cDiehl said McClure told the man, \u2018BUI, I\u2019m not afraid of your guns and bullets. If you\u2019re going to blow my brains out, don\u2019t do it here. These are nice people. As soon as I hang up this phone, I\u2019m going to leave. I didn\u2019t know it was you Carolyn was with, Bill. I thought she was out with Bud.\u2019\n\u201cProsecutor Bateman told the jury the man McClure called -\u2018Bill\u2019 was the defendant, Mcdurg. The identity of \u2018Bud\u2019 is not known.\n\u201cDiehl said that after the telephone call, McClure began pacing up and down in a cold sweat. He said McClure later borrowed his car and a night light attachment, apparently to repair the damage to Mrs. Binder\u2019s auto.\n\u25a0 \u201cMcClube Was Shot to death near Mrs. Binder\u2019s car. The hood of the car was up.\n\u201cBateman said that after the shooting, Mrs. Binder left Philadelphia with McClurg.\n\u201cIn -his opening address to the jury, Bateman called the victim \u2018a w\u00fcd kind of fellow.\u2019 He said McClure had, for a time, lived with Mrs. Binder and her husband, Neal, at the Westhampton Dr. address.\n\u201cBinder testified the victim had resided with him and his wife. The Binders have a 4 year-old son.\n\u201cAt the conclusion of yesterday\u2019s testimony, Mrs. Binder walked across the courtroom and handed the defendant a glass of water as he was leaving.\n\u201cBinder was expected to return to the stand today.\u201d\nThe six witnesses were: Robert Diehl; Dr. Marvin Aronson, Assistant Medieal Examiner; William Hadfield, who discovered the deceased\u2019s body; Officer Dennis Gibson; Raymond Lake; and Neil Binder, one of appellants herein. The majority of the day was spent with the testimony of Robert Diehl. Neil Binder did not take the stand until the end of the day, and had merely identified himself before the trial was adjourned until the following day.\nThe Daily News article attributes this information to Binder. Actually, it was Bateman who made the statement. We do not find this error in any way material; Binder testified the following day that the deceased had indeed lived with them for several weeks.\nThe other inaccuracy in the article which has come to our attention is the reported quote of Diehl\u2019s testimony as to what the deceased had told \u201cBill\u201d. The notes of testimony disclose the following:\n\u201cA. [Diehl] . . . And he [McClure] said, \u2018Look, Bill, guns and bullets don\u2019t scare me no more.\u2019 He said, \u2018If you want to come up and blow my brains out, come on ahead.\u2019\n\u201cQ. What did he say?\n\u201cA. He said, \u2018If you want to come up here and blow my brains up, but,\u2019 he said, \u2018don\u2019t do it in this house. These people are too nice.\u2019 He said, \u2018Do it some place else.\u2019 And he kept apologizing some more. And he said, T didn\u2019t know it was you, Bill. I am sorry.\u2019 \u201d\nWhen compared with the conversation as reported by Racher, we again find no legally substantial inaccuracy.",
