He was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. No direct appeal from the judgment of sentence was taken.\nIn April of 1969, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, which alleged that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered, that the plea was based on a coerced confession, and that he was denied his right to appeal.\nA full evidentiary hearing was held by the post-conviction court and the post-conviction judge found as fact that none of appellant\u2019s allegations was true. The record of the Post Conviction Hearing Act proceedings provides ample support for the factual conclusions of the court below.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case.",
