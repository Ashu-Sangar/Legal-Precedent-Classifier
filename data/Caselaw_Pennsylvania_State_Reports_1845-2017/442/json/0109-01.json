At his trial, he was represented by counsel.\nAppellant contended in his P.C.H.A. petition that he was not informed of his right to appeal. At the hearing, appellant\u2019s attorney testified as follows: \u201cQ. Did you advise him of his right to appeal? A. He himself\u2014well, I mentioned to him that there is no appeal from the electric chair because that was what his wishes were, and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t intend to appeal. I don\u2019t want to appeal. I did it and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\u2019 This conversation took place prior to the actual trial and the imposition of sentence. However, the lower Court made no finding or decision on this point or issue.\nThe case is remanded to the lower Court with instructions to determine whether the appellant\u2019s rights, as mandated in Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353; Com. ex rel. Cunningham v. Maroney, 421 Pa. 157, 218 A. 2d 811; Com. ex rel. Branam v. Myers, 420 Pa. 77, 216 A. 2d 89; Com. ex rel. Robinson v.
