L. 193, for the year ending first Monday of November, 1886. From this settlement. the defendant company appealed. The cause was submitted to the decision of the court, without a jury, under the provisions of the act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109. The specifications of objection to the settlement, the decision of the court below, Simonton, P. J., the exceptions thereto filed by both plaintiff and defendant, the opinion of the court below disposing of the exceptions, and the final judgment, raised essentially the same questions raised in Commonwealth v. Lehigh Y. R. Co., ante, 429.\nJudgment having been entered as of May 10, 1888, in favor of the commonwealth for the tax at three mills \u201c for ten twelfths of a year upon $885,026.62, being upon the amount of mortgages, etc., owned by residents of Pennsylvania \u201c as nearly as can be ascertained,\u201d with attorney general\u2019s commissions and interest, total, $2,787.61, the defendant company took the appeal to No. 35, and the commonwealth took the appeal to No. 45, the assignments of error filed being essentially the same with those filed in the case referred to.\nMr. M. E. Olmsted, for the Delaware etc. R. Co.\nMr. William S. Kirlcpatriek, Attorney General, and Mr. John E. Sanderson, Deputy Attorney General, for the commonwealth."
