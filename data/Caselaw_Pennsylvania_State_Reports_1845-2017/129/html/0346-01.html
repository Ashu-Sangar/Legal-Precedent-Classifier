It is true that the most extensive department of the defendant company’s business was the manufacture of steel rails; that it consumed the products of its iron-ore mining and its quarrying operations, and the greater part of the coal resulting from its coal mining operations ; and that the manufacture of steel rails is an operation requiring ore as a raw material, coal as fuel, and limestone as a part of the process of reducing the iron, as the result of which steel rails are produced. To say, however, that its mining and quarrying operations are necessarily incident tó its manufacturing operations, is to deal merely with words. The substance of the case is, that the company, because it possessed a manufacturing franchise, was its own customer as to the operation of its mining and quarrying franchise, and that by reason of its enjoyment of the latter it was independent of the ordinary markets and means for supplying its raw materials.</p>

It is the policy of recent legislation to strictly classify corporations, and to confine each to the exercise of the franchise pertaining to its particular class. This will be seen by reference to the corporation act of 1874. Here is a case where an exemption from taxation is alleged. Such an exemption must be strictly construed: Academy v. Philadelphia Co., <a href="/pa/22/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="22 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="413783" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0496-01">22 Pa. 496</a> ; Miller v.

An exemption from taxation of manufacturing corporations would, it is contended, include only such corporations as are exclusively organized for and engaged in the business of manufacturing. The exemption must be construed to include nothing more than its terms embrace. Quarrying companies are not exempted,' and mining 'companies are not exempted ; and a company that is both of these, and a manufacturing company in addition, must be excluded from that class of such companies which are thus strictly defined as manufacturing corporations.</p>

The tests of exemption are two: (1) Is the corporation one exclusively organized for manufacturing purposes ? (2) Is its capital so exclusively employed? The learned court below in the present case applied the second test, but not the first. The application of both, as insisted upon by the commonwealth, would have entirely excluded the defendant from the benefit of the exemption. The application of the second, as made by the court, has excluded a certain portion of its property, to wit : bonds, mortgages, city lots and store-goods. • The court, however, included within the exempted portion the portion of its capital invested in the business of mining coal and iron-ore, and the capital invested in the land connected with such operations. These are independent enterprises: and, even if the portion of the capital invested in the manufacturing plant should be exempted, it is submitted that the portion invested in other enterprises should not be.

The term is “ manufacturing corporations ; ” and the only thing to be determined is, whether the company in this case is or is not a manufacturing corporation. The general corporation act of April 29,1874, P. L. 78, in division XVII., authorizes the incorporation of companies for “ the manufacture of iron or steel or both, or of any other metal, or of any article of commerce from metal or wood, or both.” And § 88 of the act, title, “ Iron and Steel Companies,” relates exclusively to corporations of division XVII., and clearly recognizes that, as necessary incidents of their manufacturing business, such corporations may be, and usually are, required to own land and mine their own coal and iron.</p>

The character of a corporation is to be determined by the character of the principal business in which it is engaged. The revenue act of April 20, 1874, P. L. 68, provided, in its fourth section, that railroad and other transportation companies should pay a tax of six mills upon their capital stock. The fifth section provided that other corporations should pay a tax of three mills. The Pennsylvania Coal Company not only owned coal mines, but also owned nearly one hundred miles of railroad, in which it had invested over $2,000,000.

We, therefore, hold.....that the' defendant is a manufacturing corporation, within the provisions of the act of 1885, only as to so much of its capital stock as it has shown to be thus employed. The burden is upon it to make out its claim to the relief set up; if it fails, the capital stock tax of 1879 is properly collectible. It has failed with respect to the last three items of paragraph 3, and we must therefore decide a due proportion of its capital stock to be taxable.”</p>

Neither of them has any necessary connection with the latter. True, they are sources from which corporations engaged in manufacturing iron necessarily draw their chief supply of raw materials, but those materials always may be and frequently are obtained from parties or corporations independently engaged in mining and supplying same to manufacturers of iron and others. It is, doubtless, a great convenience and advantage for an iron manufacturing company to own and operate its own coal and iron-ore mines, but the fact that such corporation is also specially authorized to do so, is no reason why so much of its capital as is invested in such mining operations should enjoy the benefit of exemption from state tax, designed to relieve manufacturing, as contradistinguished from mining corporations, from a burden they were supposed to be illy able to bear.</p>

Such mining and quarrying operations are not legally incident to the business of manufacturing; that is to say, they do not necessarily depend upon it, although, as a matter of fact, the supply of raw materials is, in one sense, incident to the process of manufacturing. If the business of mining and supplying such raw materials is not necessarily incident to a strictly manufacturing franchise, it cannot become so because that franchise is exercised concurrently with the separate franchises of mining and quarrying. As we have seen, the corporation appellee is of a fourfold character. It is a coal mining company, a quarrying company, an iron-ore mining company, and a manufacturing company, specifically invested with the distinct rights and privileges pertaining to each, and exercising all of them. In the exercise of its manufacturing franchise, it finds it convenient and profitable to become, in the main, the consumer of products resulting from the exercise of the other three. In other words, the mining and quarrying departments, so to speak, find a convenient customer in the manufacturing department. But, how can it be <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>inferred from this, that the capital employed in the mining and quarrying departments of the business is relieved from state tax, because capital employed in manufacturing happens to be exempt ? Such a conclusion would be as unjust as it is illogical. It relieves from taxation capital which the legislature never intended to exempt, merely because it happens to belong to a corporation which owns and controls other capital which, for a special reason, the legislature has seen fit to exempt.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[262,773,1171,1157]]]'>The case in hand is a striking illustration of the injustice of any construction that would relieve the company from the payment of state tax on so much of its capital as is employed in its mining and quarrying operations; and we know of no rule of law that even favors, much less demands any such construction. The spirit of the exemption clause under consideration does not require it; nor is it demanded by the necessities of the company. A corporation that makes a net annual pr'ofit of from ten to fifteen per cent on its entire capital, is not an object of state charity, and should not, under a strained construction of the exemption clause, be permitted to evade payment of its share of the public burden. Corporations engaged in mining coal, etc., but not authorized to engage in manufacturing, are subject to the payment of state tax. Under a fair, if not a very liberal construction of the act of 1885, § 20, we think all that the company can reasonably claim is exemption from tax on so much of its capital stock as has been found to, be employed in strictly manufacturing operations, as contra-distinguished from the mining operations in which by its charter it was also authorized to engage at the same time.
