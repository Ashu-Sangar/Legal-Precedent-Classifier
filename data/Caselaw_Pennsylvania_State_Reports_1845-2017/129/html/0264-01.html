    <p class="summary" id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[257,690,1172,796]]]'>The question has been argued. The lease to the plaintiff was subsequent to the release of the company. Mr. Stewart contends that the release is a bar to the plaintiff’s action, because the embankment was raised and graded and the culvert finished before the release was executed; what the railroad company proposed to do in respect of the carrying off the water brought down by the drain, was to be seen by all; the plaintiff’s lessor had better means of knowing whether the culvert would prove sufficient than the company’s engineers, she having experience of the rains in that region and the volume of water sent down by the water shed and collected thereat; and non constat that the consideration she received for the release was not based in part on the probable damage to land and crops in the V by reason of the damming back of the water.

    <p id="b287-8" data-blocks='[["BL_287.8",287,[129,999,1169,1009]]]'>It was not error to enter judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto upon the reserved point. The release was broad in its terms. After reciting the consideration, $1,000, and certain acts to be performed by the defendant company, it “remised, released, quit-claimed and forever discharged the Southern Pennsylvania Iron &amp; Railroad Company, their successors and assigns, of and from all suits, claims, demands and damages whatever, for, upon, or by reason of their entry upon and taking and occupying the above described narrow pieces or strips of land and the location and construction thereon of thp said railroad and works connected therewith.” In connection with this release, there was the fact, admitted upon the trial, and incorporated into the point reserved, “that the culvert and embankment on the plaintiff’s land, as now maintained, was constructed and completed before the date and delivery of the release offered in evidence.” In the face of these facts we are unable to see any ground upon which the plaintiff could rest his claim for damages. There must be some color of right to sustain a suit even against a railroad company. There is none in this case.</p>
