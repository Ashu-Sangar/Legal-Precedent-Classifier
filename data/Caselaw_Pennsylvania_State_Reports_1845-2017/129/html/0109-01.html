The defendant' not only denies the title of the plaintiff, but alleges that the company has the title to the locus in quo and that it and those under whom it claims have been in possession thereof for many years. There is no formal proof of paper title; but the defendant shows by the affidavit of J. W. Peck, from whom it purchased, as well as by the affidavits of a number of others, that John Mesfeicar and those claiming under him were in possession of the land for many years; that Mr. Peck bought of those in possession about twenty years ago, and that he sold to the defendant in March of the present year.</p>

I have no doubt the land described in the deed includes the land on which the defendant is constructing its railroad, but the plaintiff offered no evidence to show title in those from whom he bought, and no evidence as to who had been in possession of it, to rebut or overcome that offered by the defendant. When the plaintiff’s right has not been established at law, or is not, clear, but is questioned on every ground on which he puts it, he is not entitled to an injunction : Rhea v. Forsyth, <a href="/pa/37/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="37 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="418866" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0503-01">37 Pa. 503</a>; Minnig’s App., <a href="/pa/82/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="82 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1047862" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0373-01">82 Pa. 373</a>; Washburn’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="105 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="454298" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0480-01">105 Pa. 480</a>. If the plaintiff were, or ever had been, in possession of the land, a different question might b”e presented, hut .1 do not see my way clear to restraining the defendant from carrying on a legitimate enterprise on land of which it is in <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>possession and to which it claims the title, before the plaintiff’s rights have been established at law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[244,466,1169,1168]]]'>The plaintiff also alleges in his bill of complaint that the defendant is filling up the bed of the river and diverting the channel therof, and that this will cause him irreparable injury. He is in possession of lands on the east side of the river. His rights as a riparian owner are not defined. This part of the complaint appears to me to be based upon a misapprehension of the plans and purposes of the defendant. If the defendant intended to construct the retaining wall already begun to the middle pier of the Decker bridge and to fill in all of the channel between such wall and the former bank of the river on the west side, the complaint would no doubt be well founded; but it appears from the maps and affidavits before me that instead of building the wall to the middle pier of the bridge, it is only cutting into the rough banks of the river and erecting a solid wall with a smooth surface to protect the banks of the river, and that the dirt now thrown into the river is from the excavations made for the wall, and is to be thrown back as filling. The engineers all testify that a wall with a smooth surface, such as is being constructed, instead of impeding the flow of the river or deflecting it upon the plaintiff’s land, will draw the water to itself and increase the flow. If such is the case I do not see how the plaintiff will be injured. The injunction heretofore granted is dissolved.</p>
