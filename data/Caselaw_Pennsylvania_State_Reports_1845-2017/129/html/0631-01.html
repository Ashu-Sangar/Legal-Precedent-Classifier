Distribution was reported accordingly.</p>

The matter of a few hundred dollars has been sufficient to array brother and sister against each other in the most unseemly strife; and not only that, but the zeal and feeling which have been stirred up between the parties appear to have rendered some of them entirely forgetful of the sacred obligation of their oaths in an utter and shameful prostitution of the truth. The testimony in many of its features is bleared and polluted with falsehood. Most unfortunate indeed must be the moral sense of those who have thus violated their con<a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>sciences, and placed themselves for all time in the' attitude of self-accusers. In this maze of uncertainty we will not attempt to decide who have told the truth and who have sworn falsely. The conclusion reached by the learned auditor, although by a different method than we would pursue, is, we think, the only one, under all the evidence, that he could reach.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b653-5" data-blocks='[["BL_653.5",653,[152,658,1179,190]]]'>The paper marked exhibit A was, we think, properly admissible ; and when once admitted, the burden of overthrowing it was cast upon the parties who signed it, or whose names were subscribed to it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b653-7" data-blocks='[["BL_653.7",653,[151,969,1180,612]]]'>Taking therefore, this testimony into consideration so far as the parties interested-are concerned, and leaving out the question of credibility which we are unable to pass upon, the weight of the testimony would seem to preponderate in favor of the authenticity of the paper. Leaving out all the testimony and taking into consideration the paper alone, supported by the testimony of George S. Reed, and the facts connected with its execution, age, and retention for so many years by J ohn Summerville, we would feel constrained by the well known rules of evidence applying to written obligations, to hold that the release or receipt, marked exhibit A, is sufficiently established to have a binding effect upon the distribution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b653-8" data-blocks='[["BL_653.8",653,[149,1589,1181,712]]]'>As to the subsequent article entered into between John Summerville and Samuel M., the testimony is contradictory. There is strong testimony bearing upon the fact of the existence of the contract to the time of death of John Summerville, but this is denied by Samuel M. and Mrs. Cosgrove. However this fact may be, that contract, if it had been asserted, established title out of John Summerville at his death, which would have stood in the way of the proceedings in partition. Two actions in ejectment had been brought, by J. A. Summerville at No. 114 December Term 1882, and J. H. Summerville at No. 115 December Term 1882, against S. M. Summerville, but were evidently abandoned, as motions to discontinue were filed by plaintiffs in both cases. It would thus appear that by this action it was no longer asserted that the title was in S. M. Summerville.</p>

      <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>We are, however, met by the objection that the decree in partition would be conclusive of the rights of the parties to be treated as tenants in common as to the fund representing the land, subject to distribution. It is true that the proceedings in partition and the decree do affect all parties to it who have not had notice, but the decree cannot be held to raise up a title to the fund if none exists. The very language of the release, exhibit A, explicitly relates to advancements made to the parties to it by the decedent, and only admits of a future allowance in case the decedent made a will. This he did not do. Therefore, by the authority of the case cited by exceptants’ attorneys, Dutch’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="57 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1010452" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0461-01">57 Pa. 461</a>, it is held “ that it is not too late after partition to settle advancements in the distribution of the valuation amongst those entitled.”</p>

We confess that there has been much groping through darkness, in our endeavor to penetrate to the light, and which we even now do not feel an absolute assurance that we have finally obtained.</p>
