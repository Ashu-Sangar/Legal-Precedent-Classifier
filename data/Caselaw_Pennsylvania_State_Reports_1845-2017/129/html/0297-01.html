He cannot be deprived of this privilege by any circumstance so trivial as that which may determine the form of action which the plaintiff may elect to bring.

We are clearly satisfied that he could not be so arrested in this case. On a warrant of arrest “ the proceeding is not at all' a criminal one. The fraud is treated as a private injury, giving rise to a corresponding modification of the ordinary private remedy applicable to debts. If the debt be fraudulently contracted, or if it be fraudulently attempted <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>to be evaded, this special remedy may be applied, whether the fraud be committed in or out of the state; just as we allow actions of tort without question of the place where the wrong was done.”</p>

Fraud is not' to be presumed, but it may, and often múst, be proved by circumstances. The defendant contends that he did not know the terms of the contract under which the iron in question was purchased. The evidence clearly establishes that he was not purchasing iron in any other way than by cash order shipment purchases, at or about the time this transaction occurred, except in one instance, in which it was purchased on thirty days’ credit. There is no evidence whatever that any cash purchases were made other than those in which the iron was not to be delivered until after payment. •Defendant had notice, several days before the shipment of the first car, that the purchase had been made, and there was nothr ing in the notice to lead him to suppose that the purchase was made on other than the usual terms, nor did he testify, when upon the stand, that he believed it was so made. He ’ also claims that he did not know the iron was taken until after it was used. The whole evidence shows that he must have known it before the second lot arrived, and his concealment of the fact for nearly two months, from the plaintiffs’ agent, that the iron had been used, and his evident reluctance, when upon the stand, to state candidly and clearly the whole truth of the case, lead us to the conclusion that he knowingly committed the fraud. If, by mistake, a ear load of iron had been taken and used by an honest man, who had no design or intention to commit a fraud, the plain course for him to pursue would be, as soon as the mistake was discovered, to notify the owner and make restitution. Instead of this, the defendant, who must, if he had not known it at the time, have discovered the mistake before the second load was taken, concealed the facts from the owners, made no restitution, refused to pay for the iron, and, on the hearing, set up the improbable excuse and defence that he did not know the terms upon which the iron was purchased, when, from the nature of things and from the letters produced in evidence, he must have known it.</p>

Place, <a href="/pa/32/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="32 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="986790" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0520-01">32 Pa. 520</a>.</p>

But if it had been granted, it would not have saved their case, for the warrant of arrest was then out of court and it must stand or fall upon the record as already made up : Scully v. Kirkpatrick, <a href="/pa/79/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="79 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="438410" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0324-01">79 Pa. 324</a>. If the plaintiffs’ cause of action be founded upon a contract, they cannot recover on it in trespass, which is an action ex delicto, both at common law and under the act of May 25,1887, P. L. 271. And if they cannot recover in the form of action instituted, they have no right to the remedy under the act of 1842.</p>

If the action were assumpsit upon the contract for the purchase of the pig iron, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to the warrant of arrest. It is not alleged that Cooper or either of the defendants personally contracted the debt. But the fraud that will move the judge under the act of 1842 is the personal fraud of the party charged, not that of a copartner: Bassett v. Davis, 1 Clark 310; Wetmore v. Earle, <a href="/abb-pr-ns/9/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Abb. Pr. 58" data-case-ids="1965688,4593928" data-case-paths="/abb-pr-ns/9/0058-01,/abb-pr/9/0058-01">9 Abb.

Again it is not alleged that there was any fraud, on the part of any one, in the original contracting of the debt. The only fraud alleged by the plaintiffs, or found by the judge, is the taking and converting the pig iron in fraud of the rights of the plaintiffs. But the very words of the act require that there <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>must have been fraud in contracting the debt, meaning some fraudulent conduct at the time of the contract: Hamill v.

If there be no technical error upon the face of the proceedings which properly constitute the record brought up by the certiorari, the action of the judge must be affirmed. It is important, then, to determine what part of the papers and proceedings making up the record of the suit, is included within the record which the certiorari brings here. We submit that, since the proceeding under the warrant of arrest is collateral and auxiliary to the suit, nothing belongs to the record except what is pertinent to and directly connected with the collateral proceeding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-7" data-blocks='[["BL_326.7",326,[254,1225,1166,503]]]'>2. The affidavits upon which the warrant of arrest was issued fully meet the requirements of the statute. They distinctly aver the pendency of a suit; that there is a debt or demand due from the defendants, and that this debt or money claim was fraudulently contracted, giving the facts and circumstances. They thus go even beyond the rule laid down in Gosline v. Place, <a href="/pa/32/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="32 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="986790" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0520-01">32 Pa. 520</a>, and Berger v.

There was therefore no error in issuing the warrant, since, if the affidavits made out a case of probable cause, the requirements of the statute were fully answered.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-8" data-blocks='[["BL_326.8",326,[254,1734,1166,594]]]'>3. The findings of fact upon which the order of commitment was based cannot be reviewed. The assignment of error as to the commitment must stand or fall by a simple inspection of the record. We contend that this is regular in all essential particulars. It shows that after hearing the judge was satisfied that the demand of the plaintiffs was a contract, and that the allegations of the plaintiff were substantiated, in that the defendants “ fraudulently contracted the debt respecting which the suit is brought,” which was held sufficient in Gosline v. Place, <a href="/pa/32/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="32 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="986790" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0520-01">32 Pa. 520</a>. These express findings preclude any question as to the meaning of the term “ contract,” or as to what is or is not stated in the affidavits.</p>

It may be that the form of the action brought was a tech<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>nical mistake, but tbe judge found as a fact that the demand sued for had its inception in contract, and, if a mistake, the form of action was clearly amendable under the act of May 10, 1871, P. L. 265. The right to a warrant of arrest under the act of ,1842, does not, however, depend upon the form of the action, as the opinion of the learned judge conclusively shows. The statute does not specify any particular form of suit. Moreover, the proceedings on the warrant are no part of the proceedings in the action: Scully v. Kirkpatrick, <a href="/pa/79/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="79 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="438410" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0324-01">79 Pa. 324</a>, and this court cannot regard them. Hence the form of the action can have nothing to do with the regularity of the proceedings under review.</p>

It is clear we cannot do so upon the merits. The certiorari brings up nothing but the record, of which the proceedings subsequent to the warrant form ho part. There is no provision in the act of 1842 that the proceedings, or any part of them, shall be filed of record. It follows that if the affidavit was sufficient to justify the warrant, the action of the court below must stand.</p>
    <p id="b327-7" data-blocks='[["BL_327.8",327,[121,1489,1167,910]],["BL_328.1",328,[268,368,1166,707]]]'>The affidavit of George T. Barnes, one of the plaintiffs below, upon which the proceeding was based, contains near the close thereof the general averment that “ the said George P. Cooper and Charles H. Reynolds, doing business under the name and style of Cooper, Reynolds &amp; Co., have fraudulently incurred the debt or obligation for which the above entitled suit is brought, within the meaning of the act of July 12, 1842.” Had the plaintiffs rested upon this general averment, their case would have been stronger than it is as now presented, for, when they proceed to set forth the facts upon which the charge that the debt was fraudulently contracted is founded, it appears that said charge was a mere conclusion of law from facts insufficient to support it. We think it conclusively appears that the fraud was not in the original contract — the order for the iron — -but in its subsequent breach- after the iron had been shipped by the plaintiffs to W. S. Pilling, in care of the defendants at their rolling-mill, near Harrisburg. Granted that the defendants had no right to use the iron until paid for, yet their <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>use of it was but a subsequent breach of their original contract; and, while such breach might have involved a fraud, it by no means follows that the original contract was tainted with the fraud; in other words, that the debt was fraudulently contracted. There may be many instances in which the breach of a contract is a fraud, or at least partakes of the nature of a fraud. There is no averment in the affidavit to connect the subsequent fraud with the original contract. Had there been such averment, that the fraud was contemplated and intended when the order for the iron was given, the case would have presented a different aspect and raised quite another question. As it stands, there is nothing upon the record — and we look no further — to support the allegation that the debt was fraudulently contracted.</p>
