After a very careful examination of the evidence we have come to the conclusion that we cannot do so. The evidence consists, substantially, of the testimony of Jacob <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>Charles and his wife, that there was such an agreement, and of John D. Charles and his wife, that there was not. The only-testimony given by William Trullinger on the subject relates to certain admissions which he testified John D. Charles had made three weeks before the taking of the testimony. Each of these witnesses was interested, and each testified in favor of the interest represented by them respectively. The transaction on the face of the papers purported an absolute sale by Jacob to John. The deed was executed, delivered, and recorded; and a note was taken for the balance of the purchase money not paid, or secured by the Fisher mortgage. There is nothing to show that Jacob and his wife are any more worthy of credit than John and his wife. Trullinger testifies to statements made by John three weeks before the hearing, which are inconsistent with John’s sworn testimony, but he also testifies that Jacob did not give him the correct version of the facts, when he asked him about the judgment on record against John. In this state of the evidence we could not say with any confidence that the master erred in his conclusion, nor would we set the finding aside if it were the result of a verdict by a jury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[132,1404,1173,961]]]'>It is probable, as suggested bj1- the master, that at or after the time the conveyance was made to John, there was some talk of his reconveying in case he could not pay. But the testimony does not convince us that this talk ever amounted in form or substance to an agreement which, even in the absence of the statute of frauds, could have been enforced. And there is no evidence whatever that Sarah E. Charles, the defendant, John’s wife, ever agreed to join in a conveyance, and she could not in any event have been compelled to do so. Jacob might have withheld the conveyance to John until the purchase money was paid, and on failure to pay, either from want of disposition or ability, have refused altogether to convey; but he did not choose to do so. He made the conveyance and gave credit for the balance of the purchase money not paid or secured, and thus made it possible for Sarah to obtain a lien on the land; and be now asks the court to do for him what he declined or omitted to do for himself. In view of the master's finding, which we do not feel at liberty to disturb, we do not think we can afford him any relief.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[240,586,1171,1060]]]'>It cannot be said that J ohn took no interest in the land by the conveyance made to him by Jacob. He paid $300 of the purchase money, by the surrender of the note for that amount which he held against Jacob. This being so, even if Jacob had retained the legal title as security for the purchase money, or had taken from John a written agreement to re-convey on failure to pay the balazz.ce, John would have had an interest in the land which would have been subject to a judgmezit liezi and sale on execution, and the purchaser at such sale, certainly, if made before reconveyance, would have stood izi John’s shoes, and have been ezititled to a conveyance on payment of the balance of the purchase money; or, to have the amount paid refunded on making a reconveyance. And we are unable to see how the rights of the judgment creditor, vested by the entering up of the judgmezit could be prejudiced by a reconveyance of the land bound by the lien of the judgment, because it was made before execution was issued. Nor do we think that the judgment creditor is izi aziy worse position because she is John’s wife, holding a judgment agaizist him for an honest debt, than if she were a stranger. She had the same right to levy on his iziterest in the land that a strazzger would have had.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.6",314,[240,1654,1169,646]]]'>In our opinion the plaintiffs are misled into the belief that they have a right to equitable relief, by the fact that Jacob took no security from John for the uzipaid purchase money. If he had, for example, taken a valid written contract to reconvey, it would be seen at once that a judgmezit creditor, whether his wife or a stranger, could levy on his interest in the land, subject to this agreement, and that the purchaser at sheriff’s sale would take his place under it. The fact that no such valid contract was made, does not destroy the right to levy and sell; it simply leaves the purchaser unbound, because John, whose rights the purchaser takes, was not bound. Any evil consequence to Jacob results from his own failure to make himself secure when he could have done so.</p>

The first assignment alleges that “ The court erred in sustaining the report of the master upon the facts of the case, his finding being against the weight of the evidence.” This assignment is so general that it is of no practical use. It designates no particular fact in the findings in which the master has erred. Moreover, it merely alleges that his findings are “ against the weight of the evidence.” This is an admission that there was a conflict of evidence. In such cases we do not weigh it. That is for the master, who heard the witnesses and has the means of judging of their credibility, and for the court below, who is one step nearer the witnesses than we are. We would be treading upon dangerous ground to overrule the master upon a question of the weight of the evidence, sustained as he is by the court below. We cannot say, as a legal proposition, that the defendant, by joining in the deed of conveyance to Mary E. Charles, discharged the land from the lien of her judgment. The deed is not printed in the paper books, but the fact is found by the master that the deed of conveyance from Jacob Charles and wife to William Trullinger contains a general warranty of title, and the usual covenant against incumbrances, in the words “ grant, bargain and sell.” It does not appear what covenants were contained in the deed executed by the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>defendant and her husband to Mary E. Charles. We need not speculate, therefore, as to how far a married woman who joins -in a convejwtee of her husband’s real estate is bound by the covenants in the deed.</p>
