The town council, if they themselves had passed a resolution fixing the grade of the street, and had <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>undertaken to raise the street to that grade, would have been bound to answer to the property holders for the damages.

It was not relevant or material to the issue made by the pleadings. It was alleged by the plaintiff that the railroad company, in constructing its road upon Water street in the borough of Chambersburg, made an embankment in the street in front of his lots, by reason of which he sustained damage; and this allegation was denied by the company. The ordinance did not fix the grade of Water street, nor attempt to do so. It merely granted to the railroad company the right to use the street for its road, provided it conformed to a certain grade. It was the grade of the railroad to which the proviso referred. In this case the grade of the railroad did not conform to the actual grade of the street. We need not <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>discuss the question of the liability of a railroad company for damages, where it locates its road in conformity with the paper grade of a street, before an actual change of grade is effected by the city or borough authorities. It will be time enough to consider this question when it fairly arises.</p>
