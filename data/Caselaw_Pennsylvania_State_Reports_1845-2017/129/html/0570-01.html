The Salem turnpike ran through the front portion of her lot, cutting it into two portions. On the lower portion of the lot was situated a house, and back of the house a garden. The turnpike running through the lot had under it, just above the house, a small sewer to carry off the waste water. In June, 1883, a flood occurred which caused considerable damage to the plaintiff’s property, but it was conceded that for this the city was not liable. In the fall of 1883, however, the city went upon the ground and constructed a larger sewer under the turnpike, in place, of the small sewer. The plaintiff claimed that by reason of the increased flow of water through the larger sewer her property was injured.</p>

They say, too, that the cutting away of the timber and the making of streets had made the effect of storms more serious and increased the natural flow of water; that when they put this sewer in, the first you have any knowledge they had anything to do with it, the water in every heavy rain would overflow and go over the lot below, and for that reason they put the larger sewer there; that no more water has passed through there than the natural watershed would throw off, or, if there be more water, the increase has been caused by the clearing up of the country, etc.; that, in addition thereto, a part of the water that would naturally flow this way into the ravine has been taken off by a sewer put in at Orange street, and thereby the flow of water has really been lessened across this lot; that it is less now than .it was before the sewer was put there by the city. They ask you to find, too, that the plaintiff did nothing; that she was guilty of contributory negligence by reason of sitting idly by and allowing her property to be wasted away each year, and for that reason she cannot recover for anything which has occurred since the flood of June, 1883.
