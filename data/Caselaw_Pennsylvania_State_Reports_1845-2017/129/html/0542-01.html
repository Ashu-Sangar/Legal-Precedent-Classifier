    <p class="summary" id="b563-7" data-blocks='[["BL_563.7",563,[156,769,1183,1168]]]'>Jacob Renner, deceased, by his last will and testament, dated June 20,1885, probated July 20,1885, bequeathed, inter alia, to his daughter Lucretia Headley, the plaintiff in this ease, the sum of $1,800, of which he directed that his son Bar-net, the defendant, should pay $400, in four equal annual payments. The will further provides: “ I have conveyed to my four sons, John, Henry, Barnet and Kinsey Renner, of my real estate by general warranty deed what I intend them to have, for which they are to pay to my two daughters the above named sums.” When the first payment or instalment coming to Mrs. Headley fell due, Barnet refused to pay and this suit was brought for its recovery. On the trial, the plaintiff claimed that her father intended, in the distribution of his estate, to give his real estate to his sons, they to pay, in the proportions mentioned, to each of his daughters the sum of $1,800, and that his intention was to be gathered from the deeds and will taken together ;■ and that in delivering the deeds to his sons, as testified to by William Clovis, he was acting under the mistaken advice of a friend, that to “ save expense it would be necessary ' to deliver the deeds in his lifetime,” when in reality he retained control over the deeds by handing them to Mr. Clovis, at the same time saying, “ if I should get well I may call for them, if I don’t, I want you to deliver them to the boys after my death.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b563-8" data-blocks='[["BL_563.8",563,[169,1945,1170,451]],["BL_564.1",564,[253,352,1177,1460]]]'>The defendant claimed that he was not legally bound to pay his sister, Mrs. Headley, the $400 mentioned in the will, because he held his land by virtue of a deed from his father, dated June 19, 1885, which had been delivered to him before his father’s death, and that the deed having been so delivered, he took and held the land discharged from any claim on the part of his sister Lucretia. We are of opinion from the evidence that Jacob Renner regarded his deeds and will as constituting substantially but one instrument, and that he intended his sons <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>to pay his daughters their legacies, as a condition upon which the deeds were made, and that the sons understood the matter in the same way. That Jacob Renner regarded his deeds and will as together constituting the evidence of his intention with reference to the disposition of his estate, and that they should be construed together is, we think, under the rule laid down in Thompson v. Loyd, <a href="/pa/49/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="49 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="998549" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0127-01">49 Pa. 127</a>, made clear by the fact that the deeds are referred to in the will in such manner as to amount to a devise of .the lands therein described. We are further of .opinion from the evidence that the defendant, before he took possession of the land under the deed, was fully informed of the contents of the will, and knew what he was expected to pay for the land, and that having accepted the land he should now be required to comply with the conditions of the will by paying his sister the amount of her legacy, due from him, as therein provided. That the defendant knew of the contents of the will, before the deed was finally delivered by Mr. Clovis, we think is clear from the testimony of the witness, William Clovis, who says: “ I kept them until I heard of Mr. Renner’s death. I got them and took the deeds and will both with me up there. After he was put away the heirs and myself all met in the room. I read the will to the heirs. After I read the will I said, ‘In accordance with Mr. Renner’s will I am at liberty to deliver the deeds,’ and John Renner said, ‘ I would like for you to hold the deeds awhile.’ I put them back in my pocket and nothing else was said just then. Barney came to me and demanded his deed.....I delivered the deed the next morning after Mr. Renner was buried. He came to my house and said he had come for his deed.”</p>
