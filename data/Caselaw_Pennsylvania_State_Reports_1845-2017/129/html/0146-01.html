(2) Because there was no existing or outstanding indebtedness against said school district. (3) The act of assembly of April 20, 1874, P.

    <p class="summary" id="b168-9" data-blocks='[["BL_168.9",168,[262,1579,1167,440]]]'>The school directors propose to increase the debt of the district to an amount exceeding two per cent of its assessed valuation. This can only be done by the consent of the electors. An election was held and a majority expressed themselves in favor of such increase for the purpose of “ purchasing suitable grounds and building a school house thereon.” The authority to increase the indebtedness being founded on the consent of the electors, must be confined substantially to the purposes named.</p>

If a private individual should authorize his agent to buy a lot, erect a dwelling house thereon at a great expense, he would naturally feel indignant if the agent should <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>propose to pledge the credit of his principal in the erection of a building upon lands to which he had -no title, and to which-he could acquire none. He would not consider it within a proper and reasonable exercise of the power conferred. The electors who have conferred an authority for one purpose, may well object to its being directed to another. While they might be willing to vote a large expenditure of money, on grounds owned by the district, they might not be at all willing to expend the sum upon ground which the district does not own and to which it can acquire no title. We think the preliminary injunction should be granted and a decree to that effect may be prepared by counsel.</p>

That the only public school in said district is located and maintained upon said public square, and has been continuously so located and maintained for more than sixty years last past. Said school directors claim the right, if they should finally so determine, to erect said school building upon the public square, predicating their right so to do upon such continuous use, and by virtue of the-following conveyance,” to wit: a deed, dated July 24, 1812, between Isaac Post and Bartlett Hinds, of the one part, <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>'and Thomas Parke, and others, “trustees of the county of ■Susquehanna,” of the other part, conveying “ one public lot containing ten acres, to be appropriated to the use of the public buildings of the county of Susquehanna aforesaid, and for an academy, and for the erection of a church or churches.”</p>

The further objection that school districts are not municipal corporations and not within the act of April 20,1874, P. L. 65, is not sustained. School districts are expressly mentioned in the constitution, and the act of April 20, 1874, was plainly intended to provide a statute to carry that provision into effect.</p>
