By the submission it was agreed that it should have the force and effect of a bill in equity filed by the plaintiff for the dissolution of the partnership and the appointment of a receiver; and two persons, D.

Stranahan formed a copartnership under the firm name of J. K. Lindsey &amp; Co., and engaged in the book and stationery business in the borough of Mercer. Prior to that date, the said J. A. Stranahan had been carrying on said business alone, and the partnership was formed by Lindsey buying from Stranahan the one half interest in the stock of goods which said Stranahan then had on hands.</p>

Fault is found with us because we did not find that Lindsey was not entitled to compensation, there being no express contract between the parties to that effect; and, second, in finding that there was an implied agreement that he should be so compensated; and the wholesome rule that the law never undertakes to measure and settle between partners the relative value of their unequal services is invoked and urged as decisive against the rulings of the masters on this point. We are referred to Story on Partnership, 6th ed., §§ 182-185, where the principle invoked is laid down. But it will be observed that the reason of the rule is founded, as the author says, on the implied obligation in every partner to exercise due diligence and skill and to devote his services and labors for the promotion of the common benefit of the concern, and hence they are to receive no reward or compensation unless expressly stipulated for. To the same effect is the doctrine laid down in Beatty v. Wray, <a href="/pa/19/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="19 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="970687" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0516-01">19 Pa. 516</a>. See last paragraph of Opinion of Court. In other words, where both partners are active in managing the partnership business, neither can claim compensation, no matter how much greater the services of one may be than the other; in such a case, the law will make no distinction between their services. But is that the rule where one partner leaves and entrusts the entire management and <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>control of the partnership business to his co-equal partner, whilst he engages actively in other pursuits not connected with the partnership business at all? Would not the maxim, Cessante ratione, cessat lex, apply in such a case ? As there is the implied obligation in every partner to devote his services to the partnership, does it not necessarily follow that where one leaves the entire management to his copartner and der votes his time and attention to other business, there is the implied agreement that the managing partner shall receive rear sonable compensation for his services ? Otherwise, the managing partner might require his copartner, who took no part in the management of the business, to account for profits he may have made in other ventures, when his services should have been devoted to partnership affairs. That an agreement that a partner shall receive compensation for services may be implied from the course of dealings between the partners, is ruled in Marsh’s App., <a href="/pa/69/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="69 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1026377" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0030-01">69 Pa. 30</a>. It was also ruled in said case that where a partner withdrew his services from the partnership, on a settlement of the firm account, he was chargeable with the value of his services. In this case we were asked to find by the defendant, and have found, that Mr. Stranahan left and intrusted to Lindsey the entire management and control of the business, during the entire period of the partnership. To say, in the face of that fact, that Lindsey, a co-equal partner, was to devote his time and attention to the partnership business and receive no compensation therefor, except a share of the profits, and Stranahan could give his time and attention to other business and receive the same compensation as Lindsey, is little short of absurd. We have no hesitancy, therefore, in dismissing the exceptions on this point and in affirming our former ruling, that from the course of dealings between these partners there was the implied understanding that Mr. Lindsey should have reasonable compensation for the management of the partnership business.</p>

The reason is that the partner is but attending to his own affairs. This rule is inexorable; as much so as that between parent and child. Were it otherwise, we might have a contest between the partners upon the settlement of every partnership account, as to the value of their respective services. It is true this principle may work hardship in particular cases; almost every general rule does, but that is a weak argument against the soundness of the rule. When the co-partnership agreement contemplates that one partner shall manage the business, or do more than his share of the work, it is easy to provide for his compensation in the agreement itself; and if no such stipulation is then made, as before said, the law will not imply one. Even where a liquidating or suriving partner settles up the business, it has been repeatedly ¡eld that he is not entitled to compensation for doing so, Ithough, in such case, he performs all the services: Beatty v. <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>Wray, <a href="/pa/19/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="19 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="970687" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0516-01">19 Pa. 516</a>; Brown v.
