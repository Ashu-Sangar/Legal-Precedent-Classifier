L. 126, and of 1876, P. L. 3, that the treasurer is not liable for the loss of moneys deposited in the manner referred to in said acts. The affidavit further sets forth, that the practice of the state treasurer, for the time being, has been to make such deposits ; that the bank in which the deposits were made, in this instance, was in good credit, and that defendant made careful inquiry, as to its standing and management before the deposits <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>were made; that the deposits were made in the name of the ■commonwealth, and were payable on demand, by the bank; that no reward, gain or profit accrued, or was to accrue to the treasurer; that the bank failed in 1884, and, by reason of its failure, and for no other cause whatever, the defendant was unable to account for and pay the said money to his successor; that he took from said bank bonds in the name of the commonwealth, with solvent sureties in an amount greater than said deposits; that he has brought suit against said bank and the sureties on the said bonds, which have not yet been determined.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[252,883,1169,448]]]'>It was contended, on behalf of the defendants, that this is not an action in which an affidavit of defence can be required, by law, from the defendant. A comparison of the provisions of the act of April 16,1845, § 12, P. L. 535; act of 1846, § 4, P. L. 413; act of April 21,1857, § 3, P. L. 266, and act of April 7,1862, § 1, P.

    <p class="summary" id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[256,1339,1171,1058]]]'>The only real question in the case is whether the treasurer and his sureties are liable upon his official bond for moneys deposited by him, as stated in the affidavit, and lost without fault or negligence on his part. There is much conflict of decision on this question; many courts holding that public officers sustain the relation, merely, of bailees, with respect to public moneys in their hands, and are therefore not liable to account therefor, when it has been lost without negligence or fault on their part. This however, is not the law in this state. In Commonwealth v. Comly, <a href="/pa/3/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="400691" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0372-01">3 Pa. 372</a>, which was an action of debt on the bond of a collector of tolls, the defence was that the moneys had been stolen from the desk of the collector in the night time, and this was held by the court to be no defence to the action on tbe bond. Gibson, C. J., delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ The responsibility of a public receiver is determined not by the law of bailment, which is called in to supply the place of a special agreement where there is none, but by the condition of his bond. The condition of it in this instance was, to account for and pay over the moneys to be received ; and we would look in vain for a power to relieve him from the performance of it.”</p>

      <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>The condition of the bond in this case is “ that if the above bounden Silas M. Baily, state treasurer of the said commonwealth of Pennsylvania, shall truly and faithfully perform all the trusts and duties enjoined and required by law to be done and performed by such state treasurer, then this obligation to be void or else to be and remain in full force and virtue.” It cannot be doubted that one of the trusts and duties required by law — whether by statute or at common law — of the state treasurer, is to account for and pay over to his successor all moneys received by him in his official capacity. His failure to do so was therefore a breach of the condition of the bond. As was said by Mr. Justice Strong, in Boyden v. U. S., <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Wall.%2020" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 Wall. 20">18 Wall. 20</a>: “ It is a settled rule that if the performance of an express engagement becomes impossible by reason of anything occurring after the contract was made, though unforeseen by the contracting party, and not within his control, he will not be excused.” And for reasons of public policy, as is further said in the same case: “ The rule has been applied rigidly to bonds of public Qfficers intrusted with the care of public money. Such bonds have almost invariably been construed as binding the obligors to pay the money in their hands when required by law, even though the money may have been lost without fault on their part.” ' In the case from which these quotations are made, the receiver was held liable although his failure to pay over the moneys was caused by the fact that he was “ suddenly beset in his office, thrown down, bound, gagged, and that against all the defence he could make the money was violently and without his fault taken from him.”</p>

That it is the duty of the state treasurer jfco pay over to his successor the moneys remaining in the treas/ury, or on the books of the treasury, at the expiration of his term, subject to all the provisions of the law, is not denied; but ,what is maintained is, that as there is no express act of assembly requiring him to pay over all moneys received by him, and as such is not the condition of his bond, he is not subject to the rule laid down by the court below, which would make him responsible for the state’s money absolutely and under all circumstances.</p>

In the case deferred to, Judge Gibson said that “ the responsibility of a public receiver is determined not by the law of bailment, which is called in to supply the place of a special agreement where there is none, but by the condition of his bond.” We have seen that the legal condition of General Baily’s bond was “ for the true and faithful performance of the trusts and duties of his office.” What were these trusts and duties? He was to take care of the money collected by him. How was he to take care of it ? How was he to perform this “ trust and duty ? ”</p>

Thomas, treats the liability of the defendant in a double aspect: “ First, in regard to the obligation arising from official duty; and, secondly, in regard to that arising from the bond, because the condition of the latter is twofold, that the principal shall faithfully discharge his official duties, and that he shall pay the moneys of the government that may come into his hands, as and when it shall be demanded of him. It is contended that the latter branch of the condition has a more stringent effect than the former, and creates an obligation to pay, at all events, all public moneys received.” . . . . “ The general rule of official obligations, as imposed by law, is that the officer shall perform the duties of his office honestly, faithfully and to the best of his ability. This is the custom of all official oaths. In ordinary cases, to expect more than this would deter upright and responsible men from taking office. This is substantially the rule by which the common law measures the responsibility of those whose official duties require them to have the custody of property, public or private. If in any case a more stringent obligation is desirable, it must be prescribed by statute, or exacted by express stipulation. The ordinary rule will be found illustrated by a number of analogous cases.”</p>

The mere prescription of his duties has nothing to do with the question as to what shall constitute the rule of responsibility in the discharge of those duties, or a legal excuse for the non-performance of them, or a discharge from their obligation.
