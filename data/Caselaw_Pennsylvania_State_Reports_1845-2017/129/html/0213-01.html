    <p class="summary" id="b234-11" data-blocks='[["BL_234.9",234,[246,1192,1173,856]]]'>“ The lot of ground against which the lien for water pipe, amounting to 1446.05, is filed, is a narrow, triangular strip, about 31 feet wide at the one end, and running thence along Ninth street, about 405 feet, diminishing in width' until it reaches a point. A part of this land is claimed by the Pennsylvania Canal Company, and the title is in dispute. The defendant is advised by counsel and avers that the foot-front assessment,' on which the lien is based, as applied to a piece of ground of this description is unjust, inequitable and not warranted by law, the whole property in the opinion of the defendant, not being worth the amount assessed against it. The defendant, therefore, alleging that proof will be given, on. the trial of the cause, of the facts averred in this affidavit, prays for judgment against the plaintiff that it cannot maintain its lien against the property; and the defendant believes and avers that the act of May 23, 1874, under which the lien referred to was filed, is unconstitutional and void.</p>

L. 266, under which the assessment was made and the lien filed is unconstitutional and void. This is conceded on behalf of the plaintiff, but it is claimed that the assessment and lien were validated by the act of May 17, 1887, P. L. 117, and the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 261. There is abundant authority for this claim: Grim v. Weissenberg School District, <a href="/pa/57/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="57 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1010419" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0433-01">57 Pa. 433</a>; Hewitt’s App., <a href="/pa/88/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="88 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="1061157" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0055-01">88 Pa. 55</a>; and this defence must fail.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[121,762,1174,650]]]'>2. The affidavit avers: “ The defendant is advised by counsel and avers that the foot-front assessment, as applied to a piece of ground of this description, is unjust and inequitable and not warranted by law, the whole property, in the opinion of the defendant, not being worth the amount assessed against it.” It is also stated in the affidavit that the ground assessed is a triangular lot abutting on three streets, about 31 feet wide at one end, and running to a point at the distance of 405 feet, and the assessment is for laying water pipe along this whole distance at $1.10 per foot, amounting to about $446. The opinion of the affiant may therefore very readily be thought correct; but we are unable to see how, under the law, the facts can constitute a valid defence.</p>

This arises from the fact that a rule to be valid must be general, and the further conceded fact, that in. the application of all general rules there will be casesjrfjri,Ibvidual hardship. This would appear to be one of such cases. The lot against which this assessment was filed consists of a long narrow strip, with a front of several hundred feet upon the street, and only 31 feet deep at one end and narrowing to the other. The lot is said not to be worth the amount of the, assessment against it. If this be so, it does not affect the validity of the law under which the assessment was filed. As a general rule the hardship may be avoided in such cases by squaring the lot with the owner of the rear, and in this way lessening the front and deepening the remainder. If the objection now made to this assessment were to prevail, it would be very easy for the owner of a valuable lot to convey a narrow <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>strip of tbe front to a convenient friend, and thus escape altogether. We are of the opinion that the defendant’s affidavit does not disclose a sufficient defence. The case is ruled by Michener v. City of Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/118/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="118 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="556717" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0535-01">118 Pa. 535</a>.</p>
