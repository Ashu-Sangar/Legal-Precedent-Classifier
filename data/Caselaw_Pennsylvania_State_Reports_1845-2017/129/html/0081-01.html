It is claimed by the defendant that that is not the true interpretation of this clause in the lease ; or, in other words, that the lease does not provide that if the defendant fails to work the quarry for a period of three months, then there should be a forfeiture of the lease, but that there should be a literal interpretation of the clause, that if they fail <em>not </em>to work the quarry for a period of three months, then there would be a forfeiture of the lease; or, in other words, they want the court to say to you that if the defendant, to whom was given for a valuable consideration, first in the lease from Nathan Miller to Rufus A. Grider and George Ziegenfuss, and subsequently by the articles of the agreement between Nathan Miller, and Funk and the Laidshaws, a right to go upon his property and dig and manufacture slate, that if they did <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>what they had paid a valuable consideration for the privilege of doing that would be a forfeiture, and that is the true meaning of this clause in the lease.

The plaintiffs, on the other hand, claim that the words are used in their ordinary sense. The difference between the contention on the part of the plaintiffs and that on the part of the defendant is, in effect, this: If the plaintiffs’ contention is correct, then it would be the duty of the court to say to you whaj¿ the words “ working the quarry ” meant. If the contention of the defendant is correct, then it is the province of the jury to say, from the testimony, what the words “ working the quarry ” meant.

[They both say that work done in the manufacture of slate about a quarry, is working the quarry as generally understood among slate miners and manufacturers.] 10 If I am mistaken about their testimony on this point, you will correct me; but I think Mr. Robinson said that the working of a quarry consisted in pumping out the water, taking the blocks out of the hole, hoisting them out and delivering them to the slaters on the bank, and splitting and manufacturing them into slate, and that that constituted working the quarry. Therefore, the working of the quarry does not consist alone, according to his testimony, of taking the blocks out of the hole, but that, incident to worldng the quarry is also the manufacture of the slate blocks into slate for the purposes of the trade. And this would seem reasonable too, in connection with the lease, because the only rental that is provided for by this lease is derived from the sale of the manufactured slate. The plaintiffs are not compensated, under this lease for the rock taken out of the hole. Their compensation for the taking of their property is based upon the manufactured slate, the slate that is manufactured after taking it out of the hole.

The plaintiffs, upon the other hand, called an expert, George H.

He says, however, that the manufacture of slate out of blocks already taken out upon the banks, without carrying on the work in the hole, would not be working the quarry. He also says that the removal of water covering the beds in the quarry, from which the blocks are taken to manufacture slate from, is not working the quarry.</p>

If, however, you believe from the evidence that work was not done upon the quarry, at the time testified to by some of the witnesses, by James and his dresser upon the bank, or, if you believe from the evidence that the pumping was not done there at the time they testify to, then, as I said before,- [you will determine whether, from the evidence, the manufacturing of fence posts and the splitting of the slate in January was working the quarry within the meaning of the term as contained in this clause in the lease.] 13</p>

Where the performance of a duty is prevented by inevitable accident without the fault of the contracting party, the law excuses him from the performance of that duty. But where a person absolutely contracts to do a certain thing, not impossible or unlawful at the time, he cannot.be excused from the obligation of his contract; because he might have made proper provision to guard against it at the time he entered into the contract.

So, too, where a man enters into a mining lease, containing a clause of forfeiture in case he does not work the mine, or mine the material in a given time mentioned in the lease, and he is prevented from so doing because of the acts of God, or by inevitable accident, he is excused from the performance of that duty, and his failure to perform it does not work a forfeiture of' his lease.

It is apparent from' an examination of the forfeiture clause, that the lease would not be forfeited if the lessees failed to manufacture slate for three successive months. The lessor might recover damages for such a failure, but could not forfeit the lease. The forfeiture could only take place when there was no quarrying. It seems to us, that is the reasonable construction of the instrument, and Blackstone’s pithy rule declares it to be a cardinal principle that it must be “ reasonable and agreeable to common understanding.”</p>

The company defendant is the lessee of a slate quarry. The plaintiffs are the lessors. The lease contains the following stipulation : “ The party of the second part agrees to forfeit th'e lease when they fail in not working the quarry for a space of three successive months.” The plaintiffs allege a forfeiture by reason of a failure to work the quarry during three successive months from October 18,1886, and have brought this action to recover possession for that reason. The defendant denies that <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>there has been a failure to work the quarry for three months, and asserts that, for several weeks of the time counted by the plaintiffs, operations were practically impossible by reason of the accumulation of snow and ice in and upon the sides of the quarry; that for three or four other weeks the quarry was filled with water by heavy floods to such an extent that it was necessary to keep the pumps constantly in motion, in order to make it possible to reach and quarry the slate. This work the defendant says was done in the quarry, and was necessary to be done before quarrying slate could be resumed. Two questions are thus raised: First. What do the words “working the quarry” mean? Second. Who shall determine the question, the court or the jury ?</p>
    <p id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[130,1013,1170,1370]],["BL_114.1",114,[254,341,1167,348]]]'>The quarry is the excavation or pit from which the slate is taken. Working the quarry, therefore, is the working of the pit. The doing of any work necessary to the proper and convenient use of the pit, such as the removal of earth, debris, water, ice, or snow, would seem to be working the quarry as truly and as usefully as the blasting and removal of the slate-rock, for the latter cannot be done unless the quarry is kept reasonably free from obstruction. A coal mine is worked for the purpose of obtaining coal; but gangways are to be made, slate removed, and drainage secured, before mining can be successfully done. If a mine should be flooded with water, the removal of the water is a necessary mining operation, and until it is accomplished the miners cannot resume work on the coal. While this work is in progress, with the pumps moving day and night, the operator is doing the necessary — the only possible — work in his mines, and is working them, as matter of fact and law. We think the meaning of the words is plain and obvious without the aid of the testimony of experienced quarrymen, and that they were rightly interpreted by the jury. If so, the second question is unimportant in this case. If the meaning be that which has been indicated, the plaintiffs were no worse off because the jury were left to say so upon the evidence, than if the court had so instructed them as matter of law. What the plaintiffs asked was, that the court should interpret the contract to mean that a failure to hoist slate-rock from the quarry was a failure to work the quarry. No matter what else was being done, nor how indispensably necessary it might be <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>to tbe work of getting the slate, it must go for nothing. This would be both narrow and unjust, and the court was right in refusing to put such a construction on the words under consideration. Whether the correct exposition came from the court or the jury could make no possible difference to the plaintiffs, for its effect upon the verdict in either case would be the same. The assignments of error are not sustained, and</p>
