The syllabus of this case is, “ A recognizance given for the payment of the distributive shares of an intestate by a purchaser, is a lien on the whole estate <em>taken </em>by him at the appraisement.” To this proposition your auditor, in the main, accedes. But here we have to do with the recognizance of a married woman, given with respect to real estate in which her husband, before partition, had an interest by virtue of the marital relation subsisting between them. Your auditor thinks that Martha J. Snively <em>took </em>only the undivided one half; the other undivided one half she already had by descent long before the proceedings in partition were instituted. In this undivided one half, which she had acquired by descent, J. Stouffer Snively had an interest the moment he married her, as tenant by curtesy. Nothing but an absolute conveyance by him of this interest, acknowledged according to law, could defeat it. Now, if a wife could thus by a recognizance so incumber her previously acquired real estate as to defeat her husband’s rights as tenant by curtesy, she would be able to do that without his consent which she may do only witÉ his consent. When a husband takes real estate in right of his wife, the recognizance he gives does not bind her interest in the estate: Kean v. Bidgway, 16 S. <em>&amp; </em>B. 60; Hoffer v.

Take other cases of her right to elect. Suppose A and B, husband and wife. A makes a will and dies. B, his widow, marries C. Afterwards she wishes not to take under A’s will. Is the right of election in her husband, or in herself ? Suppose again A devises a tract of land in trust to be sold and the proceeds paid to B, a married woman. B can elect to re-convert and take the land itself instead of' the proceeds of sale. Shall her husband exercise this right ?

And, indeed, if she cannot give a recognizance, she cannot accept the land and have it/assTgned-ta.her by the court, because the giving security f-6r the shares of Tfie-ptlier heirs is a condition precedent, without the performance oiNrhich no estate vests: Scott on <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>Infest.

But if she can accept the land and give recognizance, being a person named in the act as entitled to take, she is on the same footing with other heirs sui juris, who accept at the valuation or bid. The recognizance binds the whole land. The quantity of her interest and not her title is altered by the decree. The recognizance to the other children is a lien on the whole, which may be sold as an indivisible mass: Kean v. Ridgway, supra; Cubbage v.

The auditor, in his 16th finding of facts (where it seems out of place), says: “ The said Martha J. Snively, by the' proceedings in partition, acquired no more than the one undivided one half of said real estate; the other undivided half having descended to her in her own right as heir at law of Benjamin Eby.” The obvious comment is, the interest of every heir who accepts descended to him as heir at law, and in this a married woman is not peculiar. But in the case of one sui juris the recognizance binds this his descended interest, along with the interests acquired from the other heirs, the whole land including the interest which the cognizor before had. And are the other parties to the partition to be the worse off in point of security, because an heir who accepts by right conferred by law, which they cannot gainsay, happens to be a married woman ? If a wife’s recognizance binds only the shares and the interests of the other heirs, it must be upon the ground that she has no capacity to enter into the obligation, but, as when she purchases land, may not keep the land and money both, and so the obligation is held binding and a lien, not only on the interest she has acquired by the proceedings. But, as I argued, the statute names her as a party entitled to take in her order, and then demands of her a recognizance, which imports or confers the power and capacity to make one.</p>

If a married woman owning the undivided one half of land can take the other undivided one half in a partition proceeding, and, by giving a recognizance for the price of the one half so taken, can bind the title she previously held, we have an exception to the rule already stated, which, to say the least, has never been announced by this court. The decision of the court below was rested on two assumed facts: <em>(a) </em>that Mrs. Snively was authorized by the express words of the act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 201, to accept the land at the valuation; and (6) that upon taking the land she was required by the act to give security by recognizance.

Under the facts of this case, Mrs. Snively was not “ authorized to accept the land at thé valuation.” It was awarded to her without her husband’s consent and against his protest, and his request to be allowed to bid in her right was refused. In such circumstances, she had no right to bid at all, if the doctrine announced by this court in Evans v. Ross, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20Pa.%20236" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="107 Pa. 236">107 Pa. 236</a>, be correct. She took the land, however, with the consent of Irene R. Eby, who was bound to know that she was dealing with one not sui juris. Mrs. Snively was in the attitude of a married woman purchasing land, not under any statute, but of her own volition and without her husband’s consent, and could bind for the purchase money no more than the interest purchased.</p>

It is common practice to require additional personal security. If Mrs. Snively had bought her sister’s half of this land and given a judgment therefor, no one would contend that it would bind more than the interest thus bought. And one who takes land in a partition is “ exactly in the situation of any other purchaser from tenants in common : ” Cubbage v.

If the question whether a recognizance binds the whole estate were a new one, it might be sufficient to say that, as the heir who is outbid loses his estate by a decree of the court, and not by his own choice, justice requires that the lien for the owelty money should attach to the whole land.

Snively, deceased. The principal question was the effect of the recognizance given by the decedent within a year before her death, for the real estate of her deceased father, awarded to her by the Orphans’ Court under proceedings in partition. The auditor held that inasmuch as the decedent was a married woman when she took said land and gave said recognizance, the recognizance was a lien only upon that portion of the real estate which the recognizor acquired by the decree of the court awarding the. same to her, and that it was not a lien upon that portion of said real estate which she- took in her own right by descent. Distribution was made accordingly. The Orphans’ Court, upon exceptions filed, reversed the auditor and held that the recognizance was a lien upon her whole interest in the land, both as to the share she took under the proceedings in partition, and the share she took by descent. In this we think the learned judge was right.</p>

We see no analog)» between a purchase-money judgment given by a married woman and a recognizance given by her for owelty in proceedings in partition. It is well settled that such recognizance is a lien upon the whole estate thus taken: McCandless’ App., <a href="/pa/98/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="98 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="496909" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0489-01">98 Pa. 489</a>; Long v.

This is conceded as to such recognizances generally, but it was contended that the rule does not apply to a recognizance given by a married woman. The law makes no such distinction. The legal effect of a recognizance in the Orphans’ Court is not changed because given by a feme covert, We need not discuss her right to bid, the right of the Orphans’ Court to award the property to her, and her right to give the recognizance in question. All this is settled, as before observed, by the decree of the Orphans’ Court. An error in either of these particulars would render the decree voidable merely. It could not be attacked collaterally. It was held in Painter v. Henderson, T Pa. 48, that where in partition, on petition of collateral heirs, land was assigned by the court to the widow at a valuation, and the time for an appeal had elapsed, a purchaser cannot object for the defect, although such decree was not authorized by an act of assembly, which allows an assignment to heirs only. In the case in hand the wife bid for the property; it was awarded to her by the court, and the recognizance was given in obedience to the order and decree of the court. It is idle, now, upon the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of this same real estate after her death, to call in question the regularity of the proceedings of the Orphans’ Court or the effect of the recognizance.</p>
