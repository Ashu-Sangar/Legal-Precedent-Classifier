Coming to the transactions of May 10, 1886, we see from what has been already ascertained the relation of the parties. Ferguson had as yet no deed; he owed Wolf, his vendor, on purchase money, §1,000.25. Britton’s judgment for §231.65 was a lien on Wolf’s legal title in the land sold to Ferguson, and was the second lien amply secured on Wolf’s farm in Letterkenny. Hollar’s judgment for §3,150 was the first lien on Wolf’s land in Letterkenny and perfectly safe; his §5,623 judgment was the third lien on that farm and not secured, as subsequent events showed. Both of Hollar’s judgments were liens on Wolf’s legal title in Ferguson’s land, but junior liens in respect of Britton’s judgment. The unpaid purchase money on April 1, 1885, was, so far as I can ascertain from the evidence, not more than §1,000.25, that is to say, the same that it was on May 10, 1886. Therefore it behooved Ferguson to see <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>that $1,000.25 still due to Wolf was applied to the liens on Wolf’s legal title. Wolf was entitled to none of it. And Hollar as early as December 30,1885, wrote to Ferguson: “You will remember I told you not to pay Mr. Wolf any money on the farm purchased of him. I hope you have not, and will not before the 1st of April, and then to meet him and myself in Chambersburg, as the money will all be coming to me and you can only get a good title with my consent.”</p>

The court would not have confirmed the sale without knowing why the amount of the Britton judgment which appeared to be the first lien, had not been paid to the sheriff. This return which Mr. Hollar procured to be made, unfair toward the sheriff and misleading the court, is the origin of the trouble in this distribution.</p>

It is also a fact that Britton’s judgment was revived against Wolf without notice to Ferguson, who had bought from Wolf and was then in possession of the land. But it does not appear that Wolf owned the Ferguson tract on October 5, 1878, and even if it ever was a lien on it, the lien expired October 5, 1883. So that Britton’s judgment stands simply as a new lien against Wolf alone, binding only his legal title in the Ferguson land. Finally, Ferguson, who was produced as a witness, does not seem to have appeared in the cause on his own behalf, either personally or by attorney.</p>

Ferguson’s land was sold on Wolf’s purchase money judgment, obtained when the deed was delivered to Ferguson, and so the whole legal and equitable title passed by the sale; the judgments on the legal title only, as well as all others, were divested, and consequently are entitled to participate in the fund: Commonwealth v. Alexander, 14 S. &amp; R. 257. Brit-ton’s judgment bound as well Wolf’s legal title in Ferguson’s land as Wolf’s McClelland farm; but Wolf was Britton’s debtor, and Ferguson had paid Wolf the whole purchase money for his land, so that in equity Britton was bound to look to Wolf in the first instance: Martin’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%2090" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 Pa. 90">97 Pa. 90</a>; Commonwealth v.

It is true that if Wolf’s land had not been sold, Britton could have come in on the Ferguson fund, for equity will not realize another fund or delay a lien creditor. But here Wolf’s land was sold on June 30, 1887, for a great deal more than enough to pay Britton’s judgment, and at September Term the sheriff, according to the command of his writ, had these moneys before the court to render to Britton; and not until October 22, 1887, did the sheriff sell the Ferguson land. That fund, in contemplation of law, is in the sheriff’s hands now, and Britton entitled to demand it from him. Is not Britton’s judgment then to be treated as paid, since it ought to be paid out of Wolf’s land, and there is money in the hands of the sheriff derived from Wolf’s land wherewith to pay it? And the judgment creditors of Ferguson may show pay<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>ment of the prior incumbrance: Borland’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=66%20Pa.%20472" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="66 Pa. 472">66 Pa. 472</a> ; Meckley’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=102%20Pa.%20542" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="102 Pa. 542">102 Pa. 542</a>. It is enough to show that in equity and good conscience it is satisfied, for by the words of the statute the court is to distribute the fund “ according to law and equity: ” Landell’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="105 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="454303" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0152-01">105 Pa. 152</a>; Selden’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=74%20Pa.%20328" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="74 Pa. 328">74 Pa. 328</a>. But the doctrine of marshaling assets is applicable here, and may be invoked by the lien creditors of Ferguson, being no more than their right to compel Britton to seek payment from Wolf, founded upon an equity giving Ferguson the right for his own sake to compel Britton to seek payment from Wolf: Ebenhardt’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20332" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 332">8 W. &amp; S. 332</a>.</p>

The special return recited in the ninth finding was not in evidence, and the court will look in vain for any evidence respecting the exceptions to the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed referred to in said finding. Nor is there any evidence that Hollar procured that special return to be made, as the court says he did. The finding that Britton cannot be prejudiced by the confirmation of the sale, without some neglect or default on his part, ignores the fact, found by the court, that he was aware of the sale. The court went outside the testimony, built up for Britton a theory which had never occurred <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>to his counsel, undertook in this way to bring in for distribution a new fund not before the court, and allowed Britton his money at the expense of Hollar.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[265,507,1180,651]]]'>5. This action of the court amounts to depriving a man of his property without a hearing. It is true, the decree was withheld for fourteen days to give Hollar an opportunity to have the matter referred back to the auditor or re-argued. But we insist that in this the learned court misconceived his duty. It was his business to pass upon what was before him, and nothing else. Whether Britton was entitled to his money, either from the sheriff or from Hollar, was not a matter before either the auditor or the court below, and is not now before this court. The court having shown an evident anxiety to make an unwarranted finding and decree, we have brought this appeal without moving for a re-argument or a reference back to the auditor.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b306-7" data-blocks='[["BL_306.7",306,[261,1331,1179,607]]]'>1. Britton’s judgment was a lien on the land sold by Wolf to Ferguson to the extent of the purchase money remaining unpaid at the date of its entry. It was also the second lien on the McClelland farm, the first and third liens thereon being held, at the time of the sheriff’s sale thereof, by Hollar. The fund raised by that sale being more than sufficient to pay Brit-ton’s judgment in full, that judgment was paid in law, so far as Ferguson or his lien creditors were concerned. Wolf was the principal debtor, and the land conveyed by him to Ferguson was, to the extent of the unpaid purchase money, surety for the debt: Paxton v.

Britton was therefore bound to see to the distribution of the fund, and, if he permitted it to be misapplied, cannot now look to the surety for the debt: Paxton v.

    <p class="summary" id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[132,716,1166,658]]]'>3. Hollar is in no worse position by reason of the deduction of the amount of the Britton judgment from his judgment against Ferguson, than he would be if he had not taken up the latter judgment; for in that event the same deduction would have been made from his judgment against Wolf. Ferguson’s subsequent lien creditors may assert his rights for their protection. Moreover, there is another, and if possible a stronger reason for making the deduction. In consequence of the false special return of the sale of Wolf’s land to Hollar, the latter received the whole proceeds of sale, to the exclusion of prior lien creditors; and he thus has in his hands to-day, as the amount of the Britton judgment, money which belongs to W. W. Britton, guardian.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[135,1382,1166,657]]]'>4. That Hollar has this money in his hands improperly, there is no dispute. The sole contention of his counsel is that it cannot be deducted from his judgment and awarded to Brit-ton in this proceeding. But the action of the auditor and court is fully sustained by Tindle’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="77 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="436331" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0201-01">77 Pa. 201</a>. We submit the case, without further argument, upon the able opinion of the court below and the authorities therein cited. In view of the unfounded statements and unjust insinuations of the appellant’s counsel, we call attention to the concluding remarks of Chief Justice Lewis in Allegheny v. Nelson, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20Pa.%20335" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="25 Pa. 335">25 Pa. 335</a>.

    <p id="b307-8" data-blocks='[["BL_307.8",307,[136,2148,1162,296]]]'>This case has been so elaborately argued by the auditor and the court below, that we do not find it necessary to continue the discussion at length. The reasons given by the learned judge for awarding the sum of $286.22 to W. W. Britton, guardian, are entirely satisfactory. This disposes of the second assignment of error.</p>

      <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>We desire to say in regard to the first, that it is exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory. To allege in general terms that “the court erred in confirming the report of the auditor,” is to give us no information whatever. In what respect, or for -what reason did it err ? The remaining assignment, the third, is equally vague. It is, that “ the court erred in going outside of the report of the auditor and outside of the testimony, and in making up a report without legal testimony.” What fact did the court find outside of the testimony, or without testimony? This should have been stated to give the assignment any point. That the court below found some facts not found by the auditor appears from the opinion of the learned judge when he says: “I am of opinion therefore that the auditor’s report must be confirmed. But I have been compelled to find many facts not embraced in the auditor’s findings, in view of the course of the argument in court, and in order to a satisfactory consideration of all the questions raised, and I ought not to finally determine the cause upon this apparent state of facts, without giving Mr. Hollar’s counsel an opportunity to explain or rebut them. In order that they may move for a re-argument or a reference back to the auditor, it is ordered that the exceptions be dismissed and the auditor’s report confirmed, and that distribution be made accordingly. But this order and decree not to be entered or take effect for fourteen days from this date, and if within that time a motion be filed, the cause to be placed on the current argument list.” The learned judge had the right to go outside of the auditor’s report; he was not shut up within its four corners, and there is nothing to show that he went outside of the evidence. His opinion does not say so, and if he found any fact without evidence, it should have been distinctly-stated in the assignment of error. And, however the case may be, there was an opportunity afforded by the learned judge to correct any of his findings by a reference back to an auditor, or by a re-argument before the court. The appellant did not see proper to avail himself of this right, but brought the case directly here by appeal. As no objection to the findings of the court was made below, where it might and should have been made, we can attach but little weight to it here.</p>
    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[522,2281,899,94]]]'>The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
