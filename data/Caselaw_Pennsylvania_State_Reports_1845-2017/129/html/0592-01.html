The said entry was run or opened across the southeast corner of the land, and all the coal under said land and between the entry and the extreme southeast corner had been mined out, and also the coal lying next west of the entry for the average distance of 185 feet, where the miners came to a sand bar, which rendered the coal unmineable for any further distance in that direction. The coal so mined out was of the average thickness of four feet, and the area so mined was about 5,690 square yards. All the coal was taken out over this entire area, leaving nothing to support the overlying ground except that two ribs, one on each side of said entry, were left to support the superincumbent rock and keep it from falling down and filling the entry. Over the rest of the area so mined out, the surface had fallen in and filled the space whence the coal was taken.</p>

But at the time it was so paid to him it was not known that the defendant company had mined or was mining any of the coal for which he was trustee, and the royalty was paid to him, and accepted by him, the parties at the time believing that it was due to him for coal mined from his individual land.</p>

This claim, like the other, assumes as a fact what is not proved. It assumes that the nut coal would have been “ shipped ” if it had been mined. The defendant has the same right to assume that it would not have been shipped, that it would have been sold at the mines, and in that case the defendant was not bound by the covenants to pay for it. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff. He must show a breach of the covenant to entitle him to recover. The covenant is that <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>defendant shall pay for 4,000 tons as though minqd, not that it shall pay for 4,000 tons as though mined and the nut coal shipped.

He did not account for it as trustee, because he did not know the trust estate had anything to do with it, and he has been discharged. The defendant was bound to keep account of the coal mined from this land, and did not do it.

What the defendant did do was this : It delivered the deed of release mentioned. That was all it did by way of terminating its obligations under the contract. It had the right to “ abandon this contract and yield up said coal mine and privileges.” It abandoned nothing, yielded up nothing. It still holds possession of and uses the entry as it did before. One of the privileges which the contract gave was “ the right of way through, over or under said land to transport coal from adjacent lands.” It is not necessary to discuss whether the trustees had power to grant that privilege. They undertook to grant it and the defendant exercised the privilege under that grant. That, then, is one of the privileges that must be abandoned and yielded up to avoid further liability for royalty.</p>

The language of <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>the deed from James Bestwick, Sr., to the trustees is, that they are “ to own, control and cause to be mined all the mineral coal in and under said entire farm, except under the present buildings thereon.” The grant by the trustees which defendant holds is, “ All the stone coal lying and being in, under and upon ” this land. When James Bestwick, Sr., made that deed to the trustees, he owned the entire estate in the land and had the right to direct that all the coal should be mined, without regard to support for the surface; and that defendant believed it had the right to take out all the coal and let the surface sink, is evidenced by the fact that it did take it all out and let the surface sink where it mined on this land. But that is a question between the trustees and the owner of the surface, whoever he may be. He is not a party to this suit, and hence the question cannot be determined here. So far as defendant is concerned the plaintiff had the right to mine out these ribs, and hence had an interest in having the actual possession of this entry surrendered if the mine were abandoned. It was not so surrendered; and the deed, if it gave anything, gave only a right of action to force the defendant out of possession. That was not an abandonment or yielding up of the privilege the defendant had under the contract. Hence the defendant can reap no benefit from the delivery of that deed without more.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.7",621,[152,897,1166,400]]]'>The learned counsel for the defendant favored the court with a written copy of his argument on the exceptions. It has been carefully considered. The one position now attempted to be established is, that the delivery of the deed on November 19, 1887, without any actual abandonment of the premises or surrender of the possession, without any actual “ yielding up said coal mine and privileges,” operated as a complete determination of the contract relations between the parties.</p>

He states his conclusion thus: “ The principle decided is, that if a man conveys the surface, reserving the coal, he does not reserve the right to ruin the estate granted unless that was the express contract.” The difficulty is not about that principle. It is correct. The difficulty is about the application of it to the case in hand. [It is true that the trustee, the plaintiff in this case, would not be permitted to mine out and remove the two ribs of coal at the sides of the entry, or any part of them, if the owner of the surface (James Bestwick, Jr., as it is alleged), should come into court and show that removing said ribs, or a part of them, would ruin, or even materially injure his estate. But even then the trustee would have the right to mine out all the coal which he could safely take without injury to the superincum bent estate. He has a right to all the coal except what is necessary to preserve the surface from injury. To stop him, James Bestwick, Jr., would have to show that its removal would injure him.] 5 To raise and determine this question, it would be necessary to have James Bestwick in court. It cannot be decided in a collateral issue to'which he is not a party. <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>Yet the argument for the defendant proceeds on the assumption that this question can be determined in this case. It seems to be assumed that the defendant can assert all the rights which James Bestwick could assert against the trustee If the defendant has any of these rights, it must have acquired them by virtue of the contract of April 17, 1888, which was offered in evidence and rejected. But the defendant, holding under the trustee, could not acquire any rights against the trustee, and attorn to another landlord, without first fully surrendering the possession which it had obtained from the trustee. It cannot take possession under the trustee, and then hold that possession against the trustee by means of any right acquired from James Bestwick.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[264,1006,1184,243]]]'>If that were not so; if the defendant could be permitted to assert all the rights which James Bestwick might assert as owner of the surface, still the position contended for cannot be maintained because there is no proof of the facts on which • it is based. They are assumed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[259,1257,1178,1107]],["BL_623.1",623,[227,374,1165,146]]]'>The first exception assumes that the ribs as they are now there are “necessary to support the surface.” [The second exception assumes the same thing and further assumes “ that whatever coal lay beyond the sand bar would have to be taken out from the further side ” of the land. There is no evidence in this case that it would injure the surface, if a part or all of these ribs of coal now there were mined out. No such evidence was offered. It does not follow, without proof, that mining out a part of the ribs would in any way affect the surface; nor does it follow, without proof, that any injury would result from taking them all out and allowing the surface to sink! There was no proof offered to the effect that the “ coal beyond the sand bar would have to be ” or could be “ taken out from the further side” of the land. Surely the trustee would have the right to take it out at this present opening, if he sees fit to do so. It may be impracticable. It may be that, though difficult, this is the only practicable way to reach that other coal. Of that we know nothing. But we do know that the trustee has the right to have it mined out, and has a right to the possession of the present opening to facilitate that mining so far as it will do so.] 6 He alone has the right to decide how he will undertake to reach this other coal. Neither <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>the defendant, the owner of the surface, nor this court, can undertake to decide that question for him, and the court will not (if it could) undertake to decide it without evidence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[224,527,1167,351]]]'>Then, when the learned counsel argues that “ it is folly to talk about the necessity of the defendant company to abandon the premises, in order to terminate the contract, after the delivery of the deed of surrender, because there was nothing to abandon,” he assumes the very premise on which he predicates the folly, viz.: That “ there was nothing to abandon.” That cannot be assumed. It must be proved, and the proof is lacking.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b623-6" data-blocks='[["BL_623.6",623,[209,885,1180,1217]]]'>There is another thought which may be properly mentioned in this connection. [The claim is that the defendant’s liability ceased on November 19, 1887, when the quit claim deed was delivered without any abandonment of the premises or yielding ■ up of the coal mine and privileges. That deed was delivered to James Bestwick, who was then both trustee and owner, as is said, of the surface. Surely he then had the right to mine and remove the remainder of the coal under this land; I mean the ribs, if he wished, whether the surface would be thereby injured or not. He was one of the persons entitled to the royalty or profits realized from this coal. Nobody could complain if he mined it and took his share of the profits. Can it be claimed that he, as trustee, was not entitled to the possession ? Yet he did not get it. Then there was at that time no abandonment of the original contract made between the trustees and Ormsby and Spearman; no yielding up of the coal mine and privileges secured by that contract. If it was not surrendered then, when was it surrendered? Assuming defendant’s position to be correct, it would not have been surrendered, or rather the excuse for not surrendering could not have existed, until the defendant had obtained from James Bestwick the contract offered in evidence, dated April 17,1888.] 7 That was after James Bestwick had ceased to be trustee,'and after all the royalty sued for in this case had accrued.</p>
