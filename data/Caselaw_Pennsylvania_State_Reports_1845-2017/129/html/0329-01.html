The charter of the defendant association gives it no exclusive right to select sites for monuments, nor any discretion as to the location of landmarks indicating the topographical features of the battle. No power was granted to misrepresent the facts, by erecting monuments indicating untruths and violating historic accuracy. It was meant that the association should erect, and prompt others to contribute, works of art appropriate as memorials not only of heroism but of the very spots on which heroic acts were done. It is bound to permit such contributions. The argument that it may erect them or not as it chooses, or may place them where it sees fit, without <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>regard to the suitability of the location, is un warranted by either the spirit or the language of the act of April 30, 1864.</p>

But, even were this view of the subject incorrect, the charter of the association was, and always has been, subject to amendment, alteration or annulment by the legislature, the constitutional amendment of 1857 having antedated it by six years. Its property also, is subject to be taken from the association for public uses. The act of June 15, 1887, may be regarded as within the scope of each of these legislative powers. Putting the act of 1864 and that of 1887 together, then, where lies the power to choose the site of the monument ? Ultimately, it is clear, in a court of equity. If it be exclusively in the association in the first instance, a chancellor will see that it is not wrongfully, hurtfully or malevolently exercised, and this even independent of the act of 1887.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[270,1137,1172,659]]]'>3. Considering the action of the memorial association in the light of these principles, we contend that equity will enjoin interference with the use of the site selected, because the legislature contemplated that such monuments should be placed upon locations historically precise and accurate. The act of 1864, in providing for the designation of spots of S£&gt;ecial interest, unmistakably shows this. The act of 1887 makes it equally clear. In providing for memorials to mark the position of each of the Pennsylvania commands engaged in the battle, it obviously meant that the positions to be marked should be those of the commands as engaged in the battle, and that the memorials should indicate the spot where the fighting, of special interest, by any given command took place.</p>

But, even were the provisions of the statute less stringent, the plaintiffs would be entitled to the decree prayed for, upon the ground that the association is shown by the bill to be abusing its powers in such a way as to justify a chancellor’s interference. The act of 1887, however, constituted the commissioners a tribunal to determine, sitting as a quasi judicial body, for the state, which was a large contributor to the monuments, the questions of location that might be presented to it. The power of selection was by that act committed exclusively to the five commissioners co-operating with the representatives appointed by the survivors of the Pennsylvania volunteers. We submit that the legislature had power to do this.</p>

By an inspection of the acts of April 30, 1864, and April 24, 1866, and of the amendments to the charter of the defendant association, decreed by the Court of Common Pleas of Adams county on April 21, 1885, it will be seen that this great battlefield .is not the property of the state of Pennsylvania, either directly or indirectly. Neither the state nor the defendant commissioners make any claim to the control of it. The commissioners neither have nor claim any authority to appropriate the grounds to the use of any regiment, for its monument, without the consent of "the association. This battlefield knows no state, but belongs to all; and Pennsylvania cannot create a commission to locate monument sites, without the concurrence of the battlefield memorial association.</p>

The fact that the five commissioners appointed by the governor are made defendants in the bill, shows conclusively that they did not co-operate with the plaintiffs, and defeats the right of the latter to maintain their bill. Without such cooperation the bill cannot be maintained, and no other conclusion can be drawn from the fact that the commissioners are placed in the position of adversaries by the bill, than that they will thus agree to a site only with the consent and concurrence of the battlefield association. Nor are the commissioners any more than mere agents of the state to perform, for a brief period, such supervisory duties as are set out in § 3 of the act of 1887.</p>

It further admits that the location thus fixed by the commissioners, in conjunction with appellants, accurately represents the true position of the regiment while actively engaged in the battle, and also, that after "being officially notified of such joint action, the memorial association, appellee, refused to permit the erection of the monument on the site designated? and fixed as aforesaid. .</p>

No such inference can be legitimately drawn from the pleadings.

    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[245,652,1179,1305]]]'>The proceedings of the commissioners, as averred in the bill and admitted by the demurrer, were clearly within the scope of the authority vested in them by the act of 1887, under which they were appointed. That being the case, the action of the memorial association, in refusing to recognize their authority in the premises, can only be justified on the ground, virtually assumed by counsel, that the commonwealth, acting through the agency of the commission or otherwise, has no right either to designate the position where any of her regiments specially distinguished themselves during the battle, or, at her own expense, to mark the same by the erection of a suitable monument. We are not prepared to admit the correctness of this proposition. On the contrary, we think it is wholly untenable. It is not in harmony with the purposes evidently intended to be accomplish'ed by and through the memorial association, as expressed in the act incorporating it. Those purposes, as we have seen, were mainly “ to hold’ and preserve the battle-grounds of Gettysburg,..... with the natural and artificial defences, as they were at the time of said battle, and by such perpetuation, and such memorial structures, as a generous and patriotic people may aid to erect, to commemorate the heroic deeds, the struggles, and triumphs of their brave defenders; ” and also “ to erect, and promote the erection, by voluntary contributions, of structures, and works of art and taste thereon, adapted to designate the spots of special interest, to commemorate the great deeds of valor, endurance,” etc.</p>

Indeed, it is expressly made its duty to “ promote the erection by voluntary contributions, of works of art.....adapted to designate spots of special interest,” etc. In view of this and other, facts in regard to which there can be no dispute, the action of the association complained of in the bill was obstructive and wholly unwarranted. Unlike other corporations, either public or private, created for profit in connection with the advancement of certain public interests, the association appellee is a quasi public corporation created solely for the public benefit, and not for the profit or advantage of any of its corporators. But, aside from that, there is nothing in any of the provisions of its charter that precluded the legislature from doing what it did. It had undoubted right to prescribe reasonable regulations respecting one or more of the public objects which the corporation was designed to promote and accomplish, provided those regulations were such as tended to secure the ends for which the association was created, and did not materially interfere with the rights and privileges granted by its charter. Every grant,of corporate existence necessarily implies “ the condition that the corporation shall be subject to such reasonable regulations, in respect to the general conduct of its affairs, as the legislature may from time to time prescribe, which do not materially interfere with or obstruct the substantial enjoj’ment of the privileges the state has granted, and serve only to secure the ends for wiich the corporation was created:” Insurance Co. v.

The provisions of the act of 1887 are clearly within the letter as well as the spirit of this well-recognized principle. There is nothing in any of them of which the appellee has any just reason to complain, as an improper interference, on the part of the commonwealth, with, any of the rights and privileges granted by its charter. The provision for a commission to act in conjunction with the' survivors of each regiment, etc., was at most a reasonable and proper regulation, tending to secure historical accuracy, and generally in furtherance of one of the purposes for which the association Avas incorporated, and one that did not improperly interfere with any of its rights and duties.</p>
