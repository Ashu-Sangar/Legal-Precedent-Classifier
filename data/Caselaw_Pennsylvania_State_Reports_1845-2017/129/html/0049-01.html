The one taken by the plaintiff’s counsel is, that it was for the benefit of P. A. Ahl, and tq hinder and delay his creditors. If his be the correct view, it is manifest that some, at least, of his exceptions are well taken. There is a plain distinction between an illegal contract, and one simply fraudulent as to creditors. The former, whether executory or ex-<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>eeuted, is absolutely void. If a note or bond had been given for the commission of a crime, no recovery can be had thereon. The maker may show the nature of the contract, and because the public are interested, the law will not help the criminal to obtain his reward. If a judgment has been confessed, the defendant may have it opened to show the illegal consideration, and have it declared void. The cases of Ham v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20Pa.%2068" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="87 Pa. 68">87 Pa. 68</a>; National Bank v.

    <p class="summary" id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[123,817,1164,652]]]'>But if the contract be merely fraudulent as to creditors, it. is nevertheless good between the parties. Why should it hot be? Neither of them is defrauded, because both of them are fully acquainted with the subject matter and purpose of the contract, and mutually consent with full knowledge. The public is without interest in the matter, and the law will not assist either party. If the contract be executory, the law will not enforce it; if executed, it will not relieve. And yet, <em>because </em>the public has no interest, the law will undertake no search after concealed fraud. And if either party can present his case without revealing the fraud, he may invoke the same law as an honest litigant. The authorities for' this are numerous, and are abundantly cited in the plaintiff’s brief.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.6",73,[119,1477,1162,551]]]'>The other view, taken by the master, is, that the sub-letting was for the benefit of the railroad company, in order that its road might be finished without vexatious delay. The company having doubtless learned from unpleasant experience, that the original contractor was financially unable to complete his contract, it was mutually arranged between them that it should be otherwise completed for the benefit of both. P. A. Ahl having obtained the consent of his nephews to finish his work, the company approved of the plan, and he sub-let to them his contract. And in this arrangement fraud was neither intended, nor existed, in reference to creditors.</p>

The property of P. A. Ahl, subject to levy and sale, could not legally be transferred to the injury of creditors; but he was not bound to labor or continue in business for their benefit. If the subcontractors were willing to take up and perform his .work in <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>their own names, although the reason for it was that he was otherwise liable to be harassed by his creditors; if they made themselves responsible for the iron and ties, and paid the workmen, and agreed that nevertheless he should receive the stock and bonds when the work was taken off their hands; if nothing was taken or concealed from his creditors that was liable to their executions, it does not appear in what way they were defrauded. When a contract will admit of two constructions, one consistent with honesty, and the other, not, the former will be presumed. It does not clearly appear that any property of P. A. .Ahl, liable to seizure, was tranferred to the sub-contractors. It is true, he testifies that when the sub-letting was done “ the ties were on the road or secured, and 125 tons of rails on the line of the road.” But there is no evidence of any sale or transfer of this material; and the testimony of T. W. Ahl that, “ I surrendered about $7,000 of material for which I had given my obligation to creditors of P. A. &amp; D. V. Ahl; that material was put in these four miles;” would seem to indicate that creditors had received other security in lieu of this material, and that the presumption of honesty was not overthrown by the facts. We are unable, therefore, to say that the learned master’s view of this sub-contract is not warranted by the evidence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[258,1517,1174,809]]]'>But it seems to us not very important, in determining the rights of these litigants, whether this sub-letting was fraudulent or otherwise. We think the real foundation of the plaintiff’s claim consists in the written contract marked No. 42, and the action taken by the railroad company in their approval thereof, their acceptance of the completed work, and in their resolution to issue the bonds necessary for payment. And when these things have been put in evidence, the claim is established without exciting even a suspicion of fraud. The defence to the claim is equally legitimate. It consists in the fact that the bonds were issued and delivered to the plaintiff, and in the evidence tending to prove that he handed them over to P. A. Ahl personally, as the property of the latter, and not to the president of the company, with a request for certification. In short, the plaintiff’s claim is practically on an obligation, to which the defence is actual payment.</p>

A. Ahl, as the property of the latter. His 5th finding is: “ That the railroad company discharged their duty in the premises, and that the bonds were delivered by the plaintiff to P. A. Ahl, who was entitled to them as the contractor for building the road.” If the bonds were voluntarily delivered by the plaintiff to P. A. Ahl, with the intention of vesting title in the latter, it is immaterial in what capacity he received them, whether as contractor for the road, or donee of the sub-contractors. In either event, the plaintiff would be without legal claim against the railroad company, or against P. A. Ahl. After careful consideration we are unable to say that the evidence fails to support the finding of the master.</p>

We learn from the report of the master that the Harrisburg &amp; Potomac Railroad Co. was organized, and the construction of its road undertaken, largely through the instrumentality of D. Y. Ahl and P. A. Ahl, his brother and business partner. In 1877, D. Y. Ahl was president of the company, and P. A. Ahl was the contractor, not only for the grading, but for furnishing"and laying the ties and rails. He had just finished one section, and nearly completed another, extending from Langsdorf to Jacksonville, a distance of four miles, when serious financial embarrassment overtook him. D. Y. Ahl appears to have been interested with, or responsible for the performance of his brother, and to have been involved in the same difficulties. They had invested their money and pledged their credit in the construction of the road until they feared to go further. They sought the advice of family friends, who were also interested in the early completion of the railroad; and the conclusion was reached that the further prosecution of the “work under the contract should be conducted in the names of Q. P. Ahl and T. W. Ahl, and that D. Y. Ahl and P. A., Ahl and the firm of P. A. Ahl &amp; Bro. should put their <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>effects into the hands of C. W. Ahl for the payment of their debts. An assignment of the contract was accordingly made to Q. P. &amp; T. W. Ahl, who were accepted by the railroad company, and who proceeded to complete the section in their own names. An assignment was also made by D. V. &amp; P. A. Ahl and P. A. Ahl &amp; Bro. to C. W. Ahl, for the purpose of paying their debts. Neither Q. P. Ahl nor T. W Ahl paid anything for the assignment of the contract to them, but took possession of the grading and the materials, and finished the section. The work was accepted by the railroad company, and paid for in stock and bonds, in accordance with the original contract. The stock and bonds were turned over to C. W. Aid, the assignee of D'. Y. and P. A. Ahl, and appropriated by him to the payment of their debts, in accordance with the understanding had when they surrendered their property to him.</p>

W. Ahl were partners in the work of completing the section, the contract for which had been assigned to them; that the money used by the' firm was advanced by the plaintiff; that the accounts of the firm were still unsettled; that the bonds and stock issued-by the railroad company in payment for the construction of the road between Langsdorf and Jacksonville belonged to him, but were in the hands of P. A. Ahl and C. <em>W. </em>Ahl; that they had been received with full notice of his title, and used by C. W. Ahl and P. A. Ahl for the payment of the debts of P. A. Ahl &amp; Bro., or some other purpose. Relief was prayed for against each of the defendants separately, — against T. <em>W. </em>Ahl for a dissolution of the alleged partnership, for discovery, and an account; against the Harrisburg &amp; Potomac Railroad Co. for an ascertainment of the amount of bonds to which the plaintiff is entitled in payment for the section between Langsdorf and Jacksonville, and for the delivery of the same to him; against P. A. Ahl for discovery and account as to the bonds received by him applicable to the work on the said section; against C. <em>W. </em>Ahl for discovery and account as to the bonds received by him applicable to the same section. The defendants answered separately. They denied that a partnership existed between the plaintiff and T. W. Ahl in the work done on the railroad. <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>They denied that Q. P. and T. W. Ahl, or either of them, took any title under the assignment made by P. A. Ahl, and alleged that the work was agreed to be done, and was in fact done, for P. A. Ahl, and under his directions. They further alleged that the bonds and stock had been issued upon the acceptance of the section by the railroad company to the plaintiff himself, and by him turned over voluntarily to P. A. Ahl, in accordance. with the arrangement made when the contract was transferred; and that P. A. Ahl had delivered them to C. W. Ahl for sale and appropriation upon the debts of himself and his firm, and that such an appropriation had been in fact made by C. W. Ahl. Separate issues of fact were thus raised between the plaintiff and each of the defendants. These were heard by a master, who found for the defendants upon every issue raised. These findings were examined by the learned judge of the court below on exceptions, and after such examination they were concurred in. The facts, therefore, may be regarded as settled <em>; </em>but we have looked into the testimony to see if any plain mistake has been made by the master and the court below, and we are satisfied that the evidence fully justifies the findings. There was competent and sufficient evidence before the master to sustain each of them; and his findings, and the decree of the court based on them, must be regarded as settling the facts.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[166,1573,1163,807]],["BL_80.1",80,[239,350,1159,83]]]'>The legal questions involved are equally free from difficulty. The master having found that the alleged partnership -with T. W. Ahl never existed, the dismissal of the bill as to him is the necessary consequence. The finding that the railroad company issued the bonds and stock due upon the completion of the section between Langsdorf and Jacksonville, at the proper time, and delivered them into the plaintiff’s own hands, entitled the company to a decree in its favor. The finding that P. A. Ahl received such bonds as came to his hands from the plaintiff in accordance with an arrangement tbat he was to receive them, because entitled to them, was fatal to the plaintiff’s claim for relief against him. As to C. W. Ahl, the master finds that the bonds that came to his hands were delivered by P. A. Ahl to him for the payment of debts, and were actually so used, and that the plaintiff had no title to them whatever. This sweeps away the plaintiff’s case as to this defendant. <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>Nothing remains, therefore, of the case made in the bill against either one of the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[232,451,1168,1818]]]'>It has been urged in argument, that, if the plaintiff took nothing under the assignment of the construction contract to him, then the arrangement should be held to be void as a device to hinder and delay creditors of P. A. Ahl. On this subject the master finds that the transfer was intended to facilitate the completion of the section, and thereby to secure at the earliest moment practicable the entire sum to be paid under the contract for the benefit of creditors. It was therefore not a fraud in fact, and it cannot be held to be a fraud in law, upon the facts presented by the master’s report. But, suppose the fact to be, as is alleged, that the transfer from P. A. Ahl to the plaintiff was intended to hinder and delay the creditors of P. A. Ahl, and that it was therefore void as to the persons intended to be defrauded, how would Q. P. Ahl be helped by such a conclusion? He is a party to the fraudulent transfer, a particeps eriminis. The proceeds of the fraudulent transaction are out of his hands, and he asks a chancellor to take them from the hands of his co-conspirator, and place them in his own. He is not prompt and eager to seek relief, but waits for six years. He states a cause of action in his bill, every fact of which is found against him. He then says, in effect, “ If my contract is not what I have claimed it to be, a valid transfer to me of the contract with the railroad company, it is a fraud on the creditors of P. A. Ahl;” and he asks a decree in his favor for the bonds, not because they belong to him, but because the contract upon which his title depends was fraudulent and void. This is not the sort of. claim to relief in equity which is calculated to move the conscience of a chancellor. The plaintiff’s ease fails on the facts on which he rested it in his bill, and it fails on the proposition just considered, that the transfer to him was intended to hinder and delay the creditors of P. A. Ahl; nevertheless the master recommended, and the court below made, a decree in his favor for a sum of money due from P. A. Ahl to him. Whatever reason P. A. Ahl may have to complain of this decree, the appellant certainly has none, and his</p>

The master found against the plaintiff, Q. P. Ahl, on every fact alleged in the bill as the basis of the relief prayed for against each of the defendants, and recommended that the bill be dismissed as to all of them except P. A. Ahl, the appellant. It would have been dismissed as to him also, but for the fact that the evidence disclosed a circumstance not averred in the bill, viz., that he was indebted to Q. P. Ahl. This indebtedness was for loans and advances made to aid in completing the section between Langsdorf and Jacksonville, and amounted to $5,302.48. The interest was computed at $3,256.21, making an aggregate of $8,558.69. For this sum the master recommended a decree, which was made by the court, and from which this appeal was taken.</p>

Whether the decree made in this case is justified by the rule invoked, is the only question presented on this record. It will be noticed that the rule is predicated of cases in which the court has acquired jurisdiction. If the court has no jurisdiction, it can make no decree. Mere service of process subjects the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court for certain preliminary and special purposes; but, unless the bill discloses a cause of action within the cognizance of a court of equity, the defendant must be allowed to depart the court. The question whether the plaintiff’s cause of action is one that entitles him to be heard in a court of equity, must be' determined, in the first instance, from the face of his bill. If the facts stated therein ,are such as entitle him to equitable relief prima facie, the defendant cannot oust the jurisdiction by his answer denying the facts stated in the bill, but such answer raises an issue <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>or issues to be decided upon hearing. The question of jurisdiction of the cause of action must be determined, in the first instance, by an examination of the bill. If this discloses a case for equitable intervention, the defendant must answer and enter upon his defence. After hearing, the question of jurisdiction depends on the proofs: Adams’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/113/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="113 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="457581" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0449-01">113 Pa. 449</a>.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[250,718,1167,1560]]]'>In the case now before us, the bill made a case against each of the defendants. When the proofs were heard, the plaintiff failed to sustain the averments of the bill against either of the defendants, and the master found against him on every question of fact raised. He had alleged a partnership with T. W. Ahl, and prayed for dissolution and an account. The master found that no partnership existed, and that the bill ought to be dismissed as to T. W. Ahl. The account prayed for against P. A. Ahl was refused, because the master found that the bonds were delivered to him by the plaintiff with full knowledge of the use to which he was to put them. The relief asked against C. W. Ahl was refused for the same reason, and because the bonds were put in his possession pursuant to a voluntary assignment for the benefit of his creditors made by P. A. Ahl to him. As to the railroad company, the bill was dismissed because it appeared that the compauy had settled with the plaintiff, and delivered to him the bonds necessary to pay for the work and materials on the whole section, at the proper time, and owed nothing to him or to P. A. Ahl whatever. Not a single jurisdictional fact or relation averred in the bill was found to have any existence. How, then, had the court jurisdiction? The case made in the bill was sufficient until hearing, but, on hearing, it was swept away. He came into court and said: “ I have a partner from whom I desire to be freed, and to have an account. My bonds are in the hands of those who have no right to them, and they fraudulently withhold them from me.” The court hears the proofs, and finds every statement to be false. He has no partner, he had no bonds, and the bonds he describes are found to belong to others, and to be in the proper custody. Nothing remains to be done, after the suitor’s case is gone, except to send him out of court.</p>

This is done to prevent a failure of justice from defective pleading, and to prevent a multiplicity of actions for the same act or omission. Such was the case in Masson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="70 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1028154" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0026-01">70 Pa. 26</a>. The relief asked for in the bill was an injunction to prevent the use of a party-wall by the defendant. On the hearing’, the plaintiff, showed his title to relief, but the proofs also showed that the defendant had already built against the wall. Upon this state of facts, the court, to prevent a failure of justice, and to avoid further litigation, ascertained the compensation which should be made to the plaintiff for the use of the wall, and made a decree accordingly. In McGowin v. Eemington, <a href="/pa/12/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="12 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="963725" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0056-01">12 Pa. 56</a>, the plaintiff asked for a decree for the delivery of certain maps, papers, and surveyor’s instruments. It was objected that, as -to the instruments, an action of trover or replevin would afford an adequate remedy for their recovery or their value; but as these .were left with the maps and papers, and under the same arrangement, it was held to be unnecessary for the plaintiff to divide his demand, and proceed for part of it at <em>law; </em>and his bill was sustained because, as to the maps and papers, his right to relief in equity was clear. The court, having jurisdiction as to these, might proceed to dispose of the whole transaction. If the master had found that no maps or papers or instruments had been left with the defendant, and the plaintiff had shown title to none, it is not to be doubted that the bill would have been dismissed. The court would not have retained it to settle some other transaction between the parties not a subject of equitable cognizance. In Danzeisen’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20Pa.%2065" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="78 Pa. 65">78 Pa. 65</a>, the plaintiff proved the facts which he had alleged in his bill, but he had mistaken their effect. He charged that they established a trust. This court held that they created a mortgage, instead of a trust; but, as they showed a cause of action within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, the court sustained the bill, and granted such relief as was appropriate to the ease made by the proofs. But if, after hearing, the master had found against the plaintiff upon every averment in his bill, the jurisdiction of the court would have been ousted, and the bill would have been dismissed. The <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>rule is stated in Slemmer’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/58/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="58 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1013210" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0155-01">58 Pa. 155</a>, to be, that where the plaintiff shows a right to relief in equity, he is entitled, under the prayer for general relief, to such decree as is agreeable to the case as presented, though it may be different from that asked for in his bill. But, if he shows no right to relief in. equity, his case has nothing on which to stand, and it must fail. The existence of some other demand capable of being enforced at law, and not within the jurisdiction of equity, cannot help it to stand. The fundamental necessity — a case within the jurisdiction of the court — is not üiet, and the defendant has a right to ask to be allowed to depart the court.</p>
