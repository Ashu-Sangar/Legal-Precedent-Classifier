Devore, and Michael Carpenter, composed a company called the Bridgeport Land Association, and were the owners of a body of land in and adjoining the borough of Hyndman, Bedford county, which had been by them laid out in town lots and outlots. On that day they entered into an article of agreement, in writing, with the defendant, G. Newton Horn, to sell and convey to him a certain “ mill seat ” for the consideration of $500, which is described in the agreement as follows, viz.: “ The above mill or manufacturing seat is more fully described as follows: Commencing at post corner on George’s street and running N. W. with George’s street 125 feet to line of B. &amp; O. Railroad; thence in a northern direction along line of said railroad to a point near the railroad culvert; then in an eastern direction across the race to bank about 60 feet; then down along bank to place of beginning; the deed for above to be in fee simple, and to be used only for milling or manufacturing purposes.”</p>

A deed for said piece or lot of ground was executed and delivered to said G. Newton Horn on May 10, 1888, and recorded. This deed describes the lines definitely and contains the following clause: “ The said piece of ground to be used for milling and manufacturing purposes only, and party of the first part shall also be allowed to erect a dam in Will’s creek near the Peerless Lime Co.’s quarry, and divert as much water from said creek as may be necessary to run a mill or manu<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>factory that may be erected thereon; and shall have the right to clean out channel below said piece of ground, so as to allow a free flow of water from tail race, and prevent back water. In case the dam is so erected in Will’s creek as to divert all the water from said creek, grantors reserve the right to a two-inch flow of water from race or creek above dam; but if the water of said creek is not all diverted, whatever water is needed by said grantors or their assigns it shall be taken from a point below the dam.” It was evidently intended that the party of second part should have this right.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b37-4" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[112,881,1166,235]]]'>8. There is a natural water-course extending from Will’s •creek, at or near the point above mentioned, which is suitable for a mill race, extending over other lands of the grantors to and over the lot conveyed and on below it over grantors’ lands.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.6",37,[115,1339,1165,351]]]'>5. A short time after said purchase, the defendant, at a cost of about $1,200 erected a two-story frame building on said lot, at the corner of the intersection of the B. &amp; O. Railroad and George’s street, which said building was intended for a chair manufactory, but was never so used. It was used for a dwelling-house and printing office, fora short time, and since has been used and occupied as a store and dwelling-house.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b37-7" data-blocks='[["BL_37.7",37,[114,1695,1164,288]]]'>6. On another part of this lot the defendant has a coal-yard and coal-tipple along the B. &amp; O. Railroad. A portion of this coal-yard or tipple is on the right of way of the said railroad, and part on the lot in controversy. It is used in connection with the lot, and could not be operated as a coal-yard, except in connection with the lot.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b37-8" data-blocks='[["BL_37.8",37,[112,2001,1165,198]]]'>7. From the time of the purchase, up to the time of the institution of this suit, the defendant did not use this lot for milling or manufacturing purposes, but used it for a storehouse, dwelling-house, printing office, and coal-yard.</p>

After the purchase of this lot, the defendant purchased a mill in the upper part of the town of Hyndman; or rather, he took back from a man named Samuel Hendrickson a mill property he had sold to him previous to the purchase of this lot.' <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>He took it back for the reason that Mr. Hendrickson was unable to pay for it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[261,471,1162,653]]]'>9. The title to the water-right, as sold to the defendant, was in the plaintiffs at the time they made the conveyance. The calls in the old surveys, and the marks upon the ground that under the evidence were there a number of years ago, fix the line of the plaintiffs’ property on the north or Evans side of Will’s creek, so that Jacob Evans had no title to any part of Will’s creek. Even if this were not so, the conveyance from Jacob Evans to the Bridgeport Land Company, dated August 28, 1878, recorded, gives to the plaintiffs the right to divert all the water from Will’s creek. The evidence produced to show that this conveyance from said Jacob Evans to the said land company was fraudulent and without consideration, falls far short of establishing such fact.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[260,1132,1160,336]]]'>10. The evidence produced to establish an outstanding title in Cornelius Devore’s heirs to that part of the land owned by the said plaintiffs, over or through which the water of Will’s creek would have to be carried to reach the lot conveyed to said defendant, is entirely too vague and indefinite to show a title better than plaintiffs. If any such outstanding title exists, the evidence fails to show it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b38-8" data-blocks='[["BL_38.9",38,[257,1944,1164,446]],["BL_39.1",39,[118,362,1167,197]]]'>Unless it is an estate upon condition, the plaintiffs’ case is without foundation. If not clearly expressed, but the intention of the parties that it was to be an estate upon condition can be gathered from the whole paper, then it is enforceable in a court of equity, and the defendant should be restrained in any use of the property, other than for milling or manufacturing purposes and the uses necessarily and reasonably connected therewith. In a proceeding in the common law form, it would be necessary to inquire into the form in which <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>the right is reserved, in order to decide whether it should be sued for as a condition, or as a simple contract or covenant; but in the equity form- of proceeding it is the substantial element, the intention of the parties, that is inquired into.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-5" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[120,566,1168,962]]]'>It is very evident from the article of agreement and the deed, that the grantors intended to sell the lot for a mill or other manufactory, and it is just as evident that the grantee purchased it for that express purpose and intended to use it for such purpose only. The language is: “ The said piece of ground to be used for milling or manufacturing purposes only.” If this has any meaning, it is that the grantors conveyed the lot upon the condition that the grantee use it for milling or manufacturing purposes only. Without such construction the language of the clause is without meaning. It was put there for some purpose, surely, and the only reasonable or common sense purpose that can be ascribed is, that it was upon the condition that the grantee use the property so conveyed for the sole purpose of milling or other manufacturing purposes. It is very clear that such was the intention of the parties, and that this was the condition upon which the grant was made. The bill of the plaintiffs alleges it, and the answer of the defendant admits it; and he further says, “ that he still intends to do so at such time as will suit his purposes.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.6",39,[122,1537,1166,196]]]'>This was not a reservation, for the grantors have not reserved anything out of that which they before granted.

This, then, could only be an estate upon condition subsequent. It is not very clearly expressed, but taking the whole instrument together, I think the clear implication is, that the parties intended to create an estate upon condition.</p>

Has the defend<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>ant had such reasonable time ? The deed was made and delivered on May 10, 1888. This suit was instituted on February 16, 1885. Thus, the defendant has had a period of less than two years to comply with or perform the condition. He made no visible efforts to comply with it in that time. Yet if he had not used the property for other purposes, I am of the opinion that a court of equity would not compel him to proceed to erect a mill or manufactory within that period, nor would such non-compliance work a forfeiture of the estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b40-4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.5",40,[251,822,1169,592]]]'>I do not understand that the plaintiffs seek a forfeiture. The prayer for relief is that he be restrained from using the property for other purposes than that of milling or manufacturing. This prayer should be granted and a decree entered restraining the defendant from using the land for a coal-yard. But inasmuch as he has erected a steam grist-mill on the property since the beginning of this suit, I cannot see that he should be compelled to remove the building used for a store and dwelling-house. He might very consistently with the terms of the deed have a dwelling and store on the property, and having such, in connection with a mill or manufactory, would not be a breach of the condition.</p>

That the defendant bought the lot for the purpose of erecting a mill or other manufactory has already been found; but the kind of mill or manufactory, or that he was to use water-power and divert the water from Will’s creek and use it for such mill or manufactory, and so divert it that the plaintiffs would have the use of it below, is not established.

The learned master fell into an error in supposing that our case depended on its being an estate upon condition, and held it was an estate upon condition. The learned court held it was not an estate upon condition, and dismissed the bill. Both overlooked the true state of the case; that it is not put on the ground of being an estate upon condition, and that the bill seeks to enforce a covenant or contract, a negative covenant as it is called, restricting the use to which the grantee could put the lot, Which we claim to be our right.</p>

Whatever may be the authorities elsewhere, it has long been settled in this state that the mere acceptance of a deed does not create a covenant on the part of the grantee.

It seems to be conceded by the plaintiffs that, standing on the deed alone, there is no covenant on the part of the grantee, but to aid them they call in the article of agreement between the parties. To this, it may be urged, there are two objections : (1), the remedy is not sought in the bill on the terms of the agreement, but solely by reason of the terms of the deed; and (2), the contract between the parties was terminated and all prior contracts were merged in the deed, which contains substantially the same provisions as those set forth in the agreement, and in such case there is a merger and the deed must speak the contract, the remedy and the rights of the parties: Jones v.

The grantor has no legal cause to complain that his grantee does not exercise all the rights and privileges which he purchased and paid for. And even if a covenant to build a mill could be implied, no time was fixed within which it was to be done. It appears, however, that since the bill was filed the grantee has erected a grist-mill, which was intended to be operated by steam. The appellants object to this and say he should have used the waterpower. There is nothing in the deed which requires him to do so, and we cannot look elsewhere for it. The previous understanding of the parties, if there was one, must be presumed to have been merged in the deed. There is no averment of fraud,' accident, or mistake in its execution. There was no attempt to reform it. It was alleged, however, that the appellee is using the property for other than milling or manufacturing purposes. He did erect a building for manufacturing purposes, but was unable to use it as such. It is now occupied as a store and dwelling-house. If we give the language quoted from the deed the effect of a covenant, we do not regard this as a breach. It must have a reasonable construction. A covenant to use property_for manufacturing purposes would imply the right to use it for all purposes incident to such object. There must be a house or houses, for those who operate the establishment to live in, and we cannot say that a store to supply their wants is not germane. The matter of the coal-yard does not require discussion. There was no coal-yard upon the lot. It is true the master finds there was, but in this he was mistaken. The only evidence upon this subject is that of J. W. Madore, one of the plaintiffs, who <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>said, “ I am not certain tbat any part of Horn’s coal-yard proper is on this lot.
