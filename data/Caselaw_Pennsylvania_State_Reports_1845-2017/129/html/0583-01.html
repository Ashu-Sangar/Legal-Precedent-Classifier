    <p class="summary" id="b604-11" data-blocks='[["BL_604.11",604,[257,1294,1184,1022]]]'>[It appears by the evidence that the plaintiff in this case held a policy of insurance granted to him by the defendant company, which policy was in full life in the year 1885, when a loss occurred] 1; the insurance being upon merchandise in the store of the plaintiff. Upon the night of March 14,1885, there was a total destruction of the store-house and dwelling house, and the contents of the store. There could of course be no recovery for anything else than the property insured; that is to say, the goods in the store. We might mention that as a general rule, there can only be recoveries upon policies of insurance for the actual loss sustained; never more, however, than the amount of the policy. • It would appear that the fire occurred on Saturday night; and on the Friday following, Mr. Hasson, who had procured the policy for the plaintiff, and Mr. Kohne, appeared on the premises for the purpose of adjusting the loss; perhaps ascertaining what it was; whether it was a total loss, and such other facts as might seem to be important to them. The witnesses tell you that while these parties were there they were endeavoring to settle the loss and that finally it was settled in the manner they narrate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b604-12" data-blocks='[["BL_604.12",604,[259,2324,1173,96]],["BL_605.1",605,[145,376,1181,1071]]]'>It would appear that there was another policy taken out upon the same property, in the Humboldt company, the policy in the <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>Citizens company being in the sum of $1,600, and that in the Humboldt being for $1,000. It would appear that Mr. Kohne, in endeavoring to settle the losses covered by the two policies, offered a certain sum of money which was refused; that he then increased the sum offered which was still refused; the plaintiff, upon his part, agreeing to take less than the face of both policies, finally it was adjusted, the witnesses tell you, by agreeing to pay $2,200 for this loss, upon both policies of insurance. Now, Mr. Kohne would have no power, in any event, to make a settlement that would be binding upon the Humboldt company, so far as we are informed by the evidence, because he was not the agent of that company and had no authority. It is claimed that he was the general agent, however, of the Citizens company, and for the purpose of showing such agency, an advertisement which the company inserted in the Pittsburgh Directory, was shown in evidence, in which he was so recognized, as evidenced by that paper, if you belief that paper was authorized to be so made out and inserted in the Pittsburgh Directory by the company. The witness, Walter Morris, testifies that he was secretary of the company at that time, and that he inserted this card for the company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[140,1456,1181,656]]]'>Now, if this was a joint settlement of both these policies, taking a round sum of $2,200 for his claim upon both these policies, and nothing was said with regard to any apportionment at the time, or how the $2,200 was to be made up, then there could be no recovery in this case for any sum. [But, if in coming to this sum of money and adjusting the amount, it was agreed .and. understood by these parties that there was no objection to the $1,600 policy in the defendant company, and that that as a round sum should go in as a constituent part of the $2,200, and it was so understood and so agreed upon by the general agent at the time, acting for the company, we think that there can be a recovery for this amount under the evidence if you believe the witnesses.] 8</p>

The testimony of the witnesses is fresh in your recollection, and we think that you understand the question thoroughly. [We may repeat: If this offer of the plaintiff was to take the $2,200 for his claim on both policies, regardless as to any specific amount touching the present policy, there can be no recovery. But, if, <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>in adjusting this sum, it was agreed between them that the $1,600, the amount of the -defendant company’s policy should go in and be an item, and that added to that, there was to be the sum of $600 for the Humboldt policy, and this was clear and definite, and the plaintiff signed this paper with that understanding, from what was said and done by the agent of the company at the time, if you believe from the evidence he was agent, and the plaintiff’s proof, in this regard is not contradicted, then we think that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover this amount, and we submit this question of fact to the jury, under the whole of the evidence.] 3</p>
