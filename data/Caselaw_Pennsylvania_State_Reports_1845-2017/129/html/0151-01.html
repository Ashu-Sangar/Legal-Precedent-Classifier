      <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>The respondent in the case, being the postmaster of DeTurkville, in the township of Washington, was elected in the fall of 1887 a county commissioner, and having been duly sworn in, has occupied and filled the office of county commissioner since January, 1888. At the instance of E. W. Frehafer, the district attorney has instituted the proceeding by quo warranto, to try the right of the respondent to hold the office of county commissioner, on the ground that by the constitution he cannot be postmaster and commissioner at one and the same, time. Prior to the filing of an answer by the respondent, he resigned his office as postmaster, which resignation was duly accepted by the proper authorities. These are the facts in the case and they are not disputed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[125,1007,1171,351]]]'>The second section of article XII. of the constitution of Pennsylvania, provides that “ no member of congress from this state, nor any person holding or exercising any office or appointment of trust or profit under the United States, shall at the same time hold or exercise any office in this state to which a salary, fees, or perquisites shall be attached. The general assembly may by law declare what offices are incompatible.”</p>

In the present case, it is an office of very small profit, indeed, for the compensation does not exceed the sum of thirty dollars annually; nevertheless it must be classed as an office of profit. The office of county commissioner is one to which a salary is attached, the law providing a per diem pay of two dollars and fifty cents. Under the plain reading of the law it would seem clear that the respondent cannot be both postmaster and county commissioner.</p>

I cannot feel the force of the argument, even though it has been most stoutly contended for. The .constitutional prohibition would amount to nothing at all, <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>for it would leave the matter in the hands of the general assembly, to do with as it might deem proper. The clause might as well have been omitted as being entirely nugatory, if the constitutional prohibition is not to be the guide, but some law on the subject which the legislature may or may not pass.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[267,643,1173,1160]]]'>The evident purpose in giving the legislature power to declare what offices were incompatible, was not to restrict the operation of the first part of the clause, but was intended to give power to declare what state offices were incompatible with each other, and with offices under the United States not coming under the designation of offices to which salaries, fees or perquisites attached, or offices under other states and countries. Any other construction would make the latter clause nullify the former. That this must be the construction of the clause is well illustrated by the case of Commonwealth v. Ford, <a href="/pa/5/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="953542" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0067-01">5 Pa. 67</a>, arising under the constitution of 1838. Ford was deputy U. S. marshal and commissioner of the district of Penn; and upon a quo warranto, he claimed that he was entitled to hold both offices, because no salary, fees or perquisites pertained to the office of commissioner, and that therefore he did not come within the constitutional prohibition. But to this it was answered, that whilst this was true, yet the legislature had by act of April 16, 1838, declared that <em>“ </em>no person holding an office under the government of the United States shall be allowed to serve as a member of city councils, commissioner of a district, or burgess,” and that his disqualifications were not under the clause in the constitution, but under the act declaring the offices incompatible.</p>

L. 186, upon the subject, did not declare the offices held by the respondent incompatible. A great many authorities both English and American were cited upon the questions arising from the incompatibility of offices, and whilst the law as decided by the different courts seems to be uniform <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>and in accordance with the contention of the defendant, .yet it has no bearing upon the case before the court. It is not a question of incompatibility or the reverse. It is simply a question of constitutional prohibition. The cases have therefore no relevancy in deciding this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[162,616,1169,453]]]'>It was further argued that the constitution of the state was not self-executing, and that the clause relating to public offices was inoperative until the legislature passed some law to carry its provisions into effect. This is not true as a general rule, and certainly not, as to matters contained in that instrument which in their very nature may be enforced without further legislation. What legislation was required to make the clause operative, was not pointed out to us. We see no difficulty in enforcing this clause without the aid of additional legislation.</p>

Having put himself in the position of holding only one office, has he not conformed to all that the constitution requires, that he shall not “ at the same time hold or exercise ” the two offices. The law does not declare him ineligible because he held the office under the general government. It merely says he shall not hold both at the same time. If this question were one of first impression, my own inclination would be to hold that having removed the disqualification, he could retain the state office, because the requirements of the constitution would have been complied with. But what few authorities I have been able to gather, seem to rule that the disqualification must be removed before the officer is sworn in and enters upon the duties of the second office. In the case of the Commonwealth v. Pyle, <a href="/pa/18/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="18 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="969054" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0519-01">18 Pa. 519</a>, the opinion of the court was delivered by Chief Justice Black, and that eminent judge decided that “ when the constitution or a statute declares that certain disqualifications shall render a person ineligible to an office, he must get rid of his disqualification before he is appointed or elected. Such have been the decisions <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>of Congress in the contests there. But if the law merely forbids him to hold or enjoy the office, or exercise its duties, it is sufficient if he qualifies himself before he is sworn. A man may hold one office after he has been chosen to another which is incompatible with it, without thereby forfeiting either of them, provided he resigns the first before he enters upon the duties of the last.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[245,709,1176,1471]]]'>It would clearly follow from this that a resignation of the first office, long after entering upon the duties of the second, is too late, and will not cure the disqualification. Probably the law is so declared, in order to remove the temptation of illegally holding on to two' or more offices at the same time as long as possible, and only relinquishing at the last moment by a resignation enforced by the fear of an ouster. The constitutions of all or nearly all the states contain provisions similar in their nature to our own. They are intended to carry out the well defined policy of keeping distinct and separate the respective functions of national and state government. It is for the purpose of preventing any encroachments of the one upon the other, and particularly of the general upon the state government, that these clauses are inserted in state constitutions; so that state officers shall have no divided, or perchance, no inconsistent or incompatible duties to perform. This is the general principle, and we are bound to carry it out in the administration of the law, even though it hits so humble a personage as the postmaster of DeTurkville, in the county of Schuylkill. No objection is made to his competency or to his honesty; nor is it even hinted that there is danger that the relations between the state and federal government are about to be disturbed bjr allowing'him to retain both offices, or that the cause of free government may receive a shock by permitting one and the same person to handle the mails at DeTurkville, and at the same time act as a county commissioner. But the law is no respecter of persons. All are subject to its mandates, and whether the office be great or small, there is no exception to limit it or control the operation of the general principles.</p>

DeTurk was on November 8, 1887, duly elected a commissioner of Schuylkill county, and on the first Monday of the following January executed the required bond, took the oath, and entered upon the duties, of that office. At the time of his election he was holding, by appointment, the office of postmaster at DeTurkville, in said county; and he continued to discharge its duties until November 18, 1888, when he resigned, and his successor was appointed. On October 24,1888, upon the suggestion of the district attorney of said county that DeTurk was then holding the office of county commissioner, an office in this state to which a salary is attached, and the office of postmaster, an office of trust and profit under the United States, a writ of quo warranto was ordered, requiring the said Samuel G. DeTurk to appear and show by what authority he claimed to exercise the office of county commissioner in the said county of Schuylkill. An answer was filed December 3, 1888, admitting the foregoing facts, but denying that the offices were incompatible, within the intent and meaning of the constitution and the act of May 15, 1874, P. L. 186. To this answer a demurrer was filed on January 10, 1889, and upon the issue thus joined the cause was heard, and on January 14, 1889, a judgment of ouster was entered against the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[278,700,1163,806]]]'>The constitution plainly prohibits any person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States from holding at the same time an office in this state to which a salary is attached ; and it as plainly provides that the legislature may by law declare what offices are incompatible. The prohibition and the permission or direction are contained in the same section, but in separate sentences of it. Is the former inoperative by reason of the latter ? Does the section, as a whole, mean that no person can hold these offices at the same time, if the legislature shall declare them incompatible ? We cannot so construe it. The prohibition may be enforced without legislative aid, and no action or inaction of the legislature can destroy it. This construction does not render the last sentence of the section useless, because that relates to offices not within the constitutional prohibition, and authorizes the legislature to declare them incompatible: Commonwealth v. Ford. <a href="/pa/5/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="5 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="953542" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0067-01">5 Pa. 67</a>.</p>

In considering this question, regard must be had to the fact that the former is an office under the government of the United States, and the latter an office under the state government. If the titles to these offices were derived from a common source, it might well be held that an acceptance of the second office was an implied resignation and vacation of the first. This is the common law rule, and the current of authority in this country sustains it. But the state cannot, declare the federal office vacant, nor remove the incumbent from it. It may, however, enforce the constitutional provision by proceedings to test his title to the office he holds under its laws, and it may remove him from that office, if he does not surrender the office he holds under the government of the United States. It follows from these views that at the time of the institution of this suit <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>DeTurk liad not an indefeasible title to the office of county-commissioner, because he was then in actual possession, and exercising the functions, of an office of trust and profit under the United States.</p>
    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[133,565,1175,1423]]]'>Did his formal resignation and complete surrender of it, before answer, place him in accord with the constitution, and perfect his title to the office of county commissioner? By accepting it, and entering upon its duties, he elected to hold it. This election was confirmed by his express resignation of the office of postmaster, and the appointment of his successor, before issue was joined. When he appeared, in obedience to the mandate of the writ, he was not holding an office of trust or profit under the United States. The judgment of ouster, therefore, rests on an alleged forfeiture resulting from a prior holding of the two offices at the same time. But, as the acceptance of the second office was an implied resignation of the first,— an election to hold the former and to surrender the latter, — it did not forfeit respondent’s title to the office which he so elected to hold and exercise. This case depends entirely upon the construction of the constitutional provision against the holding of incompatible offices, as it is not covered by any statute. The constitution makes these offices incompatible; but it does not prescribe a penalty, or declare a forfeiture. We are of opinion that when issue was joined in this case the respondent had a valid title to the office of county commissioner, and that it was error to enter judgment of ouster. Commonwealth v. Pyle, <a href="/pa/18/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="18 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="969054" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0519-01">18 Pa. 519</a>, is not in conflict with this conclusion. It merely decided that a stockholder in a bank could not hold the office of notary public, because, by the act of April 14, 1840, the legislature had so declared. What was there said with reference to incompatible offices was not necessary to the determination of the question before the court.</p>
