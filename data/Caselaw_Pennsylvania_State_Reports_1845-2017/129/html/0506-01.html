In September, 1875, said bank discounted a note for $1,500, dated September 8, 1875, drawn by S. Woods, Jr., payable at the Allegheny Savings Bank, sixty days after date, to the order of Robert Woods, and indorsed by Robert Woods and Thomas M. Marshall. Upon this note Mr. Marshall was an accommodation indorser. He was at the same time accommodation indorser upon a number of other notes held by the bank. - Both before and after the maturity of the note in suit, he made various payments to the bank on account of his liability to it as an indorser, without specific appropriation thereof to any particular notes. He also rendered legal services to the bank, and claimed a credit upon his indebtedness for the compensation to which he was entitled for said services, alleging upon the trial that, counting interest upon the notes on which he was liable at six per cent, the credits which he claimed more than paid his indebtedness to the bank.</p>

But he could not safely sell that judgment without the consent of defendant. The money realized in that way would be in relief of defendant. He was asked if he would consent that the trustee should sell the judgment for that sum. The only conceivable reason for asking his consent, or for him giving it,, was that he was interested in that judgment, or the claim for which it had been obtained. He was thus interested. He was liable for the whole debt. If he paid it, he had a right to have that judgment assigned to him.

But a waiver of protest does not estop the indorser from setting up any defence he may have against the holder, except that specifically waived.</p>

To take a case out of the statute of limitations, the acknowledgment of the debt must be clear, distinct and unequivocal. In these agreements there is no acknowledgment of indebtedness, distinct or otherwise. They are perfectly consistent with the theory that Mr. Marshall denied all liability on his part. He simply consented that the trustee make what he could out of the judgment. An offer to purchase it had been made, and there was no time for the adjustment of accounts. • The court, therefore, gave the agreement of May 5, 1886, a forced construction, contrary to its express terms.</p>

Mr. Marshall is a lawyer, and knew that the first agreement was functus officio, so far as it operated to give consent to the sale of the judgment, and there was no conceivable reason for renewing that consent or waiving any plea in regard to it, particularly any statute plea, for the statute had nothing to do with it. The only agreement which required renewal was the implied agreement to pay the note, and this writing should be construed so as to give it effect. Mr. Marshall’s counter-claim was a mere matter of set-off, and any uncertainty as to its amount did not render uncertain the amount of the liability he acknowledged.</p>

Stephen Woods was the maker of a promissory note for $1,500, dated September 8, 1875, and payable to Robert Woods at the Allegheny Savings Bank. It was indorsed by the payee, and by Thomas M. Marshall, the plaintiff in error. At the maturity of the note on November 10,1875, the maker was unable to provide funds for its payment, and the indorsers made a written waiver of protest. An action was brought against the maker, and a judgment obtained for the amount of the note and interest, at the suit of the savings bank, but no action was brought against the indorsers. Nothing appears to have been collected on the judgment against Stephen Woods, but some one offered <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>the bank $500 for it. Before accepting the offer, the bank applied, to Mr. Marshall for his consent to the proposed sale, which he gave in writing, as follows: “I agree to sale of the judgment on this note against S. Woods for five hundred dollars, and agree to ratify same for M. Hay, trustee. Pittsburgh, May 6,1880. [Signed] Thos. M. Marshall.” Nothing more was done, so far as Mr. Marshall was concerned, until May 5, 1886, six years, less one day, after the written consent to the sale of the judgment had been given, and more than ten years after the maturity of the note and the waiver of protest. At that time it appears that Mr. Marshall was asked to waive the statute of limitations on his indorsement. This he declined to do, but he renewed his agreement of May 6, 1880, by a writing indorsed upon the same paper, in these words: “ I renew the agreement of May 6, 1880, as of this date, and I waive any statute plea thereon.

The note matured on November 10, 1875. This suit was brought on May 6, 1886. The statute of limitations is an answer, prima facie, to the plaintiff’s demand, and the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the bar of the statute has been tolled. The only evidence for this purpose is the agreement of May 6, 1880, renewed on May 5, 1886; and, unless this shows a clear and distinct admission or recognition of the liability of Mr. Marshall for this debt, the plaintiff must fail. For what purpose was the agreement of May 6,1880, asked by the bank, and given by the indorser ? The bank held a judgment for the amount of the note and interest against Stephen Woods, the maker. The use of legal process had realized nothing upon it. The bank was offered $500 for an unconditional sale of it, and was evidently inclined to accept the offer, if this could be done safely. The danger was that the indorser might insist that a sale of the judgment for less than its face was improvident and unnecessary, and treat it as a distinct ground of defence, if called upon to pay the balance. To settle this question, Mr. Marshall was asked to consent to the sale, which he did. By so doing he said in effect to the bank, <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>“ If you attempt to compel payment of the note by me, whatever other 'defences I may set up, I will not allege that you have sold this judgment for less than it was worth.” The agreement is not inconsistent with any other line of defence than the specific one which was in the mind of both parties, and which is clearly referred to in the writing. Mr. Marshall might, with entire fairness, deny his indorsement, allege payment by him, or set up the statute of limitations, and yet be willing that the bank should realize whatever it could from its own judgment against Woods by a sale of it for the best price offered. ■ The bank exercised a proper caution in asking the consent of the indorser to the sale. The indorser, if satisfied that the sale was a proper one, acted with fairness in giving his assent to it. This was the only purpose for which the agreement was asked for by the bank or its representative. It is the -only subject to which it relates, and it is the only line of defence on which it closes the mouth of him who signed it.</p>

The operative words of the agreement are these : “ I renew the agreement of May 6, 1880.” The words “ as of this date ” express the legal effect of the words preceding them, and neither add to nor take from that effect; they are wholly unnecessarjn The same may be said of the remaining words, “ and I waive any statute plea thereon.” This had been already done by the agreement to renew, as effectually as it was possible to do by any form of words whatever. The original agreement gave consent to the sale of the judgment for much less than its face. The agreement of May 5, 1886, renewed that consent. If there was danger that Mr. Marshall might be relieved from that consent by lapse of time, its renewal in express words removed that danger, and expressed his willingness to remain bound by it. Further than this the agreement was never intended or understood to go when originally made, and it is not probable that the renewal agreement would have received any <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>other construction but for the unnecessary and meaningless words it contains.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[276,483,1183,1022]]]'>The cases cited and relied on by the defendant in error are not in point. In Finkbone’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="86 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1056641" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0368-01">86 Pa. 368</a>, Wiley had given a receipt for money to be returned to Mary Finkbone, “in such amounts as she may want.” He received another sum to be held in the same manner, and Avrote the receipt therefor on the same piece of paper, and directly under the first, and then re-delivered the paper to her. This was properly held to be an admission of the amount shown to be due on the face of the paper at the date of such last receipt and delivery. In Wesner v. Stein, <a href="/pa/97/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="97 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="444834" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0322-01">97 Pa. 322</a>, the rule is clearly stated that an acknowledgment, to take a case out from the operation of the statute, must be clear and unambiguous. It must recognize, and be directed to, the debt with sufficient clearness, and must amount to an unqualified admission that it remains due and unpaid. The words relied on in this case do not meet the test. They refer clearly to another subject, — the sale of the Woods judgment. If Mr. Marshall was now objecting to that sale, his agreement that it might be made ought to conclude him; but, as he is defending upon wholly different ground, we do not see that he is affected by it in any manner.</p>
    <p id="b534-6" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[284,1514,1176,242]]]'>Judgment reversed, and judgment is now entered in favoi of the defendant on the question reserved. An opinion was filed in this case soon after it was heard, which we are informed by the prothonotary cannot be found. This opinion is now filed for that reason.</p>
