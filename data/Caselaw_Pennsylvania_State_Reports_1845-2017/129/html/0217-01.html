It is there said, 132: “The act of May 1,1868, sterns to use the phrase ‘go into operation’ as a synonym for ‘doing business,’ and this must mean more than purchasing supplies in the state through agents : P. L. 1868,108. So the act of June 7, 1879,” the act now in question, “ enacts that no corporation chartered by this or any other state, and ‘ doing business ’ in this commonwealth, shall ‘ go into operation ’ without first making certain reports; thus making ‘ doing business ’ equivalent to ‘ going into operation; ’ and in § 16, 120, foreign corporations which do not ‘ invest and use ’ their capital in this state, are required to obtain and pay for a license, thus making ‘ invest and use its capital ’ another equivalent for ‘ doing business.’ ” The judgment based on this reasoning was, in that case, affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>

Conglomerate Mining Company, decided in 1884, and not reported. In that case this court held that a foreign mining company, which owned a lot of ground in the city of Philadelphia, not used for corporate purposes, for which it had paid $1,500, was not subject to the tax on capital stock imposed by the act of 1879, because it did not come within the scope of the language of § 2 [4], which we have quoted above, and under which the tax is claimed in ■this case. It was said in that case: “ It by no means follows that because a foreign corporation owns property here, it is <em>merely </em>for that reason doing business here, or investing money or employing its capital here, in the sense intended by the act. . . . <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>The legislature did not intend to tax upon their capital stock foreign corporations who exercise no corporate activity in this state, and who do not, in some degree, or in some manner, direct or indirect, carry out here the purposes for which they were created.” This was the only point in the case, and it was affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[269,663,1189,1072]]]'>We think the authority of these precedents requires us to hold that defendant is not liable to the tax claimed in this case. We cannot say that it was doing business in this state, or had capital employed in any manner here, during the period embraced in this settlement, merely because it had leased telephones, the legal title to which it retained, and charged royalties' for the use of its patents, the rent and royalties being either a fixed sum, or a proportion of the gross receipts received by the lessees, and being payable and actually paid to defendant in Boston. . It may be proper to say that defendant claims that it retains the ownership of the telephones, in order to have it in its power more effectually to prevent infringement of its rights' under its patents. We have not found this as a fact, because it is a pure question of motive; nor do we regard it as a material element in the case. The mere ownership of property in the state, by a foreign corporation, does not render it liable to the tax on capital stock; it must be “ doing business,” or “having capital employed ” in some manner; or it must “invest and use its capital ” within the state. As said in the case last above cited, “it must be, in some manner and degree, exercising its corporate powers within the state.”</p>

The business which the American Bell Telephone Company is authorized to carry on, is the manufacturing, owning, selling, using and licensing others to -upe, telephones and other apparatus and appliances pertaining to the transmission of intelligence by electricity. It sells nothing. Its contracts for the use of telephones are nominally, and for many purposes wholly, with its licensees; but they áre made for the purpose of establishing a business in which sublicensees shall use telephones, and their ultimate object is a profit to the company through such use.</p>

It had, therefore, in the year 1884, business and contract relations with 23,982 persons in Pennsylvania, who were lessees of its property.

Nor does this company have capital employed in this state in the name of any other company or person.

It is submitted, also, that, according to the true meaning of the acts of assembly, the company does not have “capital employed ” here “-in any other manner.” The purpose of this clause in § 4, act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112, .was to tax property brought into Pennsylvania by a foreign corporation in the transaction of its business: Commonwealth v.

Two things must concur to make such a tax valid: (1) the capital must in fact and in law be employed here, by engaging in business either directly or through some representative; and (2) the property representing the capital must, in fact and in law, be the present property and pos-' session of the corporation sought to be taxed.</p>

Their physical situs is not necessarily the situs of the capital used in constructing them. And even if it were, this company has not such ownership of them as would'subject it to taxation, having neither the possession nor present right of possession: Mayor v.

But even the direct and unqualified ownership of property in Pennsylvania by a foreign corporation, does not of itself subject the capital stock to taxation there; there must be both an investment and use of capital: Commonwealth v.

As to the basis of apportioning the tax, if any were due, it must be remembered that the claim of the commonwealth, though nominally for a tax on capital stock, is really for a tax upon property and assets brought into this state: Commonwealth v. Standard Oil Co., <a href="/pa/101/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="101 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="500862" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0119-01">101 Pa. 119</a>. The proper way to apportion would be to determine the actual value of the whole property, and the actual value of that part of it in Pennsylvania: Commonwealth v. Standard Oil Co., supra; Commonwealth v, L. &amp; Z. Mining Co., 5 Pa. C. C. R. 89, note; Commonwealth v.

But these telephones not being connected together except by wires belonging to other parties, and these wires not being connected with telephones in other states, this case is not within the exception. The case of the Western U. Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20U.S.%20535" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="125 U.S. 535">125 U.

    <p id="b248-6" data-blocks='[["BL_248.7",248,[240,866,1184,1265]]]'>This was an attempt on the part of the commonwealth to tax the capital stock of the American Bell Telephone Company, to the extent that its capital was employed in “ doing business within this commonwealth.” Under the facts as found by the court below, we are very clear the commonwealth is not entitled to collect such tax. The company is a corporation created by the laws of the state of Massachusetts. Its principal office or place of business is in the city of Boston. It has no office, agent, or place of business in this state. All the contracts for rent and royalty of telephones were made in Boston, and the payments therefor were made there. It leases to certain Pennsylvania corporations the use of the telephones, and furnishes the instruments, which remain the property of the company, and are to be paid for whether used or not. The Pennsylvania corporations carry on the business here. They construct and own the necessary lines of wires, switches, switch-boards, and other apparatus necessary to carry on the business. They maintain their own offices, and employ and pay the officers and agents needed to carry it on. The telephone company transacts no business here; it has no part of its capital or - property here, except the instruments in question, which, as before observed, are leased to Pennsylvania corporations, with a license to use the same. Under such state of facts it would seem clear that the telephone company could not be taxed as doing business within this state.</p>
    <p id="b248-7" data-blocks='[["BL_248.8",248,[244,2148,1170,247]],["BL_249.1",249,[123,351,1182,923]]]'>It was contended, however, on the part of the common wealth, that, because the company had in its contract with the Pennsylvania corporations, reserved a certain power of control over telephones leased to them, and might, upon certain breaches of said contracts, enter upon, take possession of, and operate <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>said telephones, the said company was doing business here, and became liable to the tax. There is a wide distinction, however, between the right to do business and actually doing it. It may be that should said company proceed to enforce its rights under these contracts, and after taking possession of the telephones, operate them, it would be doing business here. But that contingency has not arrived. It is to be observed that this was not a tax upon the instruments owned by the company, and operated here under license. The instruments as such are perhaps within the taxfiig power of the commonwealth, for the reason that they are here and within her jurisdiction. It matters not to the state to whom they belong. But the state has not laid such tax; on the contrary, it is a tax upon capital stock, and as the company transacts no business within the state, no portion of its capital is here in point of fact, or by construction of law. Authorities are scarcely needed for so plain a proposition. It is sufficient to refer to Commonwealth v. Standard Oil Company, <a href="/pa/101/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="101 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="500862" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0119-01">101 Pa. 119</a>.</p>
