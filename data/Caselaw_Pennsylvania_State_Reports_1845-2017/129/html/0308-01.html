[So far as the defendant is concerned, the transportation was from Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, to Phillipsburgh, New Jersey, and the receipts named were for that particular transportation. But the freight and passengers were <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>there delivered upon the railroad of another company, to wit, the Belvidere Delaware Railroad Co., a line operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad Co., upon which railroad it was carried to Trenton, and thence, by other lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co.’s system, to Philadelphia. By running arrangements between these companies the transportation was continuous, and the freight and passengers were, when their transportation commenced at Mauch Chunk, destined for Philadelphia, and were actually there delivered. The transportation of passengers was upon tickets, a form of which is hereby referred to, hereto annexed, and marked exhibit A. The transportation of freight was upon the joint way-bill of the Lehigh Valley and Pennsylvania Railroad companies, and this way-bill covered the whole transportation. The total receipts from this transportation, seven per cent of which were collected by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. at point of shipment, and the remainder by the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. at point of destination, were apportioned between the companies upon a mileage basis; that is to say, each company’s share was in the proportion that the number of miles carried by it bore to the total number of miles carried. One twentieth of the said receipts were derived from passenger transportation;] 3 $48,026.82 was received for transportation from points in foreign states to other points in foreign states, not touching Pennsylvania; $39,599.44 was received for transportation from points in a foreign state to other points in the same state, passing through the state of Pennsylvania in course of transit; $227,304.50 was received for transportation from points in other states to points in Pennsylvania ; $2,203,347.87 was received for transportation from points in Pennsylvania to points in other states; and $204,659.06 was received for transportation from points in a foreign state to points in a third state, passing through the state of Pennsylvania in course of transit.
