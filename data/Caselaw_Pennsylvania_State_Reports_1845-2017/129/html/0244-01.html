The petition in case No. 7, for revocation of the order to view, was unauthorized by any statute, wholly unknown to the practice in such cases, and a mere nullity. These cases were not simply proceedings to vacate, but proceedings to vacate because of a better location of a new and safe road, to take the place of the old and dangerous grade crossings. The reports are in the exact line of the authority of the viewers. They are not in the alternative. They simply vacated parts of the old roads as useless, and then in effect provided that the old roads should not be closed up till the new way was opened. They had power to do this: Mill Creek Tp. v. Reed, <a href="/pa/29/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="29 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="982839" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0195-01">29 Pa. 195</a>.

In those cases, the contention was over awards of damages. The courts below modified the reports of viewers by conditional orders of confirmation not authorized by the act of assembly, which requires the court either to confirm or withhold confirmation of the report. The cases are not parallel with the ones at bar. It was, however, held by this court in the O’Hara Tp. Road, that where the viewers went beyond their authority as to the imposition of damages, this was not fatal to the report, but should be treated as mere 'surplusage.</p>

Any other finding than the viewers made, would shut up two roads before their place is supplied, and would thus leave the people without any highway.</p>

L. 555, vests in the Courts of Quarter Sessions the fullest discretionary power over proceedings to vacate public roads. From the start to the finish they have full control. Without an exception filed, or an objection made, they may refuse to appoint viewers on a petition for vacation: Newville Road Case, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20176" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 W. 176">8 W. 176</a>.</p>

Independent of the fact that the court had discretionary power, it will be assumed that its action was based upon sufficient reasons. The petition of the objectors set forth moving causes, not mentioned in the opinion of the court, but which it undoubtedly considered legally sound in refusing confirmation. The fatal condition in the reports cannot be dodged by calling it surplusage. It was inserted by the viewers as a vital part of their reports.</p>

Both of these cases were decided on technical grounds, and should not be held binding except where the same or similar technical defects exist. Without adverting to minor differences between those cases and the present, it is sufficient to note the substantial distinction between proceedings to open a road, in the first instance, and those to vacate an existing road, because it has become “ useless, inconvenient or burdensome.” The latter is usually, as in the present case, a proceeding with two branches, the closing of the old way, and the opening of a new one in its stead. It is of practical importance that the first branch should not be proceeded with so far in advance of the second, as to leave the public, even for a brief interval, without any way at all. This inconvenience has been guarded against by the act of 1836 itself, § 24 of which provides that “ whenever the whole or any part of a road shall be changed or supplied, the same shall not be shut up or stopped, until the road laid out to supply the place thereof shall be actually opened and made.”</p>

The finding that the road “ has become useless, dangerous, inconvenient, and burdensome, and ought therefore to be vacated,” is certain and absolute; and the further report that the said vacation shall take effect when the overhead bridge on Burd street shall be ready for use, does no more than identify the new road which is to be substituted for the one vacated, and put into express words the direction as to the time of actual closing, which would otherwise have followed as an implication of law, from the section of the act of 1836 above quoted. This is a matter under the entire control of the court, by withholding or postponing the issue of the order for closing, until satisfactory evidence is presented that the time fixed alike by the report of the viewers, and by the statute, has arrived. There <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>is nothing, therefore, in tins provision of the reports which affects the regularity of the proceedings, or which need prevent the confirmation of the reports, and the making of decrees of vacation of the roads as recommended therein.</p>

The learned judge in setting aside the proceedings put his reasons on the record formally as part of his order, and the case has been argued by counsel for both appellants and appellees, as if the reasons were regularly before us for review. We have assumed, therefore, that the court as well as the parties desired a decision on the case as thus presented. In reversing the orders, therefore, the extent of our decision is that the proceedings are regular on their face, and the reasons assigned on the record for setting them aside are not legally sufficient.
