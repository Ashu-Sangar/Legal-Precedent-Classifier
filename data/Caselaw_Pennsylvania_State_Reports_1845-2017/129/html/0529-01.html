The testator left a widow who died June 24, 1874, and children, some of whom are the plaintiffs herein. After the death of the testator, the family, consisting of the widow and such of the children as were unmarried, remained upon the premises, until after the death of the widow, in 1879. Jesse A. J. Pryer, one of the sons, living upon the farm with the family, was appointed one of the executors. He <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>took possession of the real estate, the personal property and everything, using and disposing of them as his own.

By the second clause of the will, the testator disposes of all the income, improvements and personalty, not disposed of in the first and third clauses. It may be conceded that in the absence of any intention to the contrary, not appearing, the personal property is the primary fund for the payment of legacies, and further, that the waste of, or neglect of the executor to appropriate the proceeds of the personalty to such payments in case of loss, such loss would fall upon and must be borne by the legatees. But taking the will together, I am satisfied that the testator exempted the personal estate and charged the payment of the legacies upon the land; such lien was divested by the sheriff’s sale, and the legatees would have to look to the proceeds of the sale. This being in the Common Pleas, I am of the opinion that to avoid circuity.of action, the Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction.</p>
