The acts of assembly were intended to give jurisdiction to the Common Pleas of Dauphin county only over state officers. We do not see that the act of 1881 has affected the jurisdiction in such a case as the present.

All the laws of the state, pertinent or material to this controversy, are embraced in the following list of statutes: Section 6, act of March 4, 1824, 8 Sm. L. 202; §§ 2-7, act of April 17, 1830, P. L. 387; resolution of March 18, 1840, P. L. 709; act of April 16, 1845, P. L. 532; act of April 22, 1846, P. L. 489; <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>act of April 11, 1862, P. L. 492; act of May 5,1876, P. L. 109. The act of May 4,1841, P. L. 307, contains no provision touching the question in controversy here. From an examination of the acts cited it will appear that from March 4, 1824, until the present time, the law has required the publication in newspapers of the lists of all persons and firms liable for mercantile taxes, in all the cities and counties of the commonwealth.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[247,706,1174,748]]]'>2. The duty of publishing such lists was originally devolved upon the treasurers of the cities and counties, by the act of 1824. The only change made by the resolution of 1840 was to enlarge the number of newspapers in which publication was to be made in Philadelphia, and the learned president judge is in error in saying that it directed the clerk of the Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia county to make that publication. By fair and necessary implication, this duty devolved upon the mercantile appraiser when that office was created. The act of 1845 directed the appointment of such an officer in Philadelphia and Allegheny counties; that he should assess all dealers, make a list of them, give a written or printed notice of the assessment to each person or firm living on the premises, and furnish the city or county treasurer and the auditor general with copies of the list.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[242,1472,1174,808]]]'>3. The provisions of §§ 5-8 of the act of 1845 were extended to the other counties of the state by the act of 1846, which provided that the personal notices, prescribed by § 6 of the act of 1845, should extend only to the city and county of Philadelphia and the cities of Pittsburgh and Allegheny, and that in the other parts of Allegheny county, said in the other counties, the notice should be given by advertisement, etc. It is said that this provision limits the list to be published in Allegheny county, to that of the dealers outside of the cities of Pittsburgh and Allegheny. But no such result was intended. The act certainly gives the appraiser power to order publication in at least two newspapers, and the intent of its provision limiting the personal notice to the cities named, is that dealers outside those cities shall have only the constructive notice by publication, while those in said cities shall have personal notice, in addition thereto, in the case of persons living on the premises.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b522-7" data-blocks='[["BL_522.7",522,[243,2286,1166,95]],["BL_523.1",523,[179,337,1162,646]]]'>4. The act of 1862 strengthens this view. By it the appraiser is required to give a personal notice to each taxable living <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>on the premises. This enactment clearly embraces the whole state, but it does not dispense with the additional notice by publication. Moreover, § 2 expressly allows publication in three newspapers in any city or county, and the act of May 5, 1876, makes provision for the payment therefor. It appears from the defendant’s answers that the attorney general and auditor general assert that publication in three newspapers in Allegheny county is required by law. It will thus be observed that the judgment against the relator not only was upon a question of law not raised by the pleadings, but actually was inconsistent with their concessions. In deciding against us the question raised by himself, we think the learned judge erred. .</p>

The mercantile appraiser is a county officer, and the court below clearly had jurisdiction to coerce him by mandamus : Section 18, act of June 14,1886, P. L. 626. Mandamus is the proper remedy to compel a public officer to perform a public duty: Commonwealth v. Commissioners, <a href="/pa/37/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="37 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="418910" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0237-01">37 Pa. 237</a>; Commonwealth v.

Phila. 23; Commonwealth v. Cochran, 1 S. &amp; R. 473. It is the only remedy for the recovery of salary by a state officer. It lies to compel the payment of money due a public officer from the county treasury, and is the only remedy to compel payment for services rendered a municipality, to compensate for which a specific appropriation has been made by law: High on Extra. Rem., 253, 254.</p>

The law does not authorize the publication of the appraiser’s list within the cities of Pittsburgh and Allegheny. The act of April 16, 1845, P. L. 532, creating the office of mercantile appraiser in Allegheny and Philadelphia counties, does not authorize notice by publication, but provides another mode of notice to be given by the appraiser, and fixes his compensa<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>tion for doing it. By necessary implication it thus repeals the resolution of .March 18, 1840, P. L. 709, authorizing the treasurer to give notice. The list that the appraiser is to prepare under § 1 of the act of 1845, is for the treasurer of the county, as provided by §' 8. The first authority of the appraiser to give notice by publication is by the act of April 22,1846, P. L. 489, but that is clearly limited to the portion of Allegheny county outside the cities of Pittsburgh and Allegheny; to them such an authority was never extended. This construction of the act of 1846 is entirely consistent with § 2, act of April 11, 1862, P. L. 492, and act of May 5, 1876, P. L. 109.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[252,901,1164,899]]]'>2. There is no legal authority for publishing the appraisers’ lists in any portion of the state. The only notice ever directed for the three cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Allegheny, is the personal notice provided for by the act of 1846. Outside of these cities that act directed notice by publication and provided for no further notice. The act of April 11, 1862, P. L. 492, enacted the rule of personal notice for the whole state, as a remedy for the inconvenience resulting from the fact that the publication did not always reach the parties to be affected by it with constructive notice. The remedy thus provided is actual personal notice, in lieu of the constructive notice. Publication, therefore, would not now be notice; and if this be so, why is not the act of 1846 repealed by that of 1862 ? A subsequent affirmative statute, covering the same subject-matter and introducing a new rule as a substitute for that of a former statute, works a repeal thereof: Potter’s Dwarris, 157, and note; Somerset and Stoystown Road, <a href="/pa/74/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="74 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1034690" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0061-01">74 Pa. 61</a>; Johnston’s Est., <a href="/pa/33/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="33 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="988356" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0511-01">33 Pa. 511</a>.</p>

These two acts of 1846 and 1862 cannot stand together; there are not two modes of service. The later act provides the necessary, exclusive, and only mode in which the notice can be served. The former act is therefore repealed: Erie v. Bootz, <a href="/pa/72/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="72 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="434610" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0196-01">72 Pa. 196</a>; Nusser v.

It is true, § 2 of the act of 1862, without requiring publication assumes it to be necessary and limits it. But if not necessary, why should not the limitation fall with the assumption on which it rests ? The acts of June 6,1873, P. L. (1874) 407, and May 5, 1876, P. L. 109, do not direct publication, but rest upon the assumption that it is required by existing laws, which assumption is <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>without foundation, if the act of 1862 repealed that of 1846, For a reply to the assertion of the counsel on the other side that these questions were not raised by the answer, but by the court below, it is necessary only to read the clause in the answer denying the authority of the appraiser to order the publication of his list in the relator’s paper.</p>

The allegation that the papers were dated and some of them delivered and sold on Sunday, was not traversed, but stands an admitted fact in the case. The allegation that it was a Sunday newspaper was traversed and the jury were sworn to try that fact. In their verdict they did not find facts, but simply reached a conclusion. They concluded that the proprietor had made a mistake in calling his paper a Sunday paper (Sonntagsbote meaning in English, Sunday Messenger,) and that they would rectify the mistake by finding that a paper so named, dated on Sunday, in part delivered by carriers and sold on Sunday, and wholly read on Sunday, was not a Sunday paper, simply because it was worked off and delivered to the carriers between 6 and 10 o’clock on Saturday nights. We submit that the question was for the court, and that this is a Sunday newspaper, regardless of what a jury may think upon the subject.</p>
