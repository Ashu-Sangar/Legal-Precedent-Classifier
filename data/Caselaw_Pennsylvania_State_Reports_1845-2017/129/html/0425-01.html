The proceedings therefore were for the assessment of damages in gross for the whole injury, as if the exclusive title and ownership were in Adam Seipel. Now, if there were no question of the statute of limitations barring the right of Barbara Seipel, his wife, I think this amendment ought to be allowed, because it is not changing the cause of action, but it is simply adding the name of an additional party in interest. The husband had an interest in the land as tenant by curtesy initiate, and was the proper petitioner; and it is a case therefore of amending the record by adding another joint party.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b447-7" data-blocks='[["BL_447.7",447,[191,1344,1167,963]]]'>With respect to the statute of limitations, the act of 1713, called the statute of limitations, commonly, does not apply, as decided in the case of the Delaware etc. R.

I incline to think therefore that Barbara Seipel would be precluded from bringing an action or instituting any proceedings for the recovery of damages now, after the lapse of seven years from the building of the road. But whether that be so or not, if the proceeding on the part of the husband was for the whole damage, and the wife’s name was omitted by mistake, the fact that she would be barred by the statute of limitations in bringing a new action, is not conclusive of the court’s right to allow an amendment to the record. I think the purposes of justice require it. I think the omission of the wife was by mistake, and that it is not introducing a new cause of action to simply amend the record by adding the name of the party. The amendment is allowed, and a bill of exceptions is sealed for the defendant.1</p>
