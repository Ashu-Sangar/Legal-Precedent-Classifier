The iron was shipped to plaintiff’s agent and retained by him as collateral security for the payment of the notes. The defendant paid $3,000 on the notes, and received about 125 tons of the iron rails. In August or September, 1887, the plaintiff demanded payment of the balance due on the notes, which was not made. Thereupon the plaintiff, under authority contained in the notes, proceeded to sell the iron in order to1 obtain payment of the money due thereon. In attempting to deliver the iron sold, plaintiff was compelled to cross defendant’s premises, when 475 pieces of the iron were seized by the defendant, who claimed that they had not received the quantity of iron paid for.</p>

It is in form an action of replevin. In reality and substance it is an action to recover a balance claimed to be due on certain notes, and the substantial question in the case is, what amount, if any, is due to the holder of these notes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b259-8" data-blocks='[["BL_259.8",259,[99,1847,1177,452]]]'>The notes have been given in evidence and you will have them with you when you retire to your room. From these notes, and the testimony in the case, it appears that the plaintiffs sold to the defendants certain iron, for which the defendants paid a comparatively small amount of the price in cash, and gave their notes for the balance, and in those notes they provide that the plaintiffs are to hold the iron so sold as collateral security for the payment of the notes. All that appears by the facts and the testimony, and practically is not in dispute.</p>

It is comparatively of little importance. It cannot bo controverted that the iron was taken without the consent of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs complain of the manner in which it was taken, but that is of little consequence in this case. The question for you to determine is, whether, after that iron was taken, there was still as much iron left in possession of the plaintiffs as' was worth, at the price fixed upon it, the amount due on the notes, because, whenever the notes were paid the iron belonged to the defendants. If the defendants paid the notes they had a right to take the iron they owned, but it was subject to the right of the plaintiffs to hold it until the debt was paid.</p>

We have said that the iron belonged to the defendants when it was paid for, as it was only pledged to the plaintiffs. Part of the agreement was that if the notes were not paid when they were due, the plaintiffs had a right to sell the iron and credit the amount. If you believe the testimony that demand was made for the payment of these notes some time before the iron was sold by the plaintiffs, then they had a right to sell it, because the notes upon their face are due on demand ; and therefore, if the payment of the notes was demand ed they became due, and the condition printed in the notes is that if they are not paid when due, the plaintiffs have a right to sell the iron and credit the proceeds on the notes. The plaintiffs claim that they did that and admit that they did sell the iron, except what the defendants took.</p>

If we understand correctly they base that claim partly upon the different prices for the iron.

I believe the defendants claim something like nine hundred dollars. The plaintiffs’ testimony, as we rmderstand it, was that it was something over seven hundred dollars.. The defendants claim to be entitled to credit for that, and the plaintiffs claim that they are not entitled to credit for it, and this is one of the questions to be determined. It appears that some time in April, 1887, an order or letter was directed to the plaintiffs by the defendants, in which they requested the plaintiffs to pay whatever was received from the railroad company to certain other parties. There is nothing on that order to show that it was accepted. There is some evidence in the case that afterwards, in July, one of the plaintiffs was asked whether he had paid that money to the third party, and he said he had not, and that he was holding it as a credit on these margins for the iron. It is testified to by the manager of the plaintiffs that after he received the money from the railroad company he did pay it over to that third party, and the defendants now claim that as he did not pay it over when the order was sent to him, or for so long a time afterwards, and as he said he was holding it on account of this iron transaction, therefore he is not entitled to credit for it in this cause. <em>W </em>e do not think the mere fact of the giving of that order in itself would make the plaintiffs in this case liable to the third party, or would entitle them to a credit in this case, if that were all that was in it. But there is nothing in the way of the jury determining this question, upon the fair rights and equities of the parties. The defendants claim that their rights were fixed on the day they took the iron. But that taking was unlawful in itself, <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>.and could not fix any rights; the defendants could not put the plaintiffs in any worse position by doing that unlawful act, than they were in before; and if it would have been right and fair ■for the defendants to give credit for that payment before this suit was brought, it is right for the jury to give credit for it now.]1 The objection to giving credit for the payment is a strictly technical objection, if in equity it ought to be given.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[251,725,1182,1272]]]'>[You are to determine, however, whether that money was actually paid to the third party, the Rock Hill Iron Company. If the money was not paid, if it has not been paid, and if it is still iu the possession of the plaintiffs, then they are bound to give credit for it on these notes. But if it be a fact that the plaintiffs did pay it over, in the absence of any positive recall ■ of that order on the part of the defendants, then defendants’ debt to the third party is paid; and if the defendants’ debt to the third party has actually been paid by the plaintiffs, there is no legal rule that would prevent the plaintiffs from getting the benefit of that payment in this action. The manager of the plaintiffs testified that it was paid. ■ When he was cross-examined on that point he said he had not seen it paid, but had seen the stub of the check that was drawn for its payment, and had seen the receipt the third party had given for the pay•ment. That is all the evidence of this payment before us, and that is some evidence of payment. The witness being the manager or business man of the plaintiff, is competent to testify as he did. If the jury is satisfied that it is paid, then it ought not to go as a credit on these notes, because it went to •pay a debt of the defendants, and if the plaintiffs are charged with.it here they would have to pay it twice. You are to determine how that matter is; whether or not the money was paid to the third party; and if it was, that amount cannot be credited on these notes.] a</p>
