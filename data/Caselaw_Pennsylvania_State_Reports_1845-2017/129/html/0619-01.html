They had, it seems, three gas wells, with their connections to the works. These wells were for the purpose of supplying the works with fuel, and the connections were made by a line of pipe extending from the works to the different wells. It is alleged, upon the part of Mr. Jennings, that those three wells were lumped.at a value of $10,000, and put in as a part of the capital of Mr. Beale and represented, in the capital that he supplied to the firm, the sum of $10,000; that at a time prior to the making of the contract which they entered into, Mr. Beale had agreed with Mr. Jennings that he would clean out and put in order and condition these different wells at his own expense, and that these wells furnished him with an inducement to enter into the arrangement with Mr. Beale.</p>

It was that kind of property that he would have a right to examine himself. We are free to say to you, he made the bargain for such property with his eyes open. It would be very proper, we do not say that it was a legal obligation in this kind of a case for him to do so, but as a prudent, careful man, he had a right to go and see the condition of those wells before he entered finally into this contract. Whether he did so, or not, will be for the jury, under all the evidence in the case, to determine.</p>

[Some time in the year 1887, while it seems that Mr. Beale was still superintendent for the firm which succeeded the original firm, the railroad company gave notice to the firm, or to Mr Beale, whichever it may be, that they required the gas pipe to be taken up from the old canal along which it appears to have been laid. It does not appear in the evidence how much or how far this gas pipe extended along that old canal. The plaintiff says it extended some distance along the canal. The company, or Mr. Beale, had notice from the railroad company, who wanted to take possession of their ground, that this gas pipe must be removed. It appears that it was removed and taken up, but it does not appear to have been re-laid, so far as the evidence goes, and the evidence is really obscure with reference to this gas line. It is obscure as to what was done with regard to the taking up of the gas line, whether it was by the firm, upon notice given to the firm with regard to the firm’s property, because it was the property of the firm, or whether it was upon notice given individually to Mr. Beale; or, whether the act was the act of Mr. Beale, as his own act, independent of any connection with the firm, or how. It is not clearly stated in the evidence, and you will have to draw your own inference, because I think that this has some bearing in this case. If Mr. Beale was then the official representative of the firm and acted for the firm, and took it off for the firm, and used it as firm property, it might be a question, and a very serious one, whether the individual Beale would afterwards be accountable for his action, if he acted in that capacity as superintendent of the works, he being <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>then the superintendent of the worts. If it was Mr. Beale acting for himself and upon his own responsibility, then there might be a question of his liability over to the firm for whatever he did. That is a question that we submit to the jury. It belongs to thig case, we think, and we suggest it as a matter for your consideration.] 1</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[146,672,1178,813]]]'>This well over in Westmoreland county does not appear to have been cleaned out. Was it because it was an exhausted well, no longer productive of gas? Because, if you find that that was so, the law in that respect would not require of Mr. Beale to do a vain thing, to bring gas out of a well when it was not there; nor do we say to you that the law would impose upon Mr. Beale an assurance to Mr. Jennings, the purchaser, that the gas would continue in any of the wells for any unlimited time. We all understand the uncertainty of the production of a gas well. Sometimes they will do well for months, and probably years, and sometimes their supply will almost suddenly cease. That is a part of your consideration, if you come to consider what the value of these gas wells was, and how they afterwards came to be valued at a less price than they were valued at when Mr. Beale made his transfer to Mr. Jennings. That is a matter for your consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b643-6" data-blocks='[["BL_643.6",643,[149,1492,1174,915]],["BL_644.1",644,[264,358,1175,1628]]]'>Then we say to you, with respect to that, if this gas well were an exhausted gas well, and it were unreasonable to spend money upon its improvement or attempted improvement, it would be a vain thing, and Mr. Beale would not be required to do that. That will be for the jury, under all the facts, to determine. Then if the gas well itself were of no value, the gas fine leading to it would be comparatively valueless, so far as a gas line is concerned, and the gas pipe would be of more value to the firm if they took it up. If not, if they appropriated it to themselves as a firm, it would be lying there extending to a non-productive gas well. I speak of that with reference to the warranty that is pressed before this court as of weight in this case as a matter of defence. We say to you, so far as the purposes of this case are concerned, that if Mr. Beale entered into a warranty for the property that he conveyed to Mr. Jennings, he is bound by that warranty. He must make good whatever he does warrant. Now, then, if he warrants that gas well to be a productive gas well, and to continue as such for <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>any definite period, or for a continued period, lie would be bound by that warranty, so far as the purposes of this case are concerned, and we instruct you in that way. But if he did not do so, and if Mr. Jennings took the gas well with the risks, that any one who is likely to invest in that kind of property ordinarily takes, then he takes the chances of the gas well continuing good or ceasing to be productive, and if it ceases to be productive, then that warranty would not amount to very much. As to that, it would become a matter for the jury to determine, under all the evidence in the case, what is the actual loss by reason of any breach of that warranty to Mr. Jennings, if there was any actual loss. That is a question for the consideration of the jury. The actual loss may not be what the value of the well was at the time of the purchase by Mr. Jennings, or it may not be what its increased value may have been afterwards; but it is the actual damage sustained, taldng into consideration the chances of the continuation of the gas and the necessity of keeping up that gas line. Now, was the taking up of that gas line a loss? Was it a breach of the warranty under the circumstances of the case? You will bear in mind that it is not contradicted that the company did make some improvements, and did do some work on the other two wells. Was this to be an exception? Was Mr. Beale to work at this well and the company to work at the other two ? There is no evidence, we do not see that it was required that Mr. Beale should have had notice, if that was a part of his condition and a part of his agreement to improve these gas works. It was his duty to do so if that was his agreement. But you are to determine, from all the evidence in the case, whether or not that was his agreement, and that part of the evidence which shows that the company, did improve the other two wells, has some bearing upon that question which you will have to consider.</p>
