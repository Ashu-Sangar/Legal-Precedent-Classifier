    <p class="summary" id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[249,809,1174,1520]]]'>It may be stated as a well settled principle in the law of Pennsylvania, that the confession of a judgment to a bona fide creditor, even though it have the effect of giving him a preference over other creditors, is not a fraudulent disposition of an insolvent estate: Siegel v. Chidsey, <a href="/pa/28/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="981577" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0279-01">28 Pa. 279</a>. In the case of Uhler v. Maulfair, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20Pa.%20484" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 Pa. 484">23 Pa. 484</a>, Lewis, J., said: “The principle is now too well settled to require further authority or argument, that so long as a debtor retains dominion over his property, he may prefer one creditor to another, and that such a preference is not fraudulent, either in law or in fact.” It is also well settled that a judgment may be given to indemnify one for damages he may sustain by reason of his becoming surety for another, and in the case of McCann v. Farley, <a href="/pa/26/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="26 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="977219" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0173-01">26 Pa. 173</a>, it was held that “on a judgment entered upon a bond and warrant of attorney for a stated sum, given as indemnity to the plaintiff, execution may issue without a scire facias, suggestion or other proceedings to ascertain the damages.” The authorities, foreign, national and state, show clearly that in regard to the transfer, mortgaging or incumbering of property, with a view to prefer one creditor to another, the law is the same with respect to corporations as individuals. I need not take the time to refer to the numerous authorities of other states cited at the argument on this question. It is. sufficient to say that ever since the case of Dana v. Bank of the U. S., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 223" data-case-ids="478389" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0223-01">5 W. &amp; S. 223</a>,1 do not know that this has been questioned in Pennsylvania. I am of opinion that the principal question, in the present case, is as to whether an insolvent corporation, being indebted to its officers, such officers can give judgments in their own favor, issue executions and thereby obtain a preference over general creditors in the distribution of the proceeds.</p>

In tins state, in the case of Ashhurst’s App., <a href="/pa/60/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="60 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1014412" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0290-01">60 Pa. 290</a>, it was held that “though the law ordinarily frowns upon contracts made by directors of the corporation with themselves, as private persons, such contracts are not necessarily void; but their fairness must be shown.” In that case, Justice Strong says: “ There must be many things which directors can do for their individual benefit, which are binding upon a corporation of which they are directors. If they have advanced money, I cannot doubt they may pay themselves with corporate funds. If they have become liable as sureties for the corporation, they may provide for their indemnity.” In the case of Gordon v. Preston, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.%20385" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 W. 385">1 <em>W. </em>385</a>, one of the questions raised by a creditor of the company was, that the mortgage was illegal because the mortgagees were the president and treasurer of the company, and were present at the meeting of the board when the mortgage was authorized and executed. Gibson, C. J., said, “ that a corporator may sustain the relation of debtor or creditor in regard to the corporation, and in the latter receive a security, is a proposition which requires not the aid of an <em>argument; </em>and here the existence of a meritorious debt is not disputed.”</p>

In Pennsylvania the capital stock, and all property, real or personal, of a corporation, necessary for the full enjoyment and exercise of its franchises, together with its franchises and all moneys due on unpaid subscriptions to its capital stock, constitute a fund for the payment of all its creditors. Such property and franchises may be sold under a writ of fieri facias, and the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale thereof, under the act of April 7, 1870, P. L. 58, are to be distributed amongst all the creditors, as in case of insolvency: Bayard’s App., <a href="/pa/72/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="72 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="434617" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0453-01">72 Pa. 453</a>.

All such property is liable to lien and execution the same as the property of any other debtor: Plymouth R. Co. v. Colwell, <a href="/pa/39/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="39 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="996292" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0337-01">39 Pa. 337</a>. In the case of Fairmount Coal &amp; Iron Co.’s App., 14 W. N. 214, it was decided by the Supreme Court that “ the proceeds arising from a sale, upon execution, of the property of an insolvent corporation, which is not essential to the exercise of its franchises, goes to the execution' creditor, and is not to be distributed among any of the other creditors.” In that ease the auditor found “ that the property sold consisted of the prpducts of the company, and the raw materials used in their manufacture, and was, therefore, not necessary to the exercise of its franchise; that the corporation, at the time the judgments were obtained, was insolvent.” The Supreme Court said: “It is found as a fact that the property of the corporation, which produced this fund, was not necessary to the exercise of its franchise. It was the articles which it produced to sell and the material out of which they were manufactured.” The law as there stated has been repeated through a long line of decisions, ever since the act of 1836, and it is unnecessary to refer to any more of them.</p>

There was, therefore, no fraud in fact. This brings us to the most important and material question to be determined in the case. Was there fraud in law? I would have no difficulty in deciding upon this question, were it not for the case of Hopkins’s App., <a href="/pa/90/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="90 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1065570" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0069-01">90 Pa. 69</a>.....</p>

This court cannot decide the question in the first instance until there is a final hearing and the facts found. It would seem that the insolvency of the company and the knowledge of the officers at the time they instituted their proceedings, are important matters to be considered in determining the case. These are ques<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>tions that are disputed, and must be disposed of. A preliminary injunction is for the purpose of preserving the subject of the controversy in the condition in which it is when the order is made.

    <p class="summary" id="b91-6" data-blocks='[["BL_91.6",91,[166,1016,1171,1372]],["BL_92.1",92,[238,343,1163,200]]]'>The debts due the plaintiff are admitted in defendant’s affidavit and in my opinion the question above mentioned is the only material one in the case. If said judgments are fraudulent in law, as against the plaintiffs, it is difficult to see what remedy they could have, if it is not by a bill in equity. The courts of Common Pleas by virtue of the equity jurisdiction conferred on them by the act of 1836, have supervision and control of corporations, and by the act of 1840, “in all cases over which courts of chancery entertain jurisdiction on the grounds of fraud, accident, mistake or account.” I have come to the conclusion, either to continue the special injunction until final hearing, or modify the decree entered on March 20, 1889, by dissolving the injunction and permitting the sheriff to make a sale of the property, the proceeds of which sale, to be subject to be distributed under the directions of the court. By the latter mode, although, perhaps, irregular, the facts in dispute can be found and perhaps a more speedy determination of the case had than by continuing the injunction or appointing a receiver. The question as to whether the corporation had an existence at the time of the giving of the judgment bonds to the defendants, by reason of the certificate of incorporation not having been recorded in the office for recording of deeds in Union county, can be passed upon hereafter. If both parties can agree within six days from the time of filing this opinion, upon either of the two modes above mentioned, the court will adopt the same, or enter any other decree that may be jointly suggested by them, that will save time and expense. <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>If they do not agree, within that time, I will be obliged to enter such a decree as in my opinion will put the case in such shape as to enable the court to do justice to both parties at some other stage of the proceedings.</p>

It does not appear that the corporation was insolvent at that time, or that there was any intention to collude or commit actual fraud; and I am of the opinion that the mere use of the bond after the supposed insolvency was not a fraud in law. The board was composed of twelve directors, and the said bond was given to secure five of them, who had in good faith assisted the corporation in obtaining money to carry on its operations. If the bond had been executed after the corporation became insolvent, and especially if this was known to the officers in whose favor it was executed, it is probable that the case would be within the spirit of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Hopkins’s Appeal.
