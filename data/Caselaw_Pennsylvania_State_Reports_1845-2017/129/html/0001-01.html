It established one rule of municipal action for future cities, and allowed existing cities to conform to this rule of action. The legislature of 1876 went one step further, and allowed existing cities'to conform, in part only, to this general rule of action. This tended toward uniformity and not diversity of action. No case has met the exact facts, but what is the objection to the provision ? It simply says to existing cities of a class, “You may avail yourself of any or all <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>of the municipal powers and franchises herein granted, by-enacting the proper ordinance.” There is nothing negative or exclusive in the law.</p>

The classification of the act of 1876 having been declared void, there was no fourth or fifth class, or third class, such as that act contemplated, and Meadville never was a city of the third class.

L. 204, it was said by our brother Sterrett, in delivering the opinion of the court: “It has been suggested that such provisions of the classification acts as are not in harmony with the constitution, may' be eliminated without destroying other provisions thereof; but that is no answer to the crowning vice of unnecessary and excessive classification which stands out in bold relief on the face of both acts, and of which nearly all their provisions are predicated. Those acts doubtless contain many wise and wholesome provisions, but they are so interwoven with and dependent on others tliat are unconstitutional and void, that neither of the acts of 1876 or 1887 can be sustained even in part.”</p>
    <p id="b27-5" data-blocks='[["BL_27.5",27,[152,1608,1184,543]]]'>An examination of the sixteenth section of the act of April 11, 1876, shows that it comes directly within the above remark of Justice Sterrett. If it stood alone as an independent section of the act of 1876, and unaffected by the vice of that act, it might be supported. In such case it would be our duty to consider the further question above suggested, whether an ac-' ceptance of a portion only of the act of 1874 would come within the ruling in City of Reading v. Savage. As the mat-, ter stands that question is not reached. We adhere to the ruling in Ayars’s Appeal _and under that decision this lien falls.</p>
    <p id="b27-6" data-blocks='[["BL_27.6",27,[154,2168,1162,199]],["BL_28.1",28,[253,336,1163,704]]]'>It was urged however, that the lien may be sustained without the aid of the act of 1874, and Borough of Grreensburg v. Young, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20Pa.%20280" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="63 Pa. 280">63 Pa. 280</a>, was cited to show that a borough ordinance requiring a lot owner to pay for paving and curbing opposite <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>his lot was valid and reasonable without special legislative authority. That case does not go to the extent of deciding that a lien may be filed without such authority. A lien is strictly the creature, of statute, , and without such authority it cannot “be lawfully pntered. Nor do we think the lien is helped by the act of May 17, 1887, the second section of which provides, inter alia, that “ all taxes heretofore levied in any of the cities of the third, fourth, and fifth classes, in any one year, in amount not exceeding twenty mills on the dollar, and all assessments made in pursuance of the ordinances of such cities, are hereby made valid. Such taxes and assessments may be collected by action of debt, or proceedings by scire facias may be had to collect any liens filed therefor, in a manner similar to proceedings upon mechanics’ claims.”</p>
    <p id="b28-4" data-blocks='[["BL_28.5",28,[250,1047,1165,455]]]'>It will be seen that this act legislates for cities of the third, fourth, and fifth classes. Under the decision in Ayars’s Appeal there are no cities of the fourth and fifth classes. Hence we cannot say that the legislature would have passed the act with the cities of the fourth and fifth classes eliminated. It shows upon its face that it was intended to apply to the three classes. It is so interwoven with illegal classification that we cannot save any portion of it. This view renders it unnecessary to consider any further objections to this act.</p>
    <p id="b28-5" data-blocks='[["BL_28.6",28,[1011,1507,356,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
