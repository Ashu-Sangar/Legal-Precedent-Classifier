The process is twofold: first, puddling, and afterwards finishing. About <em>-g7\ </em>of its capital is invested in dwellings which are reasonably necessary for the use of its employees.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[248,518,1177,251]]]'>3. Upon June 1, 1887, the defendant declared a dividend of fifteen per cent upon 150,000. This settlement is based upon § 4 of the act of 1879, and charges the defendant with a tax of 7£ mills upon a capital stock of 150,000, for the tax year ending the first Monday of November, 1887.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[614,784,437,25]]]'>CONCLUSIONS OB’ LAW.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b382-6" data-blocks='[["BL_382.7",382,[234,828,1191,392]]]'>The defendant is conceded to be a manufacturing corporation, and the only question for decision is, whether that portion of its capital stock invested in dwellings is taxable, notwithstanding § 20, act of July 30, 1885, P. L. 193, which abolishes the tax on manufacturing corporations. The commonwealth asserts that this portion of its stock is not employ- ' ed for manufacturing purposes, and therefore remains liable to taxation under the act of 1879.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b382-7" data-blocks='[["BL_382.8",382,[247,1238,1177,1172]],["BL_383.1",383,[182,373,1170,99]]]'>Difficult questions may arise in this matter of apportionment, but the present case seems to be fairly clear. Clause 7 of § 39 of the corporation act of 1874, P. L. 102, gives power to manufacturing corporations to “ take, hold and convey such real and personal estate as is necessary for the purpose of [their] organization.” This language is in part explained by clause 12, which provides that such corporations “ may from time to time acquire and dispose of real estate, and may construct, have or otherwise dispose of dwellings and other buildings.” This must include dwellings for the use of employees; for a manufacturing corporation is much more likely to need these than any other, and the legislature has thus in effect declared that such dwellings may be necessary for the purposes of its organization. Of course this necessity must be reasonable. In some cases, for example, that of a blast furnace in the mountains remote from towns, the need of dwellings is apparent; while in others, it might perhaps appear that the corporate purpose was not mainly in view, but that the chief object was to make a profit out of the rents. [Each case must stand upon its own facts; but we think the act of 1874 allows a portion of the capital stock of a manufacturing corporation to be put into dwellings which are reasonably necessary for the use of its employees, and that such an investment is carrying out the pur<a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>pose of its organization. While thus invested, the act of 1885 relieves this portion also from the tax now claimed.] 1</p>

The settlement appealed from was based on that dividend.</p>

They are a convenience and advantage both to the company and its employees, and doubtless a profitable investment for the former; but, in principle, the employment of its capital in building houses, for the purpose of leasing the same to its employees, does not differ materially from any other investment- that might be made outside of its- business as a manufacturing corporation. The only question is, whether capital thus employed or invested is within the exemption of the section above quoted. We are of opinion that it is not. In some respects the question is similar to one that was presented in Commonwealth v. Lackawanna I. &amp; C. Co., No. 48 of May Term 1889, in which an opinion has just been filed. In that case, we held that the section in questiqn was intended to operate solely on capital actually employed in manufacturing and not on capital employed in any other business, or pursuit.

Mr. Justice Poet.ee, speaking for this court, said: “ The gas works are clearly exempted, but' the houses do not appear necessary to the performance of the company’s proper work. On the other hand, they are said to have been erected for the accommodation of their workmen. This is a convenience, not a necessity. For anything that appears, these workmen might be able to discharge their duties as satisfactorily if they lived somewhere else.”</p>
