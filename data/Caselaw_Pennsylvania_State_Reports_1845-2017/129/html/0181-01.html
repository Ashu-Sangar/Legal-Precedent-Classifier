The single question before this court is whether the state of Pennsylvania, in imposing, through its courts, upon the Pennsylvania railroad company the liability for consequential damages provided by the state constitution of 1874, violated the provisions of article I., §■ 10, of the constitution of the United States, by impairing the obligations of a previous contract contained in the charter of the railroad company and in the terms of an executed grant or sale of property and franchises, made to it by the state in 1857.

The Pennsylvania constitution of 1874 did not attempt to irqpose upon corporations previously chartered a liability for consequential damages to property. In §§ 1 and 2 of the Schedule, and in §§ 2 and 10 of article XVI., are expressions showing that the framers intended fidelity to the mandates of Federal law, and did not intend or conceive that the constitution would apply to existing corporations, without their own consent, plainly expressed. The provisions of § 8 of article XVI., therefore, ought not by a narrow construction to be applied to such corporations. The argument that because existing municipal corporations are affected by that section, other existing <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>corporations also must be affected, falls, in view of tbe plain thought of the whole article; because no question of contract lights with the state can arise as to municipal corporations.

But, whatever view may be taken of the chartered rights of this company as such, the contract by which in 1857 the railroad company purchased from the state the Philadelphia &amp; Columbia railroad, operates to exempt it from the imposition of liability for consequential damages in connection with branches or extensions of that railroad, for two reasons: (1) The act of May 16,1857, P. L. 519, under which that railroad was sold, provided that the purchaser, if an incorporated company, should hold under the provisions of its charter except as modified by the provisions of the act, and as the charter of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company at that time conferred upon it an immunity from this liability, it is entitled bjr the contract of purchase to the same immunity respecting the Philadelplfia &amp; Columbia railroad; and (2) because, the state not being itself liable for consequential damages, as the owner of said railroad, its grant thereof, with all its rights and privileges therewith connected, passed to the railroad company this exemption.</p>

L. 423, and the constitutional amendment of 1857; and, therefore, the consequential damage clause in the constitution of 1874 could be made to apply to the corporation defendant. And yet the same court had held in 1870 that, notwithstanding the act of 1855 and the amendment of 1857, the state legislature had no control whatever over the charter of this company: Commonwealth v.

Such imposition cannot be sustained as an exercise of police power, for it has nothing to do with the health, morals, comfort or safety of the people; nor as an exercise of the sovereign power of the state to legislate, for the contract, made by the state as a private party, excepted from the legislative powers of the state the right to affect' the value 'of its undertaking. The fallacy of the position that the constitutional provision merely provided a remedy for a pre-existing right, is shown in the opinion of the state court. There is no analogy between this case and cases in which rights of action for a negligent killing have been given by statute. No person or corporation can have a contract or other right to act negligently, and the legislature has the right at all times to impose on corporations damages or penalties for negligence. The right of the state to make such a contract as was entered into here rests on even stronger grounds than contracts conferring exemption from taxation. ' Taxation is a function eminently necessary to the life and growth of the state, and yet it has been held, that, for a proper consideration, the state may contract to exempt from it.

There was no such contract between the state and the defendant, prior to the constitution of 1874, as prevented the subjection of the defendant by that constitution to. the liability for consequential damages arising from its construction of this elevated road in 1880 and 1881. Prior to the constitution of 1874, and under the constitutional provisions existing in Pennsylvania before that time, the Supreme Court of that state had uniformly held that a corporation with such provisions in its charter as those contained in the charter of the defendant, was liable, in exercising the right of eminent domain, to compensate only for property actually taken, and not for a depreciation of adjacent property. The 8th section of article XVI. of the constitution of 1874 was adopted in view of those decisions, and for the purpose of <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>remedying the injury to individual citizens caused by the non-liability of corporations for such consequential damages. Although it may have been the law in respect to the defendant, prior to the constitution of 1874, that under its charter and the statutes in regard to it, it was not liable for such consequential damages, yet there was no contract in that charter, or in any statute in regard to the defendant, prior to the constitution of 1874, that it should always be exempt from such liability, or that the state, by a new constitutional provision, or the legislature, should not have power to impose such liability upon it, in cases which should arise after the exercise of such power. But the defendant took its original charter subject to the general law of the state, and to such changes as might be made in such general law, and subject .to future constitutional provisions or future general legislation, since there was no prior contract with the defendant, exempting it from liability to such future general legislation, in respect of the subject matter involved.</p>

By its terms, it imposes a restraint only upon corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use, and extends the right to compensation, previously existing, for property taken, to compensation for <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>property injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of works, highways, or improvements, made or constructed by such corporations or individuals. Such provision is eminently just, and is intended for the protection of the citizen, the value of whose property may be as effectually destroyed as if it were in fact taken and occupied. The imposition of such a liability is of the same purport as the imposition of a liability for damages for injuries causing death, which result from negligence, upon corporations which had not been previously subjected by their charters to such liability: Boston, Concord &amp; M.
