We have examined with great care, the exceptions filed, together with the general borough laws, and the only one that needs, in our opinion, any consideration is the third. We are assured by counsel, however, that the plot was filed in the prothonotary’s office with the petition, and if the prothonotary neglected to mark the same filed, the petitioners should not be prejudiced thereby. We are not disposed to disregard the request of the bona fide residents and freeholders of the proposed borough, who are, as we have said, unanimous in their request. We see nothing fatal in the exceptions, while an exceptionally intelligent grand jury carefully considered the question and gave the application their approval. [To make the record correct, however, we think the clerk should mark the plot or draft filed nunc pro tunc (according to the fact), as of the time of filing the petition, and we will permit the counsel for the petitioners to certify to the fact.] 3</p>

The exceptions taken in the court below to the incorporation of the borough of Jeannette, and assigned for error here, are without merit. The public notice required by law appears to have been given. The plot or draft referred to was, by some inadvertence, not marked filed at the time it was presented to the court. This omission was cured by the following order: “To make the matter correct, however, we think the clerk should mark the plot or draft filed nunc pro tunc (according to the fact), as of the time of filing the petition, and we will permit the counsel for the petitioners to certify to the fact.”</p>
