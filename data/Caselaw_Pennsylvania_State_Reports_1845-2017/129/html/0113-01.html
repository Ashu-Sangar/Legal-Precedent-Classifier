    <p class="summary" id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[254,709,1172,399]]]'>1. Where a railway train does not stop at a station to which it has agreed to carry a passenger, or does not stop a sufficient time to allow him to alight, it is the duty of the passenger to remain upon the train, and not to attempt to jump off; therefore, even if the train in this case did not stop a sufficient time to allow the plaintiff to leave it, yet he should not have jumped off after it-started, and his doing so was such contributory negligence upon his part as will prevent a recovery in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.7",136,[255,1116,1176,857]]]'>Answer: My answer to that proposition is, that, as a general rule, if a passenger' is about to be carried beyond a point at which he was entitled to get off the train- by reason of the train not stopping, or if the train starts before he has a reasonable time to get off the train, to jump off that train when it has attained any considerable speed or momentum, is an act of carelessness per se which would defeat any man’s right of action, to show that after the train had got under headway, and was going at any considerable rate of speed, he undertook to jump off from the platform. I do not affirm this proposition in the breadth in which it is put to me. I do not say that when a train is just beginning to move, when it is in motion but just starting, if slightly, a passenger would be guilty of contributory negligence by stepping off, under such circumstances as that; but if a train is in motion, under headway, and a passenger attempts to jump off, it is contributory negligence which would defeat his right of recovery.3</p>

If the jury believe that the train had stopped a sufficient time for the plaintiff to leave it, upon the platform where passengers leaving the defendant’s ears usually land,- and then started upon its course, and that the plaintiff then jumped from the platform or steps of the car, he was guilty of contributory negligence, and cannot recover.</p>

In cases like the one before us, such as referred to in the point here, it is for the jury to say whether under the circumstances the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in stepping off the car when it was in motion. My own view of it is that it depends altogether on the speed or rate of motion that the train is under, at the time a passenger attempts to step off. I do not say, if a train has just begun to move, that it is contributory negligence to step off a car; but in all cases it must be left for the jury to say, according to the proof as to how the train was moving at the time the passenger attempts to jump off, — the jury are to determine whether it was contributory negligence in him to get off under the circumstances of that special case.3</p>

That is a fact which the jury must determine under the evidence. You must recollect the plaintiff’s testimony, that is, that he did not jump off the car; while the testimony of the baggage agent is, that he did jump off, and jumped off backwards. That leaves it as a question of fact for the jury to determine; whether the plaintiff did actually jump off or not. If they find that he did not jump off, then these points have no application to the case. If they find that he did jump off, then with the qualification which I have given in my answers, the jury will be governed accordingly.</p>

The testimony on the part of the plaintiff is, that the train stopped from ten to twenty seconds; on the part of the defendant, that it stopped a minute, and that from ten to fifteen passengers, mostly ladies, got off the train, and one or two passengers got on it, while it was at rest. It is contended that upon this evidence the court should have directed a verdict for the defendant upon the ground that no negligence was shown, and the court’s ref us alto do so constitutes the fifth specification of error. We have no hesitation in deciding that this refusal was right, and that it was for the jury to determine upon the whole evidence whether the train stopped a reasonable and proper time to allow its passengers to alight safely.

It did not, in terms, affirm or refuse the point, but it substantially denied any effect to a finding by the jury that the train stopped a sufficient time for the plaintiff to leave it, and that he jumped from it after it had started upon its course; and it declared that in all cases it was for the jury to determine whether it was negligence in a passenger to jump from a moving train, and that this depended altogether upon the speed of the train when he jumped from it. We cannot accept this as a correct statement of the law on the subject to which it relates. If a passenger, in alighting from a railway car, receives an injury, which he alleges was caused by the neglect of the company to stop its train long enough to enable him to leave it safely, he must prove such neglect to the satisfaction of the jury or fail in his action. When, therefore, it is found that sufficient time was .given him to get off in safety; that he did not do so, but remained on the train until it had started upon its course, and then jumped from it and was injured, a clear case of injury arising from his own negligence is presented and he cannot recover. In the present case, as we have seen, it was for the jury to determine whether a sufficient time was allowed the plaintiff to alight from the car before it started on its course, and this involved a consideration of all the circumstances of the case; but if it was ascertained that sufficient time had been given for that purpose, that he did not use it, but remained upon the car until it was in motion, and then jumped from it and was injured, the jury should have been instructed that his own negligence caused <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>the injury and prevented a recovery. This was tbe instruction the defendant’s second point sought but failed to obtain. A sufficient time in such cases means time to alight safely in the use of reasonable diligence and care, and has regard to all the circumstances which affect the act of getting off a train. The third specification of error is sustained.</p>
    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[116,654,1167,504]]]'>We cannot say that it was error to receive the declaration made by the plaintiff immediately after the train passed, and while he lay on the platform where he fell. It was, under the authorities, a part of the res gestse: Tompkins v. Saltmarsh, 14 S. &amp; R. 275; Elkins v. McKean, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20Pa.%20498" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="79 Pa. 498">79 Pa. 498</a>. It differs from the declaration which was rejected in Ogden v. Railroad Co.', as that was made after the removal of the injured party from the place where he was found; in this case, it was made while the party was lying where he fell and an instant after his fall. The first specification of error is not sustained.</p>
