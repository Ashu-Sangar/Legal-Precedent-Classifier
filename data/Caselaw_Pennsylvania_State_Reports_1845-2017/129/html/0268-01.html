He also noted on the docket containing the entry of the consolidated judgment a reference to each of the three original judgments. It is not shown whether he made a like reference on the docket containing each of these to the consolidated judgment, nor what entry was made on the judgment docket.

[The judgment entered on that agreement was held to continue the lien of the original referred to therein. It is true that, so far as appears from the report of the case, the only point argued was whether the failure of the prothonotary to liquidate the .amount of the judgment in the revival was fatal, but the effect of the decision was to declare that the judgment entered on the authority of the paper filed, preserved the continuity of the lien of the original judgment. We do not- think, therefore, that we are at liberty to declare that the judgment entered in this case, on the authority of an agreement identical in its terms, had not the same effect.] 1</p>

It provides for an “ amicable action,” the purpose of which is stated to be “ to revive and continue the lien ” of the three judgments, giving their numbers and term, and it is expressly agreed “ that a judgment be forthwith entered,” and that the three judgments “be revived.” This seems to be ample authority for the consolidation, and it is not vitiated by the mistake in attempting to prescribe the numbers on the docket to which revivals might be entered.] 8</p>
