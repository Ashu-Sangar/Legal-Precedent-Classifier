The defendant put in evidence also the deed of J. H. Hershey and wife, dated August 19, 1884, conveying the lot in controversy to Jonas Brinser.

The claim of the plaintiffs, which stands exactly on the same footing as it would stand if John Anderson, who is dead, were here and bringing the action, is that John Anderson, in 1857. the time is not very definitely fixed, purchased this lot from the heirs of one Snyder ; that Anderson, after purchasing it, went into possession of the lot which at that time was a vacant lot, and built a small house upon it; that Anderson remained in possession of it until his death, about 1883, and died while in possession, leaving the present plaintiffs as his heirs.</p>

The title of the defendant is regular upon its face. Pie has a deed which upon the face of the papers is regular and legal, conveying to him a regular title from the Snyder heirs, and it is agreed on both sides, that the Snyder heirs had a good title. But the plaintiffs say that before the Snyder deed was made to Hershey, who afterwards conveyed to Brinser, the Sliders had already sold the property to Anderson. They have no deed to show for this sale. If they had a deed regularly executed by the heirs of Snyder, that was made in 1857, while the deed of Hershey was made in 1858, they would have a good title, and the fact that a second deed was made, would not affect it at all. They have no deed, however, but they claim that they made the purchase by parol, as it is called in the law; that is to say, by word of mouth, and without any writing or deed.</p>

That is the general rule, and if there were no exceptions to that rule there would be an end to this case at once. The plaintiffs in this case would have no title because they have no deed or writing, and the claim here is not for a lease for three years or under, but an absolute fee simple of the land. That law is called the statute of frauds and perjuries, and it was passed for the purpose of preventing fraud and perjury by allowing persons to claim that they had purchased land by word of mouth or parol. But it was found by experience that persons did sometimes make these conveyances without writing, and therefore there have been exceptions established by the courts to that unbending rule, and there are times in which a man can get a title to land for a greater term than a lease for three years by parol agreement; and it is sufficient in this caseto say that persons may do so, and that where a person, having made a contract by parol, purchases land, and goes into possession of the land purchased, and makes valuable improvements upon it, or, to confine it still further to this case, where a person goes into possession and builds a house upon the property which he purchased by parol, it is, by law, sufficient to take the case out of the statute. But in order to establish it there must be clear proof of certain matters. In the first place there must be proof that the contract was made, and there must be clear and definite proof as to the subject matter of the contract; that is to say, there must be proof of what land it was that was purchased; there must be proof to satisfy a jury clearly as to what the consideration was, and there must be proof to satisfy a jury of the fact that the person who claims to have purchased went into possession of the property under and because of the contract. It is eontended#on the part of the plaintiff that there is not such proof in this case, and that is the first question you are to determine. You are to determine whether in this case there was a parol contract, which you understand to be a contract without writing, by word of mouth, between John Anderson and the Snyders, to purchase this property; that is to say, to purchase the very lot upon which the house about which you have heard was built; because if it was a contract for any other lot it is of no conse<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>quence here.

She speaks of hearing them contracting about the purchase of a lot. She could not give the number of the lot. She spoke of the price being $300. You will have to remember and determine how far she made that statement from her own knowledge, or how far she made it, if she did, simply from hearing her husband speak of it afterwards. The testimony was not very definite upon that point, but she did testify to the fact that the price was to be $300. She testified also as to payments made — one payment she spoke of quite definitely; she spoke of payments being made at other times on account of the purchase; she said, if we remember rightly, that at the other times she did not hear them say that the money was paid on this particular lot. You will have to determine whether or not Anderson, when he paid money from time to time, paid it on account of this purchase. She did not know the amount of the payments at the different times with any great definiteness. She did say that in all $150 had been paid. You will have to determine whether she testified to that from her own knowledge, or from her husband saying so.</p>

In this receipt the lot is designated, and that is the equivalent to a description of the property, because in the absence of any other evidence in the case we have a right to assume that the lots in Middletown are designated by numbers, and that this description, number 258, in the borough of Middletown, designates the lot. If this receipt refers to the payment for the same property that Mrs4 Snyder testified about, or if her testimony refers to the same property that this receipt does, then the lot is sufciently designated and described to make complete the subject matter of the purchase and to show that the lot purchased, if one was purchased, was lot number 258, and we believe the testimony is that that was the lot upon which the house was built. Then, again, you determine with definiteness and certainty what the price was to be for this lot; and a good reason why the jury should be able to find, and why the plaintiffs <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>should satisfy the jury by testimony from which they can find, what the price of the lot was, is because it would not <em>%e </em>fair and equitable to allow the plaintiffs to recover unless they have paid the purchase money, and the jury cannot compel the payment of the purchase money unless they know what it was; therefore it is right and proper that the law should be as it is, that the plaintiffs shall satisfy the jury what the price was.</p>

Was it because John Anderson purchased this lot, and because it was agreed to be sold to him by the owners, that he went into possession ; was that the way he got possession, if he did take possession of it ? If he did, did he build this house upon it ? If all these matters are found satisfactorily; if you can find that a definite . contract was made for the purchase of a definite lot, the identity of which you can ascertain; that the price was fixed; that possession was taken by virtue of that contract; that the house as described by two carpenters was built upon it by Anderson and paid for by him, and that the taxes were paid upon the property by Anderson, or even without that, for the present purpose, then he would get such a title by parol as would take the case out of the statute of frauds, and he would get such a title as would be equivalent to a written deed. The statute of frauds, under these circumstances, would not stand in the way of his title. The fact that he did not get a deed would not prevent the title from passing to him, and if the title did' thus pass to him, then the Snyder heirs would have no title to convey to Hershey, and Hershey’s deed would not be good against the title so acquired.

Some years after that deed was taken by Hershey a lease was taken and entered into by Anderson, in which he rented this property from Hershey. It has been contended upon the part of the plaintiffs that there is something irregular about that lease. They gave some evidence, as you heard, to show that Anderson could not write his name, whereas, it is written on that lease. There has been no evidence, as the counsel avers, that the lease was not read to Anderson or explained to him. That is of no consequence, gentlemen; there is nothing to show that it was not read to him or explained, and therefore we must assume that it was so read and explained to him. And it is contended that the fact that Anderson gave this lease; the fact that by that writing he rented this property from Hershey, shows that he was not the owner of it and estops him now from claiming to be the owner, and we are asked, as a matter of law, to instruct you that that is so. This we do not think we can do, and we leave the question to you to determine, upon all the evidence of the case, what the intention of the parties was in executing that lease ; to determine whether the object of it was, as it would appear upon its face, in the absence of any other facts and circumstances in evidence, that Anderson was to become the lessor of Hershey for the lot to which he otherwise had no title ?</p>

Was the lease made by Hershey so that Hershey might be in a position to in-force the payment of the interest and principal of that $150 from time to time ? If Anderson, in making this lease, and if Hershey in taking the lease, did not intend that Anderson was acknowledging that he had no title to the property, but it was for the purpose of carrying out that arrangement, and of securing the payment of the $150, the giving of the lease would not, as a pure matter of law, prevent Anderson, or his heirs, from setting up a claim of title, and we leave to you to determine what his intention was, from all the facts in the case, in the giving of the lease.</p>

If you find he did not pay it all, it will be your duty to find how much he did pay, and if a balance is due, it will be your duty, by your verdict, to say how much that balance is. If you find that all the $150 was paid, you simply find a verdict for the plaintiffs; but if you find for the plaintiffs, and that all the $150 was not paid, then you find for the plaintiffs and the amount that was paid.</p>

Had it been much less clear, distinct and positive, the court would have been bound to submit it to the jury: Richards v.

A lease does not under all circumstances estop the lessee from claiming title. The real arrangement intended to be made can always be inquired into. All the circumstances show that the deed from the Snyder heirs to Hershev was a mere mortgage to secure the repayment of the money advanced by him for Anderson. The lease, if ever made by Anderson, was not inconsistent with Hershey’s holding the title in this manner: Kunkle v.

It is claimed that Brinser was relieved by the alleged lease from making inquiries of the parties in possession, and that its true purpose cannot be shown as against him.

Both parties rely on this common source of title. The plaintiffs, on the one hand, are the heirs at law of John Anderson, deceased, who they allege, in his lifetime, in the year 1857, purchased the premises under a parol contract from the heirs of John Snyder, then deceased; and their claim is, that this parol contract has been so far in part executed as to render it unjust and inequitable to rescind the same. The defendant, on the other hand, claims under a regularly executed conveyance from the heirs of Snyder to J. ■ Hoffman Hershey, dated November 22, 1858, and under a deed from Hershey to him, dated August 19,1884: he denies that any such parol sale was made, and that if it had been, the defendant purchased without notice of it; and further, that if any such equitable right or title ever existed, it was subsequently abandoned and nullified, by an agreement to take the premises under a lease at a certain yearly rent.</p>

Howard Hershey, purporting to be from the heirs and legal representatives of John Snyder deceased, and from the note made of it in the evidence, it would seem that he' left at least four children and heirs viz.: Washington R.

Snyder to John Anderson, made in the year 1857; the receipt, dated October 22, 1857, taken with the other evidence in the cause, is full and complete on this point. The terms of the contract are, we think, sufficiently shown. The lot is described as No. 258 in the borough of Middletown, which may be regarded perhaps as a proper designation of the boundaries; the consideration was $300, a considerable part of which, if not all, was shown to have been paid; possession was taken immediately after and in pursuance of the purchase, and a dwelling house was erected upon it; the possession was open and notorious, and was continuously maintained for many years, and until legal proceedings were instituted to test the title. But how and by what authority did Washington R. Snyder represent his sisters, in the sale ? Was he their attorney in fact, regularly constituted, or was he their agent by parol merely ? Is there proof that he had authority of any kind or character from them ? He might perhaps enter into a parol contract in respect of his own interest, but how could he without authority bind his sisters ? They were not present; they do not appear to have participated in the sale, or to have approved it after it was made; it does not appear that they received any portion of the purchase money, or indeed that they ever knew any such contract was made, atft least until after their conveyance to Hershey. We are not to presume that Washington R. Snyder had power to sell his sisters’ shares,- simply because he assumed to have it, and if he had not the power, his contract to that effect was of no validity what<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>ever as to them; it was just as if it had never been made, and there is not the slightest proof that any such power existed.</p>

It cannot be expected, perhaps, after tins great lapse of time, that the proof should be as precise as if it related to a recent occurrence, but a person purchasing real property knows, or ought to know, that the law requires the evidence of his title to be in writing; the burden of proof is therefore upon him; the delay, as in this case, is frequently his own fault, and this stringent but statutory rule of evidence will not generally be relaxed in his favor. It was incumbent, therefore, upon the plaintiffs, not only to establish the existence of a contract made by Washington R. Snyder, and the terms of that contract, but also his authority for making the same.</p>

Snyder, to “represent” his sisters in the sale, we come next to consider the question as to the effect of the written agreement, made between Hershey and Anderson on December 30, 1875. It is contended, on part of the defendant, that this writing was an abandonment of any equity Anderson may have acquired under the parol purchase alleged, and that he and his heirs are thereby estopped from claiming any title to the lot. The lease was undoubtedly evidence of abandonment, and was, with all the other evidence in the cause, for the consideration of the jury, but it cannot be set up as an estoppel. Hershey was the holder of the legal title; Anderson had for eighteen years made default in the payment of the purchase money, and it was Hershey’s clear right by an equitable ejectment, at any time to rescind the contract and recover the possession. But he might contract, in the form of a lease or otherwise, with the defaulting vendee for the continuance of his possession, for fixed periods of time, on terms agreed upon, the rent to be applied to the interest or principal of the purchase money. Abandonment includes both the intention to abandon, and the external act by which that intention is carried into effect; intent is of the essence of the act, and therefore the facts are in each particular case for the judge: Clemmins v. Gottshall, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%20330" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="4 Yeates 330">4 Y. 330</a>; <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>Atchison v.

There the owner of an equity of redemption executed a lease of the mortgaged premises to the mortgagee, covenanting to pay to him an annual rent of $24, together with the taxes and repairs. It was argued in that case, as it is in this, on the one hand, that the acceptance of .the lease was a relinquishment of the equity; on the other hand, it was contended that the lease was only a mode adopted for securing the possession for a definite time, and providing for the interest, in the form of rent, and that whether it was or not was for the jury. Chief Justice Gibson, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ The only original thing in the cause, and it is not of difficult solution, is the effect of the lease from one of the defendants to the grantor, under whose title the plaintiff claims, which is said to be a decisive circumstance, either to rebut the alleged mortgage originally, or to dissolve the relation created by it, if it ever existed; and that is a matter of law for the court. But why should the relation of landlord and tenant be thought inconsistent with that of mortgagor and mortgagee. Without it, a mortgagor is an occupant liable to be turned out at a moment’s warning; and it is hard to imagine why a stipulation for a certain term, at a rent equivalent to the interest, may not be reconciled to the intention of the principal contract.”</p>

We think the court was right, therefore, in submitting to the jury, “ whether Hershey took the deed from the Snyders in the interest of Anderson, and to enable Anderson, by paying the $150 on the footing of the lease, to obtain title to the lot.” “ If Anderson in making this lease,” says the learned court, “ and Hershey in taking the lease, did not intend that Anderson was acknowledging that he had no title to the property, but it was for the purpose of carrying out that arrangement and of securing the payment of the $150, the giving of the lease would not, as a pure matter of law, prevent Anderson, or his heirs, from setting up a claim of title; and we leave to you <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>to determine what his intention was, from all the facts in the ease, in the giving of the lease.” There was evidence in the cause from which the jury might well find that Anderson did not intend by the execution of the lease to abandon his title. He seems to have regarded the deed to Hershey as collateral security for the $150 which Hershey advanced in discharge of the purchase money; and Hershey himself, if the testimony of George Anderson and Amanda Harley is believed, regarded the $150 as a loan to Anderson for the purpose stated. Upon the evidence of these witnesses, although there was certainly much countervailing proof, the court' could not do otherwise than submit the question to the jury.</p>

This would seem to be true, unless by the possession of Anderson, Brinser was put upon inquiry as to the title under which the possession was maintained. Anderson was at the time in possession, under the terms of the paper w'hich has been denominated a lease, and if Brinser had actual knowledge of the lease, and had no knowledge of the facts relating to its execution, it is probable, under the ruling of this court in Leach v. Ansbacher, <a href="/pa/55/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="55 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1470625" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0085-01">55 Pa. 85</a>, he might be regarded as an innocent purchaser. “ Nothing in the transaction,” says Mr. Justice Thompson, in the case cited, “ gave the least sign to put the purchaser on inquiry. The possession will, it is admitted ; but when the party is in possession under a lease, the knowledge of the lease dispenses with the inquiry of how the possession is held. That knowledge the agent had, and of the very terms of the lease. That was enough for him; he was not bound to inquire of the tenant in possession if the lease was fair or fraudulent, or whether there was a trust notwithstanding: Sugden on Vendors, 339; Hood v. Fahnestock, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pa.%20474" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="1 Pa. 474">1 Pa. 474</a>.” But there is not the slightest evidence in this case .that Brinser knew of the lease, and we are not to assume a fact that has not been proven. If he had no knowledge of the lease, then, plainly, the possession put him upon inquiry as to the ground of that possession, and he is chargeable constructively with the knowledge of every fact which due and proper inquiry would have brought to light: Leonard’s App., <a href="/pa/94/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="94 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="485733" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0168-01">94 Pa. </a><a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a><a href="/pa/94/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="94 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="485733" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0168-01">168</a>.

When Brinser bought, these plaintiffs who are the heirs of Anderson, were in possession. As heirs they would have no right to the possession because of the lease. Therefore, when Brinser looked at the lease, and also at the fact that these plaintiffs were in possession, he had no legal right to assume before further inquiry that they were in possession because of the lease; and the rule of law is that when a person purchases a title to a property, real estate, from one who is not in possession of the property, when there are other persons in possession, in order to protect himself against any title that those who are in possession may have, he is bound to inquire from them, or to learn in some way, what this title or claim is, else he cannot by purchase cut out any claim they may have.

The testimony fully warranted the jury in finding precedent authority in Washington R. Snyder to make the contract of sale with John Anderson.

That this was fully paid to Hershey by Anderson in his lifetime, is settled by the verdict.

The jury would have been waranted by the testimony in finding that John <em>A </em>nderson never executed this lease. Whether they did so, we have no means of ascertaining. But even if executed by Anderson, it was not inconsistent with the theory of the plaintiffs, nor a bar to their recovery. The opinion delivered by this court, when the case was here before, fully warranted the careful instructions given the jury respecting this alleged lease and the effect to be given to it. The fact that Brinser saw it before he bought, can make no difference. The alleged lessee was not then in possession, but had been dead about a year. Brinser knew this, and it was his duty to inquire of the parties in possession whether they were there under the lease.</p>

Knowledge of the existence of a lease, does not dispense with inquiry of the tenant before purchasing from the landlord. An extension or modification of an existing lease, or a subsequent purchase by the tenant of the landlord’s title, can certainly be enforced against the landlord’s vendee, who has not inquired of the tenant in possession respecting the nature and extent of his claim. It is only where the possessors of property have been given an opportunity to speak and have refused, or given false information, that they are estopped from showing the truth: [citing the same authorities cited under par. 4, argument for defendant in error, in Anderson v.

Snyder to John Anderson, in the year 1857. “ The receipt, dated October 22, 1857,” we then said, “ taken with the other evidence in the cause, is full and complete upon this point; the terms of the contract are, we think, sufficiently shown; the lot is described as No. 258, in the borough of Middle-<a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>town, which may be regarded perhaps as a proper designation of the boundaries; the consideration was $800, a considerable part of which, if not all, was shown to have been paid; possession was taken immediately after and in pursuance of the purchase, and a dwelling house was erected upon it; the possession was open and notorious, and was continuously maintained for many years, and until legal proceedings were instituted to test the title.” The testimony at this trial on that branch of the case is substantially the same as before, and we adhere to the opinion we expressed on that .point at the former hearing. The testimony at the former trial has been supplemented, however, with satisfactory proof that Washington R. Snyder, in this transaction, acted not only for himself, but in the behalf of his sisters, who were the heirs of John Snyder, deceased, and that not only the purchase money paid by Anderson, but the money advanced by Hershey, was divided between the brother and sisters according to their respective interests. There was abundant evidence of the most satisfactory character to this effect, and the fact has been found by the jury.</p>

In view of what was said in our former opinion, we think it is not necessary to enter into any further discussion on this branch of the case.</p>

Anderson died in 1883, and the conveyance by Hershey to Brinser was in 1884. Anderson’s heirs were in the actual possession of the premises in dispute at the time of the conveyance, and it is contended that their possession put Brinser upon inquiry as to the title, in virtue of which that possession was maintained, and that, having failed in this respect, he is affected with notice of that which a proper inquiry would have developed. The rule of law which <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>is thus invoked is settled in a long line of cases, including Jaques v. Weeks, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%20261" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="7 W. 261">7 W. 261</a>; Maul v.

But it is said that Detweiler, who was the agent of Hershey in the transaction between him and Brinser, exhibited to Brinser the writing, in form of a lease by Hershey to Anderson; that the so-called lease was in itself explanatory of the possession, and Brinser was thereby relieved from further inquiry. Leach v. Ansbacher, <a href="/pa/55/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="55 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1470625" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0085-01">55 Pa. 85</a>, is cited in support of this position. When this case was here before we said: “ Anderson was at the time in possession, under the terms of the paper which has been denominated a lease, and if Brinser had actual knowledge of the lease, and had no knowledge of the facts relating to its execution, it is probable under the ruling of this court in Leach v. Ansbacher, <a href="/pa/55/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="55 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1470625" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0085-01">55 Pa. 85</a>, he might be regarded as an innocent purchaser. ‘Nothing in the transaction,5 says Mr. Justice Thompson, in the case cited, ‘ gave the least sign to put the purchaser upon inquiry. The possession will, it is admitted; but when the party is in possession under a lease, the knowledge of the lease dispenses with the inquiry of how the possession is held. That knowledge the agent had, and of the very terms of the lease. That was enough for him; he was not bound to inquire of the tenant in possession if the lease was fair or fraudulent, or whether there was a trust notwithstanding.5 55 But as it did not then appear that Brinser had any knowledge whatever of the lease, the rule suggested in Leach v. Ansbacher, as above, was not considered applicable to the case. We intimated, however, somewhat cautiously and doubtfully, that, if that fact had been established, it was probable “ the ruling laid down in Leach v. Ansbacher might apply.55 Upon a careful examination, however, the doubt which then existed in our mind as to the soundness of this view, has grown into a conviction that it cannot be sustained. The case of Leach v. Ansbacher was, without doubt, rightly decided, but the remarks of the learned Justice, who delivered the opinion quoted above, were not necessary to the decision of that case. In Leach v. Ansbacher it was found as a fact that Ansbacher was an innocent purchaser without notice, and that Leach himself, who had actual knowledge of the whole transaction, not only gave no notice of his claim of title, but assented to and approved of the sale. The <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>same conclusion was irresistible, therefore, on other grounds, and in this sense it may be said that the remarks quoted were not necessary to the decision of the cause. The authorities cited do not declare the principle in support of which they are cited. Neither in Sugden on Vendors, nor in the case of Hood v. Fahnestock, <a href="/pa/1/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="1 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="949903" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0470-01">1 Pa. 470</a>, do we find any such doctrine declared. Indeed, upon a somewhat careful examination of all the cases, we conclude that the language quoted from Leach v. Ansbacher is sustained neither by reason nor authority. Knowledge of. the existence of a lease will, of course, give constructive notice of all its provisions; but, the possession, apart from the lease, we think should be treated as notice of the possessor’s claim of title, whatever that claim may be, for the lease may be but the first of two or more successive rights acquired by the tenant. Whilst in the occupancy, under a lease for years, the tenant may have purchased under articles and entitled himself to an equity; or, indeed, he may have purchased the'legal estate in fee and failed to record his deed. Would it be supposed that a knowledge of the precedent lease would dispense with the duty of inquiry, and entitle a subsequent grantee to the protection of an innocent purchaser ? Or, the lease may have been the instrument of a base fraud; it may have been executed under the false and fraudulent pretence, to an illiterate person, that it was in fact a conveyance or a contract of sale. Would possession afford no protection in such a case? We think it would. In such cases the possession is the possessor’s only reliance, for he may be powerless to put his claim of title upon the record.</p>

Among the cases cited we find Daniels v. Davison, 16 Ves. 249, where it is held that the possession of a tenant, who had taken it under a lease for a term of years, and during the pendency of the lease made a contract with his lessor for the purchase of the reversion, was notice in itself to a subsequent purchaser (the lease being still unexpired), not only of a tenant’s interest under it, but likewise of his equitable title to the estate under his contract for the <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>purchase. To the same effect is Allen v. Anthony, 1 Mer. 287; and our own cases of HotteDstein v. Lerch, supra, and Rowe v. Ream, <a href="/pa/105/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="105 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="454307" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0543-01">supra.</a></p>

He had died two years or more before the sale to Brinser, and his widow and children were in the possession. The term of the lease had expired, and it would not, we think, be presumed in favor of a purchaser, in the absence of proof, that the heirs -were holding over.</p>
