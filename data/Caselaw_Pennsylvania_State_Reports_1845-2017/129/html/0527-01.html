F. Proper, artist, J. F. Overlander and W. G. Mcviewers, who on May 21,1888, filed a report in favor of . road.</p>

But, notwithstanding the expense incurred, it is the duty of the court now to quash the proceedings, if it appears that the viewers, by reason of interest and prejudice, were not qualified to act. The undisputed facts are that the viewers, Overlander and McCain, had signed the petition before it was presented to court, but at the <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>time the petition was presented their names had been erased or taken off. They both testified that they gave consent to have their names stricken off, and, in substance, that this was done for the purpose of being appointed viewers. It is certain those parties would not have been appointed, had the court been aware of the circumstances, and it seems proper that having thus acted their report should be set aside. We do not question the honesty of those viewers. We merely hold, that, taking the circumstances under which their names were taken from the petition and they made viewers into consideration, it would be legally wrong to permit their work to stand.</p>
