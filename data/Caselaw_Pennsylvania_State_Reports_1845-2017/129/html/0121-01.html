If this allegation is proven, what is the proper and adequate redress? An action for possession? Defendants are not in possession. An action for damages? An action for damages would condone the act which the fraud vitiates, because the act must be approved as the basis of the <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>demand' for damages.

That Petery only made two bids, both on the second day, and then only $2.50 and 50 cents; that they were relatives, connected by marriage; that before the deed .was made they had agreed upon a division of the property by dividing the expense of the purchase ; that for this small sum Petery sold what he believed to be valuable property; that though the bargain was made before the deed was delivered, and Boyer paid to the county the price of the deed, yet the name' of the grantee in the deed only showed that Petery was the purchaser, and this was done because Boyer knew, as he testified he did, that a commissioner had no right to buy at this sale; that though the bargain was made between March 22 and April 9, 1884, no deed was executed or delivered until December of that year; that in that deed the consideration was stated to be $25, when in fact it was only $4; that all the writings differ from the truth, and that the motive for this was concealment; that whilst they both swear that a week or more elapsed after the sale, before Boyer acquired any interest, Kimber C. Wilson swears that Boyer was looking up the title two days' after the sale; that Boyer, Petery and Reber contradict each other as to when the request to the treasurer for indulgence to Petery was made; — it is argued that this testimony shows that there was a secret agreement between the defendants, and that this fact, in connection with the inadequate price, are grounds for setting this sale aside.</p>

Nor can I infer this from the other facts which are relied upon by the complainant. The conversation before the sale, so far as this testimony shows, only proves that Petery was interested in making an advantageous purchase, and that Boyer gave him no information or aid. Boyer did secure a privilege for him as a bidder, and he was the only person for whom he did secure that privilege; but the treasurer’s clerk, whose testimony shows it, also swears, that quite a number of other persons had the same privilege accorded to them by other officers connected with the sale. Mr. Wilson’s testimony does not pretend to prove a knowledge of any arrangement before the sale; he testifies that Boyer was claiming an interest soon, a few days after the sale. But as Wilson is not positive as to the time, and as both Petery and Boyer admit that the purchase of Boyer was between March 22d and April 9th, not much seems to be inferable from this fact.</p>

Very shortly after that, and before the deed was paid for or executed, he bargained with Boyer, who was still a county commissioner, and agreed to take him in as a partner on paying one half of the bid and expenses. Petery had then paid his bid, but had not paid for the deed. On strength of this bargain, Boyer paid his own money for the commissioners’ deed to Petery, directed it to be made out, and received the deed. In December following, Petery made a deed to Boyer for an undivided one half of this tract, in pursuance of the ■bargain admittedly made before Petery had received his deed.</p>

His duties as such in reference to this sale were not ended. The deed had not been executed or delivered. He afterwards joined in its execution. In other words, the title was still in the county and remained there until Boyer, by reason of his bargain, paid for the deed, and then as a public officer .and trustee joined in its execution. The property had <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>been struck down to Petery, as tbe highest bidder at a public sale, and he had signed an acknowledgment and contract as purchaser. It may be the fact that the duties that were still to be done by Boyer as commissioner in reference to the sale, were merely formal and unimportant, and not of such a character that they could have aided Petery to any peculiar advantage. This may or may not be so. In the eye of the law this inquiry is unnecessary, and to make it would be to recognize exceptions to the rule, which have not been countenanced by our courts. The courts in these cases do not guess or inquire whether the trustee was or could have been of service in getting some advantage.</p>

But, if this were not so, the prayer of the county for equitable relief in the premises must be sustained, on the ground that, under the evidence produced before the master, the purchase by Boyer and Petery of the tax title in question was fraudulent in point of fact as well as in law.</p>

The sixth assignment of error relates to a matter that was not brought to the attention either of the master or the court below, by any exception; and, if the rule the defendants ask to have applied to plaintiff be correct, then this matter of the failure of the county to offer Petery and Boyer the four dollars and a half which they have paid for their alleged title to the C. North tract cannot he considered upon this appeal. But plaintiff apprehends that in view of the fact, that the county is able to refund this money, the decree asked for will not be denied, but modified, if necessary, so that no injustice be done. The rule in equity is that an ability to refund, which can be enforced by a decree, is all that is necessary.</p>

Tbe questions now raised, relate to the legal effect of these facts. It appears that in 1884, Boyer, one of the appellants, was a member of the board of county commissioners of Schuylkill county. In March of that year the commissioners sold at public sale a number of tracts of land, which had been struck down to the county at treasurers’ sales in previous years because of the non-payment of taxes. At this sale, Petery, the other appellant, bid upon two lots, which were struck down to him, and he paid his bids, and took a receipt therefor. A few days later, and before the commissioners had executed a deed to him for the lands so purchased, he sold an undivided one half of both lots to Boyer. When the deed to Petery was afterwards executed, Boyer joined with the other members of the board in its execution. In the following December, Petery made and delivered his deed to Boyer for the undivided one half of the lots, in pursuance of the verbal arrangement made soon after the public sale. At the time of his purchase Petery was a good-faith purchaser as the master distinctly finds, having no contract or arrangement with Boyer in regard to his purchases, but buying for himself. The master further finds that the subsequent sale of the one half interest to Boyer did no wrong to the county, and brought no advantage to himself, orto Boyer; and. that he occupied no relation of trust or confidence towards the county out of which a duty to account could arise. Upon these facts the master, nevertheless, recommended, and the court below made, a decree declaring the sale to Petery null and void and requiring him to deliver up his deed from the commissioners for both lots, for cancellation. Do the facts found justify the decree made ? The master discusses this question by considering three subordinate ones, which he states as follows:</p>
    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[257,1954,1169,145]]]'>1. Assuming the facts to be found as stated in the bill, is the remedy at law adequate, and should the bill be dismissed as an ejectment bill ?</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.6",156,[257,2108,1167,90]]]'>2. Have the present commissioners, or those who filed this bill, sufficient interest to maintain the suit?</p>
    <p id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[303,2210,1065,42]]]'>3. Was the purchase by Boyer fraudulent in law or fact?</p>
    <p id="b156-7" data-blocks='[["BL_156.8",156,[260,2261,1166,143]],["BL_157.1",157,[120,369,1176,558]]]'>We think he was right in answering the first and second questions as he reported. The remedy of the county against its officer was, upon its own presentment of its case in the bill, <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>within the jurisdiction of the equity courts; and the commissioners in office when the bill was filed were the proper parties to move in this, as in any other case in which.the county was interested. The third question he answers by saying that Boyer was not guilty of any fraud in fact, but was guilty of fraud in law, because he was a county commissioner when the public sales were made, and could not acquire an interest in land sold by the eoúnty before the deeds were executed and delivered to the purchaser. The master holds that such conduct on the part of Boyer is against public policy, and for that reason his purchase from Petery was a fraud in law.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[120,935,1176,1479]],["BL_158.1",158,[256,353,1170,957]]]'>Let us. concede, for the sake of the argument, that .the premises justify the conclusion reached by the master, that Boyer’s purchase was a fraud in law, and that his principal, the county of Schuylkill, can require him to account for his profits, or even to turn over his title, how is Petery involved in the consequences of Boyer’s conduct ? No fraud, whether in fact or law, is charged to him by the findings of the master. The rule of public policy which affected Boyer does not reach Petery. It is conceded that he was a good-faith purchaser; that he was in no relation of trust towards the county; that his sale of the one half to Boyer did no wrong to the county, and brought no advantage to him; yet the decree adjudges his deeds to be null and void, and orders them to be delivered up for cancellation. The argument seems to be that, because Boyer can take no valid title from Petery to the one half of the lands purchased from him, therefore Petery lost the title to the other, which he bought fairly, and in good faith, from the county. The master states it thus: “ This [the voidable character of the deed to Petery] follows, whether any wrong was done or not, and whether Boyer or Petery gained undue advantage or not. The county’s demand that the sale shall not stand is sufficient reason for setting it aside. Nor does it help the case any that Petery, at the time of his bid, had no relation of trust that would prevent his acquiring title. He is charged with a knowledge of the law; and, having entered into a contract which 'brought his rights under the condemnation of the policy of the law, he must suffer the loss.” It is fair to assume that the “policy of the law,” to which the master here refers, is the rule of policy which he holds excludes a county commissioner <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>from becoming a purchaser at a public sale for taxes, and from taking title at private sale from one who is not excluded, but who may lawfully buy at such public sale. It is clear that the contract which the master holds has “ brought his rights under the condemnation of the policy of the law,” is the contract to sell the one half of his valid title to Boyer. The conclusion is thus evident that the master recommended a decree that should take away Petery’s title because he sold an interest in his lands to one who could not hold it as against his principal, the county of Schuylkill. Because of Boyer’s legal fraud, Petery’s title is swept away from him. Because Boyer, being a county commissioner, is held to be a trustee for the county, Petery, who is not a county commissioner, and who holds no relation of trust to the county whatever, is ordered to deliver up his deeds for cancellation. This is a non sequitur. The facts found do not warrant the decree. Whether Boyer must account to the county of Schuylkill, and may be required to convey his undivided one half of the lands in controversy, upon a proper bill filed for that purpose, is not now before us.</p>
