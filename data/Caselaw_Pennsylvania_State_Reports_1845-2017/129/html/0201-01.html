A man’s security for his property rests upon his title, and it is of the highest importance to us all that titles to real estate should be carefully guarded, aud sljpuld be difficult to overthrow by word of mouth. That is the policy in most states. It is the policy in Pennsylvania, and it is a policy which we must see enforced. There is a rule which our court has laid down to be applied to testimony of that kind, when it attacks a record, and it is substantially this : When a defendant sets up, as the defendant in this case does, that he claims to be the owner of <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>a property because of what is called a resulting trust; that is, because he advanced the money to pay for the property, it is necessary for him to mate out that defence by evidence that is clear, precise, and reasonably certain. [It is quite a high quality of evidence that is required.] 3 As our courts have repeatedly said, it is something more than testimony balanced, or leaning a little on his side. The testimony before you must be clear and precise ; it must be reasonably certain, so that if it leaves the jury in a fair state of doubt, the defendant has failed, and the written or record title must prevail.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[263,861,1186,1331]]]'>Now, applying these principles, and they are the only ones that apply in the case, as I think, you must solve this question: Here is a record title which is attacked by Thomas Hoover. He declares that there was a promise or agreement between his brother and himself before the partition, that Elias was to take the property for Thomas’s benefit; and the reason was, as he says, specified to be because Thomas was not fit to take care of his own business. In pursuance of that agreement he goes on to say that the property was so taken, and Elias had it adjudged to him, and that afterwards some assignment was made to Elias of Thomas’s interest in the estate, which was afterwards used by Elias in settlement for the property. Now, the jury will have to determine from all the evidence how these facts are. Elias denies those statements entirely, and says there was no such arrangement. He says that he was willing his brother should have the property if he paid him, and that he is still willing, and that that was the only arrangement; that he and Thomas had had several conversations upon the subject, and that Thomas finally said he might do as he pleased about it, and that he, Elias, finally took it for himself and nobody else. His explanation of the assignment is that it was made as payment or security for a debt of five hundred dollars, and also as a fair recompense for keeping Thomas and his family for two years, while Thomas was unable to work. That is his side of the question, and it is corroborated to some extent, at least, by the form and contents of the assignment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.6",224,[263,2200,1179,198]],["BL_225.1",225,[100,358,1184,654]]]'>That is the case. The veracity of some of the witnesses is attacked, and the jury must determine how much weight is to be given their testimony. Whether or not it has been seriously attacked, is a matter for the jury to determine. If they cannot <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>rely upon the testimony that is attacked, it must consequently be thrown out. On another proceeding, when it was to the interest of Thomas to support the assignment, his testimony was in favor of it; and now it is argued that when it is to his interest to attack the assignment, he attacks it. , The jury must determine this question, and what bearing it has upon the degree of reliance to be placed upon Thomas’s testimony in this case. As I said, if the defendant has not clearly made out his defence the record title of the plaintiff must prevail. On the other hand, if the defendant has satisfied -your minds by clear, precise and reasonably certain testimony, that his defence is as he states it, and as I have outlined it, he is entitled to a verdict.....</p>
