So far as you are concerned in this case, the statute under which these defendants are prosecuted is as much violated by selling by the gallon at the distillery, as by selling in Somerset, Rock-wood, Garrett, Meyersdale, or any other place. A sale made by either of the defendants, and a delivery of the whiskey at Meyersdale, and receiving the money for it there, is selling at Meyersdale. A sale and delivery C. O. D. at Somerset or Rockwood, or Meyersdale, would be a sale at each of these places.

He was duly appraised and returned as a distiller by the appraiser of mercantile taxes for that year, and on May 1, 1888, he paid for and received from the county treasurer a distiller’s license, which he claims authorized him to distil whiskey, and sell the same in quantities not less than a gallon, for one year from that date. At September sessions of same year, the constable of Larimer township made return to the proper court that appellant was selling intoxicating liquors, and claimed the right to do so by virtue of a license from the county treasurer; that “ if said license was lawful he was selling by authority of law; but if not, he was selling in violation of law.” On that return he was indicted, convicted, -and sentenced under the first clause of § 15 of the act of May 13,1887. From that sentence he has appealed to this court, and contends that the learned judge of the Quarter Sessions erred in holding that the treasurer’s license did not authorize him to sell by the gallon, either at his distillery or elsewhere, and, if he did so, he was guilty of selling without license in violation of the act above mentioned, etc.</p>

The act is entitled, “ An act to restrain and regulate the sale of vinous and spirituous, malt, or brewed liquors.” The title is sufficiently comprehensive to include a general prohibition of all sales without a license. The language of the first clause of the fifteenth section is: “ Any person who shall hereafter be convicted of selling or offering for sale any vinous, spirituous, malt, or brewed liquors, or any admixture thereof, without a license, shall be sentenced,” etc.</p>

The view we have taken of the main question renders it unnecessary to consider that or any of the questions arising under the remaining specifications of error. There appears to be nothing in the record that would justify us in reversing the judgment of the court below.</p>
