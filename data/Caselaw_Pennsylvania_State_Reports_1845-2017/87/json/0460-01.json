No amendment had been made, if indeed any could be made, after the expiration of the six months allowed for filing the claim. The scire facias answers as a statement of-claim, and takes the place of a declaration, and being for erection and construction presented a claim for original erection. The evidence for materials furnished was for the repairs of a house already built. It is evident the allegata and probata did not agree; non constat that the plaintiff had not a claim for each \u2014 one for construction and the other for repair.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Rynd, for use, &c., versus Bakewell and Reed.\n1. The variance is fatal, where a mechanic\u2019s lien is,filed \u2018\u2018 for materials furnished for the erection and construction of buildings,\u201d and the evidence shows they were for \u201c repairs.\u201d\n2. The scire facias upon a mechanic\u2019s lien answers as a statement of claim and takes the place of a declaration.\nOctober 9th 1878.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Woodward and Trunkev, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term 1878, No. 201.\nScire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien issued by B. E. Rynd, for use of J. T. Stockdale, against Benjamin Bakewell, owner, and William Reed, contractor.\nThe affidavit of claim was \u201c for shingles .furnished in and about the repairing or alteration of the buildings as described in said lien,\u201d and in the affidavit of defence, it was averred, \u201c that the houses mentioned in said lien were constructed over twenty years ago, and not about the time of furnishing the material.\u201d At the trial, before Bailey, A. L. J., the evidence of plaintiff showing that the materials were furnished for repairs, the defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground,\n1. That there is a fatal vai'iance between the claim and scire facias in this case and the evidence offered to sustain it. The claim is for materials furnished for and about the erection and construction of certain buildings; the proof, so far as it goes, is that materials were furnished for repairs.\n2. That more than six months having elapsed since the time the materials are alleged to have been furnished, the claim filed cannot be amended, and the plaintiff must stand on the claim as filed, and has failed to prove that any materials were furnished for or about the erection or construction of the building mentioned in the scire facias.\nThe court granted a nonsuit and subsequently refused to take it off, which action of the court was assigned for error by the plaintiff, who took this writ.\nJR. A. JBalph, for plaintiff in error.\nIt is not necessary to state how the material was used, whether as a repair or otherwise; nor need the day be proved as alleged: Pittsburgh\u2019s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 142; Hillary v. Pollock, 1 Harris 186; McCay\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 125; Haviland v. Pratt, 1 Phila. R. 364; Dreisbach v. Keeler, 2 Barr 77; Fourth Baptist Church v. Trout, 4 Casey 153. Unless the claim is totally defective in giving information to those making searches for encumbrances, the question is for the jury on the scire facias: McClintock et al. v. Rush, 13 P. F. Smith 203 ; Ewing v. Barras, 4 W. & S. 467.\nMalcolm Hay, for defendants in error.\nOctober 14th 1878,"
