It was admitted that notice of the assessment was duly received and its payment neglected by plaintiffs. Subsequently the property covered by the insurance was destroyed by fire, and immediately thereafter the plaintiffs offered to pay the assessment, but the company declined to receive it. The plaintiffs then brought suit to recover the amount of the policy. The assessment yielded a sum equal to twice the amount of the indebtedness of the company. At the trial the plaintiffs called a witness who testified that this excess was so assessed in anticipation of future losses. The plaintiffs contended that this assessment was invalid and that their policy was not forfeited nor suspended by their neglect to pay it.

The conduct of the plaintiffs, in this respect, is palpably inexcusable and without justification, and cannot and should not shield them from the consequences of their own default and neglect. They were members of a mutual company whose board of managers made an'excessive assessment; surely they had a remedy; it was their duty to have it corrected, to prevent its collection from their fellow members, at least to have spoken. Can it now be said, in equity or in fair dealing, when their company, by their representatives have collected it from their fellow members and appropriated it, without objection or complaint, in the face of an accepted legal notice and demand?

Indeed the latter contains no more than is necessarily implied in the former, for the expenses of the company must be borne by its members. They are, as members, subject to liabilities and entitled to privileges.

The managers may exercise a reasonable discretion in fixing the amount to be raised, for the charter must be construed in reference to its practical working. The actual sum required can be ascertained; but as expense must be incurred in the collection and loss be sustained in consequence of insolvency of members, proper allowances may be made for failures likely to result from these and other causes, and if the allowances are reasonable in amount and consistent with good faith on the part of the managers, they will not vitiate the assessment. But if these reasonable limits are disregarded and transcended, purposely or by culpable carelessness, the assessment is illegal and void: Jones <em>v. </em>Sissor, <a href="/mass/72/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="6 Gray 288" data-case-ids="1994733" data-case-paths="/mass/72/0288-01">6 Gray 288</a>; Peoples’ Eq.

They were bound by the assessment, unless they can show fraud or gross mistake. The presumption is that it was properly made : Hummel &amp; Co. ’s Appeal, 28 P. F. Smith 320. To overcome that presumption, the plaintiffs called J. H. Miller, who testified that assessment No. 5 realized, after deducting expenses of collection, $4950.34; that the liability of the company at the time it was ordered was $2305.48; and that the difference, $2644.86, was in anticipation of future losses that might occur. That testimony should have been submitted to the jury, with instructions that if they found the addition to the sum actually needed, was levied by the managers for the purpose of accumulating a fund for payment of future losses, they exceeded their authority and no member was bound to pay the assessment. Were there no direct proof of actual <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>intent to violate the charter, the evidence showing the large sum netted, beyond that required and authorized, should have been submitted with proper instructions. A positive intent to violate is a fraud; and heedlessly levying a large and unreasonable sum in violation of the charter is a gross mistake, affecting the members as if a fraud. It is no part of the contract that members shall pay pro rata, into a fund for payment of losses when they shall occur, and which may not occur till after their membership ceases. The assured contracted to pay assessments for losses after they occur. Simple excess arising from error of judgment, where the managers acted honestly and prudently, wmuld not vitiate the assessment.
