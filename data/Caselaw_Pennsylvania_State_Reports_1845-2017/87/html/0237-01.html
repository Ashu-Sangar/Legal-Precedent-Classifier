And further, it is the. opinion of the prothonotary, on examination of the authorities and old equity fee-bill cited, that the right of the defendant to costs for <em>drawing </em>his demurrer, if it ever existed under the practice in this county, is abrogated by the adoption of the new rules in equity practice of May 27th 1865. Prior to the adoption of these rules, as I understand it, the proceedings were filed in writing, and the party was allowed his costs for <em>drawing </em>them; but now the answer, &amp;c., are required by the new rules to be printed, and the party is to be allowed his costs for printing, instead of drawing answer, &amp;c. If this view of the case is correct, he would not be allowed for both printing and drawing his papers. Rule No. 14, mentioned, allows the costs of <em>printing, </em>and therefore costs taxed for <em>drawing </em>are stricken off. The item of $109 for paper-book is not allowed. No rule or authority under which it could be allowed was brought to the attention of the prothonotary, and it was principally claimed by defendant’s counsel, before the prothonotary, as an item allowable, not under any rule or authority, but in the discretion of the court, which discretion the prothonotary does not think he has the right to exercise.”</p>

The act of May 4th 1864, Purd. Dig. 601, makes it the duty of the judges of the District Courts and Courts of Common Pleas, to establish tariffs of fees in equity proceedings. This gave them a discretionary power as to costs in equity. No general tariff or fee-bill in equity was ever adopted by the judges of the Common Pleas of Huntingdon county, but the discretion vested in them was exercised in each particular case as it arose. That discretionary power was exercised in this case, and its exercise is not reviewable here.

It was not until 1857 the equity jurisdiction was extended to the remainder of the state. The act declared that the Courts of Common Pleas in the several counties, in addition to the powers and jurisdictions then vested in them, should have “ the same chancery powers and jurisdictions which were then by law vested in the Court of Common Pleas or District Court of the city and county of Philadelphia.” This did not carry the <em>rules </em>of these courts into other counties, but merely the same powers and jurisdictions, among which was the <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>power under the general law to make rules of court regulating the taking of fees.
