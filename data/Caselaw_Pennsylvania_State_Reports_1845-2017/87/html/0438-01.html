He found, as facts, that McKinley, who was engaged in selling the machines of the plaintiff, had leased the premises for which the rent was due and on which the distress was made in his own name, and occupied them for the purposes of his business. Before the referee, as found by him, a general agent of the plaintiff testified: “ That the property distrained was that of the plaintiff; that it was simply placed in the hands of McKinley to sell on commission, and that the plaintiff had nothing to do with the renting of the store by McKinley; that McKinley was to sell-for the company for thirty per cent, of each sale, the company having the right to reject the sales; that the company paid him $10 when a sale was accepted, and the balance when the company had received a certain amount; that the property distrained was worth $630 to plaintiff.</p>

The machines were certainly not in a warehouse on storage, nor were they in McKinley’s- possession as an artisan, like cloth in a tailor’s shop, &amp;c., nor was McKinley a factor in any sense, as between himself and the landlord or the public at large. It is true he may have received the machines from the plaintiff to sell for a certain percentage on the amount of sales as his compensation, but he was not, in the usual acceptance of the term, a commission merchant. It may have been known to the plaintiff, but it was not known to his customers, to those who bought machines of him, or to the public, or even to his landlord, the defendant, that he held the property on commission. He appeared to hold it as owner, and in that respect this case differs greatly from all those mentioned as exceptions to the general rule.</p>

As Chief Justice Gibson has said: “ There is little reason to doubt that the exceptions will, in the end, eat out the rule.” It is not a subject upon which it would be wise to draw refined distinctions. It was settled in Brown <em>v. </em>Sims, 17 S. &amp; R. <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>188, that goods on storage were exempt, though the business of the tenant was not exclusively that of a warehouseman. Certainly a man may safely intrust his cattle to a farmer to agist, who raises his own beasts for the drove or the market. Nor is there any reason why a similar principle should not be applied to the case of goods intrusted to an agent to be sold on commission. It is notoriously the usage for merchants — not holding themselves out as commission merchants — to receive and sell goods in that way. In the particular case before us it would seem reasonable to infer that the products of sewing machine companies, the machines themselves being known by the name of the manufacturers, are usually sold by these agents on commission. There was enough to put the landlord on inquiry if notice was necessary. The broad principle which governs the case has been succinctly and happily expressed by our brother Mercur, in Karns <em>v. </em>McKinney, 24 P. F. Smith 390. “ The principle,” he says, <em>“ </em>covering these cases during the tenancy, except when the goods are in the custody of the law, is this: Where the tenant, in the course of his business, is necessarily put in possession of the property of those with whom he deals or of those who employ him, such property, although on the demised premises, is not liable to distress for rent due thpreon from the tenant.”</p>
