The conveyance had been made on an exchange of lands between the parties. On the farm conveyed by the appellant was charged a right of dower, amounting to $1334. On a large body of lands of which the mill property, conveyed by Emerick to Mrs. Stephen, formed a part, he had previously given to one Long a mortgage for $4100. In the exchange the appellants were to either give Long a mortgage for the $1334 or pay him that sum, so as to secure Emerick against the payment of the same, and Emerick was to remove the residue of said mortgage. Neither party fulfilled the contract in relation to the mortgage. Long proceeded on his mortgage and sold not only the mill property conveyed to Mrs. Stephen, but also the other lands which it covered, retained by Emerick. Having thus lost the mill property which she acquired from Emerick, she now seeks to enforce a reconveyance of the farm which she conveyed to him. -</p>

In the former, the consideration for the conveyance of the land had wholly failed, through no fault of the party asking to rescind the contract; the latter was where the obligation given for the conveyance was void, and each party could be restored to his former rights. In the case at bar, there was not, at the time of the exchange, any defect <em>in the title </em>to the mill property; but merely a pecuniary encumbrance on it: Tiernan <em>et al. v. </em>Roland <em>et </em>al., 3 Id. 441. The appellants had no right to ask for a rescission on the ground of encumbrance, unless they first discharged, or showed a willingness to discharge, that portion of the encumbrance obligatory on them to discharge: Irvin <em>v. </em>Bleakley, 17 P. F. Smith 24. The learned judge was right in dismissing the bill.</p>
