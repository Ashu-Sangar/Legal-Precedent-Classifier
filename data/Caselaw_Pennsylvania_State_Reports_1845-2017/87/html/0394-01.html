The stock itself was at its par value for the $5000, while its market value was but about $1400. Had the plaintiff sold the stock without notice to or from the defendant, it might have raised a serious question as to the plaintiff’s liability for the sacrifice. It was in the power of the defendant to have caused a sale by the plaintiff at any time, or else to hold the stock at his own risk. Judgment affirmed.</p>
