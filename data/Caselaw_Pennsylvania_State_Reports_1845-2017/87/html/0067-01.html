On December 7th 1876, the two sons of decedent, William II. and Isaac N. Foster, and his attorney, Charles S. Minor, appeared before the register of wills of Wayne county, and alleging that the will of said decedent had been lost, exhibited a paper which had been reproduced from notes of instruction given to said Minor by decedent, from which said lost will had been drawn, and asked that said paper as thus reproduced should be admitted to probate. The register admitted the paper to probate as the will of said decedent, whereupon several of his children appealed to the Orphans’ Court. An examiner was appointed by said court, before whom Minor testified that he had drawn six wills for decedent, dated respectively in 1861, 1862, 1865, 1867, 1870 and 1875; that decedent came to him with his first will in 1860, and that whenever a new will was drawn the old one was always left with witness and was never cancelled until after the new one was executed ; that decedent had frequently stated to witness that it was his wish to make a disposition of his property by will for the reason that twro of his sons had assisted him in acquiring it; that the reproduced will was made up from memoranda in the handwriting of the decedent, and from which his last will had been drawn.</p>

You know what note I mean.’ I answered I did, and mentioned the note. ‘You mean the Isaac Ward note.’ Father said, ‘ As my will is, I don’t know but what William can lay claim to that note. I don’t want him to do it, and don’t think he will.’ I replied to him that we had better see William. He then said that he wanted to see Mr. Minor, William and myself together. ‘ Mr. Minor knows all about my matters and wishes, and in my will I have left him sole arbitrator of all matters of differences.’ Father was at this time suffering a good deal of pain ; he was physically weak ; his mind was active and good, no doubt about it; he was undressed and in bed.

The granting of an issue of fact is not a matter of right, but rests in the sound discretion of the court, and, unless the evidence is contradictory upon material points, it is clearly the duty of the court, taking into consideration the delay and expense attending <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>it, to refuse such issue: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Bunn, 21 P. F. Smith 412; Graham’s Appeal, 11 Id. 45, and Wikoff’s Appeal, 3 Harris 281. There are disclosed by the evidence some contradictions of witnesses, but it does not seem to us that they are upon material points, but are different recollections of conversations which were had after the death of decedent and after probate of the paper, rather than facts which would materially affect the real questions presented in the case. We therefore conclude that a reference to a jury is unnecessary. The fact, that Isaac P. Foster made a will on or about the 5th of June 1875, which was written by C. S. Minor, Esq., under the instructions of the testator, mainly in writing, is established and not controverted by the evidence. Decedent died at his own house, surrounded by his family, on the 18th day of November 1876, after an illness of less than a week. The will had been delivered to or left with the testator by Mr. Minor, at the time of his execution of it. After his death diligent search for the will was made by various members of his family, but no will was found. These facts raise a presumption, that the testator destroyed his will <em>animo revoeandi: </em>Greenl. on Evidence 688 and note; 1 Redfield on Wills 331; Jarman on Wills 231, and <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Am.%20Lead.%20Cas.%20510" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Am.

But these are to to be distinguished, we think, from the acts and declarations of a testator tending to show and showing his conviction and understanding, that he has a will in existence at the time of his decease. , If the will was destroyed or lost without the agency of the testator, it does not cease to be his will, provided its contents can be sufficiently proven.</p>

That he made provisions in his will for his granddaughter, Harriet J. Weston, who for some six or seven years had waited upon and taken care of himself and an infirm and enfeebled grandmother, and without such will this granddaughter would have no portion of his estate. That he said to his son-in-law, Luther M.

That October 12th 1876, a month or so before his death, he spoke to Mr. Minor on the same subject, and when advised that a codicil would be sufficieut for that, said to him ‘ that when he felt able he would call and have it done,’ and if he should die without doing it, he instructed Mr. Minor to see that his executors did as he desired in that matter.

That he spoke to William and Isaac as to his son James and the provision of his will. Told Isaac that James wanted him to release liens he had on James’s property in Ohio, but he didn’t want to do it, as it would oblige him to re-write his will.

That the same day, and after the conversation with Isaac, he said to William that it was no matter about having Mr. Minor come up, he had seen Isaac and it was all right; Mr. Minor understood all about it. He told Isaac that he had made Mr. Minor sole arbitrator in his will to settle any disputes. After talking with William about his will, the last day that he was conscious, he told him that he would find all the papers relating to his estate in the lower secretary drawer, and wished them to come into his hands as one of his executors. It is also in evidence that from Monday morning until he died, on Saturday, he was not able to leave his bed without help.

In support of this theory, they have shown a single instance of having forgotten that Josiah, his son, had taken some bonds to the bank for safe-keeping. They furnish no positive or circumstantial evidence of the destruction of the will or of its cancellation in any of the modes prescribed by Act of Assembly, by the testator. It appears from the evidence and is uncontradicted that testator retained his mental faculties up to Thursday morning before his death, and it is also made apparent from his conversations with his children and the attention he gave to matters relating to his estate to the Thursday morning before he died. These facts and circumstances lead us to conclude the testator died with the full conviction and belief that he had a will that would be operative at his death, and render it highly improbable that he should have destroyed it.

In order to make a will effective, it must be shown to have been in existence at the testator’s death; otherwise it is not his will. Until his death, it can have no effect; he retains full power and dominion over it, and he may either retain or destroy it at pleasure, and in the absence of the corpus of the will, the presumption is, that he has destroyed it himself, and no declaralarations of intent, condition and circumstances of family are sufficient to rebut the presumption. To this effect are the cases of The Baptist Church <em>v. </em>Robbarts, in 2 Barr 110; Jones <em>v. </em>Murphy, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 275" data-case-ids="483366" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0275-01">8 W. &amp; S. 275</a>; Clark <em>v. </em>Morton, <a href="/rawle/5/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="5 Rawle 235" data-case-ids="1824604" data-case-paths="/rawle/5/0235-01">5 Rawle 235</a>.</p>

      <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>That Isaac P. Foster made and executed in due form of law a will in writing, on or about the 5th of June 1875, is an indisputable fact. That the contents of this will are clearly and fully proved, both by testimony and by written memoranda in the testator’s own handwriting, is equally plain, and no question arises as to the number of witnesses, the contents being proved by two, as well as by the memoranda furnished by the testator himself. The will not being found after the testator’s death and diligent search, two material questions arise upon the assignment of errors:</p>
    <p id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.6",75,[177,787,1168,90]]]'>1. Whether the presumption of revocation by the testator himself is rebutted by the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b75-7" data-blocks='[["BL_75.7",75,[221,875,1007,43]]]'>2. Whether the contents can be proved by parol evidence.</p>
    <p id="b75-8" data-blocks='[["BL_75.8",75,[177,918,1172,695]]]'>There is ample evidence to rebut the presumption of a revocation by the testator. Many facts contribute to this result, among which these leading circumstances appear. Isaac P. Foster was never without a will for the last fifteen years of his life, having had seven written under the supervision of counsel and made necessary by the nature and amount of his estate, the number of his children, and advancements made to some, and those matters were often dwelt upon by himself. He, himself, regarded his will of 1875 as existing until and while lying on his death-bed, when too feeble to destroy it without assistance. Up to this time he made efforts to procure a codicil to alter the will in a certain aspect, made necessary by the failure in the payment of interest on certain bonds, but being prevented by the extremity of his last illness, died under a belief that he had arranged with his executors to pay these legatees money instead of the bonds. These and corroborating circumstances show that the testator had no thought of a revocation.</p>
    <p id="b75-10" data-blocks='[["BL_75.9",75,[178,1614,1170,562]]]'>That the presumption of a personal revocation can be thus rebutted is shown by the authorities cited by the appellees. The presumption of revocation arises from the fact that the will was known to be in the possession of the testator himself, and that it cannot be found after his death. It is, therefore, a natural presumption merely, because it cannot be supposed the testator would part with it, unless he intended to put it out of the way, and because it is out of the way and cannot be accounted for, the presumption that he intended to revoke it arises. Like other natural presumptions drawn from evidence, and not declared <em>de </em>jure, for some legal end, it must give way to stronger evidence of the continued existence of the will, and the testator’s reliance upon it as the disposition he had made of his property.</p>
    <p id="b75-11" data-blocks='[["BL_75.10",75,[178,2175,1169,260]],["BL_76.1",76,[236,407,1170,817]]]'>The will then being in existence at the death of the testator unrevoked by him, its loss or accidental destruction differs not from the loss or destruction of any other solemn instrument, such as a deed, a note or bond, or a record. The contents, therefore, may be proved in like manner, as shown by the authorities cited. It is a postulate of the question that the testator left behind him at death, a last will <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>in writing, legally executed and published; and unrevoked by any act or direction of his. That the law will not tolerate any making of a will for him by other means than his own act in writing duly executed, is clear. But such a will having a legal existence, yet accidentally lost or destroyed, the establishment of its contents is not the making of a new will, but a restoration merely of that which the testator himself made and left behind him to govern his estate. There is no greater sanctity, in this respect, than the restoration by parol evidence of other instruments equally solemn and having an equal effect in the disposition of property. The law simply comes in aid of his own legally performed act, to prevent his intentions from being frustrated or defrauded. The authorities upon the republication of wills, made before the passage of the Act of 1883, have a bearing and may therefore be cited — some not appearing in the paper-books: Havard <em>v. </em>Davis, <a href="/binn/2/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="2 Binn. 406" data-case-ids="1788926" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0406-01">2 Binn. 406</a>; Jones <em>v. </em>Hartley, <a href="/whart/2/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="2 Whart. 103" data-case-ids="1830497" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0103-01">2 Whart. 103</a>, citing many cases; Campbell <em>v. </em>Jamison, 8 Barr 498 ; Jack <em>v. </em>Shoenberger, 10 Harris 416; Fransen’s Will, 2 Casey 203. We cannot perceive that the learned judge erred in ruling either point.</p>
    <p id="b76-6" data-blocks='[["BL_76.4",76,[239,1223,1167,647]]]'>In regard to the right to an issue there is no difficulty. True, the right to a jury trial is given in the 41st section of the Act of 15th March 1832, relating to registers and registers’ courts, whenever a dispute upon a matter of fact arises before any register’s court; but the request for it must come in due time. Here no request was made, but the case was submitted to the judge of the Orphans’ Court, was fully argued, and the papers were in his possession for an opinion and decree. On application for a re-argument he permitted it. But he did not re-open the case for all purposes. If, under the pretext of a request for a re-argument, it was intended to cover up an intention to force an issue and thus delay a cause already fully submitted to a competent tribunal, it was not such a request as the court was bound to regard. It was in the sound discretion of the court then to allow an issue or not. There was no abuse of its power in his refusal.</p>
