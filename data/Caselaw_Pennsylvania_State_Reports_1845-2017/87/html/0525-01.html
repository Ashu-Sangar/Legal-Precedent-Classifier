Harper, of Louisville, Kentucky, had been shipping car loads of live stock to Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co., of Pittsburgh, to be sold on commission, and making drafts on them as soon as shipped, based on the bills of lading which accompanied the drafts. These drafts were usually discounted by the German Security Bank, and were always promptly paid until the draft for a certain car-load of hogs, shipped on August 9th 1877, by Harper to Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co., <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>came due. On the day of shipment Harper drew his draft on the latter firm for $1300, and the said draft was discounted by the German Security Bank on the faith of the bill of lading which was handed over to it. The draft, with the bill of lading attached, was sent to the German National Bank of Pittsburgh for collection, was presented to Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co., on the 11th of August, and payment refused. The hogs arrived on the 13th, were received by the. defendants below, and by them sold. At that time Harper was indebted to defendants on over-drafts on previous shipments to a larger amount than the proceeds of this last lot. The proceeds of the shipment, after deducting freight, shipment charges, &amp;c., amounted to $1299, which is the amount the bank claimed in their suit. The defendants claimed to retain it on account of the indebtedness of Harper to them. The bank based its claim to recover upon the ground that the transfer of the bill of lading, on the faith of which they discounted Harper’s draft, gave them the right to the cargo or its proceeds; that the mere handing over of the bill of lading was a transfer or pledge of the hogs as security for the draft. The defendants below denied this, claimed that no title to the hogs or proceeds could pass without an actual delivery to the plaintiff of the property, and contended further that even if it could that the handing over of a bill of lading, itself not a negotiable instrument, and which had no assignment whatever endorsed upon it, could not work a transfer of the property. The plaintiff below submitted points embracing the grounds upon which he sought to recover, and the court affirmed them. It also refused to affirm the following two points, submitted by the defendants below, which embrace substantially the defence to the action:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[283,1633,1163,216]]]'>1. That the contract of shipment or bill of lading for the hogs in question not having been endorsed or assigned to the plaintiff by any words of transfer, but merely delivered without endorsement, no property in the hogs thereby passed to the plaintiff and the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[280,1849,1164,173]]]'>2. That as there is no evidence that plaintiff took possession of the hogs, no lien was acquired by it upon the hogs, by way of security for any money which may have been advanced to Harper, which would be valid against Harper’s creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-8" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[278,2022,1165,260]]]'>There was also evidence on the trial that Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co. had agreed to accept Harper’s drafts whenever the bills of lading accompanied them. This was denied by the defendants, and the court in its charge held that the testimony was not material to the issue. The jury found for the bank, and Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co. assigned the rulings of the court as error.</p>

It was a non-hegotiable instrument, and mere manual delivery of it conveyed no interest whatever either in the hogs or their proceeds: Hopkins <em>v. </em>Beebe, 2 Casey 85; Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Ins.

And the hogs not having been taken into possession by the plaintiff, and in fact, there being nothing in the transaction to indicate that it was the intention of the parties that he should take possession of them, no title to or lien upon them could possibly be acquired as against Harper’s other creditors: Clow <em>v. </em>Woods, 5 S. &amp; R. 275; Wells <em>v. </em>Becky, <a href="/pen-w/1/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Pen. &amp; W. 57" data-case-ids="1826156" data-case-paths="/pen-w/1/0057-01">1 P. &amp; W. 57</a>; Fry <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20443" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Wright 443">9 Wright 443</a>; Bowen <em>v. </em>Burke, 1 Harris 149; Welsh <em>v. </em>Bell, 8 Casey 13.</p>
