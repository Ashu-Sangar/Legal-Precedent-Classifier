It is simply a business arrangement. And whilst it may be said in legal parlance to be a public corporation, having a charter and a corporate existence, yet it is submitttd whether it is a public corporation in that sense of the word that entitles it to the same immunities and exemptions and privileges that are enjoyed by railroad corporations, which have become and are public, common necessities every day and hour to every citizen of the government as well as the government itself.</p>

The defendant is bound to receive and transport all grain, goods and merchandise offered it, and for any one who may desire their grain, goods or merchandise so transported. It can make no choice of its customers, but must treat the public alike. In transporting grain from the western cities to the seaboard, the elevators at the port of shipping and delivery are as necessary and indispensable as the steamers and vessels by which the grain is carried; without these elevators and docks, offices and freight depot at Erie, the defendant would be utterly unable to enjoy its franchises, or perform its duties to the public. When hundreds of thousands of bushels of grain are now daily received and transported by this company, without these elevators and docks it could not transport a single cargo during the season.</p>

    <p id="b437-7" data-blocks='[["BL_437.10",437,[138,642,1178,1382]]]'>From the case stated, we learn that the company defendant is a Pennsylvania corporation, incorporated by the Act of June 21st 1865, and by the supplementary Acts of 15th of April 1869 and 9th of May 1871. That its business is the transportation of grain and other merchandise, to and from the various ports on the great lakes, the cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore and other eastern and southern cities. That it is the owner of certain water-lots in the city of Erie, on which, for the accommodation of its business, it has erected two grain elevators, warehouses and offices, and that upon these the county of Erie has imposed the taxes which are the subject of this contention. Elevators, as we understand the word as here used, are warehouses for the storage and ready shipment of grain, and we presume the docks mentioned in the statement are appurtenances connected with these warehouses, intended for the convenient landing of vessels and the easy disposition of their cargoes. The only question is, was it proper to tax these warehouses for county purposes? We may say, <em>in </em>limine, that the Act of 1870 extended to the defendant by the Act of 1871, applies only to the taxation of dividends and net earnings, and has no application to the question in hand. It has been repeatedly ruled that the property of canal and railroad companies, and other <em>quasi </em>public corporations, necessary for the exercise of their several franchises, as depots, toll-houses and water-stations, is not taxable for local purposes. The reason given for this exemption is that these things enter into the very composition of the works of these corporations, and, without which they could not exercise their corporate functions. On the other hand, it has been often and expressly held that such property as does not enter into the structure of a company’s works, but is used only as a convenience for carrying on its business, is taxable. Warehouses, machine-shops and coal-shutes have been enumerated as property of this character: Railroad <em>v. </em>Berks Co., 6 Barr 70.</p>
    <p id="b437-8" data-blocks='[["BL_437.11",437,[135,2029,1175,434]],["BL_438.1",438,[266,435,1167,87]]]'>We understand that the warehouses, the taxation of which is the subject of controversy, were used not only as storehouses, in the ordinary sense, but also for the transshipment of goods from vessels to railroads, and <em>vice versa, </em>from railroads to vessels. This being so, the case is met in point and ruled by Wayne County <em>v. </em>The Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co., 3 Harris 351, wherein it was held, that buildings situated at the junction of a canal and railroad, used for receiving and transshipping goods and merchandise to and from the canal and railroad, to be forwarded along the lines of these works, must be regarded as warehouses and therefore taxable. The <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>above cases so exactly cover the case in hand, that without overruling them, the judgment of the court below cannot be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b438-7" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[440,522,994,124]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and it is now ordered that judgment be entered, on the case stated, for the plaintiff in $675.50 with costs.</p>
