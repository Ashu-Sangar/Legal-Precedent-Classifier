The timber was cut and run to the river by jobbers who, during the whole of the year, except when engaged in running the lumber to market, occupied buildings or shanties on the tract, the materials for the erection of which were furnished by Green.

The assessment and treasurer’s deed on their face vest title in the plaintiff and entitle him to recover. To defeat the title the defendants allege the land was seated at and before the time of the assessment. If this be true the assessment and deed are void, and the defendant’s title is as clear as if no tax sale had been made. The sole question for you to answer is, was the land seated at the time of the assessment? If so the assessor had no right to place it upon the unseated list; the consent of the owners could not give such right. If it had been placed on the unseated list for many years before, whether seated or unseated, that would be no excuse for continuing to place it there. Such prior assessments may be considered with other evidence bearing on the question at issue. But if the land was seated the assessment was a nullity, and no title can rest upon it.</p>

The plaintiff claims that the evidence warrants no such finding, and contends it shows no residence, cultivation or improvement by clearing land; that instead of dwelling-houses and barns, only temporary shanties and stables were erected by jobbers, for use while stocking in logs in the winter season, and abandoned when their jobs were completed, and that there was nothing upon the land to indicate to the assessor that there was an actual occupation thereof. * * * [Actual residence upon a tract of land is not necessary to make it seated. Nor is cultivation, if by it is to be understood raising crops. Nor is improvement, if by that is meant making the land more valuable. But to seat the land it must be used and occupied, and have thereon the evidences of occupation.] To enter upon a tract of land with engine and machinery and sink an oil well, produce oil as a business thereon, store in tanks and <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>remove the oil, would make the land seated, though no one resided on it, and not a foot were cultivated for crops. To erect a sawmill of a permanent character on a tract of timber land, and make a business of manufacturing the timber into lumber for market would seat the tract, though not a residence or shanty were built on it. To open out a mine of ore or coal and carry on the business of mining and disposing of the mineral or coal, on a tract of land, would be good evidence that it is seated. Without giving other instances, you see occupations' for various purposes may render a tract seated, and residence or cultivation are not always necessary. [Whatever the use and occupation it is essential that it be visible, and such as could be and ought to be seen and known by the assessor. A tract of woodland on which the assessor can see no use and occupancy is not seated. Cutting a few trees, squaring them and leaving them in the woods, would not make a tract seated, nor would giving out a job for a single winter or lumbering season, the jobber building a shanty and abandoning it when the lumbering was done before the assessment. Occasional cutting and taking away timber from a tract would not be enough to require the assessor to place it on the seated list. When the owner of a timber tract, in person or by others under him, enters thereon to take out the timber, carries on the business for so long a time and in such a manner continuously from year to year as to show an actual and permanent occupancy of the tract, with use thereof, and personal property thereon from year to year, and so that the appearance of the land itself indicates to the assessor that there is an occupation of the same by the claimant for the purpose or business of lumbering, it is seated, and it is the duty of the assessor to so assess it.] When one enters on a tract to reside and builds a house or clears and cultivates land, the real occupancy is manifest at once, and immediately thereafter the assessor is bound to notice such occupancy. In some other kinds of occupancy the same may not be so soon manifest, may not be so readily seen by the assessor, but whenever it has assumed such character as to be visible and known to every one whose business it is to see and know it, then the assessor is required to assess it as seated.</p>

In the legal aspect of the case, the question was whether a tract of land can be seated for <em>lumbering </em>purposes. The negative means that land cannot be seated except for agricultural purposes. It would have been error to so hold. The court said: “ When the owner of a timber tract, in person or by others under him, enters thereon to take out the timber, carries on the business for so long a time and in such manner continuously, from year to year, as to show an actual and permanent occupancy of the tract, with the use thereof, and personal property thereon from year to year, and so that the appearance of the land itself indicates to the assessor that there is an occupation of the same by the claimant for the purpose or business of lumbering, it is seated, and it is the duty of the assessor to so assess it.”</p>
