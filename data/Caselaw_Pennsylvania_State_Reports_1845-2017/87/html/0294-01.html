In that month he enlisted and served in the army until 1865, when he returned to his father’s house, lived with him and in the neighbor<a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>hood until April 1866, when he sold his property in Pennsylvania and moved with his wife to the west. They lived successively in Freeport, Illinois, where their stay was short; in Morgan county, Missouri, where they remained for a year; in Benton county, in the same state, where they took up a homestead of one hundred and sixty acres, built a house and lived from 1868 until 1871, during which time their son, Christian, was born. In 1871 they removed to Henry county, also in Missouri, and while living here their son Samuel was born. In 1873 they left Missouri and settled in Peoria, Illinois, where Isaac died in February 1875. His widow thereupon came east with her children, and took up her residence with Christian, her husband’s father, who, in 1867, had moved from Limestone township, Union county, to Chillisquaque township, Northumberland county. The children, Christian and Samuel, who are the paupers in question, were supported by their grandfather until October 1875, when he was granted relief on their account by the Overseers of Chillisquaque, and they were supported at the cost of the township from that time until January 1877.</p>

From the digest of statutes of the state of Missouri, published in 1865, we see that a person who has resided there for the space of twelve months next preceding the time of any order being made, has acquired a legal settlement in that part of Missouri where he resided. (See Digest, page 232, sect. 3.) And in the Digest of the Statutes of the state of Illinois, published in 1858, we see that the residence of a person in any county of Illinois, for the space of thirty days immediately preceding such person’s becoming chargeable as a pauper, gives him a legal settlement for said purpose in Illinois. (Digest, p. 187, sect. 12.) And as Isaac Dolby aforesaid, after leaving Pennsylvania resided in Missouri about eight years ; after that again upwards of a year in the state of Illinois, it seems clear to us that he must have gained a legal settlement in both of these western states after leaving Pennsylvania. And now, if the above children are to be removed west at all, we are of the opinion that the burden and expense should not fall upon Chillisquaque township, where these children and their father never had a legal settlement, but that it should be borne, injustice, by the Overseers of the Poor of Limestone township, in Union county, Pennsylvania, where the said Isaac Dolby, the father, had his last legal settlement in Pennsylvania.</p>

It is, therefore, obvious that the prima facie settlement by birth must become, for all .practical purposes, absolute whenever it is ascertained that the child is of foreign or <em>extra </em>state parentage. It is indeed true that, by our poor laws, provision 'is made for the removal of paupers into other states, but this provisiones nugatory in that there is. no power by which it can be carried into effect; hence, the order of removal loses all force the moment it crosses the state line.
