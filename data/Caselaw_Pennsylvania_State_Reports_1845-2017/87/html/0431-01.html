The penalty of the bond was §500, conditioned that 11. should pay the county §39 quarterly, and indemnify the county against all expense in”tlie keeping of said lunatic. _ The court below held that payments made in accordance with the condition of the bond were payments on account of the penalty. Held, that this was error : that-the judgment was a continuing security in the nature of a' fixed lien, and that upon a sale upon a judgment, prior to that entered on the judgment of the county, a subsequent judgment-creditor was not entitled to have the payments, made on account of the lunatic, credited upon the judgment of the county; but $500 thereof, or if less, the, balance of the fund should be impounded for the future expenses of the lunatic.</p>

The penalty of said bond was $500; the condition was that C. C. Hollister should pay into the county treasury the sum of $39 quarterly, or such other sum as the county should be required to pay for the support of the said Martha Hollister, and fully indemnify the county against all expense for keeping the said Martha, &amp;c.

It is a mistake to suppose that payments made in accordance with the condition of the bond were payments on account of the penalty. That remains as a continuing security, and until the non-payment of the quarterly or other sum for the support of the lunatic as required by the county of Erie, there is no breach of the condition.
