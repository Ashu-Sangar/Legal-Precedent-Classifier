Davis against Wesley King. Previous to 1855, C. B. Curtis and JohnN. Miles, by deed from A. &amp; E. Huidekoper, were tenants in common of 100 acres of unseated land in Warren county. In 1855 Miles died, unmarried, without issue, and leaving to survive him a father (living at the time this suit was brought), one brother and three sisters, all adults. In 1860 and in 1862 the land was sold at treasurer’s sale for the non-payment of taxes. Robert Miles, the father, and the administrator of John N. Miles, and Curtis separately redeemed, each for himself, the undivided one-half of the land from the sales of 1860 and 1862.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b262-7" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[261,834,1166,424]]]'>Ans. “ This point is refused. It is admitted that the plaintiff was jointly interested in the tract in question as co-heir with the defendant, and that his claim to exclusive ownership rests upon a purchase made by him at treasurer’s sale while standing in such relation to the defendant. Under a well-settled rule of law he could not acquire such adverse title by the purchase of the entire property, thus taking it from under his co-tenant, and we do not see anything in the legislation referred to that will vary the general rule or take this case out of the operations of the principle referred to.</p>

Miles. The undivided half of the land was the debtor to one-half of the taxes remaining unpaid at the treasurer’s sale of 1864. That sale vested in Davis the undivided half of the land. After that sale Curtis and Davis held each the undivided half, not by the same, but by diverse titles. The case is not within the reason of the general rule. While it is not disputed that a community of interest produces .a community of duty, it is submitted that the Act of April 25th 1850, and March 9th 1847, exempt tenants in common of unseated lands from all duty or obligation to their co-tenants, so far as the payment of taxes are concerned.</p>

This rule is, however, claimed to exist only between tenants deriving their title from the same deed or a common ancestor. In this view of the law the counsel is not sustained by the authorities, the rule being that where there is a “community of interest there is a community of duty:” Weaver <em>v. </em>Wible, 1 Casey 270; Lloyd <em>v. </em>Lynch, 4 Id. 419; Keller <em>v. </em>Auble, 8 P.

In all cases of the like kind the purchaser is still trustee for his co-tenant, and can only hold the title as security for the taxes and costs which he has advanced, as is settled in the case of Duff <em>v. </em>Wilson, 22 P.

He was therefore in equal default with his co-tenant. Under these circumstances, we~think his purchase at the treasurer’s sale of the whole tract, is governed by the former decisions of this court, holding that joint-tenants or tenants in common, stand in a confidential relation to each other, such as forbids either from purchasing an adverse title over the head of the other. We are not prepared to say how the case would be if, availing himself of his right under the Act of Assembly to sever in the payment of taxes, he had paid his own, and the undivided half of his co-tenant only had been sold by reason of his own default. Judgment affirmed.</p>
