L. 30, in civil cases a wife may be called by her husband as a witness, notwithstanding she may be compelled on cross-examination to give testimony against him : Yeager <em>et al. v. </em>Weaver, 14 P. F. Smith 425; Craig <em>v. </em>Brendel, 19 Id: 153: Ballantine <em>v. </em>White, 27 Id. 20. The Act of 1869 was followed by the Act of April 3d 1872, Pamph. L. 34, entitled “ An Act to extend the competency of persons to be witnesses in certain criminal cases,” and the Act of March 24th 1877, Pamph. L. 45, “to permit defendants to testify in criminal cases.” Taking these three acts together, it was manifestly the intent that no <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>interest nor policy of the law should exclude a party or person from being a witness in any civil proceeding, of on the trial of any misdemeanor or felony, except felonies triable exclusively in the Court of Oyer and Terminer.</p>
    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[130,569,1166,776]]]'>The Act of 1869 left the incompetency of defendants in criminal cases where it was before. They are “parties” in the suit. But the Acts of 1872 and 1877 remove their incompetency and make them witnesses. And if the incompetency of “ parties” be removed, why should incompetency still adhere to other “persons,” not parties ? Manifestly the greatest stretch of the innovation was the admission of “parties” to the proceedings, civil and criminal, to testify in their own behalf. The apparent difficulty in the case is that the Acts of 1872 and 1877 omit the words “or persons,” which are contained in the Act of 1869. . But we contend that the proper construction of the three acts as one, is to incorporate the enabling provisions of the first into each of the others so as to make them co-extensive and to place the husband and wife on the same footing in criminal proceedings in which they are competent to testify, as they are in all civil proceedings. No apparent reason exists for a distinction between civil proceedings and criminal as to the competency of any other “person” after the party himself is allowed to speak.</p>

The Act of 1877 extends a privilege to the person charged with the commission of an offence, at his own request, to testify in his own behalf. By this act the incompetency alone of the accused is removed. He may avail himself of this privilege or not, as he may see fit, and his omission to do so, creates no presumption against him. Whether he be a witness or not, depends entirely upon his own will. It necessarily follows, therefore, that the wife of the accused cannot be a witness unless he so will it. Her right, therefore, to testify, cannot 'be by reason of any legislative enactment, for if the accused remain silent, no one would pretend to argue that the wife of the accused would be a competent witness under the Act of 1877. The Act of 1877 is in derogation of the common law, and must be construed strictly, and it cannot be made therefore to extend a privilege to persons not designated therein.</p>
