No amendment had been made, if indeed any could be made, after the expiration of the six months allowed for filing the claim. The scire facias answers as a statement of-claim, and takes the place of a declaration, and being for erection and construction presented a claim for <em>original </em>erection. The evidence for materials furnished was for the <em>repairs </em>of a house already built. It is evident the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>did not agree; <em>non constat </em>that the plaintiff had not a claim for each — one for construction and the other for repair.</p>
