The note fell due and was duly protested on the 15th of February 1877, in Allegheny City. The notices of protest were duly forwarded to the Union Banking Company of Philadelphia, the last endorser, and by that bank duly forwarded to the Elk County Bank, the next prior endorser, at Ridgway, Pa., at which place they arrived on 19th of February. J. G. Hall, the next prior endorser, lived in Ridgway, was an attorney, had a law oifice and a law partner there, and was also a member of the Elk ,County Bank, a private bank<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>ing company. On February 20th Kline, the cashier of the bank, mailed the notices of protest to J. Gr. Hall at Louisville, Kentucky, where he was temporarily. He did not go to his residence or place of business to give notice or make inquiry, but knowing of the absence of Hall and where he was, and Hall having no one in Ridgway expressly authorized to attend to his private business, he mailed the notices to him at Louisville. Hall received the notices on the 22d day of February, and on the same day mailed the notices to Pittsburgh to defendant, who was the next prior endorser. If these facts constituted due and legal notice to defendant, judgment was to be entered on the verdict (which was for plaintiff for $567.11), otherwise judgment for the defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.</em>

    <p class="summary" id="b380-7" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[251,1050,1165,378]]]'>“If the bank in Ridgway had left the notice of protest at Hall’s residence in Ridgway or his place of business, no doubt the service would have been good. And if some one at Ridgway had received the notice for Hall and mailed the notice to Dicken, Dicken might have received the notice one or two days earlier than he did. The bank received notice on the 19th and had the 20th to give notice to Hall; Hall then had until the 21st to mail notice to Dicken. Hall received notice at Louisville on the 22d, and the same day mailed the notice to Dicken.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-8" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[251,1438,1163,345]]]'>“The principle of law is, that notice of dishonor must be given in a reasonable time. What is reasonable time depends upon circumstances. But the general rule is that it must be given the next day where the parties live at the same place or by the next practicable mail where they live at different post-offices. Where there are several endorsers living widely apart, or where the mails are infrequent, several days, even weeks, may intervene between the day of dishonor and the time when some endorsers may receive notice.</p>

But the bank knew he was absent from home and knew his post-office address, and sent the notice to him by mail. He received it only one day later than he would have been entitled to receive it had he been at home, and no doubt actually received it sooner than he would have done, had it been left at his residence or usual place of business. He had no person expressly authorized to attend to his private business in his absence, and if the notice had been left at his residence or place of business it would probably have been <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>neglected or he would not have received it in time to give notice to his prior endorser. Hall therefore had no good ground of complaint against the hank. It was rather a favor to him that the notice was sent to him at Louisville. Otherwise he might have lost his claim upon the prior endorser.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.6",381,[141,621,1166,428]]]'>“Has Mr. Dieken any good ground of complaint? He says if the notice to Hall had been left at his residence in Ridgway, he (Dieken) would have received, or at least been entitled to receive, it one or two days earlier. There might be something in this if the delay had been to his injury or prejudice. But there is no allegation of that kind. Perhaps if the notice had been left at Hall’s residence in Ridgway it would have been neglected until too late to notify Dieken, and in that way he might have escaped entirely. But such a contingency hardly constitutes a good ground of defence, at least <em>in foro consoientice.</em>
