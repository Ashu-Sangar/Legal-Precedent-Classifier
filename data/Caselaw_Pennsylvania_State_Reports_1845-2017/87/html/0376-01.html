The plaintiff’s counsel then insisted that the whole of this conversation should be given, in order to show that the landlord admitted that another guest had been robbed on the same night. It was objected that this was irrelevant, and because the plaintiff had not been cross-examined upon this conversation. The court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b376-14" data-blocks='[["BL_376.15",376,[264,2059,1165,248]]]'>The defence offered evidence to show that the plaintiff was intoxicated on Sunday when he retired, and also on the Monday morning following; that they had a watchman on duty on the night of the robbery, and a safe provided for the reception of the valuables of guests, and had given notice thereof, as required by the Act of May 7th 1855.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[139,527,1161,215]]]'>Ans. “That point as stated is affirmed.

    <p class="summary" id="b377-8" data-blocks='[["BL_377.8",377,[138,959,1161,386]]]'>Ans. “ That point is refused. The measure of damages must be the value of the property — the pin at $600, and the watch at $350, and whatever amount of money he had, and the interest. There is no testimony as to expenses incurred by Mr. Porterfield in attempting to get his property, and you have no right, in the absence of testimony, to assume that he put himself to any expense; and as to counsel fees and such as that he is clearly not entitled to anything. You limit yourself, if you find in his favor, to the value of the property at the time of the loss.”</p>

That was the common-law liability. He was practically an insurer of the safety of the property whilst the guest remained in his house.”</p>

F. Smith 92, as to the extent and character of the liability of innkeepers for the goods of their guests. An innkeeper is bound to pay for goods stolen in his house from a guest, unless stolen by the servant or companion of the guest. It is his duty to provide honest servants and to exercise an exact vigilance over all persons coming into his house as guests or otherwise. The learned judge below, in his charge to the jury, evidently adopted this oase as his chart, and there is no error in his instructions upon the law. He affirmed the defendants’ ninth point, that if the plaintiff was intoxicated, and this contributed in any way to the loss, he could not recover. The evidence of the whole conversation of the plaintiff, of which the defendants had drawn out a part in the cross-examination, was rightly admitted. The error in the answer to the plaintiff’s thirteenth point, stating the value of the articles stolen, was a mere slip of the tongue, and evidently did the defendants no injury. It was not intended as a binding instruction as to the value, nor was it so understood at the time. On the whole, we discover no substantial error on this record, which requires us to reverse the judgment.</p>
