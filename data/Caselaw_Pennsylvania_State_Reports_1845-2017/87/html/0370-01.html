By no act of Shaffer was the lien incurred. He did nothing to defeat the title he had granted. He in no way petitioned for or was privy to the action of the city in grading, paving and curbing Devilliers street. He was not even the owner of the property when the assessment which is complained of was made. How, then, could the assessment be said to be his act for -which he was liable under this implied covenant ? But it is said the councils of the City of Pittsburgh represent the property owners, and therefore when they <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>passed the ordinance to grade, &amp;c., it was the act of the property-owners, and the judgment below is sought to be justified on that ground. But this court had already settled that question against the views of the court below in Wilson <em>v. </em>City of Allegheny, 29 P. P. Smith 278. This court there said: “ A municipal lien is an adverse right given by the law against the will of the citizen.” If so, the assessment, the basis of the municipal lien, cannot certainly be said to be the act of the citizen or lot-owner. If not, then this assessment was no act of the lot-owner within the meaning of the above decisions.

F. Smith 480, clearly limit the operation of the covenant upon which this suit is based to acts done or suffered by the grantor himself, or those claiming under him, of such a’character that the estate granted might thereby be defeated. Is the lien created by the improvement of the street while Shaffer owned the property within the protection of the covenant? The lien was undoubtedly of a character such as to defeat the estate granted. Was the creation of the lien an act done or suffered from the grantor ? The point has never been directly adjudicated; but, upon principle, the lien seems to be clearly within the covenant: O’Connor <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, 6 Harris 187. The right to repave has been fully recognised in this state by the Supreme Court: Seely <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, <em>supra. </em>No encumbrance can be placed upon any man’s property, otherwise than by his own act, or the act of those who legally represent him in that behalf. All municipal burdens, within the scope of the constitution, are imposed with the consent of the citizen, or, rather under authority conferred by the citizen; and a lien created by virtue of authority so conferred, constitutes an encumbrance upon real estate “done or suffered from” the owner; and if it is such an encumbrance as may defeat the estate conveyed by him who suffers it, it is within the covenant upon which this suit is founded. The whole system of governmental burdens rests upon the same principle of consent: Blossom <em>v. </em>Van Court, <a href="/mo/34/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="34 Mo. 390" data-case-ids="989541" data-case-paths="/mo/34/0390-01">34 Mo. 390</a>; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2058" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Jones 58">1 Jones 58</a>; Pittsburgh <em>v. </em>Cluley, 16 P.

Laws 95, a covenant only against acts done or suffered from the grantor. The word “suffered” necessarily implies that it is not confined to the voluntary acts of the grantor, and it has never been doubted that he is liable on a judgment obtained against him by adverse proceedings. It is apparent that the same principle extends to and includes a tax assessed on the land during his title. Nor ought it to make any difference that such tax does not create personal liability. A tax on unseated lands would be such an encumbrance. And how does the case on this record differ from that ? It is unecessary to resort, in vindication of the rule, to the doctrine that the municipal, authorities, at the time the encumbrance was created, virtually represented the grantor, and he must be held to have given his assent. It is enough that he suffered a charge on the land — during his title — for which, as between him and his grantee, he was bound to indemnify him. Caldwell <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2058" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Jones 58">1 Jones 58</a>, is a case very much in point. It follows, too, we think, that no difference can be made between the work done before and after the deed. The lien was certain at the time of the conveyance — it related by the provisions of the statute to the commencement of the improvement: Blossom <em>v. </em>Van Court, 34 Missouri 390.</p>
    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.9",375,[169,1526,1163,519]]]'>There was no error, we think, in rejecting the offer of evidence complained of in the first assignment. It was not an offer to prove that at the time the deed was executed, it was part of the consideration that the grantee should be liable to pay the assessment. By the provision of the Act of 1715, the effect of the covenant implied by the words, “grant, bargain and sell,” can only be limited “by express words contained in the deed.” At most, the offer was to show knowledge or notice of the encumbrance, and an expression of the opinion of the grantor that the grantee would have to pay it. The grantee was not bound to deny this, even supposing that he knew the law. The evidence offered was, therefore, irrelevant, and was rightly rejected. Judgment affirmed.</p>
