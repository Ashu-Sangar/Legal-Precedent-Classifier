Affidavits of defence were filed in each case, setting up that the money belonged to Abraham Rhodes alone, and this issue was thereupon framed to determine its ownership in each case, with Abraham Rhodes, as plaintiff, and Mary Rhodes, executor, as defendant.

She had been previously married, and in the year mentioned she joined with her husband Abraham in a receipt for about $400, and a release to the executor of her first husband’s will. He had personal property of probably the same value, and their subsequent acquisitions were entirely the result of their own labor, and the use of this small capital, She received nothing from any other source than her second husband, and the principal question was whether his acts and declarations established a gift to her of the larger note.

There was no evidence outside the title to show that, in the course of these transactions, she claimed to own the land in her own right. In February 1864, Abraham purchased a farm from Michael Sissler for $3447, paying $1148.67 in hand and giving a mortgage in which his wife joined for the balance. The title of this property was made to him. In April 1872 he sold this land to Henry Shaw, and the money paid by Shaw at that time, viz.: $2887, which was at once loaned to Fichtner, together with other loans to Fichtner theretofore made by Abraham, and for which Abraham individually held Fichtner’s notes, made up the note in dispute.

But about the time that this new note was given, or immediately before it was given — after they had determined to put them into one note, Mrs. Rhodes said to mo, ‘ I want the new note in my name.’ I told Mrs. Rhodes I didn’t like to do that; could .not well do it unless the old gentleman was satisfied. I addressed myself to Mr. Rhodes; he was hard of hearing, and I spoke very loudly, telling him what Mrs. Rhodes had said. He said that the money was his, and that he wanted the note in his name, as it was before. They parleyed a little about it; he commenced to talk then to Mrs. Rhodes and got a little loud on it. I saw that they wouldn’t come to any agreement, and I told them they should settle upon the matter, and whenever they had determined how it was to be drawn I would draw it, and I left the house then. The next day Mrs. Rhodes came up to my house and told me again she wished the new note to be in her name. I told her I didn’t see how I could do it unless he would be satisfied. Either that day or the next day I went down again to see Mr. Rhodes and he again told me that he wouldn’t have the note in any other way but what it was in his name. Mrs. Rhodes was by. After talking awhile to them I proposed to them at last to make the note jointly —to draw the note in favor of Abraham and Mary Rhodes.

There is not a spark of evidence in this case of any coercion or compulsion exercised by the husband to get the money from her, or of any fraud or deception practised upon her in taking the title in his name. This must, therefore, be taken as having been done with her full consent, there being no evidence of dissent on her part, and from the day in 1864 [1872 ?] when the title was taken in his name, that land and the increased value of it was his just as much as the land in Martinsburg, which was taken in her name, was hers. * * *</p>

    <p id="b232-10" data-blocks='[["BL_232.11",232,[268,1109,1166,417]]]'>This was a feigned issue between Abraham Rhodes of the one part, and the executor of his deceased wife Mary of the other part. It was to try the right to certain money paid into court by Joseph Fichtner, on a note executed by him in 1872, to Abraham and Mary Rhodes. The contention involved an inquiry into the ownership of the property which was the consideration of this note. Evidence was given in relation to their business transactions, covering the whole period of their married lives. They were married in T834. Each party then owned property of the value of a few hundred dollars.</p>
    <p id="b232-11" data-blocks='[["BL_232.12",232,[274,1537,1161,379]]]'>Although numerous errors are assigned, they may all be considered together. The uncontradicted evidence shows the note of Fichtner in contention was given in consideration of other notes against Fichtner, payable to Abraham Rhodes alone, and some money loaned by Abraham to Fichtner at the time the last note was executed. One of the notes was for $2887, and the money, for which this note was given, was obtained by Abraham from one Shaw, on a sale to him in 1872 of a farm, the title to which had been in Abraham from 1864.</p>
    <p id="b232-12" data-blocks='[["BL_232.13",232,[274,1927,1158,170]]]'>The appellant attempted to prove the wife was entitled to a portion of the money paid by Fichtner in two ways. The one by showing her previous ownership of property; the other by the conduct of the parties when the last note was executed.</p>
    <p id="b232-13" data-blocks='[["BL_232.14",232,[275,2098,1161,345]],["BL_233.1",233,[137,416,1161,89]]]'>In support of the first view’, it was shown that in 1834 Abraham and his wife united in giving a receipt for a legacy due to her of about $400; but there was no evidence that she took the money into her possession. At that time the law gave the personal property of the wife to the husband. It was not shown that she had the possession or control of this money at any time thereafter. There vras no proof that she loaned it to him, or that he promised to repay it. There was no understanding that he should invest it <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>for her, and no evidence that he ever did so. He appears to have mingled it with his other funds and treated it as his own property -</p>
    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[137,503,1162,303]]]'>It is true, in 1852, he conveyed some lands to her, and this land is claimed by the appellant to be the foundation of her title to the money in controversy. The uncontradicted evidence is, that he made this conveyance to her at a time when he was sick and expected to die; that she neither paid, nor was expected to pay, anything therefor. They had no children, and the deed was made with the supposed view of avoiding a collateral inheritance tax.</p>
    <p id="b233-7" data-blocks='[["BL_233.7",233,[136,806,1162,780]]]'>The conveyance of the land to Campbell, in consideration of his agreement to support Abraham and wife, and the reconveyance thereof, and the subsequent conveyances to Crissman and Sissler were not accompanied by any agreement between Abraham and his wife, or by declarations of either of them, indicating that she had any equitable interest therein as against him. The fact that when Sissler conveyed the land to Abraham, on the 23d February 1864, the wife of the latter united with him in the mortgage given to secure the payment of a part of the purchase-money, creates no legal presumption that the land was purchased with her funds or on her credit. The title thereto was made to him alone, and remained in him until he conveyed to Shaw, more than eight years thereafter. There is not a particle of evidence tending to show that she had any estate in the land during the intervening time. He was therefore entitled to receive in his own right the whole purchase-money paid by Shaw. Having so received it, the money was his exclusive property. The court was therefore right in saying Mrs. Rhodes had no right to any portion of it.</p>
    <p id="b233-8" data-blocks='[["BL_233.8",233,[130,1585,1167,822]]]'>The other question requires us to consider the acts and declarations of the parties at the time the last note was executed by Fichtner. The former notes and the money, which were the consideration for this note, were the property of Abraham alone. He suggested to Fichtner that they should all be put into one note. After it was so agreed, Mrs. Rhodes said to Fichtner “ I want the new note in my name.” He replied that he could not so make it unless her husband assented, and then informed him of her request. Abraham “said that the money was his, and that he wanted the note in his name, as it was before.” They failed, that day, to agree on the form of the note. On the next day Mrs. Rhodes again expressed a desire to have the new note made payable to her; but as Fichtner swears, Abraham “again told me that he would not have the note in any other way but what it was in his name. Mrs. Rhodes was by.” After talking awhile to them, Fichtner proposed to make the note to them jointly. To this Mrs. Rhodes made no reply; but Abraham, in rather an angry tone said, “I don’t care how the note is made; but the money is mine.” Fichtner then drew the note payable to both of them.</p>
    <p id="b233-9" data-blocks='[["BL_233.9",233,[174,2407,1119,43]],["BL_234.1",234,[273,419,1158,602]]]'>Thus it appears, he clearly asserted his exclusive right of pro<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>perty, and an unwillingness to relinquish the same'or any evidence thereof. She did not deny his right nor assert any claim in opposition thereto. Apparently as a favor, she requested that the note be made payable to her. At the suggestion of the maker, and to him, he reluctantly expressed an indifference as to the form of the note. Yet, to avoid any seeming waiver of his rights, he added: “but the money is mine.” These were his last words in relation to the execution of the note. In view of all this evidence, we cannot see that the appellant has any cause of complaint against the court for having submitted to the jury to find whether he made a gift of one-half of the note to her at the time of its execution. The jury found he did not. This finding disposed of the whole case, and the question reserved became irrelevant. It is therefore not necessary for us to now consider it.</p>
