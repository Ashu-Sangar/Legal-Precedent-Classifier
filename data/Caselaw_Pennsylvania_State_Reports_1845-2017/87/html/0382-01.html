The bank was not content to rest upon its legal right to proceed upon its judgment-bond and take its chances of becoming the purchaser of the mortgaged premises as the highest and best bidder at the sheriff’s sale. In advance of the sheriff’s sale, and even before the entry of the judgment, the bank stipulated for, and exacted from the defendant, acquiescence by him in the proposed proceedings and in the purchase by the bank at the lowest possible price. The undertaking of the defendant was founded upon the two-fold consideration of benefit to the bank and injury to the plaintiff. The injury to the plaintiff is most obvious. His hands were tied by his contract. By reason of it he could not and did not interfere with the judicial proceedings, raise money or procure bidders. The testimony shows that it was in his power to arrest the sheriff’s sale and save a large part of his estate by a private sale of a portion. This he forbore to do. The transaction between the plaintiff and the bank was in fact but a mortgage. The arrangement was that the bank should hold the property as security, and only enough be sold to pay off the claim of the bank with interest, costs and expenses. That such a transaction is but a mortgage and may be established by parol evidence is shown by the cases of Maffitt’s Administrator <em>v. </em>Rynd, 19 P. F. Smith 380; Sweetzer’s Appeal, 21 Id. 264; Danzeisen’s Appeal 23 Id. 65.

If a promisee is induced to incur expense or perform some act which otherwise he would not have done, a purchaser may be estopped from denying the trust. But however this may be, mere acquiescence, or omission to take other steps to obtain the property, although induced by the promise, is not available for such a purpose: Jackman <em>v. </em>Ringland, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 149" data-case-ids="1856423" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0149-01">4 W. &amp; S. 149</a> ; DeFrance <em>v. </em>DeFrance, 10 Casey 385; Sample <em>v. </em>Coulson, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 62" data-case-ids="12168906" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0062-01">9 W. &amp; S. 62</a>; Carhart’s Appeal, 28 P.

That it could not be regarded as a parol mortgage is evident from the fact that there was no new loan, and for their existing debt the defendants already had a regular valid mortgage, duly recorded, on which they proceeded and purchased at a sheriff’s sale. The only conceivable purpose of such a new parol mortgage must have been to keep the plaintiff’s other creditors at bay or to bar his wife’s dower, neither of which could be set up by the plaintiff to raise a trust. There is no evidence of fraud, as there was in Wolford <em>v. </em>Herrington, 24 P. F. Smith 311, where there was a distinct agreement by the purchaser that he would execute a declaration, which he at first evaded, before the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed and afterwards refused, giving the strongest evidence that he never had meant to execute such a paper. The case before us is entirely within the principle of Jackman <em>v. </em>Ringland, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 149" data-case-ids="1856423" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0149-01">4 W. &amp; S. 149</a>, Barnet <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 8 Casey 371, Kellam <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 <a href="/watts-serg/4/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 149" data-case-ids="1856423" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0149-01">Id. 158</a>, and other cases of that class, which have held that where there is nothing more in the transaction than is implied from the violation of a parol agreement, equity will not decree the purchaser to be a trustee.</p>
