      <em>“ </em>The key-note in the construction of every will is the ascertainment of the intention of the testator, and when ascertained that intention must prevail unless inconsistent with some law or with public policy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b503-11" data-blocks='[["BL_503.11",503,[134,1863,1169,380]]]'>“ The present proceeding raises a question as to the intention of Margaret Griffin, now deceased, with respect to the power of sale which she conferred upon her executors — whether she intended no more than the partial conversion which has already been made, or a peremptory sale of all her real estate. In the consideration of this question it must be borne in mind that conversion is not favored by the law where the result may be to change the course of inheritance, and will be presumed only so far as may be necessary to effectuate the intention of the testator.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b503-12" data-blocks='[["BL_503.12",503,[132,2251,1167,217]],["BL_504.1",504,[258,441,1163,1294]]]'>“ What then was the intention of this testatrix with respect to conversion ? She declares that in order to enable her executors to carry out the provisions of her will she authorizes and empowers them (1.) to make sale of all her estate and (2.) “ to pay the bequests hereinbefore made'(without interest), as they have money on hand <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>to do so in the order in which they are herein given.” What bequests are meant ? Certainly not the residuary bequest that <em>ex vi termini </em>carries not only principal but interest. The bequests which were to be paid out of the proceeds of sale must then relate to the general legacies, and the power of sale is limited by the amount necessary to pay these general legacies. It was not necessary, so far as the residuary devisees were concerned, that there should be a sale of the real estate in order to carry out the provisions of the will. The devise was to them directly, and the legal title to the land need not have vested in the executors for their benefit; they could take directly from the testatrix; whereas the general legatees must derive title through the executors. Nor is this view inconsistent with the codicil. There is no express reference in the codicil to the power of sale contained in the original will, and no necessary implication of the enlargement of that power. It has been seen that a special fund was to be created by <em>sale </em>for the payment of the general bequests. That fund was to be realized by the terms of the will as it could be ‘ done to advantage.’ But there was in addition to this fund a large amount of cash on hand which was not strictly applicable to the payment of these bequests, but out of which the legacy to Mrs. Rankin might be satisfied, leaving a balance for ‘final distribution.’ The time of payment of this legacy was to be regulated by the ‘ needs’ of Mrs. Rankin, and might be demanded at a time when not only the sale of the real estate could not be made to advantage, but when there might result a serious loss. It is not to be presumed that testatrix intended to subject so large an estate to such a risk for so small a legacy, but rather that she intended Mrs. Rankin to be paid out of the cash on hand. There could, under the circumstances, have been no necessity for sale of the land,- and therefore no sale was contemplated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[258,1732,1165,562]]]'>“ In any event, conversion can not be presumed to have been intended further than may be necessary to pay those bequests, which are payable ‘without interest,’ and to equalize the shares of the residuary legatees in the ‘ final distribution,’ which must terminate the duties of the executors. There is nowhere to be found, in terms, in the will, a positive and explicit direction to sell. The expression ‘authorize and empower,’ is in itself discretionary; it was used with reference to a purpose, and that purpose has been accomplished. The executors were authorized and empowered to sell ‘ all’ the ‘ goods and estate’ of testatrix, if necessary to carry out the provisions of her will, and they have sold all that was necessary for that purpose. The authority and power conferred upon them has therefore been exhausted.</p>

There can be no doubt that the power of sale which the testatrix vested in her executors is discretionary as to <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>time. The sale was to be made ‘as it can be done to advantage.’ This court will not interfere with the exercise of a discretionary power unless bad faith is shown to exist on the part of the executors, or, loss may result from a failure to exercise such discretion. Neither of these conditions appear in this proceeding. 2. Whether it would be advantageous to make sale of the unsold portion of decedent’s real estate, in the present depressed monetary condition of the country, is a question about which there ought to be little contention. So long as there is no absolute necessity for selling, the executors would not be justified in making, nor this court in ordering, a sale, There could be no ‘ advantage ’ in such action.</p>
