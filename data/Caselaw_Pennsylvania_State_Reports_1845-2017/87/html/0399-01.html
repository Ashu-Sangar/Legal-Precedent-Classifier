On September 17th 1874, it issued its policy for the term of three years from that date, in the sum of $2000. The policy insured a two-story flour mill in Freedom, Beaver county, Penna., belonging to John F. Mueller, but by him mortgaged to the Rochester Building Association, No. 2. By the terms of the policy, it was provided: “ Loss, if any, payable to the Rochester Building Association, No. 2, as their interest may appear.” The premium Avas $180; but instead of paying it in cash, Mueller, by an arrangement with an agent of the insurance company, gave his promissory note for $180, dated September 22d 1874, payable at ninety days after date to the order of the agent. The company received the note and issued the policy. The note, hoAvever, was not paid at maturity, and Avas protested for non-payment. By the terms of the policy, it was provided, inter alia: “ Article 1. * * * If, during the insurance, the risk be increased <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>by the erection of buildings, or by use or occupation of neighboring premises or otherwise, or if, for any other cause, the company shall so elect, it shall be optional with the company to terminate the insurance, after notice given to the assured, or his representative, of their intention to do so; in which case the company will refund a rateable proportion of the premium.” Availing itself of this provision, the company, on March 19th 1875, resolved to and did cancel the policy, and forthwith gave notice of such cancellation to the Rochester Building Association, No. 2, which duly received such notice. No further negotiations or business with relation to the policy took place between any of the parties thereto until after December 13th 1875. At that date the mill described in the policy was totally destroyed by fire. In the meantime, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county, the insurance company, upon the petition of its stockholders, was dissolved, on August 7th 1875. No trustee, however, was appointed by the court until May 13th 1876. The plaintiff, however, claiming a right to recover under the policy, prepared what purported to be a proof of loss and left it at the private residence of Hugh Lafferty, who, prior to the dissolution, had been the president of the company. It was not denied that he received, but there was no evidence from which a waiver could be implied except <em>Ms </em>silence.</p>

And where there has been a note given for the premium instead of the payment thereof in money, there must either be an absolute tender of the note by the insurer to the insured or a tender upon the terms of paying the insurer the earned part of the premium, or the company must otherwise provide for the return of the unearned premium before any attempted cancellation of the risk will be operative. And if the jury find that no such tender, either absolute or qualified was made by the company, defendant in this suit, to either the legal or equitable plaintiff, and that the note was accepted by the company as payment of the premium, then the alleged cancella<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>tion of the policy by the defendant was ineffectual and does not bar the plaintiff’s recovery.</p>

If, therefore, they receive it, it was essential to their proper cancellation of this policy that they should, in accordance with the terms of one of their own articles alluding to this possibility of cancellation, have returned or tendered to one or the other of these plaintiffs a rateable amount of the unearned premiums. If, therefore, they have not so done, there is no bar in this regard to the plaintiff’s recovery.</p>

All of these reasons were urged in the court below by the plaintiff’s counsel. As to the first reason, the association was primarily interested in the policy. Mueller himself had appointed it to take the fruits of the policy. It was his representative, and as such, a proper party under the conditions of the policy. He had no interest until it was paid. The second reason has already been decided against the plaintiff; in Carr <em>v. </em>The Lancashire Ins. Co., 27 U. C. Q. B. 217 and 458, cited in Bates’ Eire Ins. Cases, 159, sect. 13.</p>

It was the beneficiary. It had paid neither money nor note for the insurance. If money had been paid, the company would not have been bound to refund it, although, in that event, of course, it would have been bound to refund to Mueller. The <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>notice then terminated the rights of the association in the policy.

It contained a stipulation that for any cause “ it shall be optional with the company to terminate the insurance after notice given to the assured or his <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>representative, of their intention to do so; in which case the company will refund a rateable proportion of the premium.” This provision was also inserted, to wit: “Loss, if any, payable to the Rochester Building Association, No. 2, as theirinterest may appear.” The said association took and retained possession of the policy until after the fire. Mueller gave his note, dated September 22d 1874, at three months, for the premium, which was protested for non-payment. On the 19th March 1875, the company cancelled the policy and served notice on its holder as follows : “You are hereby notified that policy No. 1644, issued to John Mueller by this company, on the 15th of September, is hereby cancelled for non-payment of premium.” To this no response was made. The property insured was destroyed on the 14th of December 1875.</p>
    <p id="b404-6" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[283,986,1165,1076]]]'>Notice of cancellation was requisite upon Mueller or his representative, not on both. No one could better answer as representative than he who had the custody of the policy and would be entitled to the money in case of loss. The notice was sufficient, and the cancellation took effect from the service. Had the premium been tendered and refused, within a reasonable time, a question might exist which is not now in the case. There was no offer to pay. It is said the policy remained valid because the company did not refund a rateable proportion of the premium. Non-payment of the premium was the very cause of cancellation. Refund what ? The evidence of a broken promise to pay ? The company had received no money. No legerdemain could make that protested note appear as cash. Mueller had no right to the note until payment of the proportionate part due-when the policy ended. It was his paper, received and held by the company, between them a mere contract subject to any legal or equitable defence. The insured has no just ground for complaint. Eor three months his note stood as if a payment of the premium; for three months longer the policy was permitted to continue in force; and for nine months after the cancellation he was content. At no time did he tender or offer to pay a dollar for restoration of the policy. Too often insurance companies set up technical and trifling defences against payment of losses; but that is no reason for holding a policy valid after its cancellation according to the terms of the contract, and a long neglect by the insured to pay the stipulated price for the insurance.</p>

The ninth condition of the insurance provided that the loss should not be payable until the production of a certificate of an officer as therein directed. It is alleged that production of the certificate was waived. Let it be conceded that Lafferty was duly authorized to act for the company. Also that silence under many circumstances may be evidence of a waiver. As where payment is refused for a specified cause; or where a defect is pointed out in proofs and certificates; or where, after receipt of proofs, the company act upon them as if correct in treat<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>ing with the insured; or where the company resort to and agree upon another mode of ascertaining the loss; waiver as to a defect, not the ground of objection, refusal or action, may well be inferred from silence. But where no word or act has been said or done by the assurer to mislead the insured or throw him off his guard, mere silence is not enough to infer waiver: Beatty <em>v. </em>Lycoming Co. M. Ins. Co., 16 P. F. Smith 9. Mueller left the papers with Lafferty’s wife, and he received them from her. There was no communication between them, orally or in writing. Lafferty did nothing.
