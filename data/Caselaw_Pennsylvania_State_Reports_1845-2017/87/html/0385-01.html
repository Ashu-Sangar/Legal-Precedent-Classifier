J., in June 1877. At this trial it appeared that the spring political campaign in Allegheny county in 1864 was a particularly bitter one. Moore was the chairman of the Democratic county committee at this time, and John H. Elder was the Democratic candidate for city controller of Pittsburgh, and Peter Farley, the candidate of the same party for mayor of Allegheny City. On the Saturday preceding the election Moore, signing himself the chairman of the Democratic county committee, published a card in certain papers of the city of Pittsburgh, charging, first, that Elder was ineligible to the office of controller, and second, that he was unworthy of the support of Democrats, because he had supported at a recent election <em>the </em>Republican candidate for state treasurer. The card further asserted that there was no Democratic candidate for mayor in the city of Allegheny. Mr. Farley, <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>it appeared, was running as the citizens’ candidate, with the understanding that the Democrats, who made no nomination, were to support him. On the morning after the publication of Moore’s card a number of Democrats collected at the office of the “Post,” at which meeting Barr was present, and severe complaint was made of this article. The next morning the alleged libellous article appeared in the “Post.” It appeared also from the testimony of Moore and others that Moore entertained feelings of hostility to Elder, and that the latter belonged to the “Barr faction” of the Democratic party, against whom a bitter feeling existed on the part of the faction to which Moore belonged.</p>

Mr. Barr, when subsequently called for the defence, contradicted this assertion, and said theré were no other publications of like tenor and effect, or in any way confirmatory of the one published, other than one or two communications and answers thereto, denying the right of Moore, as chairman of the county committee, to interfere with the city elections.</p>

It cannot be regarded as a privileged communication, its publication cannot be justified or excused, and inasmuch as its tendency was to injure the reputation of the plaintiff, we are of opinion it is libellous and actionable, and that your verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff. The amount which he is entitled to recover is a matter solely for your determination under the evidence before you. * * * While compensation simply is ordinarily, the measure of damages in libel, there are cases in which vindictive or exemplary damages are justifiable and proper. Where the evidence shows that the wrongful a.ct complained of was accompanied by circumstances of aggravation, where there has been express, wanton, or unmitigated malice on the part of the wrongdoer, the jury may, in assessing damages, go beyond simply compensation to the injured party, and in addition thereto, give such exemplary damages as the circumstances of the case may appear to warrant.

This man Moore is in the pay of the ring, and the fact does not surprise us in the least when we reflect that he has descended from the high calling of a clergyman to the recognised champion and professional defender of prostitutes and the lowest grade of criminals who throng the audience halls of our police and criminal courts; and he seems to follow his profession solely for the purpose of making money, and his opinions are moulded by the extent of his client’s means to pay, The money of the ring ; the money of the prostitute, and the money of the libertine and burglar, is all alike to him if he is duly intent on making money.

To support this position, they invoke the aid of that part of art. 1, sect. 7, of the constitution of 1874, which declares “no conviction shall be had in any prosecution for the publication of papers relating to the official conduct of officers or men in public capacity, or to any other matter proper for public investigation or information, where the fact that such publication was not maliciously or negligently made, shall be established to the satisfaction of the jury.” In answer we say this clause refers only to attempted “conviction” in a “prosecution,” and in no wise applies to a civil action to recover damages. It would be a clear perversion of language to extend it to any case other than a “prosecution” in which a “ conviction” is sought. It manifestly refers to the trial on an indictment for a libel.</p>

The right of each is too valuable to be encroached on by the other. Hence, another part of the section just cited declares “ the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>liberty.” Thus it appears this right or liberty is not one of unlimited license; but it is restrained by a legal responsibility.</p>
    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[130,509,1173,1172]]]'>The high esteem in which reputation is held, and the protecting care which the organic law has thrown around it, are clearly expressed in the first section of the Declaration of Rights. It declares “all men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.” Thus reputation and property are put on the same high ground. The fundamental law affirms the. same inherent and indefeasible right in all men to protect the one as fully as the other. This language in the Declaration of Rights naturally flows from the doctrine of the common law. The natural right of personal security consists in a person’s legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health and his reputation. The security of his reputation or good name from the arts of detraction and slander are rights to which every man is entitled by reason and natural justice. The reason given is that without this “it is impossible to have the perfect enjoyment of any other advantage or right:” 1 Blackstone’s Com. 134. The right to protect reputation being inherent in man and being indefeasible, it cannot be annulled by legislative action. A good reputation is too valuable to admit of its being falsely assailed without the law giving some redress to the person injured. The general liberty of the press must be construed in subordination to the right of any person calumniated thereby, to hold it responsible for an abuse of that liberty. It follows that the article published by the plaintiffs in error was not privileged, and having failed to establish its truthfulness, they are liable in damages.</p>
    <p id="b393-6" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[133,1679,1170,518]]]'>Although malice is a necessary ingredient in slander and libel, yet it must be understood in its legal signification. In its common acceptation malice means ill-will against a person ; but in its legal sense it means a wrongful act done intentionally, without just cause or excuse, and therefore every utterance or publication having the other qualities of slander or libel, if it be wilful and unauthorized, is in law malicious. Legal malice alone is sufficient to support an action. If the words are actionable in themselves, as we have shown them to be in this case, and not being privileged, the publication of them is sufficient evidence of legal malice; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Am.%20Lead.%20Cas.%20192" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Am. Lead. Cas. 192">1 Am. Lead. Cas. 192</a>. The falsity of the publication creates an implication of malice: Farley <em>v. </em>Ranck, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 554" data-case-ids="1854650" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0554-01">3 W. &amp; S. 554</a>.</p>

The fact that an indictment may be sustained, does not preclude the jury from giving vindictive damages. When the act is both a public and private wrong, the public and the person aggrieved, each has a distinct and concurrent remedy: Foster <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 77" data-case-ids="483342" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0077-01">8 W. &amp; S. 77</a>. If the party aggrieved <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>makes out a case which justly calls for vindictive damages, his right thereto cannot be defeated by the fact that the plaintiffs in error may be punished for an injury to the public.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[291,554,1175,693]]]'>With one exception we find no error in the record. That error is found in the bill of exceptions, and is covered by the second assignment to the evidence. The learned judge erred in permitting the witness to testify that articles of the same tenor and <em>character, </em>wei-e afterwards published in the paper of the plaintiffs in error, without producing those articles, or giving any valid reason for their non-production. The best evidence of their contents was not given. No ground was laid for the admission of secondary evidence. Nor was the error cured by the fact that one of the plaintiffs in error afterwards testified that no such articles were published. The evi. dence was given for the purpose of swelling the damages. If true, such was its natural effect. How far it influenced the amount of the verdict we have no means of ascertaining. It is sufficient for us to say that it may have increased the amount. For this error and for this alone, evidently made in the hurry of the trial, the judgment must be reversed.</p>
