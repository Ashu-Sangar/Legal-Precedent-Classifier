It matters not how impolitic the grant, or how small the consideration, it is binding on the public when made by the legislature; the adequacy of the consideration or policy of the grant must be judged of by that tribunal. If there is nothing to be done or suffered by the grantee, if it is a mere gratuitous gift by the grantor, it may be revoked at pleasure. It is not a contract. Had the exclusive right to the ferry for one mile above and below the house of Kreamer been invested in the original grant, it would have been binding, as he is required, by the statute, to make landings, keep up boats and craft, suitable ferrymen, &amp;c., to carry passengers and teams at all times.</p>

Nor confer an exclusive privilege without what the legislature considered an equivalent in value to the citizens. The supplemental act of April 15th 1867, which grants to Joseph Kreamer the exclusive right and privilege of a ferry for one mile above and below his house, where his ferry at that time existed, may be of immense injury not only to the people of Millersburg, a flourishing town, but to the whole travelling public which may desire to pass that way. It grants a monopoly in perpetuity for two miles of river frontage, if the supplement can be construed to be a contract. When that whole country comes to be densely peopled the inconvenience may be felt as great as the bridge to the people of Binghamton, with its exclusive privilege along the river. These thoughtless grants of the legislature, made when the country is comparatively new, become intolerable in a future day. Yet, if a contract, we must sustain it. There is nothing whatever contracted or ordered to be done by the supplement in consideration of the privilege. It is a mere gift, which may be reclaimed and revoked by the legislature at any time. It is urged, however, that Kreamer had expended several hundred dollars on the ferry after this supplement was passed, and before the grant to the Crows by the Act of 1872. Everything which could be required for a ferry, either for public convenience or private benefit, was enjoined by the Act of 1866. It is not shown that this work was in addition, and if it was, it was merely voluntary, outside of the requirements of the law. If a man does merely what he was required by his contract to do, in consequence of some new promise, it furnishes no new consideration. If A. promises B. that if he will immediately pay him the one-half of the sum then due on his bond he will forgive him the residue, it furnishes no bar to the recovery of the whole. Kreamer has failed to show that he expended a dollar in consequence of this supplement beyond and above what he was bound to do before its enactment, consequently there is no consideration for this additional privilege. It could be revoked or disregarded by the legislature at any time. Was it revoked? That depends on the proper construction of the Act of April 12th 1872, Pamph. L. 1130. This statute does not, in terms, repeal the Act of 1867, but it is entirely inconsistent with its provisions. It substantially revokes the supplement on which the claim is founded, by entirely disregarding it, and conferring the same privilege on another. The rights granted by it are in effect conferred on the Crows, who owned the land on the west side of the river, and who claimed the privilege of landing their boats at any place along the Millersburg front, not actually occupied by Kreamer or his grantee. This grant is an implied <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>repeal of that given to Kreamer by the supplement. Implied repeals are not to be favored, but when a later law is entirely inconsistent with an earlier one, the latter is at an end, according to the legal maxim, <em>leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogarít. </em>The legislature could not by a repeal affect the rights of Kreamer, under the Act of 1866, it was a contract; the Act of 1867 conferred a mere gift, which could be revoked, and was by the grant to the Crows.”</p>

The great rivers of the Commonwealth are held as the common property of all the citizens of the state for public use. No presumption will arise that the legislature intends to part with any portion of the public domain, unless upon the most clear and express terms. A privilege to a private person to use the public right for his private gain, will not be deemed exclusive unless the intent of the legislature is perfectly clear. All these great rights are held in trust for the general good, and the representatives of the people must be deemed to be not guilty of a breach of this trust, or a dereliction of duty. Hence nothing less than a plain contract between the state and the individual for an adequate consideration can bind the hands of the state and prevent the repeal of a mere privilege. Conceding for the occasion merely that the Act of 21st March 1866, contained a contract for a perpetual privilege granted to Joseph Kreamer to keep a ferry, over the Susquehanna at Millersburg, it contained no grant of an exclusive privilege. The privilege, therefore, was subject to the undoubted right to grant similar privileges to others. Therefore, when by the Act of April 15th 1867, the legislature made the right of Joseph Kreamer exclusive, it conferred a new right, which it protected by a penalty upon others infringing it; but required no new duty, and no compensation to the state. The mere fact that the title of the act was, <em>“ </em>A supplement to an act, &amp;c,” does not import a consideration. It was not an enlargement of powers under the former act to give it further effect, and to be. taken as a part of the former grant, but it was an enlargement by way of a new and greater grant. No consideration appearing for the new contract, and the state desiring to protect Kreamer merely by a penalty, it would be contrary to the rule of presumptions as to duties and powers of the legislature to suppose a binding contract <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>under the Act of 1867. The Act of 1872, conferring a ferry right on Isaac Crow, was therefore no unconstitutional interference with the rights of Joseph Kreamer.</p>
