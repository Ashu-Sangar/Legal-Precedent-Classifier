When the carriage was delivered a bill of lading was given by defendants, which provided that except when their agents were guilty of gross negligence, the company was not responsible for injuries that might arise “from the damages of seas or railroad,” &amp;c., “ or from fire,” &amp;c. Two or three days after the shipment Mr. Miller received notice from the freight agent of the company of the arrival of the carriage in a damaged condition, and that inquiry would he made as to the occasion thereof. Mr. Miller called upon the agent and found the carriage badly injured, evidently by fire, and refused to accept it. The carriage was stored by the company and afterwards sold for charges.</p>

That is, to find for the plaintiff you must find as a fact from the evidence, that the railroad company or some of its employees neglected to do something which a man of ordinary care and prudence would do to take care of this property; or that they did some affirmative, positive act that a person of ordinary care and prudence would not have done, and that that neglect —the want of the exercise of that prudence and care — contributed to and was the cause of this fire and injury, and you will take all the testimony in regard to that.”</p>

Second, it submitted to the jury to find negligence when there was no evidence sufficient to authorize any inference of it.</p>

How much more so the refusal to furnish the owner with any information as to how the injury occurred. Mere silence is a presumption of negligence: Logan <em>v. </em>Mathers, 6 Barr 459; Brown <em>v. </em>Schock, 27 P. F. Smith 471; Bryant <em>v. </em>Stillwell, 12 Harris 317.
