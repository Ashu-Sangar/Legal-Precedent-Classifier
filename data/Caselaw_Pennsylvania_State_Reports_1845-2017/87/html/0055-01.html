In the application of this rule courts have allowed it in cases which apparently ought to have been excluded by the rule. The objection on the part of plaintiff to allow said checks or indebtedness to be treated as a set-off is based on the ground that they are not due by the bank in the same right; that two of said checks are signed by the defendant as assignee, and that the credit of the defendant on the books of the bank is in the name of the defendant as ‘assignee,’ and the fact admitted in the case stated that said credit was in fact for trust funds of the assigned estate of John Krause to the defendant, and another for the benefit of creditors. There is no doubt that the objection would be well taken if said credit had been in the name of the defendant as . one of the assignees of John Krause for the benefit of creditors. It is contended on the part of the defendant 'that the addition of the word ‘ assignee’ to the name of the defendant as depositor does not, without any further designation, give the deposit the character of a trust fund, and make the depositor a creditor of the bank in a fiduciary character. In other words, it is claimed that the word ‘ assignee’ is mere surplusage, and that the credit in its legal effect between the depositor and the bank is the credit of the depositor in his individual right, and as such he has a legal right to the deposit, and to sue for and recover the same: Swartwout <em>v. </em>Bank, <a href="/denio/5/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Denio 555" data-case-ids="1881404" data-case-paths="/denio/5/0555-01">5 Denio 555</a>. Swartwout was collector of customs in the city of New York, and kept an account with defendants in the name of ‘ Samuel Swartwout, collector,’ which was continued to Nov. 1st 1838, when there was a' balance to his credit of $751.26. During the same period he kept another <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>account with the defendants in the name of ‘Samuel Swartwout.’ This account was balanced September 11th 1838. In May 1844, the plaintiff’s interest on the former account was assigned to one F. J., and a check drawn for the same and signed ‘Samuel Swartwout, late collector,’ presented to the defendants, which they refused to pay. On suit brought by Swartwout, the Supreme Court of New York held that where a public officer deposits money in a bank upon an account kept in his own name, with his official addition, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is presumed and regarded as his own funds and subject to his drafts. The reason for this decision, as collected from the opinion of the court, seems to be that the defendants, to protect themselves from payment to the plaintiff, must show that by their account so kept they are liable to pay the United States this balance.</p>

Yet it was held that the garnishees were liable to the attaching creditor, although the jury found that all the funds were deposited and drawn out by the defendant as agent for others. It does not clearly appear from the history of the case whether the bank had knowledge at the time the money was deposited that it did not, in fact, belong to the depositor, but the fact that it stood in his name, and apparently subject to the operation- of the attachment, shows the bank had no right to pay out the money to the defendant, on the information that it belonged to him as agent.

So also where money attached in the hands of a person received in the name of the defendant in the attachment, but in <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>fact the money of a third person, that this fact could he set up as a defence by the garnishee when notice had been given by the true owner, or where the latter appeared in court and sought its assistance to protect him against the attaching creditor.</p>

For a deposit of money in bank is nothing less than a loan or contract between the parties, and if put in that form, the right of recovery can only be had in that way and in no other. But a deposit by a person designating himself simply “assignee,” though it may have been known at the time by the depository that it was a particular trust fund (which however is not alleged in the case stated), does not necessarily make the contract of loaning between the depository and the depositor other than an individual or personal one in his own right. Would he be obliged to bring suit in his name as one of the assignees of John Krause for the benefit of creditors against the depository to recover the money ? We think not. If in that form then his co-assignee, Levin J. Krause, would necessarily have to join also, for if the word ‘ assignee’ in the credit, coupled with the admission that the money deposited was in fact money belonging to said trust, did not constitute a contract of loaning with the defendant in his individual right, then it must follow that it is a contract by implication with, both assignees in their fiduciary character. But such a conclusion we are not willing to admit. If that were so and the money was lost, Levin J. Krause might possibly be held liable for a devastavit, though he may have had no knowledge of the transaction whatever. But it may be said that assignees for the benefit of creditors occupy the relation of agents to his <em>cestui que trust </em>as principals. That is not so. .The only relation between them is as trustee and <em>cestui que </em>trusts, bearing no resemblance to that of principals and agents. In them as trustees is the legal title and ownership of the trust estates, and in that sense it cannot be said that they are agents of the <em>cestui que trusts </em>as principals. For as between principal and agent the legal title of money belonging to the principal is always in him, though deposited by the agent in his own name fraudulently or otherwise. While that is so he is not bound to invoke his right, but if he does, the depository is obliged to render it to the principal and not to the agent. It is this principle which governs the relation of principal and agent that controlled nearly all the cases above cited, but it has no application to the case under consideration, either as between the parties thereto or the defendant and his <em>cestui que trusts. </em>The <em>cestui que trusts </em>certainly could not give notice to the bank not to pay the money to the assignee, in whatever form he may have deposited it; neither could they bring suit for the recovery of the money. They have, it is true, a remedy to <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>remove an unfaithful trustee, and possibly as auxiliary to the former remedy by proper process, restrain him from recovering the trust funds in his hands. In the proceeding now before the court, the plaintiff has no right to assent, either in his own interest or to protect the <em>cestui que trusts </em>of the defendant, that the fund loaned by the defendant to the plaintiff in fact belonged to the trust estate of John Krause, to defeat the defendant’s right of set-off, unless the former shows conclusively that the contract of loan by the defendant was in his fiduciary character as one of the assignees of John Krause for the benefit of creditors. There are other safeguards thrown around <em>cestui que trusts, </em>and courts are not bound to supervise the transactions of trustees with respect to trust funds in every form they may incidentally come before them.</p>

Rut if it contains all the necessary facts and embraces the whole controversy, the court annexes the proper legal consequences. According to the argument of the learned counsel, the defect so far as the judgment below is concerned, is admittedly not that the facts are not sufficiently stated, or of a kind of which the judgment could not be properly predicated, but that the question was not in so many words asked of the court. The question certainly was asked in the very act of submission. The court was substantially called upon to declare the legal aspect of the case stated.</p>

It is not the case of a deposit made by his assignor, to whose right he succeeded as official trustee for certain beneficiaries, but a contract of deposit made with himself in the first instance; and it makes no difference in such a case whether he styles him assignee for creditors, or presents himself unclothed with his fiduciary title, it being analogous to the case of a contract made with an executor or administrator of a decedent, after the death of the testator or decedent: Grier <em>v. </em>Huston, 8 S. &amp; R. 404; Kline <em>v. </em>Guthart, <a href="/pen-w/2/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 490" data-case-ids="8879273" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0490-01">2 P. &amp; W. 490</a>; Wilmarth <em>v. </em>Monntford, 8 S. &amp; R. 124.</p>

No other could check for the money, or prevent its payment to him. The word <em>“ </em>assignee ” appended to his name in the account, did not earmark the fund, and gave it no identity as belonging to any particular person or fund. Assignee of whom, or for whom, or of what fund was it ? Nothing in the addition answers these questions. Leibert’s checks were therefore good for the purposes indicated on their face. The fact that they were received under protest made no difference. What right had the bank to protest ? Its duty was payment to its depositor, and the checks were sufficient vouchers. The protest could avail no one else, for it was not a trustee for another. All it could do was to pay the money to Leibert. The checks were therefore his appropriation of his deposit to the purpose expressed, of which the bank had notice when they were received. The delay in payment resulting from the refusal and protest did not change the effect of the appropriation. The money being in the hands of the bank <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>itself, and subject to Ms draft, and the checks being an immediate appropriation of this money, operated to extinguish the notes held by the bank against Leibert. It was not a mere assignment of a fund in the hands of a third party, but a direct application of the money which the bank itself held, and was bound to pay over to him to the notes in question, and therefore the bank was bound so to apply it. On what principle can the bank with the money in its own hands, and a direction to apply it to payment, maintain suit on the notes, and recover the cash, leaving the money in its hands already appropriated, to go to payment of its other debts ? Clearly this would be grossly inequitable. The question propounded in the case stated is, whether Leibert was liable to pay the notes in cash at the suit of the bank ? The court answered this substantially correctly. The criticism on the so-called set-off is therefore unavailing.</p>
