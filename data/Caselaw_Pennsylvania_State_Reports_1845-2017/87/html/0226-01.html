Executions were issued on the same day and Yenter’s personal property was sold, producing a sum sufficient to pay the first four judgments in full and a portion of that in favor of Hemphill. After the issuing of the executions, viz., on January <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>24th, Yenter made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to John O. Miller. After some time it appeared that the costs charged by the sheriff upon the writs of execution were in excess of the legal fees, and Yenter having, on June 29th, procured from Hemphill an assignment of his interest in such excess, the sheriff, on July 6th paid to George B. Orlady, Yenter’s counsel, the sum of $131.50, which, without the assignment, would have been applied upon Hemphill’s judgment. On the same day Lorenz issued this attachment, which was served upon Orlady and Yenter. On August 20th, upon the application of Yenter, a rule was granted upon Lorenz to show cause why the attachment should not be dissolved, which the court (Dean, P. J.,) afterwards, on February 20th 1878, made absolute, at the same time directing the fund “to be paid to assignee of insolvent debtor, Z. Yenter, less his reasonable counsel fees.”</p>

The rights of the parties could not be disposed of in this summary manner. Much more was it error to award the fund in the hands of the garnishee to the assignee of the insolvent debtor. The assignee had made no claim to the fund, was not in court nor represented by counsel. He had no right to the fund, for the plain reason that it had been acquired by Tenter several months after the assignment. It could not, therefore, have passed to his assignee. Whether the money in the hands of Orlady, the garnishee, and who was also Yenter’s counsel, is liable to attachment, is a question that must be settled in the usual manner. The attachment was dissolved upon the petition of Yenter, the defendant. He has a right to appear and plead to the attachment, and by his plea to have all such matters of fact put in issue so that they may be tried by a jury: Pleasants <em>v. </em>Cowden, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 379" data-case-ids="481738" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0379-01">7 W. &amp; S. </a><a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a><a href="/watts-serg/7/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 379" data-case-ids="481738" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0379-01">379</a>. The garnishee also has the right to have a jury pass upon disputed questions of fact, if there be any. It was not the right of either the defendant or the garnishee to have the attachment dissolved in a summary manner.</p>
