But after the organization of the company, a condition is binding and obligatory, and ordinarily, this is so, though it rests in parol, if, except for such condition, the- subscription would not have been made. The latter part of this proposition is subject, however, to the qualification that the rights of co-subscribers are not affected thereby: Bowser <em>v. </em>Bedford, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%2029" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="12 Wright 29">12 Wright 29</a> ; Caley <em>v. </em>The Railroad Co., 30 P.

    <p id="b336-8" data-blocks='[["BL_336.9",336,[254,1240,1162,865]]]'>Now, as at the time the defendants entered into the contract in suit, the plaintiff was a chartered and fully organized corporation, it had all the powers to make contracts, conditional or unconditional, by deed or in parol, that are possessed by natural persons. This being so, it remains to inquire whether the offer of the defendants comes within the rules which permit the introduction of oral testimony to add to or vary the terms of a written instrument. And, first, supposing the proposed oral conditions to be admissible, as between the company and the defendants, would their interposition prove to be injurious to, or in fraud of, the rights of co-subscribers? Would the effect be to relieve the defendants from payment whilst their fellows in the common adventure would be still held ? An affirmation of this proposition determines the question against the offer proposed. For it would be intolerable that one, who had joined with others in a common undertaking, should be permitted to escape from the common burthen by the interposition of a condition of which his co-obligors had no knowledge. The inequitable character of such a transaction becomes obvious when we reflect, that one in this manner would not merely relieve himself, but would thereby add to the burthen of the others.</p>

All might have taken advantage of them, and though some may not have seen fit so to do, yet that is no fault of the defendants, and, for such reason, they cannot be deprived of a common right. The proposed proof was that all the subscriptions, contained in the book, offered by the plaintiff, were obtained for a special purpose; that they were to be applied to the building of a branch from the main road, at Burns <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>Junction, to the town of. Selinsgrove, and that these subscriptions were not to be of force until they represented an amount fully equal to $20,000. These stipulations were reasonable and proper. The subscribers desire to have the road built to Selinsgrove; for this purpose and none other they will agree to pay their money, and that there may be a reasonable certainty that this design be fulfilled, they stipulate that if the subscriptions do not amount to a figure that will insure this reasonable certainty, then the whole adventure is to be treated as abandoned. Had the company fulfilled the first condition,'by building the road to Selinsgrove, the second might be disregarded, for the main design, to wit, the construction of the improvement, being accomplished, the necessity for the second would fall, and the subscriber could not allege a want' of consideration for the money which he had agreed to pay. But the company did nothing of the kind; it did not build the road, hence, any one can see that it would be a most inequitable perversion of the agreement should these people be compelled to pay for that which was not embraced in their compact; that is, for the construction of the main line instead of the branch.</p>

This offer brought the proposition within the rule which allows of the introduction of parol evidence to add to or vary the terms of a written contract, for it is clear, that the attempt to enforce the writing, without the oral conditions, was but an attempt to enforce what was not the contract of the parties, and if successful, would be a fraud on the rights of the defendants.

The 8th section thereof provides that “the capital stock of such company shall be divided into shares of $50 each, and shall be called in and paid at such times and places, and in such proportions and instalments, not, however, exceeding $5 per share in any period of thirty days, as the directors shall require, of which public notice shall be given for at least two weeks next preceding the time or times appointed for that purpose.” It does seem, therefore, that the statute contemplates notice, and unless the officers of this corpora<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>tion may disregard this plain precept, they cannot move until it has been complied with.</p>
