It was provided therein that a committee should be appointed, who should advertise for proposals, make contracts subject to the approval of councils, and employ an engineer, to prepare the necessary plans and specifications. The engineer, with the authority of the committee, but without the approval of councils, entered into a parol contract with a company to make certain connections in the pipes. In the performance of this contract, through defective machinery and negligent work, on the part of the company, an explosion occurred, whereby S. was injured and died. <em>Held, </em>that the city was responsible.</p>

      <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>At the trial it appeared, that on the 8th of March 1871, the city by ordinance directed the construction of new waterworks and a reservoir, and authorized the appointment of a committee, who were specially charged with the duty of advertising for proposals, making contracts, employing an engineer to prepare plans, &amp;c. All contracts, however, were to be made subject to the approval of councils. The committee employed H. P. M. Birkenbine, as engineer, and made contracts for the work, awarding to the Harrisburg Foundry and Machine Company, the contract for two pumping-engines and for the erection of the stand-pipe, and to Heikel, Opperman &amp; Co., that for making the foundations for the engines, engine-house, boilers, &amp;c. During the progress of the work, in order to keep the city supplied with water, it became necessary to connect .the stand-pipe with the old reservoir. It was decided to connect the sixteen-inch main with the twenty-four inch forcing-pipe, leading from the stand-pipe toward what was called the low-pressure engine, not then in place, by bringing the sixteen-inch pipe from Front street, around the stand-pipe, and connecting it by means of a Y with the twenty-four inch forcing-main, between the place for the low-pressure engine and the stand-pipe. The contract for the work was, as above set forth, given by the water committee, through Mr. Birkenbine, to the Harrisburg Foundry and Machine Company, without the previous sanction, or subsequent ratification of councils. By the terms of that contract, which was in parol, the company was to cast the pipe according to drawings furnished by the engineer, Birkenbine, furnish all the material and labor, put the pipe in place, and make the connections, and to be paid for the same what the work and material were reasonably worth.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[138,1620,1164,129]]]'>The drawings for the Y casting furnished by the engineer, had on them what are called lugs, or projections for clamps, or stirrups, and the Y was cast with these lugs for clamps upon it.'</p>

The clamps or stirrups, were not put on the Y, as indicated by the drawing supplied by the engineer, so as to make it secure. The pipes were only soldered together by a plumber, in the employ of the company. The city was thus supplied with water for about twenty days, when it was arranged to pump the water, into the new reservoir. On the morning when the attempt was made, it was found that the engine was being run carelessly by the superintendent of the Machine Company, who was in person driving and directing its running. Saylor, the deceased, wTas at work with other employees of Heikel, Opperman &amp; Co., in a pit separated by a board partition from the engine, preparing the foundations for the second engine. A leak was sprung in the pipe near to the Y, the water from which ran into the pit where Saylor and the others were working. Some of <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>them noticed it and observed that the water increased with every thump of the engine. The attention of one of the firm of Heilcel, Offerman &amp; Co., being called to this, he directed his employees to come out of the pit, which they did. After being out, Saylor, with others, went back into the pit to get their coats. On his way out again, the pressure from the engine having been increased, the Y blew off, tearing away a wall in front of it, scattering debris in all directions and dropping itself down into the pit, injuring Saylor, from the effects of which he died within about forty-eight hours.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[252,798,1169,393]]]'>It appeared that the cause of the accident was the rapidity with which the engine was run, and the neglect to clamp or stirrup the Y connection. There was a conflict of testimony as to whether the return of Saylor for his coat contributed to his death. The evidence was also conflicting as to whether the connection was made by the direction and under the supervision of the engineer, Birkenbine, or whether the company was exercising an independent employment in making the same. The workmen were paid by the company, who charged their wages in their account with the city.</p>

So you will weigh the matter and examine the evidence touching upon this with some care, and determine whether the contract was made between the Harrisburg Foundry and Machine Company and Mr. Birkenbine to do this work and make this connection and furnish the castings from the plans furnished by Mr. Birkenbine, but at the same time to do it as a work of their own; or were they employed by Mr. Birkenbine, simply to do it with their hands, under his direction ? If in the former way, then the city would not be responsible. If under the direction of Mr. Birkonbine, the agent of the city, the engineer of the works — if he had <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>the management and control of those hands — gave directions how the work was to be done, then the city would be responsible.

[If you determine that the city had control of the engine at that time, and that it caused the separation, it was their negligence.] But if under the control of the Harrisburg Foundry and Machine Company, and they, by an improper use of that engine, whilst they were there and having it under their control, and without directions or instructions from the city, used it in that way, so as to contribute to that accident, it would relieve the city from responsibility, or its consequences.”</p>

Whatever power was vested in the committee on new waterworks to make contracts was delegated to them by the city, under the restrictions contained in the ordinance, not to the engineer or other person; and that power could not be sub-delegated. It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show by affirmative' proof the authority for making the contract. It was, therefore, error in the court below to assume, in the face of indubitable proof to the contrary, that the engineer “had ample power” to make the contract out of which the action arose.

It was undisputed that he went back on his own motive, after he had received notice of the danger, and had for that reason left the pit, and was safely out of harm’s way. He went back subsequently, not for us, or by our order. There was, therefore, no room -for the judge to put the question, “Was it contributory negligence in going back into the pit?” Whether a given state of undisputed facts constitute negligence, is a question of law. There is nothing for a jury to do — the facts being conceded or not denied — but to apply the law as' it is declared from the bench. If there was any question on this branch of this case for the jury at all, it was, “Did the deceased’s going back into the pit contribute to his injury and death?” The court nowhere, either in the general charge, or in answer to the points, put on both sides, touch that, the real point, if the question was to go to the jury at all.'
