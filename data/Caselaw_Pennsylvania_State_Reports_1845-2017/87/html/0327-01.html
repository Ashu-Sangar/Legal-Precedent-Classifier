    <p class="summary" id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[263,506,1164,474]]]'>The fund arose from a sale upon a levari facias on mortgage of Hugh P. Sheller, against John H. Beale, under which certain real estate situate in the borough of Lewisburg, was sold by the sheriff on the 2d day of December 1876. As to part of the real estate sold, the terms not being complied with by the purchaser, there was a return made to that effect, and an alias levari facias was subsequently issued, returnable to February term 1877. This writ was afterwards, however, stayed, some arrangement being made by which the property was taken by the purchasers at the sheriff’s sale. The court confirmed the sale to them, and on the 24th day of May 1877, the sheriff paid the fund into court.</p>

H. Dill, Esq., upon the street, and after remarking that both Mr, Dill and himself were endorsers for Beale, inquired whether, if Beale made a deed to him to secure his endorsers, the same would be a valid security for them, to which Mr. Dill gave an affirmative answer. The deed was subsequently made and was delivered by Beale to Frick at Beale’s store, in the presence of, and after the deed had been inspected casually by, Mr. Dill. Upon delivering it Beale stated to Frick the purpose for which the deed was made. At the time the deed was made Beale told Frick that its purpose was to secure the endorsements; the endorsers meant being Henry Frick, Philip Billmyer, A. H. Dill, and Thomas Reber. Some endorsements were upon notes in bank, which had been renewed from time to time, and other endorsements were for money borrowed from Charity Lodge, A. Y. M. At the time the deed was made the consideration therein expressed appears to have <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>been about tbe aggregate amount of the endorsements. The deed is dated January 22d 1876, from John H. Beale and Mary T., his wife, to Henry Frick, of a certain two-story brick dwelling and lot of ground in Lewisburg, for the consideration of $4250; was acknowledged on the 22d day of January 1876, and recorded on the 26th day of July 1876.</p>

The deed had been placed upon record on the morning pf this same day, and at this meeting Frick declared, in the hearing of Sheller and of all present, that he held the deed for the security of Philip Billmyer in one endorsement; of Henry Frick in two endorsements; of Henry Frick and Thomas Beber in- one endorsement, which was for money borrowed from Charity Lodge; of Thomas Beber in one endorsement; and also for the security of Messrs.

There were also two other judgment obligations written, one for Sheller of $1443.88, consolidating two claims he held against John H.

Beale to Henry Erick, dated January 22d 1876, was a mortgage, for the reason that it was accompanied with a defeasance, which was not placed upon record until after the judgment of Mr. Sheller had been entered. This, without more, would have brought the case within the rule laid down in Friedley <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 17 S. &amp; R. 70, and followed uniformly since, that an absolute deed and defeasance, made at the same time, constitute a mortgage; and if the defeasance be not recorded, it is to be considered as an unrecorded mortgage and post<a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>poned to a judgment-creditor of a subsequent date, notwithstanding the absolute deed has been duly recorded. But the auditor also found that Sheller, the judgment-creditor, had notice of the true character of the deed before he entered his judgment. He therefore excluded Sheller from participating in the residue of the fund after the payment of the paramount mortgage, and gave it to the endorsers and parties interested in the deed. The court below reversed the auditor upon exceptions, and allowed Sheller to come in <em>pro rata </em>with the parties above referred to, for the reason that even if Sheller had notice of the true character of the deed when he entered up his judgment, he had not such notice at the time the debt was contracted.</p>
    <p id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.6",331,[154,946,1168,1083]]]'>We do not think it necessary to discuss this question, as we are of opinion there was not sufficient evidence in the case to establish the defeasance. The deed of January 22d 1876 is absolute upon its face. The paper executed by Frick on July 27th 1876 is a declaration of trust, and lacks every essential element of a defeasance. This was conceded by the auditor. He says: “The defeasance is not to be found in th'e deed dated July 27th 1876, and recorded August 7th following, but rests in parol, and began to exist as soon as the deed from John H. Beale to Henry Frick came into existence.” The auditor was evidently misled as to the true character of the transaction by the statement of some of the witnesses that Frick, the grantee, had declared that the deed was given “ to secure the endorsers.” There is no doubt it was given with a view to the security of the endorsers, but not in the sense of a trust in which Beale, the grantor, was to have any future or resulting interest. The consideration named in the deed was the precise amount of the endorsements, and was as much as the property was worth at a full valuation. The testimony of Beale, the grantor, is explicit upon this point. He says: “The character of the deed was that the property was to be sold and the proceeds go into bank to lift the notes these men were endorsers for. There was nothing said about what was to be done with the property in case I paid the notes on which these men became endorsers; I never took that into consideration. I knew that I had not the means to pay the notes. If Mr. Frick paid the notes the property was to be his.”</p>
