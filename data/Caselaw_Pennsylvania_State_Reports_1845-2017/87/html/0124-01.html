Hendrickson, who had become the agent of the company, made a survey of Barr’s property, for the purpose of insuring other buildings which he owned, and about the 1st of May 1870, Barr signed an application for the term of three years, the policy to include the buildings theretofore insured and others, the whole amount of insurance being $8800. This application and the premium, $48.80, Barr handed to Hendrickson, who gave him a receipt, which set forth, “that he will be'insured upon the property specified in said application, $8800, for three years from date, if the same be approved by the direc,tors.” On May 6th 1870, the company issued a policy to Barr, <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>insuring the property designated in his application for the term of three years, from .May 3d 1870.

I don’t know that he ever gave, it back to me. It is not in my possession. I have no recollection of Mr. Hendrickson ever returning it to me. The old policy expired on May 31st 1870. The new policy was to expire three years from the expiration of the old one, which would be on May 31st 1873. I do not remember the exact day that I called on Hendrickson and gave him the note and paid him the cash to effect the new insurance, but it was some time in the latter part of April 1870. I was at Mt. Joy; Hendrickson called me across the street and reminded me of the expiration of my old policy of insurance; I then asked him whether I could arrange it that day; that I had proposed going away, and would probably not be home on the 31st of May, when the old policy expired. He said that if I was prepared it could be arranged that day. I mentioned to him about and spoke to him of the time of the expiration of the old policy. He said we could date the receipt on the 31st, on the day of the expiration of the old policy. I paid him $48.80, took his receipt for the amount; receipt dated May 31st, the expiration of the old policy. I signed an application without date or being filed — a blank application; I signed a note with the amount without date, with the understanding and agreement that the policy and the note should correspond with the receipt as to date. * * * Mr. Hendrickson did not return the fifty-five cents, or any other sum, for the unexpired term of the first policy from May 3d to May 31st 1870.

The first does not need an extended discussion.

While there are instances in the books where judgments have been reversed for the refusal to allow leading questions where the party was entitled to put them, I know of no reversal in Pennsylvania for allowing a leading question. Susquehanna Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Quick, 11 P. F. Smith 328, is not an exception, as in that case there were a number of other assignments of error which were sustained. The reason for this is manifest. The form of a question, whether it shall be put as leading or otherwise, depends not upon an inflexible rule, but upon a variety of circumstances which must of necessity be left to the discretion of the court below. Thus a party may be surprised by his own witness, and after he has placed him on the stand, discover that he is hostile, in which case it is settled law that he may be asked leading questions as if upon cross-examination. The rule is thus laid down in Starkie on Evidence 147 : “ Thus a party’s own witness, who, having given one account of the matter, <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>when called on the trial gives a different account, may be asked by the .party calling him, whether he had given such account, stating it, to the attorney ; and if a witness called stands in a situation which of necessity makes him adverse to the party calling him, counsel may cross-examine him.” The mere manner of the witness when on the stand may be such as to justify the court in permitting leading questions. It is needless to multiply instances. It is said in Sharswood’s notes to Starkie, at page 150, that “ the allowance of a leading question is within the discretion of the court, and not the subject of a writ of error, although the refusal to allow a party to put a leading question who is entitled to do so upon cross-examination isand a number of authorities are cited in support of the text. The same doctrine is laid down in Greenleaf, § 435. We are not obliged to go so far in this case, however. The witness Hertzler was called by the plaintiffs to contradict Hendrickson, a witness called by the defendants, after the ground had been previously laid by the cross-examination of Hendrickson. Thus, taking the first assignment of error as an illustration, Hendrickson had been asked upon his cross-examination: “ Did you not state to Mr. Barr, in presence of H. B. Hertzler, that his policy would soon expire ; that he must not neglect it ?” The ground having thus been laid, the plaintiffs called Mr. Hertzler to the stand to contradict Hendrickson as to this particular matter. How was this to be done ? Clearly by putting the question to the witness in the same language in which it had been put to Hendrickson. Hertzler was therefore asked, “Did Mr. Hendrickson state to John K. Barr in your presence that his policy of insurance would soon expire, and that he must not neglect it?” Nothing less than this would have been just to the witness sought to be contradicted. Nothing less would amount to a contradiction. Unless it is a denial in terms it is no denial at all. I have always understood this to be the practice, and I am not aware of any authority against it. The only case cited in opposition to this view, Susquehanna Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Quick, supra, has no application. In that case the witness, Quick, was not called to contradict anything that another witness had said, but merely to prove what occurred at a conversation. The witness having been asked a question clearly leading, it was very properly held to have been improper. The rule is laid down in Starkie, at page 148, to be: “ So, where a witness is called in order to contradict the testimony of a former witness, who has stated that such and such expressions were used, or such and such things were said, it is the usual practice to ask whether those particular expressions were used, or those things were said Avithout putting the question in general form by inquiring what was said. If this Avere not to be alloAved, it is obvious that much irrelevant and inadmissible matter would frequently be detailed by the witness.”</p>
