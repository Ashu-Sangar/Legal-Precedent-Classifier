True the plea of no lien is held to be no plea, but under the statutory plea of payment the defendant may give in evidence anything which goes to show the plaintiff is not entitled to recover: Act of 1705, Bright. Purd. 487. We submit that there is nothing in the evidence that shows that on the 17th day of April 1876, when this order was given and received, that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiffs on any other account than for the plumbing and gas-fitting in these two houses. And even if there was no specific appropriation of it at the time, the law would apply it to the account due and owing. And therefore it was error in the court below to submit this question to the jury upon a general proposition as contained in the plaintiff’s first point. The street-washer was no part of the original contract. It was something not attached to the house at all. The court had no right, as a matter of law, to decide the question of fact whether or not this street washer was a substitution for the hose-plates, required by the original contract.</p>

And our case is stronger in this, that when we were required to do this work, it was as a part of the original contract for which we were to get nothing, and for which we have gotten nothing.</p>

    <p id="b418-7" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[304,725,1163,1370]]]'>The third assignment, however, must be sustained. There was evidence that the contract for plumbing and gas-fitting was substantially completed, and was accepted by defendant as finished before May 10th 1876, and that defendant claimed that the work had not been done according to contract, and that plaintiffs agreed to do, and did do, other outside work to compensate for the deficiency. There was a street-washer put in June 28th 1876, according to Eailey’s testimony. According to the evidence given by Samuel Jarvis, McKelvey, the defendant, met him and complained about the arrangement he was using for a hose. “ I told him that never was put in for that purpose at all; it was merely a branch put in for the use of the bricklayers to make mortar, and that the street-washer arrangement had been overlooked. He said our arrangement was to put in a hose-plate for each house. I admitted that, and we talked the matter over a little, and he wanted it done right away, and he proposed the street-washer; wanted to know if that would answer in place of the other two. I said it would if he was satisfied, and he says, ‘Go ahead and put it in.’ ” This evidence certainly covered the facts presented in the defendant’s third point, which ought, therefore, to have been affirmed, for if the jury believed on this testimony that the street-washer was outside work, done to compensate the deficiency in the work done under the contract, it ought not to preserve the lien. In like manner we think the refusal to affirm the defendant’s fourth point was error, for certainly if the jury found that the contract was completed before May 10th 1876, the claim having been filed November 10th 1876, work or materials furnished after that time under any new arrangement or with any purpose whatever would not preserve the lien. We are of opinion also that there was error in refusing defendant’s fifth point, which was sufficiently based upon the evidence of Jarvis above stated, independently of any evidence offered and ruled out.</p>
