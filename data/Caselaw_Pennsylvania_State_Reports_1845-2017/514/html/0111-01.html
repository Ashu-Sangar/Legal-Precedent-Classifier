After being held over for court following a preliminary hearing, Appellee filed a Motion to Quash Return of the Municipal Court transcript. After argument, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Kiester, J., specially presiding) ordered Appellee discharged for lack of a <em>prima facie </em>case. The order was temporarily vacated, but then reinstated. Superior Court (Montemuro, Beck and Watkins, JJ.) affirmed in a Memorandum Opinion, <a href="/citations/?q=341%20Pa.%20Super.%20619" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="341 Pa.

Appellee then allegedly obtained coupons from a source other than Esquire and mailed most of the coupons to General Mills and Eastern Coupon Clear<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>ing House, again in Esquire’s name. When General Mills or Eastern Coupon Clearing House mailed reimbursement checks to Esquire, Appellee allegedly intercepted the checks, endorsed Esquire’s name on the back of the checks, endorsed his own name on the back of the checks, and then deposited the checks in his own personal account. Forty-eight such checks, in the total amount of $4,663.20, were allegedly intercepted and deposited.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The evidence reveals that no cash was found missing from Esquire Drugs (the store manager testified that the cash register balanced on each shift). It is unclear whether coupons submitted by Esquire’s customers to Esquire were ever taken from Esquire by Appellee or by anyone else. All of the informations lodged against Appellee relating to forgery listed Esquire Drugs as the “person prejudiced.” Likewise, the informations dealing with the theft charges specified Esquire Drugs as the owner of the property (checks) stolen. None of the informations was ever amended.</p>

Superior Court found that no abuse of discretion by the trial court had occurred in the instant case, reasoning that the Commonwealth, in the informations, failed to allege facts from which the trial court could have found a <em>prima facie </em>case of theft or forgery. Throughout the trial court proceedings, the Commonwealth framed the alleged crimes as being theft of property belonging to Esquire, and forgery which prejudiced the rights of Esquire Drugs. Superior Court believed that the trial court was correct in rejecting the Commonwealth’s contention that Esquire had any rights which could be prejudiced or property which could be taken in this case. While it is clear that the prejudice to a victim’s rights need not be pecuniary or proprietary in nature, Superior Court reasoned that there still must be some “right” which is being prejudiced. Superior Court did not <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>believe that the instant facts establish such a “right,” or at least that the facts were so clear and compelling as to warrant a finding of abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.</p>

    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[259,477,1157,1058]]]'>As to the theft charges, simply put, Esquire had a property interest or “right” in the checks issued in its name by virtue of the fact that it was the named payee on each of these forty-eight negotiable instruments that came into the possession or custody of its employee. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 13 P.S. § 1101, et. seq., the checks were delivered (§ 1201), and transferred (§ 3201) to Esquire Drugs — the payee (through Appellee, its employee or servant), and Esquire Drugs thus became a “holder” (§ 1201). Under § 3201(a) of the U.C.C., Esquire Drugs, the holder-transferee, was thus vested with “such rights as the transferor has therein.” Hence, it is clear that even though Esquire may not have had absolute title, Esquire, as transferee, still acquires the rights of the transferor. See, U.C.C., Comment No. 1 to § 3201.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Whether we regard Esquire as an involuntary bailee, or other holder of rights and therefore a holder of limited title or ownership in the checks, it is clear under the facts alleged that Esquire was deprived of its rights, title, or ownership interest in the property because of Appellee’s actions.</p>

He was held to have necessarily received the money “for or in the name or on account of his master or employer” (the police commissioner) under Maryland’s embezzlement statute although the money taken from the agent was to be used merely as evidence or only held for safekeeping. The Maryland Court held that its embezzlement statute did not require that ownership of the embezzled funds be in the master or employer, and that proof of any legal interest or special property in the money would suffice.

However, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Zappala in his dissent, the information upon which the Commonwealth relied did not accurately set forth the offenses committed. It is clear that it was not the property of Esquire that was converted by appellee, since Esquire was not entitled to these refunds and therefore was not prejudiced in any way. The person or entity who may have sustained a loss was not identified nor called upon to assert that loss and the absence of appellee’s authority to act on his or its behalf.
