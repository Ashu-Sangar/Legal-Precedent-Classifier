A tenant is not liable when his landlord fails to pay a utility bill, but, as established in 68 Pa.C.S. § 3311(b), a judgment against the Council would have constituted a lien against each individual condominium unit owner.

As to subsection one, we have already stated that the council and the unit owners herein are one and the same for the purposes of purchasing utilities for the residential use of the individual unit owners. This transaction is not between two “parties” but rather the representation by a purchasing agent for a group of residential dwellers. Subsection two’s reference to multiple dwellings must be interpreted in light of the section’s preceding references. The doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>mandates that “[g]eneral expressions used in a statute are restricted to things and persons similar to those specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expressions.” <em>Butler Fair and Agricultural Association </em>v. <em>Butler School District, </em><a href="/pa/389/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="389 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1273990" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0169-01">389 Pa. 169</a>, 178, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.2d%20214" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="132 A.2d 214">132 A.2d 214</a>, 219 (1957). In subsection two the. distinctive feature of the designated structures is their commercial aspect as well as the absence of ownership on the part of the dwellers. This is certainly contrary to the situation presented by a condominium setup. Applying this doctrine to subsection two of § 32.25, we conclude that the legislature intended to deny the refund to commercial multiple dwellings, but not <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>to a privately-owned condominium unit or units which happen to exist in a single complex.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
