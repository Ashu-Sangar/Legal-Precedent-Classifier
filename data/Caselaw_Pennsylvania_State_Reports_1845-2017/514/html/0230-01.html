It took responsibility for operating and maintaining these properties; security was one of these responsibilities. AMTRAK had to establish an operating railroad police force in short order.

The Court stated that federal law is concerned with the rights of strikers and found that the state claims directly and primarily concern the replacements’ rights.

Pursuant to a valid collective bargaining agreement, they were subsequently removed from those jobs. The removals were proper under the collective bargaining agreement. The workers, who relied on the employer’s promise, sued in state court and claimed that their rights under state law were violated. The claims were for breach of contract and misrepresentation. In <em>Belknap, </em>the N.L.R.B. under the NLRA was interested in protecting striking workers from unfair labor practices; it was not concerned with the replacements’ rights. Similarly here, the interest of the Board under the RLA here is the protection of the workers’ rights under the collective bargaining agreement. It has no interest in appellants’ state law rights because they arose separately from the collective bargaining agreement. Pennsylvania has an interest as strong as Kentucky or any other state in protecting its citizens from breaches of contract and misrepresentations.

The Supreme Court in <em>Belknap </em>also addressed another federal labor law preemption doctrine; that doctrine was set forth in <em>Lodge 76, International Association of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, </em><a href="/us/427/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="427 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6175136" data-case-paths="/us/427/0132-01">427 U.S. 132</a>, <a href="/us/427/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="427 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6175136" data-case-paths="/us/427/0132-01">96 S.Ct. 2548</a>, <a href="/us/427/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="427 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6175136" data-case-paths="/us/427/0132-01">49 L.Ed.2d 396</a> (1976). Under it, state law dealing with a party’s conduct during a labor dispute is preempted where Congress intentionally left that area unregulated. The Court held Congress intended labor disputes arising under the NLRA to be controlled by "the free play of economic forces," <em><a href="/us/427/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="427 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6175136" data-case-paths="/us/427/0132-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/427/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="427 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6175136" data-case-paths="/us/427/0132-01">at 140</a>, 96 S.Ct. at 2553, and left them unregulated. The Company in <em>Belknap </em>argued that the replacements' claims were preempted under this doctrine as well. The Court considered and rejected the Company’s arguments for preemption based on Congress’s intent to leave the conduct of strikes unregulated. We need not discuss this aspect of preemption further. It is not applicable or relevant to the case before us. In addition, the NLRA and RLA are materially different in this context. Congress did not intend railroad labor disputes to be resolved solely by the “free play of economic forces,” but has provided statutory mechanisms for dispute resolution without a work stoppage. <em>See </em>p. 235-237.</p>

The United States Supreme Court has held that individual employment contracts dealing with matters covered in collective bargaining agreements are invalid under the RLA apparently because they interfere with the collective relationship between the workers and their bargaining representative. <em>Order of Railroad Telegraphers v.

Collective bargaining agreements govern the employment relationship and deal with such matters as compensation, rules and working conditions for employees. <em><a href="/us/321/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="321 U.S. 342" data-case-ids="302085" data-case-paths="/us/321/0342-01">Id.</a> </em>They do not deal with recruitment except to the extent that certain trade union agreements use <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>hiring halls. <em>See Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.
