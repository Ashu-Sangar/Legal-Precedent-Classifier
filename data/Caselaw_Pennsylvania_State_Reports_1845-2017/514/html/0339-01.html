Two buildings are situated on this lot. In July of 1980 appellants listed the rear building, consisting of a three-car garage on the first floor and an apartment on the second floor, for sale. In August of 1980 the Zoning Officer of Ingram, John A. Sacco, informed the Reloskys through their realtor that the rear unit could not be sold because the property was not approved for subdivision. Appellants then contacted the Ingram Solicitor, Clarence Biggs, and informed him of the Zoning Officer’s ruling. Mr. Biggs advised appellants that if they wished to pursue the matter they should file for an occupancy permit with the Borough through the Zoning Officer’s office.</p>

Mr. Sacco subsequently informed the appellants that the Ingram Borough Council would take action on the matter at the next council meeting, scheduled for October 13, 1980. No transcript was prepared of this meeting. Appellants contend that Mr. Relosky attended the meeting, but was not allowed to present any testimony regarding his application. Appellants further contend that Mr. Biggs announced at the October 13 meeting that a decision had been made one week before to deny appellants’ application.

By letter of December 3, 1981, the Building Inspector, Mr. Sacco, rejected the request on the basis that subdivision would be in violation of Ingram Borough Ordinance No. 982, Section 1.7, requiring “the lot area per dwelling unit shall be not less than 5,000 square <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>feet for a One Family Dwelling, and not less than 2,500 square feet per dwelling unit for a Two Family Dwelling or Double House.” The letter stated that “You have approximately 5538 square feet [in the total property].

A hearing on the matter was held on October 12, 1982, and on the same day the Honorable Richard G. Zeleznik issued a writ of mandamus ordering appellees to grant appellants occupancy permits. Following the filing of exceptions, Judge Zeleznik issued an opinion stating that mandamus had been ordered because (1) Ingram Borough did not have a land subdivision ordinance and therefore had no basis to interfere with appellants’ proposed subdivision; (2) Ingram Borough had not followed the formal procedures set forth in Title IX of the Municipalities Planning Code; and (3) the proposed subdivision and sale would not affect the longstanding use of the property and thus would not increase the non-compliance with Ingram Borough Ordinance No. 982. Appellees appealed to Commonwealth Court which reversed the Court of Common Pleas, stating that mandamus was not warranted in the instant case because permitting separate occupancy permits for the two structures would clearly violate ordinance No. 982.</p>

The Council therefore acted as a <em>de facto </em>zoning hearing board at the hearing which occurred on October 13, 1980.

There was brief testimony by the Ingram Building Inspector at the October 12, 1982, hearing before Judge Zeleznik to the effect that the Borough did have a zoning hearing board, T.T. pgs. 45-46, but this testimony was not elaborated upon and appellees have not expressly argued anywhere in their brief that the Borough had a zoning hearing board. Since appellees would doubtless have pressed this position if it were so, we must assume for purposes of this appeal that Ingram Borough did not have a zoning hearing board and that individuals who were adversely affected by the Building Inspector’s decisions were customarily advised to proceed to the Borough Council.</p>

In our analysis it was unnecessary to reach the question as to whether or not the borough council was empowered to sit as a <em>de facto </em>zoning board. In response, however, to the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Zappala in his concurrence as to this subject, we cannot agree. The reasoning of the concurring opinion is in our judgment based upon a faulty syllogism. Rather than citing a legislative provision expressly articulating such a prohibition, the argument rests upon the fact that section 903, 53 P.S. § 10903, provides that where there is in fact a zoning board the members thereof may not hold any other municipal office. It clearly does not follow that the prohibition of section 903 prohibits the members of the governing body of the municipality, who are charged with the authority to enact zoning laws, 53 P.S. § 10601, to create planning commissions, 53 P.S. § 10201, to create zoning boards, 53 P.S. § 10901, and to appoint'the members of that board, 53 P.S. § 10913, would be powerless to act as a zoning board in the absence of such a body within the municipality.</p>

In addition, a written decision, containing the requisite findings of fact and supporting reasons, would obviously facilitate review.</p>

Section 903 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805 et seq. as amended, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq. (“Code”), specifically sets forth that, “[mjembers of the (zoning) board shall hold no other office in the municipality, except that no more than one member of the board may also be a member of the planning commission.” 53 P.S. § 10903.

In this situation where the Borough failed to create the mechanism for reviewing the building inspector/zoning officer’s decision, § 909 permitted direct appeal to the Court of Common Pleas if a mandamus action would lie. Since the Borough failed to create a zoning board as required by § 901 of the Code, there existed no other adequate remedy for relief. Furthermore, as the trial court specifically held, the Appellants’ existing use constituted a legal non-conforming use, obviating a need to strictly comply with the appropriate lot area provisions of the Borough’s zoning ordinance. Thus, the zoning officer clearly acted improperly in denying the Appellants an occupancy permit. Because the Borough acted improperly in failing to create a zoning board, the Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction to hear the mandamus action under § 909. Furthermore, the record supports the trial court’s action in issuing the writ of mandamus, requiring the issuance of the occupancy permit. Based upon this reasoning, I would reverse the Commonwealth <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>Court and affirm the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.</p>
