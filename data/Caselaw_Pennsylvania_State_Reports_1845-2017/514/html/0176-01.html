The record shows that municipal sewer service is not likely to be extended to this area before the year 2000. Benham proposed several modifications to his plan to address the Township’s concerns. These proposals included dedication of the on-site sewage facility to the Township, the Sewer Authority or any other body acceptable to the Township, ownership and operation of the facility by the Homeowner’s Association, and joint public and private ownership and operation of the facility.

It then held that governmental ownership is not required and that the system proposed by Benham was a “public sanitary sewer system” because it provided sanitary sewers for the residents of the development and may be expanded to serve future adjoining developments.
