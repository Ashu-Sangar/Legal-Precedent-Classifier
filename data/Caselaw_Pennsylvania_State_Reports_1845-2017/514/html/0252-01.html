Ms. Herron brought an action against Trustees of C.I. Mortgage Group, the building owners, Westinghouse Elevator Company, the manufacturer of the elevator, and United Elevator Company, the elevator maintenance contractor. C.I. Mortgage Group joined additional defendants Binswanger-Herman Company, the building manager, and Competitive Building Maintenance Corporation, the building maintenance contractor. United Elevator Company joined Imperial Elevator, the former elevator maintenance contractor.</p>

Byrne, III, became ill and was unable to continue with the trial. Mr. Byrne’s partner, Mr. Schell, informed the court that Mr. Byrne would probably be ready to resume on Wednesday, and the court granted a continuance until then, but by Wednesday Mr. Byrne was hospitalized. The court again ordered a continuance, this time until Friday, and instructed Mr. Schell to arrange for substitute counsel so that the trial could proceed on Friday. On Friday, Mr. Schell indicated that Mr. Byrne might be available by the next Wednesday; however the trial court ordered Mr. Schell to proceed as substitute counsel. Mr. Schell indicated that he was unable to represent Westinghouse adequately and moved for the withdrawal of a juror. The other defendants also moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the delay had prejudiced them. These motions were denied and trial resumed. At this point there had been five days of trial and eight witnesses had testified. What remained of the trial was cross-examination of a defense witness, the introduction into evidence, by Mr. Schell, of Ms. Herron’s deposition and portions of her complaint, and closing arguments by all attorneys. Mr. Schell proceeded as substitute counsel on Friday, and on Monday the jury was charged. That afternoon they returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Herron in the amount of $1,488,480 plus delay damages of $424,522.64. Two defendants, C.I. Mortgage and Binswanger, were absolved, and of the remaining defendants, the jury allocated negligence 50% to Westinghouse, 20% each to United Elevator and Imperial Elevator, and 10% to Competitive Maintenance.</p>

Because of the large number of parties, and the complex alignment of their interests, there has been a very considerable amount of discovery in the intervening period. Only Mr. Byrne was familiar with these materials. Similarly, by the end of the fifth day of trial, the opening statements had been given, ten witnesses had been fully examined, and extensive cross-examination had been conducted. Mr. Byrne had been Westinghouse’s only representative at these proceedings. It might have been physically possible for Mr. Schell to examine all of this information within the 1½ day period available, since this Court instructed the court reporter to make herself available. Yet it would have not been possible for him to prepare the kind of careful analysis of the testimony and issues his client had a right to expect. To require one party to be represented by counsel who had no hand in shaping the strategy or course of the trial, and who, in effect, had no exposure to the trial, is to place upon that party a serious handicap. The party’s competitive disadvantage is compounded where there are numerous other defendants with contrary interests.

In <em>Budget Laundry </em>the trial court denied a continuance even though, after the case was called on the daily trial list and was in a position for the selection of a jury, appellant's counsel informed the court that he would be unavailable to proceed at that time because he was then in trial before another judge of the same court and was next scheduled for trial in the United States District Court. The case proceeded ex parte and a verdict was returned in favor of the appellee. Superior Court affirmed and this Court reversed on the grounds that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the continuance. <a href="/pa/450/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="450 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1947093" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0013-01">450 Pa. 13</a>, 18, <a href="/citations/?q=298%20A.2d%2055" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="298 A.2d 55">298 A.2d 55</a>, 56.</p>
      <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.8",320,[296,2036,1119,305]]]'>The fact that <em>Budget Laundry </em>involved the denial of a continuance requested before trial began, not during the trial, as in the present case, is a significant difference in the cases since prejudice to the plaintiff was less likely to be a factor on the <em>Budget Laundry </em>facts. Nonetheless, both cases involve the trial court's discretionary denial of continuances and both cases present analytical difficulties for appellate courts, who must review the trial court’s actions from a cold record.</p>

City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/480/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="480 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1745062" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0177-01">480 Pa. 177</a>, 184, <a href="/pa/480/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="480 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1745062" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0177-01">389 A.2d 568</a>, 572 (1978), Superior Court quoted our statement that "when one attorney is prohibited by ethical considerations from undertaking to represent a certain client, all members of the firm to which that attorney belongs are also prohibited from serving as counsel to that client,” and then concluded that substitute counsel was not a stranger to the case. This conclusion, following hard upon reference to the disciplinary rule prohibiting other members of a firm from representing a client when one member may not represent that client for ethical reasons (Disciplinary Rule 5-105), seems to imply that one attorney’s knowledge of a case will be imputed to all members of the firm for all purposes, including the purpose of acting as substitute counsel.</p>
      <p id="b323-7" data-blocks='[["BL_323.7",323,[185,1989,1117,350]]]'>Suffice it to say that if this is what Superior Court intended, it was in error. Disciplinary Rule 5-105 was never intended to serve as a device to impute the knowledge of one lawyer to all other lawyers in his firm for purposes of requiring them to act as substitute counsel. Rather, it serves simply to prevent lawyers from accepting employment which would impair their exercise of independent judgment on behalf of a client or representing conflicting interests, and to prevent other members of a firm from accepting employment when one member has this type of ethical conflict.</p>
