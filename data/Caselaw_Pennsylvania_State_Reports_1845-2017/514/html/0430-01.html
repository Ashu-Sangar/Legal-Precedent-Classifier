The Act established the Fund to provide liability coverage over and above the basic coverage insurance up to $1,000,000 for each occurrence and $3,000,000 in the annual aggregate. 40 P.S. § 1301.701(d). Capitalization of the Fund is from surcharges levied by the director upon the health care providers who are entitled to participate. 40 P.S. § 1301.701(e)(l)-(4).

Davison treated Miss Joyce Mihelic when she was hospitalized for a broken leg which she suffered in a motorcycle accident. She returned to him and he removed her cast in September of that year. Appellee, the Ohio Casualty Group of Insurance Companies (hereinafter Ohio Casualty) alleged in its complaint that Dr. Davison committed malpractice at that time because x-rays disclosed that the leg had not properly knit. She was readmitted to the hospital under Dr. Davison’s care because of continuing complaints on November 4, 1975, and after treatment by him was discharged on December 23, 1975. Because of continuing difficulties in her recovery she was again readmitted to the hospital under Dr. Davison’s care on July 27, 1976. In the interim the Act became effective on January 13, 1976. On July 28, 1976, Dr. Davison performed surgery on Miss Mihelic’s leg during which he removed a condilar plate, installed a femoral plate and performed an osteotomy. Appellee alleged that Dr. Davison committed a second act of malpractice by failing to administer antibiotic spray following that operation, and that his failure led to infection and further complications.</p>

While Argonaut considered the offer Miss Mihelic underwent knee surgery in September of 1981. She later decided to withdraw the settlement offer. Her claim was eventually settled in November 1983 for $455,000. Participating in the settlement were Argonaut and Ohio Casualty.

In its complaint it stated <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>three counts. The first charged Argonaut with failure to perform its duty to Dr. Davison in good faith and with due care by failing to accept the original offer of settlement, thus exposing Ohio Casualty to liability as Dr. Davison’s excess insurance carrier. The second count, also against Argonaut, alleged that there were two separate acts of medical malpractice. Therefore, Ohio claimed, Argonaut was required to contribute an additional $100,000 to the settlement as the basic coverage insurance carrier. The third count against Director Judge and the Fund, alleged that because the second act of alleged medical malpractice occurred after January, 1976, i.e., after the effective date of the Act, the Fund was required to contribute to the settlement.</p>

The court went on to note that although Section 702(f) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 1301-702(f), authorizes the director of the Fund to “defend, litigate, settle or compromise any claim payable by the Fund” the director is not authorized to determine the outcome of such claims.

    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[218,1101,1160,960]]]'>The basic nature of appellee’s complaint is a claim for restitution for its discharge of an alleged statutory liability of the Fund. The Act itself is empty of any specific procedure whereby appellee may be afforded a remedy of restitution. The provisions of the Act are directed to resolving claims brought by injured patients against health care providers. In resolving these claims the Act anticipates the participation of the director and the Fund in the successful completion of such proceedings. The Act does not anticipate, nor was it intended to anticipate, claims brought directly against the Fund which are premised upon the alleged failure of the Fund to complete its statutory duty to pay its share. Such claims place the Fund in the position of defendant, as opposed to its designed position of participant and/or arbiter; and as a defendant the Fund is not in a position to fairly assess its own liability.

In both cases it would clearly be better practice to first seek informal resolution of the claim, but the failure to follow the better practice does not mean the litigant is precluded from the only enforceable means by which he or she can obtain relief.
