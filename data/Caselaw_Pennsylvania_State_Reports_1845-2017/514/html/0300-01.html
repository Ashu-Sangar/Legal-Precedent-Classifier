Thus, we should not hold a legislative enactment unconstitutional <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>except on the clearest showing of invalidity. Appellees do not make such a showing in the record before us.

U.S. Const, amend. V; U.S. Const, amend. XIV; Pa. Const, art. I, § 10.

The same principle holds true for the interest paid on that award, called delay compensation under our Code. The record in this case establishes that the interest rate paid on passbook savings accounts at the County Trust Company (acquired by Pittsburgh National Bank in 1982) was five-and-one-quarter percent for the years 1979-1983 and five-and-one-half percent in 1984. R.R. at 111-112. The interest rate paid by the Citizens National Bank for the years 1979-1984 was four percent. R.R. at 129. A statutory interest rate of six percent, which is higher than the rate of interest paid on these passbook savings accounts, is not so low as to deprive appellees of their constitutional right to just compensation.</p>

Those courts which have approved the consideration of interest rates higher than the statutory rate in fixing delay damages generally disfavor or expressly reject the use of commercial loan rates. Instead they use the “reasonably prudent investor” standard. <em>See, e.g., United States v. 429.59 Acres of Land, </em><a href="/f2d/612/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="612 F.2d 459" data-case-ids="1411359" data-case-paths="/f2d/612/0459-01">612 F.2d 459</a> (9th Cir.1980); <em>Leverty and Hurley Co. v.

This standard is based on the overall average interest rate a reasonably prudent investor could have obtained based on prevailing interest rates.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> It correctly focuses on the use to which the money lost through delay in compensation could have been put rather than on the costs the condemnee would incur in borrowing at commercial loan rates to replace the money lost as a result of the delay. The use of commercial loan rates is disfavored for two reasons: costs based on condemnees’ borrowing rates are highly speculative, and the cost method fails to ensure uniformity of treatment among condemnees. <em>See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v.

Given the methods the Eminent Domain Code now provides for recompense of costs incurred by condemnees, I see no reason to follow <em>Whit-comb’s </em>pre-Code approval of the use of commercial loan rates. To the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion, I would overrule <em>Whitcomb v.
