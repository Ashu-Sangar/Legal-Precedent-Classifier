We have also recognized that to err is human and, in the course of criminal prosecutions, some prosecutorial error is inevitable. Thus, we have said that when prosecutorial error motivates a defendant to seek a second trial, the re-trial will not be barred by double jeopardy. However, when prosecutorial <em>overreaching </em>provokes the defendant’s request for a mistrial, or the request on appeal for a new trial, the constitutional protection against double jeopardy will bar the second trial.</p>

      <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>The question then to be answered is: What constitutes <em>overreaching? </em>Until now, we defined overreaching as did the Oregon Court of Appeals in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em><a href="/us/456/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="456 U.S. 667" data-case-ids="6189962" data-case-paths="/us/456/0667-01">supra.:</a> Bad faith conduct which threatened (1) the harassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or (2) declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict. The United States Supreme Court has apparently decided this standard was too difficult for trial and appellate courts to apply, and, for purposes of federal double jeopardy protection, has abandoned these standards in favor of a standard which requires courts to find that the prosecutor “intended to ‘goad’ the defendant into moving for a mistrial” before a second prosecution is barred. <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em><a href="/us/456/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="456 U.S. 667" data-case-ids="6189962" data-case-paths="/us/456/0667-01">supra at 676</a>, 102 S.Ct. at 2089, <a href="/us/456/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="456 U.S. 667" data-case-ids="6189962" data-case-paths="/us/456/0667-01">72 L.Ed.2d at 425</a>.

The terms of the bargain involve more than what the majority characterizes as “the <em>usual </em>commitment by the Commonwealth that it would recommend a lighter sentence in return for [the witness’s] testimony.” In return for testimony in two cases, the Commonwealth promised a witness who was charged with murder and other crimes which, in the aggregate, could have brought a total of 55 years in prison, to recommend 11½ to 23 months in jail with credit for time already served, plus a term of probation. This is the sentence which was subsequently imposed. Despite the fact that the witness was fully apprised of the terms of the agreement, he testified at appellant’s trial that <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>there was no agreement as to what sentence he would get and that he expected that he could go to prison for 55 years. The error was compounded when the prosecutor failed to clarify the terms of the agreement for the jury. The fact finder was entitled to know the precise terms of the agreement in order to assess whether the witness’s testimony was motivated by truth and remorse for his misdeeds or simply a desire to secure his own early release. Concerning as it does the alleged <em>concealment </em>of information which was necessary to the truth-determining process, the alleged misconduct, even if proved, could well never satisfy the new federal standard, as concealment will always negate any “intent to goad the defendant request a mistrial.” The intent of concealment, indeed its essence, is that the defendant would never know the facts and, thus, would not base any claim for relief on those facts.</p>
    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[144,1211,1153,1032]]]'>Likewise, there may be other cases where the Commonwealth conceals its efforts to subvert the truth-determining process. Where, for example, the Commonwealth knowingly uses perjured testimony, there will of necessity be no intent to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial. Quite the opposite, the intent would be that the defendant should never know how his wrongful conviction came about. Should the Commonwealth’s concealment of necessary information vitiate the double jeopardy protection afforded by our constitution? I think not. As Judge Del Sole opined below: “I find no functional difference between intentional misconduct, engaged in by the prosecution in order to avoid an acquittal by causing a mistrial and intentional misconduct, engaged in by the prosecution in concealing evidence, which results in a guilty verdict. In either case, the conduct of the prosecution once established, places the defendant twice in jeopardy for the same crime.” <em>Commonwealth v.
