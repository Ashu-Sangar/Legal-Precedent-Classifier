    <p id="b352-9" data-blocks='[["BL_352.7",352,[255,1395,1153,579]]]'>Appellant first asserts that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury instruction that not guilty by reason of insanity was a possible verdict. Appellant relies on <em>Commonwealth v. Mulgrew, </em><a href="/pa/475/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="475 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1734128" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0271-01">475 Pa. 271</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="475 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1734128" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0271-01">380 A.2d 349</a> (1977), for the proposition that once the issue of insanity has been raised, the court must state in its charge that “not guilty by reason of insanity” is a separate and distinct verdict in the case. Appellant further contends that the jury must be made aware of the meaning of such verdict, i.e., that it could mean that a defendant would be subject to commitment proceedings and psychiatric treatment.</p>
    <p id="b352-10" data-blocks='[["BL_352.8",352,[256,1991,1151,364]]]'>Insanity was clearly at issue in Appellant's trial. In fact, Appellant’s defense rested solely upon a claim of insanity. The only witness presented by the defense was a psychiatrist. The Commonwealth’s evidence was undisputed. At the conclusion of the jury instruction, after the trial judge had recited the law on insanity generally and on homicide, he summarized the jury’s options as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.3",353,[218,291,1111,419]]]'>
      <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>If you find the Defendant not guilty, that ends it. If you find him guilty, then you have to go on and specify the degree of the offense, if you find the Defendant guilty of murder in the first degree or the third degree or voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter. So there are <em>five possible verdicts </em>that you come in with. With our instructions, four types of homicide, and of course, one of not guilty. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[175,728,1153,411]]]'>The court did not specifically state that not guilty by reason of insanity was a sixth possible verdict and, while the jury was aware of the insanity defense because it was raised at trial, the court’s charge did not cover it as a separate and distinct option. Despite the obvious error of the trial judge in failing to specify that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity was possible, trial counsel did not object to the omission.</p>
    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[173,1167,1153,741]]]'>In support of his contention that this omission constituted ineffectiveness of counsel, Appellant contends that the jury could conceivably have disbelieved all of the Commonwealth’s witnesses and found him “not guilty,” or that they might have believed both the Commonwealth’s witnesses and the defense psychiatrist and found him “not guilty by reason of insanity.” Since this was at least theoretically possible, Appellant argues that the instruction given was confusing and misleading and should reasonably have drawn objection from his trial counsel. We agree with Appellant that the instruction was legally incorrect, and that there is no apparent reason for trial counsel’s failure to object to this oversight. Thus, Appellant’s claim is of arguable merit.</p>

Trial counsel testified at the P.C.H.A. hearing that he was aware of our decision in <em>Mulgrew, <a href="/pa/475/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="475 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1734128" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0271-01">supra,</a> </em>and its application to a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. However, he felt it was inapplicable because it was decided before the Mental Health Procedure Act of July 9, 1976, which repealed the <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, which was applicable in <em>Mulgrew. </em>This conclusion was erroneous, and no doubt constitutes ineffective assistance.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[248,488,1153,580]]]'>On the facts of this case, counsel could have had <em>no </em>reasonable basis for failure to request a specific charge that not guilty by reason of insanity was a possible verdict, or to object when such charge was not given. Appellant’s sole defense was one of insanity. His actions in killing the victim were undisputed and he pled no justification other than his purported delusions. His entire defense consisted of psychiatric testimony. At no time did the defense argue that Appellant did not commit the crime. Quite to the contrary, it was all but admitted that Appellant had done the shooting (N.T. 9, 12, 14, closing arguments).</p>
    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[243,1087,1154,1284]],["BL_355.1",355,[183,283,1151,149]]]'>It is clear from the evidence that trial counsel could not reasonably have considered a separate “not guilty” verdict as one of the alternatives available to the jury. Trial counsel did not present any factual basis nor argument to the jury that Appellant was, or could be, “not guilty” in the sense that he did not shoot Mr. Marzka. Hence, a “not guilty” verdict was possible only if the jury accepted the defense of insanity. While it is true that the jury was instructed on the concept of insanity, they were not instructed that “not guilty by reason of insanity” was a possible verdict. We conclude that this omission worked to the prejudice of Appellant. In <em>Mulgrew, supra, </em>we held that when insanity is raised as a possible defense, the jury must be instructed concerning the possible psychiatric treatment and commitment of the defendant after return of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.

The defendant was required to prove the alleged defective mental condition by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Carluccetti, </em><a href="/pa/369/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="369 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1232336" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0190-01">369 Pa. 190</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20391" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="85 A.2d 391">85 A.2d 391</a> (1952). In <em>Vogel, </em>Mr. Justice Roberts first articulated the principle that, as an element of <em>mens rea, </em>the burden of proving sanity rests with the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Vogel, supra </em>(Roberts, J., opinion in support of <em>per curiam </em>order). This theory was later endorsed as the law of this Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, upon request of the jury, the trial judge redefined the legal definition of insanity. <em>Id. </em>at 75-77. I believe the jury was adequately apprised of the law of insanity. An instruction to the jury must not be examined in artificial isolation but must be judged in the context of the overall charge. <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em><a href="/us/414/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="414 U.S. 141" data-case-ids="11715366" data-case-paths="/us/414/0141-01">414 U.S. 141</a>, <a href="/us/414/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="414 U.S. 141" data-case-ids="11715366" data-case-paths="/us/414/0141-01">94 S.Ct. 396</a>, <a href="/us/414/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="414 U.S. 141" data-case-ids="11715366" data-case-paths="/us/414/0141-01">38 L.Ed.2d 368</a> (1973); <em>Commonwealth v.

As appellant has not pointed to any prejudice stemming from the use of a general instruction as opposed to a specific instruction mentioning a possible verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, he is not entitled to relief.</p>

In <em>Amos, <a href="/f2d/803/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="803 F.2d 419" data-case-ids="1629550" data-case-paths="/f2d/803/0419-01">supra,</a> </em>the Eighth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Federal Insanity Defense Reform Act, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 20">18 U.S.C. § 20</a> (Supp.1986). The Act requires a criminal defendant to prove his insanity by clear and convincing evidence. I believe that 18 Pa.C.S. § 315, requiring a defendant to prove his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, will similarly pass constitutional muster. <em>See Leland v.
