At that time, a truck driver who had been watching television in the sleeper section of his tractor-trailer rig, which was located in the parking lot of the truck stop, heard some gun shots that sounded as though they had come from a pellet gun or air rifle. The truck driver looked out his window and saw a man standing in the fairly well-illuminated lot. The man was at a distance of approximately thirty feet, and was holding what appeared to be a gun or rifle (a weapon larger than a handgun), and the body of Archie Bradley was lying on the ground. The man then began to run across the parking lot towards Route 19. Based upon this brief but ample opportunity to view the man, the truck driver positively identified appellant, at a police line-up and at trial, as the man he had seen in the truck stop parking lot.</p>

The Oldsmobile did not have its lights on, and its wheels were throwing gravel, so the officer commenced to follow the vehicle. Another motorist who was traveling on Route 19 at the time noticed that the Oldsmobile was being followed by the police car, and, while stopped at a red light, the motorist looked into the Oldsmobile while it was along side of his car. Later, in court, the motorist positively identified the driver of the Oldsmobile as appellant’s brother and co-defendant, Ronald Williams.</p>

The objects were later recovered by police investigators and were found to consist of a .45 caliber automatic weapon known as a “Mac-10” machine pistol, a Mac-10 ammunition clip, and a noise suppressor/silencer. Ballistics experts established that the Mac-10 machine pistol had inflicted the fatal wounds upon Bradley.</p>

A search of the vehicle revealed .45 caliber ammunition, an attache case, .22 caliber weapons and ammunition, driver’s licenses belonging to appellant and his brother, and an owner’s registration card listing appellant’s brother as the owner of the Oldsmobile. In addition, there was found in the vehicle a piece of paper upon which was written the name of the truck stop where the shooting had occurred, and, beside that name was the notation, “10:15.”</p>

While the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>lower court was satisfied by the testimony that the jury was not influenced by the unsubstantiated, out-of-court rumors of other criminal acts, we hold that the sentence of death cannot be allowed to stand. Imposition of this most serious and permanent of all penalties is a matter that naturally weighs heavily on the minds and hearts of those involved. In addition to the dangers outlined by Mr. Justice Yeates in <em>Cluggage </em>there is in this case the added danger that, prior to the hearing the jurors had two weeks after rendering their verdict to become more comfortable with it, and to reassure themselves that, in fact, they had “done the right thing.” Particularly in view of the fact that, after rendering their penalty verdict, they were advised by court personnel that appellant was indeed wanted for murder in other jurisdictions, the danger is great that the information not only tainted the verdict but also subconsciously gave the jurors a reinforced confidence in their decision which enabled them to convince the court that, in fact, the verdict was rendered on only proper considerations.</p>

As the statute is presently construed, judicial tribunals are reluctant to overturn sentences of death, particularly in circumstances as horrendous as this, where that action precludes the reimposition of a sentence of death, even though the subsequent proceeding is free of error and such a sentence is fully justified under the evidence.</p>
