Muse (hereinafter “claimant”) suffered a bilateral hernia which was classified as a work-related injury. Surgery was performed on June 23, 1973, to correct the impairment and a final receipt was executed on November 21, 1973, with regard to the claimant’s workmen’s compensation benefits. Benefits were thereafter reinstated in 1977 when it was discovered that the surgery had caused the atrophy of the claimant’s right <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>testicle together with the contraction of the right spermatic cord. The referee found that the cause of this condition was a result of the first surgery. A second operation was recommended by the employer’s physician, which the claimant refused.</p>

A hearing was held before a referee on June 22, 1978. At the hearing the only witness was the employer’s physician. The petition for modification was eventually dismissed, the referee having determined that the claimant’s refusal to undergo surgery was not unreasonable “considering the nature and extent of the operative procedure as well as the possible complications.” Finding of Fact No. 13, Referee’s Decision, July 14, 1982, p. 3.</p>

The sole evidence offered at the referee’s hearing consisted of the testimony of the employer’s physician concerning the feasibility of surgery to correct the claimant’s condition. His testimony as summarized by the Board was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[181,900,1112,1446]],["BL_68.1",68,[293,294,1111,627]]]'>He performed a physical examination on claimant. He found claimant’s complaints were produced by a too tight repair (surgery) around the internal inquinal ring, resulting in a compromising of the venous and arterial blood supply, and hence, that claimant’s present problem is related to his prior surgery necessitated by his asserted injury and not directly to the injury. He recommended treatment for claimant which would be surgery that would eventually repair the tightness. Hospitalization would be from five to seven days. He stated that with any type of surgery there is always the various risks that are associated with any surgery but are minimal in nature “as long as general health is fairly good, that there is no complicating or contradicting medical conditions.” His examination of claimant caused him to conclude that claimant was a candidate for surgery that he recommended. Normal post-operative convalescence would be two to three months. If the surgery was successful, claimant would be relatively asymptomatic with regard to the right groin area. Claimant would have no limitation in his ability to lift objects or perform any kind of work. He stated the surgery should be completely successful under the proper technique and under the proper conditions. He stated that the risk factors of the problem, phlebitis, pulmonary emboli, wound infection, are on a percentage basis, that there would be a one to five percent chance of complications. On cross-examination <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>he mentioned the possible consequences of any surgery. Counsel had the physician estimate the incision in the body which the recommended surgery would entail. The physician noted claimant was a heavy smoker, and that non-smokers are better surgical candidates. He then went on in rather considerable detail as to what organs of the body would be touched in the recommended surgery. He stated that complications, other than phlebitis, pulmonary emboli, or wound infection would include the whole gamut following any surgical procedure, a myocardial infarction, drug reaction, skin reaction, allergic dermatitis, just to name a few.</blockquote>

    <p id="b68-7" data-blocks='[["BL_68.6",68,[246,1335,1154,738]]]'>On review the Board found as a matter of law that the referee applied the improper analysis to the case, in that he focused on whether the claimant’s refusal was reasonable, as opposed to whether the services offered were reasonable. The Board went on to say that the mere element of risk intrinsic in any surgical procedures was not sufficient to permit a conclusion that the surgery was unreasonable. Something more was required. Otherwise all surgical procedures would be presumptively unreasonable, a conclusion that would effectively vitiate the statute. The Board concluded therefore that in this case, where the only evidence was that the surgery involved minimal risk and offered a high probability of success, the surgery was, as a matter of law, reasonable under section 306(f).</p>

However, on the record, the referee’s conclusion was unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Katz v.

    <blockquote id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[153,980,1111,305]]]'>If the employe shall refuse reasonable services of duly licensed practitioners of the healing arts, surgical, medical and hospital services, treatment, medicines and supplies, he shall forfeit all rights to compensation for any injury or any increase in his incapacity shown to have resulted from such refusal.</blockquote>

However, the Commonwealth Court interpreted the statute as if it focused on the reasonableness of the claimant’s refusal. While the latter can certainly be a factor in determining whether the services offered were reasonable, it is not something that can be presumed on a barren record.</p>
    <p id="b69-8" data-blocks='[["BL_69.7",69,[109,1699,1153,527]]]'>Thus the statute requires an employer to place evidence on the record that proposed medical services are reasonable. That was done in this case. Thereafter, the claimant can rest his case, hoping that the employer will have failed to carry his burden, or introduce evidence as to why, in his individual case, the services offered were not reasonable. Unfortunately for the claimant in this case, once the employer established the reasonableness of the surgical procedure, the record was barren of any evidence to support a finding of unreasonableness.</p>

Who can be cured and won’t soon drys sympathy and wearies the most willing helpers. One ought not in any context avoid reasonable medical procedures to cure infirmities that are a burden to life and the prospects of life.

What the record also contained, though, was that claimant’s <em>uncontroverted actual medical history, </em>which included the fact that the previous surgical procedure to correct his work-related hernia, performed at the employer’s request, was unsuccessful and caused further damage, pain and suffering.
