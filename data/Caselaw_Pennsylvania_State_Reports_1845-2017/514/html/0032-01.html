By that lawsuit <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>appellant sought to recover damages for a physical injury he suffered while in the course of his employment. The action was grounded partly on a claim of products liability under section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), and partly on a theory that Newman had caused appellant’s injury by willfully disregarding governmental safety regulations and by deliberately exposing him to a known hazard. Newman responded to the suit with an Answer containing.

The allegations of the appellant’s Complaint in Trespass set forth the following. On June 7, 1983, the appellant was in the course of his employment at Newman’s factory. While so engaged, he had occasion to be operating a device called a “notching” machine, which had been designed and manufactured by Newman itself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Part of this machine consisted of six sharp saw-blades, which would spin when the mechanism was turned on. At some point in the appellant’s operation of the machine on the day in question one of his hands came into contact with the spinning blades, causing him to lose a portion of the small finger.</p>
    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[116,1094,1156,1062]]]'>In support of the products liability claim, the Complaint alleged that the employer’s design and construction of the “notching” machine was defective because there was no cover or guard over the saw-blades to protect the hands of operators, and that such defect was the cause of the appellant’s injury. With respect to the companion theory of liability, the Complaint alleged that Newman, despite its awareness of the danger posed by the machine, deliberately forbade its workers from using a certain “feeding” device which would have greatly reduced the risk of hand injury. Another averment was that Newman also knew that the “notching” machine did not comply with federal and state safety regulations, and, for that reason, directed the appellant to remove it on the eve of an OSHA inspection which took place about eleven days before the accident. It was again placed in full operation when the safety inspectors departed. According to the Complaint, Newman’s course of conduct amounted to a deliberate and wanton disregard for the safety of its workers, and such was the cause of the appellant’s injury.</p>

He also contends that Newman’s act of deliberately concealing the defective machine from OSHA inspectors should disqualify it from having the protection of that provision.</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[140,818,1161,1113]]]'>There is no Pennsylvania judicial authority supportive of the result the appellant seeks. The argument he presents is one based entirely on his view of the relationship between the Act and other laws and regulations which bear upon safety in the workplace. According to the appellant, if an employer is to be allowed to escape common law liability for intentional misconduct causing harm to a worker, governmental policies aimed at promoting job safety will be undermined. Analogous theories have been propounded by various writers on the subject of workmen’s compensation. Some of these commentators take the position that the present statutory system of compensation, in not providing the injured worker with all that he might recover in a tort action, relieves the employer from bearing the full cost of maintaining an unsafe plant. According to these theorists, such a result should not be countenanced where an employee’s injury has resulted from the employer’s intentional creation of an injury-causing hazard. <em>See generally, </em>Note, <em>Exceptions to the Exclusive Remedy Requirements of Workers’ Compensation Statutes, </em>96 Harv. 1641, 1648 (1983).</p>
    <p id="b99-6" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[140,1952,1151,152]],["BL_100.1",100,[244,295,1153,486]]]'>It is true that the appellate courts of some other states have held that wanton and willful misconduct by an employer is tantamount to an intentional tort, and as such, pre<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>vents the operation of a statutory exclusive-remedy provision. <em>See, e.g., Mandolidis v. Elkins Industries, Inc., </em><a href="/w-va/161/0695-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="161 W.

It must be noted, however, that those cases rested on provisions in the state workmen’s compensation statutes which expressly preserved the right of an employee to sue in tort where his injury was caused by the employer’s intentional wrongdoing. There is no such provision in The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act.</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[239,815,1155,1040]]]'>The appellant’s argument is an interesting one; but it is one that must be resolved by the General Assembly, not this Court. What he is asking us to do is to engraft upon section 303(a) of the Act an exception the legislature did not see fit to put there. A reading of the Act will disclose that the legislature was not unmindful of the issue of intentionally caused harm. For example, in section 301(c)(1), 77 P.S. § 411(1), it is provided that “an injury caused by an act of a third person <em>intended </em>to injure the employe because of reasons personal to him ...” does not fall within the statutory definition of a covered injury. (Emphasis added.) And, under section 205, 77 P.S. § 72, which immunizes an employee from tort actions for harm caused to a fellow employee, an exception is expressly made for the <em>intentional </em>infliction of harm. Since it is clear that the legislature had the issue of intentional harm in mind, and yet did not mention it in connection with section 303(a), we are constrained to conclude that the legislature did not intend the result for which the appellant argues.</p>

    <blockquote id="b102-6" data-blocks='[["BL_102.6",102,[315,1496,1112,852]]]'>There are sound policy reasons for reaching this decision. The purpose of the Workers’ Compensation Act is to protect both the employer and the employee by incorporating a quid pro quo for negligent acts by the employer. The employer is given immunity from suit by an employee who is injured on the job in return for relinquishing his common law defenses. The employee is assured of compensation for his injuries, but foregoes legal recourse against his employer. To allow an employer to [commit an intentional tort] and hide behind the exclusivity clause of the Workers’ Compensation Act is to disregard the purpose of the Act. Other employers would have to pay for his protection. In effect, he would have bought the right to [intentionally harm] his employees. That is not a quid pro quo. The law does not allow a wrongdoer to benefit from his wrongs.</blockquote>
