    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[263,408,1157,747]]]'>From April 1950 until October 1977, Frank Pawlosky (claimant) was employed at the Rolling Rock Brewery of the Latrobe Brewing Company (“Latrobe”), a business engaged in the manufacture of beer. During that twenty-seven year period Pawlosky worked for Latrobe in various capacities, including the jobs of carbonator, “beer dropper” and cellar-man. However, for twenty-three years of his career at the brewery Pawlosky worked in the fermenting cellars, an assignment which required him to periodically clean and sterilize tanks with a solution of chlorine. During the course of a work day he was also exposed to the fumes of such other chemical agents as caustic soda and sulphuric acid, which were also used by the employer for cleaning purposes.</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[259,1176,1157,582]]]'>In November of 1977 Pawlosky filed a claim petition for workmen’s compensation, alleging that he had become disabled by an “occupational disease” within the coverage of section 108 of the Act. The petition further averred that the disability was caused by a lung infection and an asthmatic condition resulting from his long exposure to the fumes of chlorine and other chemical solutions used at the brewery. Latrobe responded with an answer demanding proof of the claim. Thereafter, the claimant amended his petition to assert entitlement under the general compensation provisions of the Act, namely, section 301(c)(1).</p>

He admitted on cross-examination that he had been, at one point in his life, a heavy smoker of cigarettes. The claimant also stated that, after receiving various pro<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>fessional diagnoses of his breathing problem, he was finally advised by another physician in March, 1977, that he was suffering from a severe bronchial asthmatic condition.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[164,462,1156,902]]]'>Pawlosky’s medical witness in the proceedings was Dr. Raymond Mayewski, who testified that the claimant was suffering from an obstructive <em>disease </em>of the bronchial airways and that the condition could be classified as asthma. Dr. Mayewski defined asthma as a hyper-reactivity of the bronchial airways to irritants, and explained that when irritation occurs the result is a bronchospasm, or asthmatic attack, which is characterized by wheezing and shortness of breath. This witness could not say how or when the claimant contracted asthma, but he was of the opinion that fumes from the chemicals to which the claimant was exposed at the workplace would irritate the ailment and cause attacks. Based on that opinion, Dr. Mayewski concluded that the claimant was no longer able to engage in his former employment at the brewery. Regarding irritation of the claimant’s asthma, the doctor conceded that a variety of non-occupational stimuli could have the same effect.</p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[161,1382,1158,693]]]'>Latrobe’s medical witness, Dr. C. Vaughn Strimlan, described the claimant’s condition as being a severe, chronic, obstructive pulmonary disease. Dr. Strimlan agreed that the condition would be aggravated or irritated by the chemicals at the brewery, and that the claimant should not return to such an environment. This witness also opined that the claimant’s basic ailment would be irritated by a number of other agents, including cigarette smoke, paint fumes and even hair spray. Going further, however, Dr. Strimlan took the position that Mr. Pawlosky’s underlying respiratory malady had been caused by the heavy smoking of cigarettes over a period of many years, and did not result from any job-related exposure.</p>

After noting that the claimant did not <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>proceed to prove his case “in an occupational disease context”, the referee then found that the claimant’s exposure to the said chemical fumes in the workplace did not cause “a separate occupational disease” but rather aggravated an asthmatic condition that was pre-existent. The referee next determined that, since the asthma was not one of the occupational diseases specifically mentioned in sections 108(a)-(m) or (oMq) of the Act, it became incumbent upon the claimant to establish his case under the omnibus provision in section 108(n), 77 P.S. § 27.1(n), which accords to any other disease the status of an “occupational disease” if certain factors are proved.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Observing that one of the requirements under section 108(n) is that such other disease have an incidence in the claimant’s work which is “substantially greater in that industry or occupation than in the general population,” the referee dismissed Pawlosky’s claim petition because no such proof had been offered. It is obvious from the referee’s decision that he rejected the claimant’s assertion that section 301(c)(1) provided a basis for compensation, even though the decision made no express reference to that contention.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[237,1434,1153,418]]]'>The claimant followed with an appeal to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (“Board”), which affirmed the referee’s decision. The Board reasoned that the claimant sought benefits for an “occupational disease-like injury” and that such was compensable only under section 108(n). The Board therefore concluded that, since he had not satisfied the proof demands of that section, the claimant could not prevail.</p>

In its resolution of <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>the case, Commonwealth Court held that the workplace aggravation of a pre-existent disease constituted an “injury” within the meaning of the current version of section 301(c) of the Act, even if the exposure-type harm is not proven to be an occupational disease within the compass of section 108. Based on the evidence and the referee’s findings in the matter, the court further held that the claimant was entitled to benefits by force of section 301(c)(1). Thus, in the view of the Commonwealth Court, the referee and the Board had erred in applying occupational disease standards to the claim.</p>

To amplify this contention the appellant begins by pointing out that the claimant’s underlying asthmatic condition, though medically classifiable as a disease, is not specifically included in the statutory schedule of “occupational diseases”, and that the condition was not in itself caused by any workplace exposure. The appellant then emphasizes that the claimant’s asthma is an ailment common in the general population and one that can be aggravated by a variety of non-occupational causes. Having armed itself with the above premises, the appellant argues that the claimant’s right to receive workmen’s compensation, for the aggravation of his asthmatic condition by on-job irritants, required proof that the incidence of aggra<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>vation was substantially greater in his industry or occupation than in the general population. According to the appellant, it was not enough for Pawlosky to prove that the disabling aggravation was in fact caused by his work environment; he had to go further and show that his work-related <em>exposure to aggravation </em>was of the comparative degree required by section 108(n).</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[254,685,1157,569]]]'>In support of its argument the appellant states that “since 1972 it has been the clear legislative intent to define ‘injury’ in terms of (1) the old pre-1972 concept of ‘accidental injury’, and (2) the occupational disease definitions which had previously only appeared in the Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act of 1939.” Having fashioned this interpretation of the current Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act, the appellant concludes that where the harm in question involves a disease the exclusive route to compensation is through the occupational disease provisions of section 108.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[247,1282,1161,905]]]'>As originally enacted in 1915 The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act provided benefits only for injury or death resulting from an “accident” in the course of employment. Sections 101, 301(a), 77 P.S. §§ 1, 431 (1915) (amended 1972). The word “injury” was statutorily defined as meaning “only violence to the physical structure of the body, and such disease or infection as naturally results therefrom....” Section 301(c) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 411 (1915) (amended 1972). Although the original Act specifically defined the term “injury,” the statute contained no definition of the word “accident.” Therefore, the task of defining what was an “accident” within the meaning of the Act had to be assumed by the courts; and they proceeded to interpret that word essentially in accordance with its usual, ordinary and popular sense. <em>See Lacey v.

Specifically included in the new statutory conception of “injury” is the job-related aggravation, reactivation or acceleration of a pre-existing disease, even if the underlying disease itself was not caused by a work-related injury. Also, by virtue of the 1972 addition of section 301(c)(2), 77 P.S. § 411(2), occupational diseases, as defined in section 108, are included in the concept of “injury” under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.</p>
    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[166,798,1156,1127]]]'>A careful reading of the 1972 version of section 301(c) will reveal that, with the exception of the occupational diseases incorporated by reference, the word “injury” as there used is not itself actually defined. Section 301(c)(1) merely states that “[t]he terms <em>‘injury </em>’ and ‘personal <em>injury,’ </em>as used in this act, shall be construed to mean an injury....” 77 P.S. § 411(1) (emphasis added). This direction does no more than state that an injury is an injury. Although the 1972 amendment effectively categorizes the circumstances under which an injury is compensable, the word “injury” itself is given no express statutory meaning, as it had prior to the 1972 revision. Thus, just as under the original 1915 Act the courts had to give meaning to the undefined term “accident,” <em>see Lacey v. Washburn &amp; Williams Co., supra; McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., supra, </em>so must the courts now define the meaning of the term “injury” in section 301(c)(1). And, since the latter term no longer has a technical meaning, it must be interpreted according to its common and approved usage. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a); <em>see Lacey v.

This bizarre argument is no doubt the source of the appellant’s notion that, since the harm suffered by claimant Pawlosky was not brought within any of the occupational disease provisions, it could not constitute an “injury” within the meaning of that word as used in section 301(c)(1). What the appellant fails to recognize is that, as a result of the 1972 amendment of section 301(c), the term “injury” became a greatly broadened concept, of which occupational disease is but one dimension. Section 301(c)(1) makes it clear that, in determining whether an employee has suffered a compensable injury, his previous condition is of no consequence. So too, this section <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>makes it clear that the job-related aggravation of <em>a </em>disease is a category of “injury” for compensation purposes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

A sounder explanation of section 301(c)(2) is that the legislature, by including occupational diseases in the Act’s concept of “injury”, was attempting to create a unified, integrated compensation law for all work-related harm occurring after the effective dates of the 1972 amendments. <em>See </em>2 A.

Once such a claimant establishes that he has contracted an occupational disease and that the disease, at or immediately before ¿he date of disability, was a hazard in his occupation or industry, he then becomes entitled to a non-conclusive presumption that his occupational disease arose out of and in the course of his employment.

In its original classic conception Workmen’s Compensation was compensation for a direct violent injury to a person’s physical structure which occurred at the workplace. As the concept evolved, by salutary legislation, it came to embrace more than a direct violent injury. It was recognized that in some occupations the nature of the work and the materials used did injury to the interstices of the body that could remain unknown and undetected. The legislature perceived these possibilities of injury from alien mixtures, uses of materials and methods, theretofore unknown to nature or science, that could pass latent poisons osmotically into the body and, after long years of work, suddenly flash out. In 1939 the General Assembly took the matter in hand and passed the Occupational Diseases Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> to cover non-traumatic occupational injury. Then in 1972 the General Assembly revised and redefined the Workmen’s Compensation Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and included in one enactment provisions for both direct traumatic injury and occupational disease.</p>

However, his claim is that unhealthful fumes aggravated a preexisting asthmatic condition, and that such aggravation constituted an injury under the general injury category of Section 301(c)(1). Claimant does not claim that he would have been otherwise injured by the fumes but for his pre-existing condition. The question thus becomes whether a claimant, who has alleged that a pre-existing non-occupational disease was aggravated by long-term exposure to conditions peculiar to the work place, must pursue his claim for compensation under those provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act which describe occupational diseases, as opposed to the general injury provisions of the Act.</p>

An injury at the workplace is compensable if it occurred at the workplace. Under Section 301, proofs of that injury may be a heavier burden than required under 108 and 108(n), but because 108 and 108(n) cannot be proven does not mean that Section 301 proofs are denied a forum.

I believe that the majority’s decision largely emasculates the requirements section 108(n) imposes for proving an unenumerated occupational disease. By inserting section 108 into the Workmen’s Compensation Law, the legislature intended comprehensively to provide for individuals disabled due to occupational diseases. Section 108(n) provided for occupational diseases not recognized at that time. Under it, a claimant must show that he is exposed to the disease as a result of his employment, that the disease is causally related to his employment and that it it has a statistically greater incidence among persons engaged in his occupation than it does among the general public. The legislature could hardly have intended that we circumvent its careful provisions by allowing recovery for aggravation of any disease through the general provisions of section 301 defining injury. By coupling together sections 301(c)(1) and 301(c)(2) to define injury as including aggravation of non-work related, pre-existing diseases, the majority has done just that. The legislature’s intent in enacting the 1972 amendments to section 301(c), elimination of the former statute’s accident requirement for all injuries, is ignored by this broad construction. Considering this background, I believe the specific provisions of section 108(n) should over<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>ride the general provisions of section 301(c) in accordance with the usual rules of statutory construction. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1933.</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[237,480,1159,1130]]]'>I find no evidence that the legislature embraced a “take the worker as you find him” approach with respect to occupational diseases. Instead, in section 108(n), it required a substantial correlation between the disease and employment. Aggravation of a pre-existing disease is not consistent with the approach taken in section 108(n). Our current law eschews magic words and requires some substantial connection between the injury and the employment. <em>See Kusenko v. Republic Steel Corp., </em><a href="/pa/506/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="506 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1790917" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0104-01">506 Pa. 104</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="506 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1790917" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0104-01">484 A.2d 374</a> (1984). Moreover, the evidence in this case showed that appellee’s condition was also subject to aggravation by many common substances, including cigarette smoke and hair spray. In the face of section 108(n), it seems wrong to me to impose upon this employer the burden of compensating appellee for a disease which is not peculiar to his occupation. The diseases included in section 301(c)(2)’s definition of injury should be limited to diseases peculiar to an industry and not extended to those which commonly afflict the general population and are subject to aggravation by any number of substances commonly found in that part of the earth on which we live.</p>

It is clear to me, however, the majority works a major change in our compensation law.
