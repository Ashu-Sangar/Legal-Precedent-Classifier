The basis for granting the new trial was a determination that trial counsel had been ineffective in absenting himself, and Lobel, from the courtroom during a portion of trial. The circumstances surrounding the claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness were the following.</p>

Lobel was charged with two counts of theft by deception and two counts of criminal conspiracy. Candelori was charged with multiple counts of theft by deception, multiple counts of criminal conspiracy, and certain other charges related to the scheme. During their joint trial, Lobel and Candelori were shown by the Commonwealth to have utilized so-called “volunteers,” who <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>were in fact paid for their services, to solicit for a ficticious charity.</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[246,402,1154,954]]]'>Specifically, Candelori held himself out as “Bishop” of the “Holy Orthodox Christian Church,” having purchased the title of “Bishop” from an out-of-state mail order firm. As such, Candelori controlled a guild of street solicitors, comprised mainly of handicapped persons, who called themselves the “Salvation Mission Army Workers.” To these solicitors Candelori issued identification certificates, which the solicitors used to present an appearance of legitimacy, as the certificates indicated that the solicitations were being conducted on behalf of a church-related tax exempt organization. Candelori’s solicitors were permitted to retain 60% of their collections, with the remaining 40% passing into Candelori’s control. The so-called “church” over which Candelori presided, and for which the solicitors were ostensibly collecting funds, was a fictitious entity. It engaged in no charitable activities, and it listed as its address various private homes, an answering service, and a subsequently demolished building.</p>

Lobel’s solicitors were furnished with identification certificates, bearing “Bishop” Candelori’s name, indicating that the solicitors were collecting for the “Salvation Mission Army Workers.” Lobel’s financial arrangement with the solicitors differed from Candelori’s to the extent that Lobel retained 50% of all moneys collected, as opposed to the 40% that Candelori retained. Lobel also paid Candelori $3.00 per day for each collection can used. In addition, Lobel herself solicited and collected funds for the “Salvation Mission Army.”</p>

Upon the prosecutor’s assurance that the upcoming testimony would refer only to Candelori, the court granted the request, whereupon Lobel and her trial counsel left the courtroom.</p>

One of these witnesses testified that he had worked for Candelori as a solicitor for the Salvation Mission Army Workers, and he further testified, as had earlier witnesses, that he had not observed any charitable or religious activities that could be attributed to the Salvation Mission Army. The witness stated that he recognized one of the identification certificates, of the type described supra., as being one that had been issued to him by Candelori. Earlier in the trial, before Lobel and her trial counsel left the courtroom, other solicitors had testified that this particular certificate, which included on its face the name of “Bishop” Candelori, was identical to the ones that they utilized while working for Lobel. Finally, the witness testified that Candelori had influenced his prior grand jury testimony, and stated that Candelori had asked him to go into hiding to avoid testifying at the instant trial.</p>

The stipulated testimony indicated that the solicitor was not cognizant of any charitable or religious activities attributable to “Bishop” Candelori or the Salvation Mission Workers. The solicitor also stated that she obtained identification certificates from Candelori, and she identified one of the certificates that she had used. In addition, the solicitor testified that she did not know Lobel.</p>

Immediately thereafter, Candelori was found guilty of theft by deception and criminal conspiracy, and, subsequently, Lobel and her counsel returned to the courtroom. Upon their return the case against Lobel continued as the Commonwealth introduced Lobel’s testimony from a prior trial in which Lobel had been prosecuted for perjury. In that testimony, Lobel admitted having lied in her testimony before a grand jury investigating the instant solicitation scheme, and she further admitted to having solicited with collection cans labeled “Help Handicapped Children” and “Salvation Mission Army Workers” on various occasions, using identification certificates bearing the name of and furnished by “Bishop” Candelori. She further admitted that she transported others to solicitation sites, retained a 50% share of the others’ collected monies, and that she paid Candelori $3.00 per collection can used. Lobel stated that the parceling out of the collected funds in this manner was done in accordance with an agreement and instructions put forth by Candelori. In addition, Lobel admitted that she never gave the collected funds to causes such as helping handicapped children or any other charitable use. Nevertheless, Lobel testified that she did not perceive anything wrongful in what she had done.</p>

Based upon the record before it, Superior Court noted that “absolutely no evidence was admitted against [Lobel] during her absence,” and that there was “no basis for the court en banc’s conclusion that trial counsel’s ineffectiveness was apparent on the record or that counsel’s decision was ‘incomprehensible and arbitrary.’” <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, the record before the trial court was the same as that which had already been reviewed by the Superior Court.

    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[247,963,1156,1056]]]'>In the present case, Lobel’s trial counsel has not testified on the record as to his reasons for seeking excusal of himself, and Lobel, from the courtroom. Thus, speculation as to those reasons necessarily arises, and the Commonwealth argues that counsel was pursuing a reasonable strategy of disassociating Lobel from her more culpable co-defendant, Candelori, who was being tried upon more charges than was Lobel, and that counsel was trying to demonstrate Lobel’s lack of concern for her co-defendant and to show a schism between the two co-defendants. Showing such a disassociation between the two co-defendants, the Commonwealth argues, was a wise strategy designed to rebut the inference that the defendants were co-conspirators. Further, it is argued that counsel took little or no risk in making a departure from the courtroom, since the departure occurred only after the prosecutor announced that the testimony of the remaining two witnesses would relate only to Candelori. In addition to these justifications for counsel’s action, there is another possible explanation for counsel’s action that should be addressed.</p>

Specifically, by counsel’s absenting himself and Lobel from portions of the trial that related to Lobel’s co-defendant, a gain may indeed have been realized by having emphasized the distinction between Lobel’s case and that of the arguably more culpable co-defendant. Yet, if that strategy failed, the record would nevertheless have been seeded with an ineffectiveness claim on which an assertion of entitlement to a new trial might be based. Thus, there was an arguable strategic basis for counsel’s actions.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[134,959,1155,1016]]]'>Granted, there is room to debate the likelihood of success associated with a tactic of emphasizing the distinction between the two co-defendants, particularly in a case such as this where the dramatic gesture of departing from the courtroom was employed in a bench trial rather than in a trial before jurors, in view of the fact that one might expect jurors to be more easily influenced by such dramatic tactics. Similarly, there is the question as to whether it was reasonable for counsel to rely upon the assurances of the prosecutor that the evidence to be introduced would not pertain to counsel’s client. Of course, if it later appeared that the prosecutor had misrepresented the nature of the evidence to be introduced, counsel could reasonably argue for relief on grounds he had been deceived into departing from the courtroom. Examination of the record in this case, however, fails to reveal any indication of deceptive tactics on the part of the prosecution, and, indeed, none have been alleged. The evidence introduced in counsel’s absence did, on its face, relate only to Lobel’s co-defendant.</p>

Any de<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>fense would have been greatly limited, not only because of the strongly incriminating testimony that had been admitted against Lobel prior to Lobel’s departure with counsel from the courtroom, but also in view of the fact that Lobel’s prior testimony from the trial in which she had been convicted of perjuring herself before a grand jury was to be introduced. In that testimony, recounted supra., Lobel in effect admitted all the major elements of the fraudulent solicitation scheme for which she was being tried in the instant case, even though Lobel asserted that she did not regard her conduct as wrongful. Under such circumstances, counsel may have been pursuing the only trial strategy that he perceived to be available, by creating an appearance of disassociation between Lobel and the co-defendant and by laying the groundwork for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, it cannot be said that such a strategy was so lacking in reason that “in light of all the alternatives available ... no competent lawyer would have chosen it.” <em>Commonwealth v.

There was not one instance in which Lobel was referred to as having been involved in those activities, or even as having had any association or contact with Candelori. In short, Lobel was not mentioned or alluded to in any way during the testimony, except for one instance.

    <p id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[249,818,1155,788]]]'>One of the witnesses who testified in counsel’s absence identified an identification certificate that had been issued to him by Candelori, and this was the same certificate that had been identified earlier in the trial, before counsel’s departure, as being exactly the same as certificates that Lobel supplied to her solicitors. It is argued, therefore, that identification of this certificate established a crucial link between Lobel and Candelori, and that the failure of counsel to be present to cross-examine as to that certificate’s identification was prejudicial. In short, it is alleged that this testimony, as well as other testimony elicited during counsel’s absence from the courtroom, such as testimony to the effect that solicited funds were not channeled into religious or charitable applications, was highly prejudicial to Lobel.</p>
    <p id="b236-6" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[245,1633,1155,743]],["BL_237.1",237,[135,318,1153,567]]]'>We do not believe, however, that prejudice warranting a new trial can be claimed upon the facts presented. The allegedly crucial nature of the testimony presented during counsel’s absence has been overstated by Lobel in an effort to gain a new trial, for the testimony challenged as prejudicial was, for the most part, cumulative with respect to testimony that had been presented prior to counsel’s departure from the courtroom. Nevertheless, a claim of prejudice still might be sustained were it not for the fact that, in testimony at her trial upon charges of perjury, Lobel <em>admitted </em>every significant fact that is now alleged to have been established by adverse witnesses during counsel’s absence. In Lobel’s perjury trial testimony, recounted supra., Lobel admitted that she supplied her solicitors with <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>identification certificates which were furnished by and which bore the name of “Bishop” Candelori, that she parceled out the collected funds in accordance with an agreement and instructions set forth by Candelori, that she never applied the retained funds to religious or charitable causes, etc. In the face of these admissions by Lobel, it is inconceivable that any of the testimony admitted in counsel’s absence could have been prejudicial, inasmuch as that testimony, if it can be taken to relate to Lobel at all, merely substantiated aspects of Candelori’s operation that Lobel had already admitted to be true.</p>
    <p id="b237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[134,907,1154,935]]]'>Thus, we believe Lobel has failed to establish, that trial counsel’s actions were ineffective, or that prejudice was incurred through those actions. In so holding, however, we do not wish to endorse the practice followed by counsel in this case, for, although counsel’s strategy was not unreasonable and caused defendant no prejudice, the practice of counsel absenting himself from the courtroom is one that, in the usual case, would be fraught with risk. This is particularly so in the context of conspiracy cases, where the potential for intertwining factual and legal issues is great. Further, trial strategies that involve setting the stage for built-in ineffective assistance of counsel claims are to be looked upon with great disfavor. In the future, therefore, case by case experimentation in the area of courtroom absence by counsel during criminal trials shall be regarded as prohibited. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.
