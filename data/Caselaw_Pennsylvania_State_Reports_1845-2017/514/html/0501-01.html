[and] No appeal therefrom shall be allowed to any court....”, 43 P.S. § 217.7(a), nevertheless the courts have jurisdiction to review Act 111 arbitration awards in the nature of narrow certiorari.

As we have noted, and as the Township concedes, policemen may seek judicial <em>review </em>of an Act 111 arbitration award in the nature of narrow certiorari to determine whether the arbitrators had jurisdiction, the regularity of the proceedings, whether the arbitrators exceeded their powers and authority, and constitutional questions. This right of review by way of narrow certiorari was predicated in <em>City of Washington </em>upon our former Supreme Court Rule 68½, but subsequent cases of this Court have made it clear that, although “Rule 68½ has since been repealed, we will retain the stated scope of review.” <em>Township of Moon v.
