PennDOT sought the <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>then vacant property for the purposes of constructing a highway. Estimated just compensation of $13,920.00 was paid into the court by PennDOT on May 25, 1977. An additional amount ($2,180.00) was added to the initial payment on January 7, 1981, thereby increasing the total payment to $16,100.00. PennDOT was eventually forced to contribute another $34,500.00 after a jury returned a verdict of $50,000.00 from PennDOT’s appeal of the Board of Viewers’ report, which had awarded Pittsburgh North $69,-250.00 in damages. No delay damages were ever paid on any portion of the jury award. Pittsburgh North thereafter filed a Petition for Interest, contending that delay compensation was appropriate based on the findings of the Board of Viewers. The petition was denied. On appeal the Commonwealth Court affirmed, 89 Pa.Cmwlth. 573, <a href="/citations/?q=492%20A.2d%201168" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="492 A.2d 1168">492 A.2d 1168</a>.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[244,1221,1161,1037]]]'>The trial court determined that pursuant to section 611 of the Eminent Domain Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> PennDOT would have to have taken possession of the condemned tract of land in order for Pittsburgh North to be entitled to delay compensation. Pittsburgh North argued that “by designating the abutting highway as a limited access highway, [PennDOT] interfered with its full and normal use of the property because [Pittsburgh North] was thereby deprived of a <em>contemplated </em>use from the time of the Declaration of Taking.” <em>Pittsburgh North, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, </em>Slip. op. Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, GD 81-14168 at 1 (emphasis added). The trial court rejected the argument, holding that in the instant case the character of the condemned, vacant tract remained unchanged and will remain unchanged until Penn-DOT actually takes physical possession. The Commonwealth Court thereafter based its affirmance on the trial court’s, reasoning. From that decision appellant sought allowance of appeal, which was granted.</p>

      <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>Pittsburgh North raises two issues herein: (1) whether it was entitled to delay compensation under section 611 at the time PennDOT acquired the right to possession of the condemned tract; and (2) whether the prescribed rate of interest of six percent per annum under section 611 is unconstitutional. Based on the following analysis, we affirm the lower courts’ decision.</p>

This was due to the fact that PennDOT refused to guarantee that it would not enter the land prior to harvest, thereby forcing the condemnees to refrain from planting any crops on the condemned parcels. The facts in the case at bar are easily distinguishable from those in <em>Hughes, supra. </em>Pittsburgh North states that PennDOT’s action of condemnation prevented its <em>contemplated </em>development of the vacant land.
