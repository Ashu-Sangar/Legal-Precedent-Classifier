According to official job descriptions, each DLR <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>performs a variety of functions related to the marketing of state lottery tickets. These functions include coordination of advertising activities, distribution of lottery materials, evaluation of the performance of sales agents, and supervision of compliance with regulations and policies governing the sale of lottery tickets. The DLRs have been paid under a “portal-to-portal pay system” (hereinafter p-t-p). Under this system, the DLRs have treated their official headquarters for travel expense purposes as their homes, and they have received pay on an hourly scale from the time they leave their homes each workday until the time they return to their homes, on the basis of a 7½ hour work day, i.e., from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., less a one hour unpaid lunch period.</p>

Then, in July of 1986, the department proposed to reorganize the work of the DLRs by eliminating DLRs from field operations, replacing them with contractors to perform delivery and marketing functions and creating a smaller number of new positions in the Harrisburg area for employees who would use telephones to keep in contact with lottery ticket retailers. The department has regularly described elimination of p-t-p as desirable in the interest of promoting efficiency and productivity within the department, and the position of the department has been that, if p-t-p is not eliminated, most of <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>the present DLRs will be furloughed from their jobs through the reorganization plan.</p>

The general scope of review applicable to cases where an appellate court is called upon to review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is also well settled. In reviewing the grant or denial of such an injunction, an appellate court is not to inquire into the merits of the underlying controversy, but rather must examine the record to determine whether there were any apparently reasonable grounds to support the action of the court below, and, if it is plain that no grounds exist to support the decree or that the rule of law relied upon was palpably erroneous or misapplied, the decision of the court below must be reversed. <em>Roberts v.

If an agency seeks to accomplish its mission in a more efficient manner, by redistributing work among its employees, it is pursuing a commendable administrative objective.

Based upon these considerations, the department argues that issuance of the instant injunction <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>constituted an unwarranted interference with management of the Pennsylvania State Lottery. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[124,422,1155,1662]]]'>The harms which the Commonwealth Court sought to prevent by issuance of the injunction, namely the consequences that could conceivably be incurred by employees as a result of being furloughed, are speculative in nature, whereas the injunction’s interference with management of the department is of a most certain form. In holding that irreparable harm would be suffered by the employees if an injunction against the furloughs were not to be issued, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that, during the period required for final resolution of unfair labor practice proceedings and grievance proceedings that had been instituted with respect to the furlough actions, furloughed DLRs might face hardships and losses deriving from the possible need to relocate to obtain new employment, possible mortgage foreclosures, disruption of spousal employment, disruption of children’s schooling and social patterns, and interruption of medical care provisions. It is established, however, that “speculative considerations ... cannot form the basis for issuing [a preliminary injunction].” <em>Berkowitz v.

Further, losses arising from termination of employment have not been regarded as providing a basis for a finding of irreparable harm. As stated in Berkowitz, <a href="/pa/416/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="416 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="1893008" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0369-01">416 Pa. at 374</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20280" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="206 A.2d 280">206 A.2d at 282</a>, where an employee sought a preliminary injunction to avert alleged harms that might ensue from a termination of employment, “These are not matters of record before us, and even if a hearing had been held to prove these specific items of hardship, at best they are speculative considerations which cannot form the basis for issuing the extraordinary relief sought.”</p>

The position of <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>the DLRs is not, therefore, unique, and there appears no basis for departure from settled remedies which have traditionally been made available to employees who believe the terms of their employment contracts have been infringed. Injunctive relief is not normally available in cases involving employment contract disputes such as the one in the instant case, since damage awards are deemed adequate to compensate for losses that result from breaches of such contracts. <em>Clark v.

    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[259,1203,1155,1173]]]'>In issuing the instant injunction, Commonwealth Court noted that the threat of immediate furloughs might have coercive effects upon the exercise of the rights of the DLRs during the proceedings instituted before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board to determine whether the furloughs constituted an unfair labor practice, and in grievance proceedings that had been set in motion to challenge the proposed furloughs. We believe that consideration of such speculative factors was, however, improper. Conflicts between unions and employers inherently involve coercive influences, from both sides of the bargaining table, and there is no basis for the conclusion that irreparable harm is incurred merely as a result of the fact that department management has at its behest certain bargaining tools with which to possibly counter the instant union’s position regarding proposals to alter the p-t-p pay system. The effects, if any, which the proposed furloughs might have upon the outcome of grievance proceedings and Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board proceedings are of a most speculative nature, and, thus, do not supply a proper basis upon which to award injunctive relief.

The injunction effectively imposes upon the department significant new impediments to the achievement of efficiency in the department, hampering and substantially delaying efforts to remove unnecessary employees from the payroll, thereby working to the detriment of the public interest in governmental efficiency.</p>

Damage awards are adequate to rectify losses suffered by improperly furloughed employees, and there are available to such employees the usual administrative remedies such as reinstatement, restoration of seniority, restoration of back pay and fringe benefits, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we find no reasonable basis for the Commonwealth Court’s determination that the DLRs have no adequate remedy at law and that irreparable harm would be suffered if a preliminary injunction were not issued to prevent the instant furloughs.

Initially, by discussions and then, in July of 1986, by memoranda from the department’s director of personnel, the department has proposed to reorganize the work of the DLRs by eliminating DLRs in field operations as at present, replacing their delivery and marketing display functions by contractors and creating a smaller number of new positions in the Harrisburg area to deal with retailers primarily by telephone. The department proposal involves furloughing the home-based DLRs working in the respective six areas of the state, proceeding one area at a time, beginning with the thirteen DLRs now remaining in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.3",262,[261,301,1154,685]]]'>
      <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>11. Departmental oral and written communications have regularly described the elimination of the p-t-p pay system as desirable for the achievement of productivity goals. However, department management has in fact not presented the proposed reorganization as a definite administrative action desirable for its own sake, but has consistently presented it only as an alternative which the department would undertake if the union declines to accept elimination of the p-t-p pay plan. Accordingly, the department’s position, as communicated to the union representatives and DLRs in the six areas of the state, has essentially been that, if the p-t-p pay plan of DLRs is not eliminated, the present DLRs will be furloughed from their jobs.</p>
    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[260,1004,1152,257]]]'>12. In fact, by written notification of July 25, 1986, the department’s director of personnel informed the union and the respective Pittsburgh DLRs that all DLR positions in the Pittsburgh area will be eliminated and all DLRs will be furloughed effective August 28, 1986.</p>
    <p id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[259,1280,1152,205]]]'>13. Department management officials, after the announcement of the Pittsburgh furloughs, have continued to communicate the prospect of such furloughs being invoked in other areas if the p-t-p pay system is not eliminated.</p>
    <p id="b262-7" data-blocks='[["BL_262.6",262,[255,1503,1155,851]]]'>14. No evidence appears in the record to explain why, if the “telemarketing” mode of operation proposed in the reorganization is desirable as an administrative end in itself, it must be immediately initiated from Harrisburg rather than being conducted out of the department’s Pittsburgh office as an alternative to the home-based operation of the DLRs. That is, no valid reason appears to explain the initial transfer of all DLR functions (except those given to outside contractors) from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, rather than having them conducted — albeit by a smaller number of employees — from the Pittsburgh office. Although the department could avoid furloughing 100% of the Pittsburgh DLRs and still revise the mode of operation, the department has not done so. The evidence indicates that the reorganization proposal is primarily a means of coercion rather than a genuine plan for administrative improvement.</p>
    <p id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.3",263,[138,318,1152,314]]]'>
      <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>15. The thirteen furloughed Pittsburgh DLRs are qualified to fill the proposed new DLR positions in Harrisburg. Because only seven new positions are presently proposed, selection of DLRs willing to move to Harrisburg would be achieved in accordance with seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[137,650,1153,479]]]'>16. Furloughed DLRs and the union have instituted, with respect to the furlough actions, (1) unfair labor practice proceedings before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB) on the ground that the department is using the furloughs unlawfully to coerce the employees with respect to their bargaining rights and (2) grievances on the ground that the furloughs are being employed to coerce the employees into giving up a pay system based upon established past practice.</p>
    <p id="b263-6" data-blocks='[["BL_263.5",263,[136,1147,1154,1230]],["BL_264.1",264,[258,313,1149,149]]]'>17. During the period required for the final resolution of the unfair labor practice and grievance proceedings, which may be as short as several months or as long as two years or more, furloughed DLRs face hardship and losses which would not be remedied by dispositions of those proceedings in their favor. Pittsburgh DLRs who elect and obtain placement in the new Harrisburg positions would face the necessity of relocating their homes twice, if the proceedings determine the alleged reorganization to be invalid as a coercive device, by reason of leaving or selling their homes and disrupting family roots to move to central Pennsylvania, and then doing the same in order to return to western Pennsylvania. Such dislocations include, in addition to the sale and purchase or lease of two residences, disruption of spouse employment, disruption of children’s schooling and social patterns, and disruption of medical care arrangements. Even if arbitrators or the PLRB awarded back-pay — which is not assured even in the event of decisions in favor of the employees — compensation for relocation expenses and family losses is not available. With respect to DLRs not eligible to be placed in the new Harrisburg positions, their loss of employment could later be compensated if backpay awards are made, but consequent losses— <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>such as those ensuing from mortgage foreclosures — would involve noncompensable economic, personal and social hardships.</p>
    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[254,481,1153,631]]]'>18. Although the evidence indicates that DLRs who obtain placement in the new central Pennsylvania positions conceivably face greater irreparable harm during the determination proceedings than those who decline placement, remain in western Pennsylvania and are fortunate enough to find other employment temporarily, the furloughed DLRs cannot be reasonably expected to forego the placement opportunities in the face of their need for gainful employment. The department’s insistence on establishing the new positions remotely has an effect similar to a forced transfer as to those DLRs — up to seven in number — who could obtain the new positions.</p>
    <p id="b264-6" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[253,1131,1152,357]]]'>19. If relief is not afforded in the form of enjoining the furloughs pending determination of the labor proceedings, no future remedy is available to offset the coercive effect of the department’s threat of reorganization, as an alternative to foregoing the p-t-p system, upon the past-practice labor rights of the remaining five groups of DLRs elsewhere in the state.</p>
    <p id="b264-7" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[251,1516,1153,851]]]'>20. Refusal of a preliminary injunction will subject the furloughed DLRs to greater injury than would result to the interests of the Commonwealth by reason of postponing the change in method and location of operation of the DLR functions. First, the revised mode of operation does not appear to be desired by the department on its own merits solely, but rather as an alternative to the p-t-p pay system which the department opposes. Second, the fact that, according to the secretary, the department has already deferred the matter for fifteen months indicates that the department sees no great urgency in effectuating a change. Third, the department — which views the initial Pittsburgh change as a pilot test of its approach — could test the approach by instituting some of the new methods from the Pittsburgh office without insisting upon a wholesale transfer of functions to central Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p id="b265-7" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[136,1087,1153,737]]]'>The pivotal question here is the irreparability of the harm. Although the situation here is not as clearcut as that in <em>Mazzie, </em>the evidence here strongly indicates that the departmental “reorganization” — particularly as it involves a transfer of functions unnecessarily, at this time, to central Pennsylvania — constitutes a device designed to coerce agreement as to the elimination of the p-t-p pay plan. Therefore, in addition to those elements of the individual employees’ losses which are not compensable, it appears that allowing the department to invoke job furloughs, as a coercive device, would constitute the allowance of imposition of irreparable harm upon the union as a party by subjecting the collective bargaining process to an unjustified constraint.</p>
