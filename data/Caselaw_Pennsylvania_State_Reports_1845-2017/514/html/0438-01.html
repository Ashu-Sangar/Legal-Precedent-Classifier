    <p id="b503-6" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[170,934,1156,1225]]]'>Appellee’s defense was one of alibi. He claimed he was asleep in Sunbury, Pennsylvania during the time the burglary occurred. His testimony therefore directly contradicted that'of the co-conspirator and his wife who testified that he participated in the burglary. Obviously then, credibility was an important consideration to the jury in determining the guilt or innocence of Appellee. The introduction of evidence which arguably tends to ascribe the element of motive to Appellee cannot be deemed to be harmless in this instance, since it would reflect directly upon his credibility. Notably, none of the stolen items was found in Appellee’s possession, and the eyewitnesses to the crime did not identify or implicate Appellee. It is certainly a reasonable possibility, then, that the jury could have found the two co-conspirators who were in possession of the stolen items guilty and, believing the story of Appellee, find him not guilty. While this may be unlikely, it certainly cannot be said that it is unlikely beyond a reasonable doubt. The introduction of inadmissible evidence at trial tending to cast a new and not merely cumulative element against the Appellee, given the positions of the parties involved, puts an unmeasurable variable into the proceeding and the jury’s deliberation.</p>

Joseph Ruskuski, a co-conspirator, testified that he and the three co-defendants at trial planned and executed a burglary on the night of May 4th, 1981. (Notes of Testimony at 119-41) Ruskuski’s wife testified that, after the burglary, appellee and Derek made incriminating statements.

Each of the co-defendants testified that they played cards at Derek’s apartment, and then were sleeping there when the burglary occurred. Derek testified that (1) Ruskuski came to his (Derek’s) apartment at 3:00 a.m. the morning of May 5th, 1981; (2) Ruskuski then admitted that he burglarized the building himself, and asked Derek for help; (3) Ruskuski feared his car had been identified at the scene of the crime; and (4) Derek refused to help, and sent Ruskuski away. (N.T. at 357-59) Appellee testified that he heard parts of the discussion between Derek and Ruskuski, and confirmed that Derek sent Ruskuski away. (N.T. at 433) Derek testified that he found a calculator on his porch the morning of May 5th, 1981, and showed it to Yuhas and then to appellee. (N.T. at 360-63) This calculator was taken in the burglary, and was seized by police from Derek's closet later in the day on May 5th, 1981. Appellee and Yuhas confirmed that Derek showed them the calculator. (N.T. at 434-35, 400)</p>

      <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>This case, then, turned solely on the issue of credibility of the respective witnesses, with Ruskuski and his wife on one side, and the three co-defendants on the other. The jury obviously found Ruskuski’s account more credible than the mutually supportive alibis presented by the three co-defendants. The majority asserts that the testimony concerning appellee’s income could have had an adverse effect on appellee’s credibility, and thus tainted his conviction, stating:</p>

In this case, however, Yuhas and Derek were convicted upon the same evidence, and pursuant to the same jury determination of credibility, as was appellee. Any inadmissible evidence with a presumed effect on credibility was presented against Yuhas and Derek, as well as against appellee, for what affected the credibility of one affected the credibility of all co-defendants. I cannot accept, on the facts of this case, the majority theory that “the jury could have found the co-conspirators who were in possession of the stolen items guilty and, believing the story of Appellee, find him not guilty” had it not been for the testimony regarding his income. To the contrary, the defense presented in this case was an “all or nothing” defense, given the three co-defendants’ consistent, interwoven alibis.</p>
