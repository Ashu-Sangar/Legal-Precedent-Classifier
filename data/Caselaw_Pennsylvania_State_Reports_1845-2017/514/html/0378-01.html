We note that this case presents no willful misconduct issue under Section 402(e) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, as in <em>Penflex v. Bryson, </em><a href="/pa/506/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="506 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1790962" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0274-01">506 Pa. 274</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="506 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1790962" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0274-01">485 A.2d 359</a> (1984). In <em>Penflex, </em>consistent with a line of appellate cases distinguishing on the basis of causation situations in which Section 402(d) on work stoppages applies from those involving willful misconduct under 402(e), we held claimants’ unemployment was caused by their discharge at the same time the work stoppage there began. The claimants in the present case were not at any time discharged or furloughed, but engaged in a work stoppage to protest the School District's refusal to honor the Agreement’s terms in its second year. <em>See Penflex, </em><a href="/pa/506/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="506 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1790962" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0274-01">506 Pa. at 287-89</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="506 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1790962" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0274-01">485 A.2d at 365-66</a>. Their unemployment resulted exclusively from the work stoppage to which 402(d) applies. Parenthetically we note that those employees who were furloughed did receive benefits at the administrative level pursuant to Section 402.1(1) and (2) because they had no reasonable expectation of returning to work in September, 1981. 43 P.S. § 802.1(1) and (2) (Supp.1986). <em>See Odgers, </em><a href="/pa-commw/89/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="89 Pa.

Identity of issues is but one of the requirements for successful assertion of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
