Appellant’s suit challenged the constitutional validity of the local option provision embodied in Section 472 of the Liquor Code. 47 P.S. § 4-472. The local option provision permits municipalities, <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>by referendum, to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within their borders. The appellant sought to have the court declare Section 472 illegal and void on the grounds that: (1) it violates Article I, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution; (2) it violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; and (3) it violates the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The appellant also sought supplemental relief by way of a rule upon the PLCB to show cause why an order should not issue directing the PLCB to consider appellant’s application for renewal of his restaurant liquor license pending resolution of the constitutional issues. In response to appellant’s action, the PLCB filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. A panel of the Commonwealth Court (Craig, Palladino and Kalish, J.J.) sustained the demurrer and dismissed appellant’s suit. Appeal to this court followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We now affirm.</p>

    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[172,1307,1152,742]]]'>The appellant was the owner of a restaurant — lounge business which he operated under restaurant liquor license No. 20038 issued to him by the PLCB. The business was conducted in Penn Township, Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania under the trade name of Ye Olde Barn Lounge. Appellant acquired the retail liquor license in August, 1972. He opened for business under the license on April 1, 1977. Appellant was never cited for violating any provision of the Liquor Code and he renewed his license annually without incident. The appellant owns the real estate from which he operated the lounge. He purchased the property in order to get into the tavern business and over the years he invested about $150,000.00 in the realty in furtherance of his business.</p>

A majority of the electorate voted to ban the granting or renewal of liquor licenses in the township, and according to section 472, the PLCB then was without authority to renew appellant’s liquor license when it expired on January 31, 1986. Section 472 of the liquor code provides that a referendum may not be held in the same municipality “... oftener than once in four years ...” 47 P.S. § 4-472. Because of this limitation, the question of liquor sales in the township could not come up for another vote until, at the earliest, the primary election in 1989. As a result, the appellant cannot seek to have the voters reconsider by another referendum vote until that time.</p>

Fair market value is the price that would be agreed to by a willing and informed seller and buyer, taking into account, inter alia, the present use of the property and its value for that use. The condemnee was operating a retail liquor establishment under a valid, unrevoked and renewable liquor license in a municipality which permitted liquor sales. These circumstances were to be taken into consideration in computing damages. This is an entirely different situation than that which is present in the instant case. Here there was no property taken for public use. No authority or governmental body condemned any of appellant’s property for public purposes. The electorate of Penn Township, pursuant to the provisions of the Liquor Code, voted to prohibit the sale of liquor within the municipality. The appellant’s license was issued subject to the condition that the inhabitants of the township could vote to ban liquor sales at some future time. Now that the electorate has exercised that right, the appellant will not be heard to demand compensation.</p>

This has little to do with the question in the case sub judice. Whether a license <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>is or is not subject to levy, execution or attachment to satisfy a judgment, the license is always subject to the conditions of the Liquor Code. One of those conditions is the local option provision that could render the PLCB without the authority to renew the license as happened in this case. Where the electors of a municipality proceed in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-472 of the Liquor Code and vote to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within their boundaries, that vote is not a taking of private property for public use requiring compensation to those who are unable to renew a license.</p>

Appellant contends that the lack of due process results from the legislature delegating police powers to the electorate without providing standards to guide the voters. Appellant argues there is nothing to assure that the voters of a municipality will not vote to ban liquor sales for improper motives. First, we question the appellant’s characterization of Section 472 as a legislative delegation of police powers. “Under our constitutional assumptions, all power derives from the people, who can delegate it to representative instruments which they create.” <em>City of Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., </em><a href="/us/426/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="426 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6181713" data-case-paths="/us/426/0668-01">426 U.S. 668</a>, <a href="/us/426/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="426 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6181713" data-case-paths="/us/426/0668-01">96 S.Ct. 2358</a>, <a href="/us/426/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="426 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6181713" data-case-paths="/us/426/0668-01">49 L.Ed.2d 132</a> (1976). In this instance, the power to regulate liquor sales generally, was given to the legislature as a representative body. A portion of that power was returned to the people whence it came in the form of the local option law. The fact that its return to the people was not accompanied by discernible standards does not invalidate that power. The question is not whether the legislature prescribed standards when the local option provi<a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>sion was adopted, but whether the law is a reasonable exercise of police powers and is rationally related to the object and purposes of the Liquor Code. We hold that it is, and correspondingly, we further hold that the local option law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
