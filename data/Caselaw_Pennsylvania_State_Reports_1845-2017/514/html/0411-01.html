On or about December 21, 1983, the Appellant was observed by two police officers driving through a “steady red light” and proceeding for “approximately two hundred to three hundred yards in an erratic manner.” (N.T., p. 2). As a result, the police officers stopped the Appellant and detected the “strong odor of alcoholic beverage about his person and breath”. The officer’s testimony also indicated that the Appellant had difficulty in walking and otherwise failed various field sobriety tests. The Appellant was placed <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At the police station, the Appellant was requested to and consented to perform a breathalyzer test. After the test was performed, the officers requested that the Appellant submit to a second breathalyzer test. In response to this request, the Appellant asked to speak to an attorney or in the alternative to see the statute requiring him to submit to a second breathalyzer test. Even though he was warned by the police officers several times that such a response was considered a refusal and would result in an automatic suspension of his operating privileges for at least one year, the Appellant refused the second test.</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[245,937,1155,409]]]'>As a result of his refusal to take the second test, the Department of Transportation suspended the Appellant’s operating privileges under § 1547(a) of the Motor Vehicle Code (75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(a)). The Appellant appealed his suspension to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County which dismissed his appeal.

      <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>As set forth above, § 1547(a) is not clear on its face, but susceptible to differing interpretations. The highlighted section can mean either that the police are permitted to administer one blood, one urine, <em>and </em>one breath test, or that they may require a multiple number of blood, urine <em>or </em>breath tests. Section 1547(a) can also mean that the police may administer a multiple number of one particular type of testing, e.g., two blood, or two breath, or two urine tests.</p>
    <p id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[253,721,1160,1040]]]'>Following the instructive directive of the Act as enumerated in subsections 1-5, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(1)—(5), it is clear from reading § 1547 of the Motor Vehicle Code that the pujóse and remedial objective of § 1547 is to provide the police with evidence to prosecute an intoxicated driver, thereby keeping him off Commonwealth roadways. Prior to the 1982 amendments, a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol was a misdemeanor of the third degree without a mandatory sentence. The present statute makes a person convicted of drunk driving guilty of a misdemean- or of the second degree, with the penalty for such a first time conviction being increased to a mandatory forty-eight hours of imprisonment. Under the prior statute, the legislature empowered the police to administer only a blood <em>or </em>breath test. Now the legislature has expanded police authority not only by permitting a urine test, but also by providing the police with the authority to require additional testing. By the passage of these various amendments, it is clear that the legislature is making a concerted effort to keep drunk drivers off of our highways.</p>
    <p id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[249,1781,1156,570]],["BL_479.1",479,[147,295,1155,517]]]'>In addition to reviewing the necessity for a statute, the circumstances of its enactment, the mischief to be remedied and the object to be attained in determining legislative intent, we must consider the consequences of a particular interpretation. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(6). The legislature has also instructed us that in enacting a statute it “does not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or of this Commonwealth.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3). Therefore, if one interpretation results in conflict with another statute, or violation of the Federal or State Constitution, such interpretation cannot be accepted. Although it <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>is clear that the legislature intended to extend police authority in testing for drunk drivers under § 1547(a), the legislature did not intend either an unreasonable result or a constitutional violation. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922. Under the interpretation suggested by the Appellee and followed by the police in this case, the legislature would be delegating unbridled power to the police, resulting in a violation of Art. 1, § 8 of the Constitution of this Commonwealth. For this reason, neither the Appellee’s interpretation nor its actions can be accepted.</p>

Funk, </em><a href="/pa-super/254/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="254 Pa. Super. 233" data-case-ids="96746" data-case-paths="/pa-super/254/0233-01">254 Pa.Super. 233</a>, <a href="/pa-super/254/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="254 Pa.

Although an individual consents to a chemical test by driving on Commonwealth roadways, the initial intrusion must be supported by probable cause and conducted in a reasonable manner. Under § 1547(a), the basis for the initial stop and search is the police officer’s reasonable belief that the person from whom the request for a chemical test is being made is driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and thus the search is either incident to a lawful arrest or necessitated by exigent circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v. Cieri, </em><a href="/pa-super/346/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="346 Pa.

In order to justify a second intrusion, the police officer must establish circumstances which support the reasonableness of a second search. To hold otherwise would subject an individual to “unreasonable searches and seizures” in violation of Art. 1, § 8 of our Constitution. A second test may be proper if the first test was inconclusive <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>due to faulty equipment or faulty performance by the individual. Thus, if an individual fails to fully participate in a breathalyzer test, subjecting him to a blood or urine test may be reasonable. However, requiring a blood test after completing a breathalyzer solely to enhance the evidence and guarantee a conviction is not “reasonable” under Art. 1, § 8 of our Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[260,667,1155,607]]]'>Accordingly, we hold that § 1547(a) authorizes a police officer to request a chemical test for alcohol provided that probable cause exists for the initial stop. If more than one test is requested, the police officer must offer sufficient evidence to establish the “reasonableness” of such a request. In this case, the only purpose given for the second test was to substantiate the accuracy of the first test. A request founded upon such a shallow basis can never be deemed “reasonable” and is thus violative of Art. 1, § 8 of our Constitution. Therefore, the second request in this instance was improper, and the Appellant cannot be deemed to have refused.</p>
