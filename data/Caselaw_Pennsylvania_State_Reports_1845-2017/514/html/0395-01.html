Officers Jack J. Parker and Walter G. Fife of the Tinicum Township Police Department arrived on the scene within minutes of the alarm. The motel clerk advised Officer Parker that the television alarm in Room 122 had sounded. An investigation revealed that the television in Room 122 was missing.</p>

Officer Parker observed two men peeking out of a glass doorway. Believing the men were acting in a suspicious manner, he radioed Officer Fife and described his observations. Officer Parker entered the building adjacent to where he had observed the two men and again saw the two individuals peek out of the glass doorway. As Officer Parker approached, the two men exited the building close to where Officer Fife was standing.</p>

Defendant replied that he was a guest in the motel and that they were in the same room. Officer Fife asked to see the room key to confirm their status as guests. The co-defendant stated that his wife was in the room and that she had the key.</p>

In response to the co-defendant’s knock on the door, his wife opened the curtains. At this time, Officer Fife observed through the window a large plastic bag atop a scale. The door was opened and the officer given permission to enter. Upon entering, the officer observed white powder in the plastic bag. Officer Fife called down to Officer Parker, “Jack, you’d better come up here.” At that time, Officer Parker told Appellee to come with him to the motel room. Appellee entered the room in front of the officer and exclaimed, “All this stuff is mine, they know nothing about <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>it.” Appellee and the co-defendants were then placed under arrest for suspected illegal drug activity.

The subsequent illegality of Appellee’s detention after the voluntary statement does not retroactively change the circumstances under which he made the disclosure.

The “six-hour” rule promulgated in <em>Davenport </em>was designed to effectuate those underlying purposes in a way that was both certain and workable. Although the majority opinion in the instant case recognizes the dual purposes of the rule excluding evidence obtained during unnecessary delay, the majority proposes a drastic abridgment of the <em>Davenport </em>rule that will severely undermine the second of those essential purposes. If, as the majority opinion proposes, only statements obtained <em>after </em>the lapse of the six-hour period should be subject to exclusion, then once the police obtain a statement prior to the end of that period, there will no longer be a compulsion on their part to have the accused arraigned in a timely manner. The sanction for unnecessary delay will be gone. If an <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>accused’s right to arraignment without unnecessary delay is to be ensured, as we have said it must, then the sanction for violation of that right must continue to be the exclusion of evidence, regardless of what point during the delay the evidence is obtained. The police must be kept cognizant that even though they have obtained a statement before the lapse of the prescribed six-hour period, continued unnecessary delay beyond that period will result in the exclusion of even that evidence.</p>

Ct. 204">84 S.Ct. 204</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20149" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="11 L. Ed. 2d 149">11 L.Ed.2d 149</a> (1963). My review of the record in this case reveals that the Commonwealth failed to make <em>any </em>certification as to the impact of the suppression order upon its case. Accordingly, I would quash this appeal and would not reach the <em>Davenport </em>issue. The failure to heed the certification requirement of <em>Dugger </em>will only add to Superior Court’s already congested docket unwarranted Commonwealth appeals of suppression orders. Moreover, I do not believe that the Commonwealth, in <em>good faith, </em>could possibly certify that the exclusion of appellee’s inculpatory statement alone either terminates or substantially handicaps its prosecution in light of the wealth of physical evidence available to the Commonwealth. On the record before us this is a <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>purely interlocutory appeal. I see no need to engage our limited appellate resources in deciding it.</p>
