No appeal was taken and judgment was entered on July 2, <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>1979. In March, 1980, the auditors again imposed a surcharge upon Chute and Deljanovan in the 1979 audit and financial report in the amount of $15,278.10.

Snyder, Richard Johnston, James Remick, Ethan Mes-singer, and Veryl Simmons, the township supervisors, seeking coverage for the surcharged amounts under insurance policies issued by the Appellant to the township. The Appellant denied coverage, asserting that the coverage of surcharges is contrary to public policy and is statutorily proscribed by Section 702(XIII) of The Second Class Township Code, Act of May 1,1933, P.L. 103, as amended, 53 P.S. § 65713. The trial court concluded that the Appellant was required to provide coverage for the surcharges. Judgment was entered against the Appellant in the amount of $11,-635.03, and the Appellant was ordered to reimburse the township for reasonable attorney’s fees.

Neither the Act nor the Code provision elucidated upon the specific conduct of an official for which liability insurance could be obtained. Both defined the authority to purchase liability insurance in terms of liability arising from the performance of an official’s duties in the course of his employment. The Code provision, however, contained an exception for surcharges. The Act removed that particular limitation on the authority of political subdivisions by grant<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>ing authority to purchase insurance for any liability arising from the performance of officials’ duties within the scope of their employment.</p>

    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[221,921,1158,1431]]]'>Both the township and its officials were named insureds under the policies which were issued. By the terms of the policies, the Appellant was required to pay on behalf of an insured losses which the insured became legally obligated to pay because of a wrongful act occurring during the policy period or an amount which the municipality was required or permitted by law to pay as indemnity to an insured. For the claim made in this case, it is the township official who is responsible for the surcharged amounts. A surcharge imposed upon a township official is neither an amount which the township is legally obligated to pay nor an amount which it would be required to pay as indemnity to an insured. This is the extent of the coverage provided by the policy. The township officials who were surcharged may have been proper claimants under the policy, but clearly the township is not. Simply stated, the township is not the proper party to sue under the terms of this policy. To find coverage for the township’s claim, the language of the policy would have to be rewritten to extend coverage to amounts which the township was <em>not </em>legally obligated to pay. This was not the agreement between the parties. While a township may obtain insurance coverage for losses it sustains as a result of an official’s actions resulting in a surcharge, this was not what was purchased by the township in this case. Accordingly, we must reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b311-3" data-blocks='[["BL_311.3",311,[173,296,1151,816]]]'>
      <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>Proceeding from the erroneous premise that it could recover surcharged amounts under these policies, the township argues that the insurer could recover the payment of a claim for the amount surcharged from the surcharged officials. This would be an impossibility because it is the surcharged official only who is the insured for the purposes of this claim. Since the insurer would be contractually bound to pay the amount surcharged on behalf of the surcharged official, no right of subrogation could exist. The policies were written, inter alia, to protect an official who is liable for the amount surcharged. It would be an absurd result that an official could be insured for his liability due to a surcharge, but have to reimburse his insurer for that very liability against which he sought to insure.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[173,1152,1151,265]]]'>While we dismiss the Appellant’s assertion that a township lacks the authority to purchase coverage for surcharges, we must agree in part with its alternate contention that insurability of wrongful acts on the part of township officials which result in surcharges is contrary to public policy.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[172,1482,1153,871]]]'>Surcharges may arise out of either the negligent conduct or the willful or fraudulent misconduct of an official. We hold that where the conduct is negligent, a township may seek insurance coverage for the loss occasioned to either the township or its officials. But where the surcharge arises from the willful or fraudulent misconduct of an official, the township may insure only its loss and may not purchase coverage for the official. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the language of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8564, and its precursor Section 703 of the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, authorizing a township to purchase insurance on itself or its employees for any liability arising from the performance of their duties <em>within the scope of their employment. </em>Surcharges arising out of an official’s willful or fraudulent misconduct necessarily are liabilities which arise outside of the scope of his employment.</p>

      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>It would also be violative of public policy to permit a township to insure against the willful or fraudulent misconduct of its officials. In those instances, the possibility of a surcharge is intended to act as a disincentive by imposing personal liability upon the official. If a township would be authorized to insure an official from personal liability under such circumstances, no disincentive would exist. An official could act without personal financial repercussions all at a cost to the taxpayers.</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[214,811,1154,692]]]'>The limitation in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8564 on the authority of a local agency to procure insurance for its employees for liability arising from conduct within the scope of their employment strikes a balance between two competing public interests. The public interest in having competent individuals seek public office without an inordinate fear that negligent conduct resulting in a surcharge would expose them to uninsurable personal liability is satisfied, as is the public interest in providing restraint on officials’ actions. No evidence was introduced in this record which would indicate that the township officials’ actions were willful or fraudulent misconduct, but the terms of the policies do not encompass claims by the township for surcharged amounts.</p>

The surcharges thereby constituted a derivative action which was predicated upon the original financial loss suffered by the Township and which is fully compensable under the law. Had the Township not sustained the loss, there would have been no surcharge. I greatly fear, in short, that my colleagues have placed the cart before the horse. They wave a magic wand and make the predicate disappear into thin air. As a matter of fact, of course, the existence of the original monetary loss will not go away for the obvious reason that it is the essential reality of this case.</p>

    <p id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.6",313,[171,1813,1154,537]]]'>Finally, I also take exception to the extraneous inferences employed by the Majority in its analysis. While it is true that they conclude in this case that there is no evidence of willful or fraudulent misconduct, I cannot understand why they found it necessary to juxtapose within their opinion a lengthy legal delineation of the consequences which could attend such behavior. Civic pride induces our good citizens to conduct the affairs of their own governments in a virtuous manner. Gratuitous implications leading to guilt by association are unwarranted on this record.</p>
