One of the residents, a former Philadelphia police officer, looked out from the rear of his house and observed a yellow or beige two-door coupe automobile in a parking lot across the back alley. He observed a white male “staggering, trying to flee the area, [who] looked as if he’d been injured.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.), Trial February 1, 1983 at 52. Another resident heard the injured man, Anthony Petrone, exclaim “Oh my god — I’m shot. I’m shot.” N.T. Trial January 31, 1983, at 98-99. The ex-police officer also observed two white males entering on either side of the car and watched as the car left the parking lot with its lights out and sped away. Other residents observed a yellow or beige or light brown midsize car, possibly an Oldsmobile or a Pontiac, exiting the parking lot and the alley with its lights out and two males in the car. Some witnesses heard a loud scraping sound, as of metal scraping against stone.</p>

At this point, the victim was badly injured, and was thrashing about, speaking and screaming incoherently. The officer attempted to find out the name of his assailant, but the only intelligible word that the officer could understand was the word “Al.” The victim was taken to nearby Methodist Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 12:20 a.m. the following morning. The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds to the cheek and head, and to the left side of the front of his chest. He was also wounded in his hand (in an apparent unsuccessful attempt to protect his face). The cause of the wounds were two .38/.357 caliber bullets<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that were probably fired from two different barrels, according to the Commonwealth’s ballistics expert. No murder weapon was ever found.</p>

Shortly thereafter, following investigation, Philadelphia police requested and obtained the issuance of a Federal Bureau of Investigation fugitive warrant on a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. On December 8, 1981, appellant and his girlfriend, Bernadette McFarland, were apprehended by F.B.I. agents in Newton Falls, Ohio, near Youngstown. Philadelphia police were notified of appellant’s arrest and Detectives Michael Chitwood, Philip Checchia and Sergeant Daniel Rosenstein left Philadelphia by car that evening, arriving in Youngstown at approximately 2:30 a.m. on December 9, 1981.</p>

At this hearing, appellant was advised by the magistrate of the charges against him, of his rights to remain silent and to counsel, and of his right to post bail to obtain his release. Following this arraignment hearing, appellant spoke with Sergeant Rosenstein regarding extradition, and agreed to waive extradition and return to Philadelphia. A state court proceeding was then held at the Barberton, Ohio courthouse, at which appellant was advised by the presiding judge of his right to contest extradition. After executing a waiver of extradition form, appellant was turned over to the custody of the Philadelphia police officers and returned to Mahoning County Jail in Youngstown for the night. The following morning, December 10, 1981 at about 6:30 a.m., appellant and Ms. McFarland were picked up and transported by the Philadelphia police officers together to Philadelphia, arriving at the Philadelphia police administration building at 1:57 p.m.</p>

Between 3:45 p.m. and 4:50 p.m., appellant confessed to the murder of John Amato in February, 1981; from 5:01 p.m. to 6:05 p.m., appellant confessed to the murder of Anthony Petrone; and from 6:06 p.m. to 7:25 p.m., appellant confessed to the murder of Anthony Bonaventura.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Appellant suggested the two go for a ride to talk about it as the restaurant was crowded. They left the restaurant and drove off in Ms. McFarland’s car, driving to a parking lot nearby.</p>

Appellant “got mad and crazy,” walked around to the victim, pulled a two-shot .38 caliber Derringer (with two “over-under” barrels) from his coat pocket, and shot the victim twice at close range.

Appellant’s confession was, understandably, the critical and most damaging evidence introduced at trial. The confession was corroborated by the witnesses from the 2800 block of South Sydenham area (who observed a car matching the description of Ms. McFarland’s car leaving the parking lot), by witnesses who had seen both the victim and appellant at Cozy’s Restaurant on the evening of March 19, 1981 (although they had not been observed together), and by William Boyle who testified that he gave appellant a .38 caliber Derringer earlier that day (which he later that day reported <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>as stolen to the police). In defense, appellant attempted to demonstrate to the jury that his confession of December 10, 1981 was involuntary because the Philadelphia police officers threatened to prosecute members of appellant’s family for aiding and abetting appellant’s escape unless appellant gave a confession.</p>

The suppression court also found that appellant made no complaint of mistreatment to either the federal magistrate or the Ohio state judge, that no officer of either the Philadelphia Police Department or the F.B.I. engaged in any conduct calculated to coerce appellant to waive his right to remain silent, and that when arrested appellant appeared responsive, calm, and uninjured.</p>

Presumably, the examination would have revealed that the undercarriage of Ms. McFarland’s car had been damaged by scraping, thus corroborating the testimony of the witness who heard a scraping sound on March 19,1981 at the scene of the shooting. This reference was completely innocuous, however, in light of the abundant evidence, including appellant’s own statement, placing Ms. McFarland’s car at the scene. Moreover, defense counsel had made the misleading comment in his closing that “no identification of any car was ever submitted in this case. Nothing,” suggesting that the Commonwealth had no evidence linking the car to the murder. This was not the case. While we admonish Ms. Christie for countering this misleading statement with a reference to an examination of the car that had been ruled inadmissible, it is clear that the reference was an invited response and was innocuous, given <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>that the car had been positively linked to the scene and the murder from other sources.

Again, appellant pulls the prosecutor’s statements out of context. The prosecutor’s comments as to what appellant chose to tell the jury were specifically directed at what he told the police officers “through December of ’81” and were made in response to defense counsel’s vigorous attempts to discredit the appellant’s confession by pointing out “inconsistencies” between the confession (e.g., appellant was alone) and testimony of witnesses (e.g., two males in the “getaway” car). Counsel’s comments were merely an attempt to place the responsibility for that discrepancy on appellant, whose confession in December of 1981 related only as much of the incident as appellant chose to relate. And the prosecutor’s comments on the “code of silence” were a legitimate attempt to suggest that the reason for the discrepancy, which defense counsel vigorously “played up” to the jury, was that he may have been protecting someone. Defense counsel would not have had a legitimate basis to lodge an objection j;o these comments, which did not raise an adverse inference on appellant’s right to remain silent at trial. <em>See Anderson v.
