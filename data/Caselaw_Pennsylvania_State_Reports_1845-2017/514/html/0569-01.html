Gatz, died as a result of stab wounds inflicted by her husband, Mack C. Gatz. Mack Gatz pleaded guilty to the homicide and is currently serving a sentence of incarceration. After the arrest of Mack Gatz, the children were taken to the home of Janet’s parents, John and Edith Steele, appellants herein. Numerous members of the paternal and maternal families filed petitions for custody in Lycoming County Common Pleas. Following the withdrawal of two parties to the action, the remaining litigants were appellants John and Edith Steele and Mack Gatz’s sister and brother-in-law, Frank and Sandra Heddings. A hearing was held in March and April of 1983. On May 12, 1983, Common Pleas awarded primary custody of the children to the Heddings with limited visitation rights accorded the Steeles.</p>

Asserting that the statements were so contrary to Janet Gatz’s “social interest” that the statements would not have been made if not true, Common Pleas accepted the hearsay testimony into evidence. The trial judge found the appellants generally fit and proper parties to seek custody “except for the Court’s concerns regarding sexual immorality stated later herein.” Common Pleas slip op., May 24, 1984, at 10. The court then found that appellant John Steele engaged in sexual intercourse with his daughter on several occasions while Janet was in her minority. Although there was no evidence that John Steele ever accosted his granddaughter Heidi Gatz, the Common Pleas court considered this “evidence” of her father’s incest with the children's mother, Janet Gatz, as a factor weighing in favor of precluding appellants from enjoying permanent custody of the children. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Indeed, it is plain the court relied on it and ignored the other evidence on this issue which could have justified the same result. Superior Court, citing a number of guarantees of trustworthiness surrounding the damning hearsay statements of Janet Gatz, adopted the statement against social interest exception to the rule against hearsay and affirmed the judgment of Common Pleas.

To determine what is against one’s <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>penal interest, a trial judge need only consult the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 101-9183, which defines criminal conduct.</p>
    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[249,462,1155,526]]]'>In the present case, Common Pleas accepted and considered testimony which it felt had the guarantees of trustworthiness necessary to obviate the hearsay rule in determining that appellants are ill-suited for custody of the minor children. That conclusion is not unreasonable on this record. However, it would not be limited to the peculiar facts of this case, but creates a new general principle which would materially impact the means by which the law seeks truth. This principle must therefore be judged as a universal. So judged, it fails.</p>

The scope of review of an appellate court in custody matters is of the broadest type. We are not free, however, to nullify the factfinding function of the hearing judge. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Robinson v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/505/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="505 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1788853" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0226-01">505 Pa. 226</a>, 236, <a href="/pa/505/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="505 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1788853" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0226-01">478 A.2d 800</a>, 806 (1984). We are satisfied that the trial court’s award of custody of these children to appellees was and is in their best interest. That conclusion can stand without the necessity of considering the charge of incest levied from beyond the grave by the children’s late mother against her father. This other evidence supports the hearing court’s finding that the Steeles’ unstructured family arrangement and permissive attitudes would work a severe disservice to the children wheréas the Gatzes’ more structured environment would create an atmosphere conducive to healthy development. Common Pleas slip op. <em>supra </em>at 10. The Steeles are both diabetic and overweight and would be less likely than the Gatzes to address and correct Heidi’s weight problem. <em>Id. </em>at 11. The Gatzes are more apt to cooperate in facilitating the Steeles’ visitation rights than the Steeles would cooperate with the Gatzes. <em>Id. </em>at 13. Heidi is in need of remedial instruction with her schoolwork; only the Gatzes have shown an interest by contacting <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>Heidi’s teacher to discuss her problems. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14. Betty Gatz has made a substantial effort to improve the children’s grooming habits. <em>Id. </em>at 15.
