In the interim between Board action and this Court’s pronouncement, death, resignation or, as in this case, defeat in a retention effort might intervene. Thus the question arises whether the issue is mooted by one of these events. If this Court accepts a recommendation of removal, the effective date is obviously as of the date of the decision of this Court. The Board’s power is limited to <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>recommending the sanction it deems appropriate. The final action under Article V, Section 18 is committed to the Court and not the Board for discipline under this Section of our Constitution.

As stated by the majority opinion and conceded by the dissent, the jurisdiction of the Court over the disciplinary processes under Article V, Section 18 is not affected by termination of the judicial service during the course of these proceedings. The issue is therefore a question of whether any purpose is to be served by continuing the proceedings to their conclusion. Where the event terminating the jurist’s service is death, there is arguably no purpose served by an ultimate finding by this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> However, where the termination results either from the completion of the term of office, an unsuccessful bid for retention, or a voluntary retirement the question of the former jurist’s right to again seek judicial office in this Commonwealth remains unanswered. See Article V, Section 18(i).

Recognizing the resourcefulness of counsel of this bar, I realize that if we accept that premise it could be cogently argued that from the period Judge Snyder’s conduct came into question all of his decisions could be questioned. This is inevitable, but not catastrophic. In each instance an error must be demonstrated before relief would be warranted and such would be the case in any event.</p>

      <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>The initial problem posed by this case is the fact that because the Respondent is no longer in office as of the date of this decision today, our jurisdiction over these disciplinary proceedings may be susceptible to attack. In order to dispel any confusion over this issue, I wish to underscore at the outset the fact that this Court possesses continuing and plenary jurisdiction which cannot be foreclosed prior to our final decision in a case. Our authority to conduct judicial proceedings and impose punishment, moreover, flows directly from our State Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> It does not depend, as the Majority argues, on the authority of cases from either sister states or other decisions which, in any event, are distinguishable on the facts. There is no need, therefore, to reach beyond our own Constitution to find a basis of continuing jurisdiction. In sum, this tribunal continues to have constitutional jurisdiction inspite of any intervening acts which result in a judge leaving office. Once the discretionary punishment of removal is selected by this Court as appropriate under the facts of a case, of course, perpetual banishment under Article 5, Section 18(e), results automatically by operation of the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[130,1434,1151,314]],["BL_222.1",222,[261,291,1152,308]]]'>Because of these arguments, the Majority decision is badly flawed in two other respects. On the one hand, I presume that it is the intent of the Majority to fix the date of removal from office as some date prior to the natural termination of Respondent’s term, while he was still in office.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> In that case, it is obvious that the Respondent’s <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>judicial decisions taken subsequent to that date of removal may linger under a pall of suspicion regarding their validity. This could easily result in additional damage to judicial integrity through collateral attacks. Of course, we are empowered fully to set any removal date, but the consequences of our choice should not result in foolishness.</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[256,618,1155,840]]]'>On the other hand, the Majority compounds its own problems even further by interpreting Respondent’s retention election loss as a removal from office. The truth, on the contrary, is that following Respondent’s rejection at the polls, he completed his full term, was not <em>removed </em>during his tenure, and is fully eligible to run in the future in a contested election, unless and until this Court imposes the punishment of removal from office. The loss of a retention election cannot be equated with <em>removal </em>from office in any case. Under the Majority’s definition, that would mean that all losers of retention elections could be considered as being <em>removed </em>from office by the electorate, and arguably subject to the same type of sanction. Is this the intent of the Majority’s argument? The electors of Philadelphia County chose not to <em>return </em>Respondent to office; they did not <em>remove </em>Respondent from office.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[252,1476,1155,671]]]'>In place of futile and confusing efforts to find a date of removal in some past act, the Majority opinion would have been more consistent and jurisdictionally accurate had it simply stated that its decision to remove Respondent from office was legally effective as of a date, nunc pro tunc, while Respondent occupied the office. In that fashion, this Court then could decide that its jurisdiction oyer the disciplinary proceeding was continuing and not at an end until the date of the final order <em>regardless </em>of any intervening election, or resignation, or even death. This would have resolved the conundrum of the validity of Respondent’s subsequent decisions and rendered irrelevant the vexatious issue of the retention election loss.</p>

A gap will always exist between the actions of the Board and a final order issued by this Court. Judges will continue to hold office and hand down decisions during this period, and the very problems addressed by this case will be re-created in the future.</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.4",223,[143,732,1152,480]]]'>In the context of the present case, this Court should decide that its final order is the last legal step which divests the judge of authority, even though such order may act in a nunc pro tunc fashion. As for future cases, I strongly recommend the use of our recently adopted administrative solution<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a> in the form of a temporary suspension with pay, imposed by this Court, to take effect on the date we select.
