In October of 1981, appellee filed an additional complaint alleging that the asbestos in question had been manufactured, sold, and supplied by the appellant asbestos companies. In both of these actions, appellee asserted that she reasonably did not know until March of 1981 that exposure to asbestos products caused her husband’s death, and, thus, that the actions should be regarded as having been timely filed under the applicable two-year statute of limitations. The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the actions as being time-barred, however, reasoning that the two-year period commenced to run on the date of death, rather than on the date when appellee determined the cause of that death. On appeal, the Superior Court reinstated the complaints, holding that the so-called “discovery rule” tolled the statute of limitations until such time as appellee knew or reasonably should have known the cause of her husband’s death.</p>

Justice Roberts and Flaherty, with Messrs. Justice Larsen and Kauffman concurring in the result), it is clear that the actions were not filed within the allowable time period. In <em>Anthony, </em>a majority of this Court (five Justices) agreed that the period for bringing wrongful death and survival actions was not to be extended by the discovery rule to permit the bringing of actions beyond the period specified in the statute of limitations. In doing so, a distinction was drawn between application of the discovery rule in actions brought to recover damages for “injuries” sustained versus application of the rule in actions alleging wrongfully caused deaths.

The applicable statute in <em>Anthony </em>provided that the wrongful death action “shall be brought within one year after the death, and not thereafter,” 12 P.S. § 1603, while the statute applicable to the present case provides, “The following actions and proceedings must be commenced within two years: ... (2) An action to recover damages for injuries to the person or for the death of an <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect or unlawful violence or negligence of another,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5524(2). Thus, both statutes required the bringing of wrongful death actions within a specified period after a victim’s death, and neither incorporated any language indicating that the time of discovering the cause of death was of significance to the running of the statutory period. It is argued that a distinction between the statutes is to be found in the fact that the former statute provided for bringing an action within the specified period “and not thereafter,” while the current statute omitted the “and not thereafter” phraseology. Examination of our decision in <em>Anthony, </em>however, reveals that no emphasis was placed upon the “and not thereafter” language in the statute. Rather, as discussed supra, the determinative factor was that, for purposes of statutes requiring the filing of an action within a specified period after “death,” the term “death” must be taken as referring to a “definitely established event” that “leaves no room for construction.” Upon this basis, application of the discovery rule to wrongful death actions was unequivocally rejected in <em>Anthony.</em>

Such a concept of accrual, however, would greatly expand, theoretically to infinity, the time period during which wrongful death actions could be brought, extending the discovery rule in its application far beyond that to which has heretofore been recognized. We do not believe that such was the intent of the legislature in enacting 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5502(a), for while the concept of accrual may have usefulness in delaying the point at <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>which the statute of limitations begins to run with respect to injuries, e.g., <em>Ayers v.

    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[240,681,1159,1124]]]'>As stated in <em>Anthony, </em><a href="/pa/496/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="496 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1772960" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0119-01">supra,</a> “death” is a “definitely established event.” Upon the death of an individual, survivors are put on clear notice thereof, and they have the opportunity to proceed with scientific examinations aimed at determining the exact cause of death so that a wrongful death action, if warranted, can be filed without additional delay. Such examinations, including autopsies, are designed to make a final determination as to the cause of death, and they are not restrained or limited in their scope, as would be examinations of living persons, by the need to avoid intrusive or destructive examination procedures. Because death is not an event that is indefinite as to the time of its occurrence, and because survivors are immediately put on notice that they may proceed to determine the cause of death, there is no basis to regard the cause of action for death as accruing at any time other than at death. In the present case, therefore, where appellee’s wrongful death action was not filed until more than three years after her husband’s death, and the statute required the filing of such an action within two years after the accrual of a cause of action for “death,” the action is clearly legislatively barred.</p>

In <em>Anthony, </em>this Court rejected application of the discovery rule to survival actions, where application of such a rule would work to extend the time for filing such actions beyond the period, measured from death, specified in the statute of limitations. Acknowledging that in actions based upon injuries, rather than deaths, the discovery rule has proper application, the <em>Anthony </em>decision declined to extend <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>the rule in a manner that would have permitted the filing of survival actions beyond the statutory period as measured from death, and, in so doing, rejected the argument that the statute runs from the date the survivors knew, or should have known, the cause of death.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[157,584,1156,1664]]]'>The statute will, of course, begin to run prior to death with respect to injuries that the afflicted individual should reasonably have “discovered” while alive, and, for this reason, it was held in <em>Anthony </em>that the survival statute begins to run, “at the latest,” at death. <a href="/pa/496/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="496 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1772960" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0119-01">496 Pa. at 122-124</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="496 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1772960" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0119-01">436 A.2d at 183-184</a>. The explanation for this lies in the nature of the survival cause of action, for, as stated in <em>Anthony, </em>“the survival statutes do not create a new cause of action; they simply permit a personal representative to enforce a cause of action which has <em>already accrued </em>to the deceased before his death.” <a href="/pa/496/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="496 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1772960" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0119-01">496 Pa. at 125</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="496 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1772960" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0119-01">436 A.2d at 185</a> (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).

Although the statute of limitations applicable to the present case is not identical to the one addressed in <em>Anthony, </em>the differences between the statutes are not such as would indicate a contrary result. The governing statute in <em>Anthony, </em>12 P.S. § 34, provided for bringing survival claims within a fixed period following death, as is the case with the present statute which, as noted supra, provides that actions “to recover damages for injuries to the person or for the death of an individual” must be instituted “within two years,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5524(2). The language of the instant statute stating that the period “within which a matter must be commenced ... shall be computed ... from the time the cause of action accrued” does not alter the analysis, for the “accrual” concept was expressly recognized in <em>Anthony; </em>hence, the statute of limitations was regarded as running, <em>at the latest, </em>from the time of death, unless it had earlier “accrued” through the fact that the victim knew, or should reasonably have known, of his injury.</p>

Only three members of this Court agreed in <em>Anthony </em>that the discovery rule does not prevent the running of the statute of limitations in a wrongful death action brought pursuant to the limitations statute in effect prior to the effective date of the Judiciary Act Repealer Act. To suggest that the two concurrences <em>in the result </em>of that case (mine and that of Justice Kauffman) amount to a concurrence in its holding and rationale, is to misrepresent the precedential value of <em>Anthony </em>on this issue.</p>

I would remind the majority that the plaintiff would carry the same heavy burden of proving the exercise of due diligence in discovering the cause of death where wrongful death and survival actions are commenced more than two years after the date of death as the plaintiff does in a personal injury case. Although death is a “definitely established event,” the cause of death may be just as difficult to ascertain as is <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>the cause of an injury.
