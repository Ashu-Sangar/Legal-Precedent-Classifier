Traditionally, the common law held that each communication of a defamatory statement created a separate cause of action. <em>Duke of Brunswick v. Harmer, </em>14 Q.B. 185, 117 Eng. Rep. 75 (1849). With the development of mass media as it is known today, such a rule became anachronistic because it created the possibility that a single defamatory statement would give rise to millions of causes of action. “From the sheer necessity thus created, and from a recognition that mass communication of a single defamatory communication, for practical purposes, constitutes a single wrong, the courts have developed a theory of a ‘single publication’ as one composite tort which embraces all the acts involved in the printing and distribution of a newspaper or magazine to its millions of readers in many jurisdictions.” 1 Harper and James, The Law of Torts, §5.16 at 394-395.

Recovery in any action shall include all damages for any such tort suffered by the plaintiff in all jurisdictions.” It is the position of appellees that “the single publication rule centers on the principles that a single issue of a magazine or newspaper, although that issue consists of thousands of copies widely distributed, is in legal effect one publication which gives rise to but one cause of action for libel, and that the single cause of action accrues at the time of first publication.” Therefore, their argument is directed to the problem of what day was the day of first publication for purposes of the statute, for it is their contention that it is on that day that the one year period commenced.</p>

It is clear that the statute was designed to offer protection to the defendant from countless suits, an almost endless tolling of the statute of limitations and diversity in applicable substantive law (although the choice of law problems in this area have scarcely been settled). That purpose can be effectuated by holding that the plaintiff may choose any publication as the single publication which represents his single cause of action. This does not mean that he may recover damages for all publications; to hold that would defeat the statute’s purpose to prevent endless tolling of the statute of limitations. He may only recover damages that result from publications occurring within one year (assuming that is the applicable limitations period) of the date he chooses. An example might be helpful. Assume publications of a defamatory article were made in New York beginning on January 1, in Pennsylvania beginning on February 1, and in New Jersey on March 1 (all in year 1). Assume then the plaintiff brought suit in Pennsylvania on February 15 of Year 2. Under appellees’ theory, his whole suit would be barred. (It does not matter which state’s statute of limitations is applied as each is one year. N.J.S.A. 2A:l!-3; N.Y. Civil Practice Act, §51-a). Under our interpretation of the statute, the plaintiff would not be able to recover for any damages suffered in New York as a result of publications there prior to February 15 of Year 1, because the one year period had expired. He would be able to recover for damages suffered as a result of publications in New Jersey because that one year period had not expired. As to damages suffered in Pennsylvania, he would be able to recover for those suffered as a result of publications after February 15 of Year 1 but not those suffered as a result of publications before. The nature of the defama<a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>toiy publication might be helpful in this difficult job of assessing damages. For example, the damage done by an article in a daily newspaper would probably be greatest in the day or two following initial publication, while that done by a book might be constant over a long period or even increase over time if the defamatory matter created constantly increasing public interest and sales.</p>

An unscrupulous publisher might print a defamatory article about a Californian and distribute a few copies in New York; the plaintiff might well feel that the time and expense involved did not warrant the filing of an action; then after the one year period was over (assuming California has a one year period also) the publisher could flood California and the rest of the country with the article and, under appellees’ theory, face no threat of liability.

    <p id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[177,944,1150,974]]]'>It is my view that the first publication of the alleged defamation <em>in the state in which suit is brought </em>should be taken as the single publication and so mark the date from which the statute runs. Such a rule would, I believe, provide the plaintiff with adequate flexibility; the action being transitory, the jurisdiction sued in would be a matter of plaintiff’s choice, reflecting his calculation of the convenience of the forum, the extent of the damages,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> and the substantive law under which the case would be tried. It would also protect a defamed person against the impossibility of recovering damages for an extensive libelous publication which reaches into his hometown, the statutory period for suit having previously run by virtue of a prior publication so limited in scope or so far removed from his domicile that the publication was unknown to the defamed person or would not have justified suit even had it been known.</p>

At the same time, it would preserve the normal nexus between a Pennsylvania cause of action and the Pennsylvania statute of limitations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> From the point of view of judicial administration, moreover, it would seem that such a rule would be easily comprehended and applied; the considerable problems in the area of multi-state defamation litigation underscore the need for such clarity. While I appreciate the careful balancing of interests which the majority opinion attempts, I doubt that the various interests involved in this or any similar case are adequately reconciled by a rule which would allow a plaintiff to choose any single act of publication—no matter how remote in place or in time from the first publication—as the date from which the statute is to run. Neither do I think the cause of relative certainty is advanced by a rule, such as that proposed by Justice Roberts, which focuses on such necessarily vague concepts as the plaintiff’s “stature”, or “community”, or a “major distribution”.</p>

March 14, 1965 having been a Sunday, the filing of this action on March 15, 1965 was within the statute. Accordingly, I concur in the decision of the Court.</p>

In such a case, the Pennsylvania courts, applying the normal principles of conflict of laws, would have to look to the law of the place where the publication declared upon occurred to determine if it is a “single publication” state, either by common law or statute, and then apply the law of that jurisdiction as to whether the asserted cause of action is based on the correct publication. The statute of limitations to be applied in such a case would be that of the forum state, viz., Pennsylvania, subject of course to the possible application of the Pennsylvania “borrowing” statute, Act of June 26, 1895, P. <em>L. </em>375, §1, 12 P.S.</p>
