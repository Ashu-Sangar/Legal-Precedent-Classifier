It purchased from Indemnity Insurance Company of North America, the <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>defendant-appellant, an aircraft policy which contained a “Hangar Keeper’s Liability Endorsement”. This appeal concerns a dispute between the two parties as to whether a loss sustained by appellee was or was not within the coverage afforded to appellee by the policy. The background facts, viewed most favorably to the appellee, the verdict winner below, are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b575-3" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[176,705,1151,1081]]]'>Larry Herron, Inc., of Williamsport owned a twin-engine airplane which it stored at Penn-Air’s hangar. On May 5, 1960 Penn-Air had possession of the plane for the purpose of giving it a one hundred hour inspection, which was to include a flight check on the following day by Mr. Taylor, Penn-Air’s president, who with his wife is owner of its capital stock. Following the check-up but before the flight check, one William Angle, who was an employee of Herron and the plane’s pilot, and one Richard Littley, an employee of Penn-Air and its chief mechanic, took the plane up. In so doing, Angle was acting outside the scope of his employment and Littley was likewise acting outside the scope of his employment and without authority from Mr. Taylor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After climbing to about 500 feet the plane suddenly lost altitude and crashed after having traveled about a mile and a half. The aircraft was burned and totally destroyed, and both Angle and Littley were killed instantly. Which of the two men was piloting the plane was never determined.</p>

Following trial, the jury in that case returned a verdict in Herron’s favor in the amount of $22,800. Penn-Air paid the judgment, with interest, and thereafter brought this suit for reimbursement claiming that the loss was covered by the insurance policy. The jury in the case at bar found for Penn-Air. The lower court overruled appellant’s post trial motions, and this appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Indemnity’s answer denied coverage and asserted that the insured had not complied with the provisions of the policy as to timely notice of claim, proof of loss, and commencement of suit.</p>

The text of the insuring agreement relative to this coverage is as follows: “Indemnity Insurance Company of North America . . . Agrees with the insured ... to afford those of the following coverages as specified in the declarations: Coverage B—All Bisks of Physical Damage While Not in Flight and Fire, Explosion and Lightning in Flight Except Following Crash. To Pay For: (1) Any loss of or damage to the aircraft while not in flight.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (2) Loss of or dam<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>age to the aircraft while in flight<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> caused by fire, explosion, lightning, theft, robbery or pilferage, excluding fire or explosion caused by or resulting from collision of the aircraft with the ground, water or any object; including the cost of Salvaging the aircraft following a forced landing caused by fire, lightning or explosion while in flight. . <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Hangar Keeper’s Liability Endorsement extended the coverage to “liability imposed by law upon the insured as bailee for direct loss or damage as hereinafter specified to aircraft which are the property of others and in the custody of the insured for storage, repairs or safekeeping . . . only while the said aircraft are in or on the premises specified below.” (City Hangar, Williamsport Airport, Williamsport, Pennsylvania.)</p>

The physical damage which occurred followed the taking of the plane, in direct unbroken sequence. . . . The risk insured was the ‘loss of or damage to’ the plane while it was in plaintiff’s possession. . . . [T]he destruction of the plane as a consequence of an incident in flight operated to establish the extent of the damages, nothing more.” The court thus found coverage under clause B(l), <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>
      <em>supra, </em>of the policy, insuring against loss to the aircraft “while not in flight”.</p>

What is insured against in clause (1) is “loss of or damage to the aircraft while not in flight” (not only, as the court below indicated, while the aircraft was in the appellee’s possession). It is indisputable that the actual physical destruction of the plane occurred when it fell from the air, crashed to the ground and burned. Was this destruction the loss insured against, or was the unauthorized taking the loss insured against? The lower court held the latter and concluded that since the taking occurred on the ground, clause (1) provided coverage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We think this is a strained construction and not consonant with the language of the policy. It seems clear that loss or damage is one thing, and the cause of it another. Thus clause (1) insures against <em>any </em>loss or damage, however caused, while not in flight. Clause (2), on the other hand, insures against loss or damage while in flight if it is “caused” by certain specified things, including fire, lightning, and theft. The loss or damage is not the same as the fire or the lightning or the theft which causes it; it is the resultant total or partial destruction of the aircraft. This distinction is evident in other parts of the policy. Thus under Exclusions, “loss or damage due to strikes, riots or civil commotion” is not covered, nor is any loss or damage “caused by or resulting from . . . hostile or warlike action ... or insurrection . . .” Another provision states that the policy does not apply with respect to coverages A, B and C “to loss due to conversion, embezzlement or secretion by any person in lawful possession of the aircraft under a lease, conditional sale, mortgage or <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>other encumbrance.” It is evident that the physical harm to the aircraft is what is covered, and this is nowhere equated with the act or condition giving rise to or occasioning the harm. This construction is further supported by reference to provisions in the Conditions section of the policy. For example, “The company’s liability for loss of or damage to the aircraft shall not exceed the actual cash value thereof at the time any loss or damage occurs.” Again, the insurer is given the option to “pay for the loss in money or may repair or replace the aircraft or any lost or damaged part thereof, or may return any lost or stolen property and pay for any resultant damage thereto, if such property be found before the loss is otherwise settled with the insured.”</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[181,1153,1152,866]]]'>It is of course true that an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured so as to effect the dominant purpose of indemnity or payment to the insured, but this is where the terms of the policy are ambiguous or uncertain and the intention of the parties is therefore unclear. See e.g., <em>Cadwallader v.

On appeal, however, Penn-Air argues, alternatively to its clause (1) position, that if the loss did not consist of a conversion of the plane while not in flight, it did consist of a theft while in flight, or at least that the in flight theft caused the loss.</p>

In all of these cases there was loss or damage following unauthorized taking; in all of them it was recognized that whether or not such taking was a theft depended on the plaintiff showing by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a felonious intent, “an intent to steal”. In <em>Slomowitz </em>the insured’s car was taken for an unauthorized ride by a discharged chauffeur of the insured, wrecked and abandoned; the jury found in favor of the insured, the Superior Court found no error, and affirmed. In <em>Seither </em>the jury found in favor of the insured, the Superior Court found no evi<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>dence of felonious intent, held that it was error to have submitted the case to the jury, and reversed.

When the Work was finished the mechanic took the car, with his family in it, for a ride, and collided with a pole, causing serious personal injuries and extensive damage to the car. There was some evidence that the mechanic had been drinking at the time. In the opinion of the court, by Teexlee, P. J., it was said at p. 264: “We have not gone so far in Pennsylvania that any unlawful taking is covered by the word ‘theft.’ . . . There must be some fact about the transaction from which it may be found that the matter was done animo furandi. We fail to find one. The sum and substance of the evidence presented by the plaintiff is that Wachter without right took the car to afford his relatives the pleasure of a ride. If there were the least evidence that the purpose was to flee with the car, or to dispose of it, or any act inconsistent with the intention to return it to the garage after, the ride was completed, there might be something for the jury to consider, but as the case was presented, we find nothing that should have been submitted to them for their decision.”</p>

Upon discovering that the car was missing and that his son also was <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>missing, the father had called the police because he “wanted to find out before he [the son] got into any trouble to get the truck back if I could.” The son did not appear as a witness at trial. The court recognized that to constitute theft “There must be a criminal intent permanently to deprive an owner of his property”, but felt that these facts were sufficiently different from those of <em>Seither </em>to permit the case to go to the jury.</p>

I cannot agree, and I would affirm the verdict of the jury and the conclusions of the trial judge. The insurance policy covered “any loss of or damage to the aircraft while not in flight,” and I fail to see how the unauthorized taking involved in this case was anything other than a “loss of” the aircraft while not in flight.</p>
