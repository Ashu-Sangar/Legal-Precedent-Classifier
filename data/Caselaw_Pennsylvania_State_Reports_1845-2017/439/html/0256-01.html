Spano, appellee, as a professional employee.</p>
    <p id="b320-10" data-blocks='[["BL_320.15",320,[191,1447,1157,866]]]'>On July 11, 1966 the Superintendent of the Brent-wood School District interviewed appellee for the position of Curriculum Coordinator which was then vacant. She was offered the job, and a contract was signed which became effective August 1, 1966. Soon thereafter difficulties arose, and relations between Miss Spano and others in the school system became strained. On November 7, 1966 she was asked to resign, and on April 20, 1967 she was suspended by the Superintendent. By a resolution of the School Board adopted September 12,1967 charges of incompetency and persistent and willful violation of the School Laws of Pennsylvania were brought against appellee as a basis for her dismissal. Hearings on the dismissal began on September 26,1967 and continued until April 16,1968 at which time she was discharged.</p>

      <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>Miss Spano then took a timely appeal to the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to the Act of March 10, 1949 (Public School Code of 1949), P.L. 30, art. XI, §1131, 24 P.S. §11-1131. By opinion and order dated October 11, 1968, the Superintendent found that appellee was a professional employee within the meaning of the Public School Code, dismissed the incompetency charges and sustained the action of the School Board in dismissing appellee for persistently and willfully violating the School Laws of Pennsylvania. Both sides then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County pursuant to §1132 of the Public School Code, supra, 24 P.S. §11-1132. The lower court dismissed appellant’s argument that the Superintendent had erred in finding appellee to be a professional employee and in dismissing the incompetency charges. At the same time it agreed with appellee that she had not been given a fair hearing by the School Board, and it ordered the School Board to retain her as a professional employee.</p>
    <p id="b321-3" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[184,1401,1151,754]]]'>The first question we must answer is whether Miss Spano is a professional employee within the meaning of the Public School Code because if she is not she had no standing under §1131 and 1132 of that Code to appeal to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Court of Common Pleas. Appellant argues that appellee is not a professional employee because the position of Curriculum Co-ordinator is a nonmandated position which is not encompassed by the definition of professional employee in §1101(1), 24 P.S. §11-1101(1), and that appellee abandoned whatever contractual relationship she had with appellant by not presenting her teaching certificate to the Superintendent before beginning work.</p>

The section states “[t]he term ‘professional employee’ shall include those who are certificated as teachers, supervisors, supervising principals, principals . . .” and appellant argues that as the words Curriculum Co-ordinator do not specifically appear Miss Spano can not be a professional employee. Appellant recognizes, however, that appellee has been certified as a teacher, and §1141 states “ ‘Teacher’ shall include all professional employees . . . who devote fifty per centum (50%) of their time, or more, to teaching or other direct educational activities . . .” Construing sections 1101 and 1141 together, an individual is a teacher for purposes of §1141 if he holds the necessary certificate and devotes at least half his time to teaching or direct educational activities, and he is a professional employee under §1101 if he is a teacher under §1141. There is no question that Miss Spano held a teaching certificate, and the court below found that her areas of responsibility included curriculum development, evening classes for adults and the teachers’ in-service program which consisted, among other things, of teacher seminars for the improvement of teaching methods. It concluded that she devoted practically all her time to educational activities and there is ample support in the record for that conclusion. Certainly what she was doing qualified as “direct educational activities”, and thus she is a teacher under sections 1141 and 1101 and a professional employee entitled to appeal to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

Darby School District, </em><a href="/pa/388/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="388 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1272527" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0301-01">388 Pa. 301</a>, 309-10, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20661" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="130 A.2d 661">130 A. 2d 661</a> (1957), we stated, “[a]n examination of these decisions indicates that the criterion for determining whether a position or office is or is not ‘mandated’ depends upon whether or not the title of the incumbent to the position or office is specifically covered by the phrase ‘professional employees’ in the statute.” In the contract between appellant and appellee, the title given her position was the phrase professional employee itself. Both the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the court below were correct in concluding that they had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>

In this appeal both parties feel that the central issue is whether or not Miss Spano was given a fair hearing by the School Board. It is true that when an appeal is not accompanied by a de novo hearing the court of common pleas should examine the record to see if there was a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law on the part of the Superintendent. <em>Pease v.

By providing in §1132(b) for a de novo hearing by request in the court of common pleas as part of the appeal from the decision of the Superintendent, the legislature has given the employee the opportunity for a hearing in a forum free of any bias. Thus, if the employee-appellant desires, he can have his case retried in a forum in which the School Board plays only the role of prosecutor and not that of judge also. If the employee’s claim, however, is that he was denied a fair hearing before the School Board and he does not request a hearing de novo before the court, that failure forecloses him from raising the issue thereafter. That is so because bias may to some degree exist in every hearing before a school board, while the jury and prosecutor are one and an employee can not be heard to complain of that alleged bias when he has ignored or rejected the procedure provided by the legislature to eliminate that taint. The opportunity for a de novo hearing before the court must be taken as the exclusive remedy when an employee contends that the board’s bias and prejudice has deprived him of a fair hearing.</p>

    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[202,376,1154,425]]]'>I agree with the majority insofar as it holds that the appellee was a professional employee of appellant school district and that the trial court and the Superintendent of Public Instruction had jurisdiction in this case.

    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.7",326,[200,812,1156,1520]]]'>I am unable to understand how, as a matter of justice, the majority can conclude that a professional employee’s right to a hearing de novo strips that employee of any right to challenge the fundamental unfairness of the procedures conducted by the School Board. The Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. §1-101 et seq. (Supp. 1970), clearly requires that dismissal proceedings be conducted in accordance with certain minimum due process standards. <em>See </em>Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. §§11-1125-11-1132 (Supp. 1970). I assume that the Legislature did not intend to engage in a useless act and earnestly desired that the prescribed minimum standards be observed. It is well established, however, that when an appealing professional employee requests a hearing de novo he may not also challenge the regularity of the proceedings conducted by the School Board. E.g., <em>Ambridge Borough School District v. Snyder, </em><a href="/pa/346/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="346 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="1216452" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0103-01">346 Pa. 103</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%2034" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="29 A.2d 34">29 A. 2d 34</a> (1943). And the majority, by denying aggrieved professional employees who do not request a de novo hearing the right to contest the propriety of the hearing conducted by the School Board, strips the professional employees of any ability to enforce their legislatively-given due process rights. The majority forces professional employees to accept whatever kind of a “hearing” the School Board chooses to give them, and to rely on de novo proceedings in the common pleas courts for a fair hearing.</p>

I strongly believe that one of the central principles of a democratic government is that it must provide impartial adjudication when the state and one of its citizens are opposing litigants. I do not think it is too much to ask of a public agency like a school board that it restrain its prosecutorial zeal and provide at least a modicum of procedural fairness to every citizen who appears before it. I hardly believe that the majority’s permissive decision will advance the cause of ordered liberty.</p>

    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[130,1339,1154,700]]]'>The second case is <em>Thall Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/410/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="410 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1884621" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0222-01">410 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=189%20A.2d%20249" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="189 A.2d 249">189 A. 2d 249</a> (1963), wherein this Court asserted that where an appeal is prosecuted by a school board from an adverse decision of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the court of common pleas should look to see only if there was a manifest abuse of discretion or error of law. In support of this conclusion the Court did nothing more than to cite <em>Tassone </em>and assert that the Superintendent’s “expertise” justified the imposition of a narrow standard of review. The language of 24 P.S. §11-1132 was neither cited nor discussed and the holding was explicitly applied <em>only </em>to appeals prosecuted by a school board.</p>
    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.7",329,[133,2050,1149,310]]]'>The third relevant case, <em>Pease v. Millcreek Township School District, </em><a href="/pa/412/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="412 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="1887199,1887206" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0378-01,/pa/412/0378-02">412 Pa. 378</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.2d%20104" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="195 A.2d 104">195 A. 2d 104</a> (1963), again involving an appeal by a school board, did no more than cite <em>Tassone </em>and <em>Thall </em>without discussion before affirming the Superintendent’s determination in an exhaustive factual discussion.</p>

      <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>Although some of the language in these cases superficially indicates that a narrow standard of review is appropriate in an appeal by an aggrieved professional employee from an adverse decision of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, I believe that a careful reading of the cases demonstrates that neither their holdings nor their logic, supports such a result. When the question of the proper standard of review is confronted in the context of an appeal by a professional employee, it seems evident to me that the common pleas courts were intended to have and should have a broad scope of review in order to fulfill their legislative mandate to “make whatever order it considers just.” Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
