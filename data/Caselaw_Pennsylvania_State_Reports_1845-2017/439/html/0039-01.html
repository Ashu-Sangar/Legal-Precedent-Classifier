On that date, while in the <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>front office of the penitentiary, Girnus was taken into custody by the sheriff of Union County as a fugitive from justice in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In accordance with the provisions of Section 10 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, 19 P.S. §191.10, Girnus then filed an application for ha.beas corpus challenging the legality of his arrest. A hearing was held, following which relief was denied, and an order granting extradition issued. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[143,832,1151,307]]]'>Girnus first contends that since he was arrested within the confines of a federal penitentiary, he was not “found” within the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania as that term is intended in Section 2 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This novel position lacks legal merit.</p>
    <p id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.6",103,[139,1161,1152,373]]]'>At the relevant time Girnus was physically present in Pennsylvania and subject to its laws. Under the Act of the Pennsylvnia General Assembly of March 26, 1931, P. L. 7, §3, 61 P.S. §355, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania retained jurisdiction to serve criminal process upon him even while he was on the premises of the penitentiary.</p>

    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[250,670,1155,209]]]'>It is argued that the “cause” arose within the penitentiary itself (i.e., at the time of the arrest by the sheriff of Union County) and not “without the area” as required by the act. This is erroneous.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.6",104,[249,890,1155,373]]]'>Girnus was arrested as a fugitive from justice because of information received by the sheriff of Union County that he had been convicted of several serious crimes in Virginia and was under sentence of imprisonment in that jurisdiction. The “cause” referred to in the Act of 1931, supra, clearly arose in Virginia and not in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.7",104,[248,1273,1154,153]]]'>Girnus next contends that the extradition papers were “not sufficient” to warrant the lower court’s order of extradition. With this we agree.</p>

While counsel for Girnus offered no objection to the admission of the duplicate copies of these records into evidence, he did specifically question the legal sufficiency thereof, since any authentication was lacking.</p>
