Rizzuto, collided with a motor bike, operated by George L. Clevenstein, at the intersection of Haws Avenue and West Lafayette Street in the City of Norristown. Clevenstein was seriously injured in the accident, and he sued Rizzuto for damages. His complaint alleged, inter alia, that Rizzuto drove his automobile into the intersection from West Lafayette Street, which is controlled by a stop sign, without maintaining “a reasonable lookout” for the presence of other vehicles coming into the inter<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>section from Haws Avenue, a through street, and this negligence caused the collision.</p>

He alleged that an automobile owned by Williams was so “carelessly and negligently” parked on Haws Avenue “immediately north of the intersection” as to obstruct Rizzuto’s view at the intersection; that as a result, Rizzuto was forced to proceed into the intersection to ascertain if any traffic were approaching; that the Williams automobile was parked in violation of the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code of Pennsylvania; and, that the parking of the automobile in such a location was the “sole” cause of the collision between the Clevenstein and Rizzuto vehicles.</p>

It seems clear to us that the purpose of this statute was to protect against the particular hazard alleged in this case, namely, the hazard of obstruction to visibility at intersections, or more specifically, a driver’s lack of lateral visibility in approaching an intersection and the attendant danger of vehicle collisions. Likewise, it seems clear to us that Clevenstein and Rizzuto are members of the class which the statute was intended to protect. See Prosser, Torts §35 (3rd ed. 1964), and Annot., 4 ALRSrd 324 (1965) and cases cited. Hence, it cannot be ruled as a matter of law that Williams was not negligent.</p>

Generally, this question is for the fact-finding tribunal <em>(Bleman v.

However, at this point in the instant case, we are not persuaded that the remoteness of the causal connection is so clear as to permit it to be determined as a matter of law.</p>
    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[202,859,1158,1247]]]'>If Rizzuto were negligent and this negligence were a proximate cause of Clevenstein’s injury, this would not automatically make his conduct a superseding cause, thus relieving Williams of liability. <em>Skoda v.

Rizzuto’s negligence (assuming his conduct did amount to that) may not be declared to be such an intervening cause (1) if at the time of Williams’ negligent conduct, Williams should have realized that a motorist, such as Rizzuto, might act as he did at the intersection; or, (2) if Rizzuto’s conduct was a normal consequence of a situation created by Williams and was not done in such a manner as to amount to extraordinary negligence. See Restatement (Second), Torts §447 (1965); <em>Skoda v. W. Penn Power Co., </em>supra; <em>Kline v. Moyer &amp; Albert, </em><a href="/pa/325/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="325 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1172294" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0357-01">325 Pa. 357</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.%2043" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="191 A. 43">191 A. 43</a> (1937). The issue of whether negligent conduct constitutes such a superseding cause as to absolve another negligent person from liability is difficult in the ordinary case, and the question is made more difficult herein because of the failure of the complaint to be more specific. But, we cannot conclude under the facts presently before us that “the law says with certainty that no recovery is permitted.”</p>

    <p id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[162,394,1151,864]]]'>The lower court’s action herein was based on our decision in <em>Cotter v.

And this is understandable. In <em>Cotter, </em>the plaintiff was injured when his bicycle was struck by an automobile at a street intersection. An action for damages was instituted against the driver of the automobile and he, in turn, attempted to join as an additional defendant the owner of a property at the intersection who allegedly permitted a hedge on his property and adjacent to the street, to grow and remain in such a condition that it obstructed visibility of traffic at the intersection. Therein the lower court sustained a demurrer to the third party complaint and we affirmed. We ruled that the property owner’s conduct, even if negligent, was merely a passive circumstance of the accident and hence, not the proximate cause thereof.</p>

      <em>Cotter </em>might possibly be distinguished from the instant case on the ground that therein a hedge was involved, i.e., a static or rather permanent condition, as opposed to a parked but movable object; or that the object obstructing the visibility was located off the highway. We prefer to be more intellectually honest than to rely on such tenuous distinctions. Better should we say, “Wisdom should never be rejected merely because it comes late.”</p>
