Twenty-eight institutions performing health-related services then challenged the ordinance in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, as set forth in The Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, §6, 53 P.S. §6906 (Supp. 1970). In an effort to expedite the proceedings the parties agreed to select Allegheny General Hospital, Shadyside Hospital and the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania to proceed to hearing. The court, after hearing testimony and argument, held that the ordinance was invalid and unenforceable as against the three petitioners and all other institutions of purely public charity. The City has appealed and we affirm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

(v) Institutions of purely public charity . . .” The Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853, art. II, §204, as amended, 72 P.S. §5020-204, provides: “The following property shall be exempt from all . . . city . . . tax, to wit: ...

We there held that when property is found to be “public property used for public purposes” the Act of 1933 exempts it from all taxes, regardless of their labels: “Neither the constitution, nor the statute, say the exemption will be only for property taxes; the statute, in fact, expressly says ‘all tax’. The word ‘property’ is used merely to describe the locus of what the Legislature was exempting, not the type of tax it was exempting it from. There is no reason to assume that the Legislature did not fully exercise its constitutional power to exempt this property, not only from property taxes, but also from taxes on activities conducted on the property.” <em>Moon Township, </em><a href="/pa/436/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="436 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1926018" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0054-01">436 Pa. at 56</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=258%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="258 A.2d 630">258 A. 2d at 632</a>.</p>

Nevertheless, the City argues that the Legislature has given it the power to tax institutions of purely public charity by virtue of The Local Tax Enabling Act, supra, 53 P.S. §§6902, 6903 (Supp. 1970), which provides: “[CJities of the second class . . . may, in their discretion, . . . levy, assess and collect . . . such taxes as they shall determine on persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property within the limits of such political subdivisions. . . .” “. . .

We cannot agree. The policy of exempting charities from taxation is an old one in this Commonwealth. If the Legislature had intended to now allow many governmental units<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> to tax charities, we believe that it would have acted in a more direct fashion and explicitly repealed all or part of the Act of 1933. Indeed, we have long held that broad taxing statutes do not cover charities unless the Legislature specifically so states.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus we might simply repeat what this Court stated in 1891 in response to an almost identical argument over the power to tax charitable institutions: “When the legislature of Pennsylvania, turning its back upon all the previous history of the state, shall deliberately resolve to recruit the finances of the commonwealth by a raid upon the treasuries of all the charities within its limits<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>, by seizing money which has been devoted ... to the relief of the distressed, they will doubtless do it at any rate in an open and manly way, and not by the use of doubtful phrases or ambiguous and concealed meanings.” <em>General As</em>

Section 2 states: “Cities of the <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>second class . . . may, in their discretion, . . . levy, assess and collect . . . such taxes as they shall determine on persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property within the limits of such political subdivisions. . . .” Section 3 states: “. . .

Section 23 of The Local Tax Enabling Act states, “All other acts and parts of acts are repealed insofar as they are inconsistent herewith.” There is no question that the broad grant of taxing power contained in that act is inconsistent with the limitation contained in The General County Assessment Law, and I see no reason why a specific repealer is necessary when the legislature in section 3 has made its intention clear. Also, section 91 of the Statutory Construction Act, Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, art. VII, 46 P.S. §591, states, “Whenever a law purports to be a revision of all laws upon a particular subject, or sets up a general or exclusive system covering the entire subject matter of a former law and is intended as a substitute for such former law, such law shall be construed to repeal <em>all former laws upon the same subject.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). <em>Werner v.
