From the trial testimony of a disinterested eyewitness, the jury could find that Toney shot Lionel Chandler, who was unarmed, on a public street in Philadelphia without provocation or an iota of necessity. Three bullets entered Chandler’s body; one in the front upper chest, another in the right thigh and the third in the left knee. The bullet entering Chandler’s body through the chest pierced a lung and his heart, resulting in almost instantaneous death.</p>

Assuming that such an instruction was required under the evidence, it is patently clear that the charge, when read in its entirety, was more than adequate in this respect. Appellant’s counsel submitted several points for charge which the trial judge approved and read word for word to the jury.</p>

There are circumstances under which the Idlling of a human being may be excused. One such circumstance is where the killing takes place under a reasonable apprehension that one’s life is in danger and that the killing is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm. That is the defense offered by the defendant in this case. His contention is that he wanted to talk to the decedent, that he knew that the decedent had a reputation for being a violent person, that he further believed that the decedent would be surrounded by his friends of similar reputation. The defendant further states that he was carrying this gun for self-protection. In viewing that statement, it would be proper for you to consider the character and nature of a neighborhood in which the defendant lived.</blockquote>

If the conditions surrounding the slaying were of sufficient quality to both raise and justify the defendant’s belief in the necessity for killing a man in self-defense and if he actually had that thought and acted on it, he would be excused. On the other hand, if he had an uncontrollable fear of great physical injury or death, caused by the surrounding circumstances, but without the presence of all of the ingredients necessary to constitute self-defense, the killing was manslaughter.</blockquote>
