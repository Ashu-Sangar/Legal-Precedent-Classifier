Extradition proceedings had been originally initiated against appellant by Ohio some two years earlier. Appellant had pleaded guilty to charges of indecent exposure in a Lorain County, Ohio, Court on March 23, 1966. He had been released on his own recognizance and was awaiting sentencing when he left the State of Ohio. On May 5,1967, the Governor of Ohio requested the Governor of Pennsylvania to deliver DeVault to the appointed Ohio authorities. On May 9,1967, a Governor’s warrant was issued by the Governor of Pennsylvania pursuant to Section 2 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Act of July 8, 1941, P. L. 288, Section 2, 19 P.S. §191.2.</p>

Shortly after leaving Ohio in 1966, he was arrested in Fayette County on charges <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>of burglary, larceny and related offenses. He was convicted of those charges on September 8, 1967, in Fayette County, and on November 9, 1967, he was sentenced to a term of from 11% to 23 months in the Fayette County jail. It was at the expiration of this sentence that he was arrested in Pennsylvania as a fugitive from Ohio.</p>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[238,717,1157,812]]]'>DeVault was released on bail pending extradition. The Public Defender of Fayette County petitioned the Court for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the extradition, pursuant to Section 10 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Act of July 8, 1911, P. L. 288, Section 10, 19 P.S. §191.10. The writ was issued on June 20, 1969, and a hearing on the writ was held by the Fayette County Court on June 30, 1969. After the hearing, the Court dismissed the writ by an Order dated July 9, 1969. That Court held that DeVault was a fugitive from justice in the State of Ohio and ordered that he be delivered to the Ohio authorities and be returned to that State to face the Ohio charges against him. From that Order, DeVault brings this appeal.</p>

The crime was allegedly committed upon a 15-year-old inmate in the Lorain County Prison, where DeVault was serving a six-month sentence for assault and battery. Appellant’s original plea of not guilty to the sodomy charge was later withdrawn and a plea of guilty entered to the lesser included offense of “indecent exposure; solicitation of an act of sex perversion.” The case was referred to the Probation Department of Lorain County for pre-sentence investigation and DeVault was released <em>on his own recognisance </em>with a bond of $500.</p>

At this time, the Judge deferred sentencing and ordered appellant committed to the Lima State Hospital for 60 days for psychiatric evaluation. DeVault’s personal recognizance was continued and he was ordered to report to the Lorain County Sheriff’s Office on October 31, 1966, at 9:00 o’clock A.M., to be conveyed to the State Hospital. Appellant did not appear at the appointed time and left the State of Ohio without ever again appearing before any Ohio authority.</p>

He contends that under such a release be was not compelled to appear anywhere and consequently be was not a fugitive from justice and Ohio’s only remedy was to bold him in contempt of Court for not reporting to the hospital for tbe above-mentioned psychiatric examination. He admits that bad be been <em>released on bail </em>be would be a fugitive and would have no grounds for objection to tbe Obio extradition proceedings. There is no need to discuss tbe differences, if any, between a release on bail and a release on tbe defendant’s own recognizance, or tbe legal effect of tbe Court’s Order commanding appellant to appear at tbe Sheriff’s Office for transportation to tbe Lima State Hospital. It will suffice to say that be was and is a fugitive from justice and be is properly subject to extradition.</p>
