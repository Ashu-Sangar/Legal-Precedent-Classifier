    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.9",375,[141,660,1151,377]]]'>Dorothy Sellers, plaintiff’s thirteen year old daughter, was struck and killed by an automobile on the evening of April 4, 1967. After plaintiff’s survival and trespass actions resulted in verdicts for the defendant, and after his motion for a new trial was denied, a judgment was entered on the verdict, and he took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.10",375,[141,1048,1150,588]]]'>The only issue is whether the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to charge the jury that the standard for judging the decedent’s negligence was the degree to which her conduct comported with that which could be reasonably expected of a child of like age, intelligence, and experience. See <em>Kuhns v. Brugger, </em><a href="/pa/390/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="390 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1275666" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0331-01">390 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="135 A.2d 395">135 A. 2d 395</a> (1957). It is true that no such instruction was given, but it is also true that the plaintiff neither requested such an instruction nor objected to its omission. Thus plaintiff cannot now raise this issue.</p>

We disagree. The two propositions are in no way connected, and we fail to see how the plaintiff’s objection to the one point, which was properly refused, see <em>Patterson v. Palley Manufacturing Company, </em><a href="/pa/360/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="360 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="475010" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0259-01">360 Pa. 259</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20861" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="61 A.2d 861">61 A. 2d 861</a> (1948), brought the second asserted error to the attention of the trial court, thereby <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>fulfilling the purpose behind the requirement of timely objection.
