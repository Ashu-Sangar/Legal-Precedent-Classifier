The petition asserts, inter alia, that petitioner has been denied Ms rights under the Eighth Amendment, the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The assertion is grounded on the proposition that Ms constitutional right to nonexcessive bail has been denied because the Constitution must be read “to prohibit bail in excess of what petitioner can afford.” It is also claimed that Ms bail was set “without consideration of individual circumstances pertinent to the probability of his appearance at trial.” The petition states that the issues presented are of vital importance throughout the Commonwealth and should be resolved by this Court. It alleges that this can be accomplished only through the exercise of original jurisdiction, because petitioner’s claim of unconstitutional pretrial detention “will . . . likely become moot before it can fairly be considered by tMs Court if he is compelled to follow the time-consuming appellate route through the Superior Court to tMs Court.” He points out, in support of tMs statement, that this is what occurred in <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

There is not here the “imperative necessity or apparent reason why expedition is desirable or required,” that this Court normally requires in a habeas corpus proceeding in order to dispense with the benefit of full and adequate consideration by a lower court. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The Standards of the American Bar Association Relating to Pretrial Release, Approved Draft, 1968, are an excellent contribution to the thinking on this subject, and deserve the careful study of all those who wish to see improvement in this field. It well may be that they, together with other recent studies particularly pertinent to Pennsylvania, should form the basis of a revision and expansion of our bail rules. (Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure 4001-4016, adopted November 22,1965, effective June 1, 1966, 419 Pa. lxii.) Approached in this fashion, the subject in all its aspects and with regard to all sections of the Commonwealth would be considered first by the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee, drawing upon such resources and assistance as they might see fit. Their recommendations would then come to this Court. This approach to a complex and pervasive socio-legal problem appears to us much sounder than an ad hoc approach of taking original jurisdiction in a particular case.</p>

The bail hearing in the instant ease established only that petitioner had no prior criminal record and that “according to our [defendant’s representative’s] information he can afford very little bail.” In contrast, Rule 4005(a) of our Rules of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: “The amount of bail shall be such as to ensure the presence of the defendant, and shall be determined according to, but not solely upon, the following criteria: (1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the stage of the prosecution then existing; (2) The age, residence, employment, financial standing and family status of the defendant; (3) Defendant’s character, reputation and previous criminal history; and (4) Defendant’s mental condition.”</p>

Court has today declined the opportunity to consider one of the most urgent problems currently facing our criminal law system. The majority offers by way of explanation the observation that it cannot find on this record the “imperative necessity or apparent reason why expedition is desirable or required”, and the stated hope that the Criminal Procedural Buies Committee can better perform the task the majority has today abjured.

Indeed, given the normal time lag in our appellate procedures, it is difficult to imagine how this question will ever come before us in the “normal” fashion.

Literally thousands of indigents, many of them innocent of any wrongdoing, are today languishing behind bars because they cannot afford their money bail. Every day these thousands must undergo a confinement which has been imposed upon them without any determination of their guilt or innocence and without any finding that jailing them is the only method of assuring their future presence in the courtroom. The assertion that “expedition is not desirable or required” is beyond my comprehension; these numbers represent human beings, men who will continue to suffer the rigors of an arbitrary imprisonment because a majority of this Court today refuses to confront this vexing issue. I have every hope that this practice of wholesale indiscriminate pretrial imprisonment will one day cease to exist, but that hope is of little comfort to those who this day remain in our prisons because they cannot purchase their release pending a judicial determination of their guilt or innocence.</p>

It seems apparent to me that it is for this Court to determine the substantive content of the right to bail.

In the least any system of “preventive detention” would require full scale adversary hearings to be even arguably constitutional. This would add a heavy, unwise and unnecessary burden to our already crowded criminal court docket, and would seriously impair the ability of our criminal courts to achieve the proper solution to the problem— a swift and speedy trial. Why should we interpose these preliminary procedures, with their extensive and costly pretrial hearings, and thereby divert substantial judicial, prosecutorial and defense manpower from the prompt disposition of criminal cases? Further, I do not see how even these pretrial adversary hearings can accomplish their goal, which is the differentiation between those accuseds who are likely to commit further crimes, and those who are not.

Freed and Wald, <em>Bail in the United States: 1964, A Report to the Rational Conference on Bail and Criminal Justice, </em>29, 62 (1964). The success of the various bail projects in achieving low “skip rates” indicates largely that the lack of adequate notice is the single most common cause of failure to appear.</p>
