According to his statement given to the police and corroborated by a witness, he spent the evening of October 21, 1964, in Waynesboro, drinking beer and watching television in two local taverns. The distrust of his wife’s fidelity which had caused their separation apparently continued to bother him. Later that night he decided to drive back to the Ewing home to see if Mrs. Ewing was entertaining another man there. He drove by the darkened house, parked his car some distance away and walked across a field and up to the house. Unable to sneak into the unlighted house, appellant broke in through a locked <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>screen-door. Hearing this, appellant’s wife ran from the house to the home of the next-door neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Schultz.</p>
    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[237,513,1156,375]]]'>Appellant then went to his -wife’s bedroom to see if anyone had been there with her. He saw no one else in the bedroom, but in a closet which had been left open he saw the .308 Enfield rifle his wife had given him for his birthday some four years before. He took the rifle from the closet, loaded three shells into it and left the house, heading for the Schultz house.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.6",156,[232,898,1160,1032]]]'>By this time, Mrs. Ewing had awakened Mr. and Mrs. Schultz, who let her into their home. Mrs. Ewing told them that her husband was after her and that she was afraid he might kill her. Mr. Schultz called the State Police on the kitchen phone and then handed the phone to Mrs. Ewing when the police answered. Appellant meanwhile had crossed the yard between his home and the Schultz’s. He saw the light in the kitchen where Mrs. Ewing was using the phone, but the kitchen window was too high for him to see through. He stepped back across the lawn to a point where he could see his wife’s head above the windowsill. Appellant then raised his hunting rifle to his shoulder and, when he could see his wife’s head outlined in the scope, fired a single shot into her head behind her ear. The entire back of Mrs. Ewing’s head was blown off and her death was undoubtedly instantaneous. Appellant then drove back to Waynesboro as Mr. Schultz calmed his wife and called the police.</p>

Finding him there, they took him first to the Waynesboro Police Department and then to the Gettysburg Police Substation. There appellant confessed to the murder of his wife. After confessing, appellant took the police to the driving range near his home, where he had thrown <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>the murder weapon. After identifying the gun, he reenacted the crime for the police.</p>
    <p id="b157-3" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[186,456,1154,706]]]'>In addition to the facts hereinabove set forth, [Trooper] Eckenrode testified at the degree-of-guilt hearing that while appellant was reenacting the crime he asked the appellant what he had in mind when he took the gun from the closet and loaded it, and that Ewing then said, “I had it in my mind to shoot her.” Eckenrode further testified that he asked Ewing, “Well, then, when did it formulate in your mind, when were you going to kill her?” and that Ewing replied, “I picked up the gun and tucked it under my left arm and I picked up three shells out of the box and put them into the chamber, and at this point is when I decided I was going to kill her.”</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[183,1175,1150,264]]]'>Appellant also described to Eckenrode what happened after he had gotten into position to see his wife in the Schultz’s kitchen. Eckenrode testified that Ewing said: “I raised the gun to my shoulder, got her in the sights, and I pulled the trigger.”</p>

He maintained throughout the hearing that he was confused and did not know what his intention had been. The ridiculousness of this position and contention is further apparent from the following responses to the district attorney’s questions: “Q. Can you explain to me why you went over there with a gun, with three shells in the chambers or in the gun, if you weren’t angry? A. I can’t give you a definite explanation, no. Q. Do you remember doing what Corporal Eckenrode said you did, you backed off the window to get a view of her? A. Yes. Q. Do you remember sighting along the rifle at her? A. Yes, I remember that. Q. Through the window. Do you remember what you intended in your mind, at that point? Were you angry? A. I suppose my intentions were then to shot [sic] at <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>her. Q. Were you going to shoot at her or did you intend to kill her then? A. That I couldn’t say. Q. Well, did you take good aim on her? A. Well, as good as I could. Q. Corporal Eckenrode apparently said you had a right profile view of her, did you get that in the sights? A. Yes. Q. Do you remember squeezing the trigger? A. Yes. Q. And as a matter of fact at that point you did intend to shoot her, didn’t you? A. I suppose I must have. Q. As you remember, did you? A. I don’t know what was in my mind at that time. Q. You don’t remember, is that right? A. No.”</p>
