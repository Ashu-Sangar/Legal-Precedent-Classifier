Appellees and the court below, however, misconstrue the purpose of that section of The Borough Code. Although this Court has never had occasion to interpret that section in relation to the problem now before us, on several occasions we have construed §1502 of The First Class Township Code, the Act of June 24, 1931, P.L. 1206, art. XY, as amended, 53 P.S. §56502 (Supp. 1970), which contains language almost identical to that in §1010. In that line of cases we have consistently held that the only questions the court of quarter sessions can consider relate to defects in the process of enactment of the ordinance and that it has no jurisdiction to decide substantive issues concerning the ordinance’s validity. <em>Palmeri v.

      <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>It is certainly true, as appellees argue, that under MPC, §910, the Zoning Hearing Board has no power to pass on the validity of an ordinance. Its function is only to prepare a record if special issues of fact or interpretation exist which have not been determined at a hearing before another competent agency or body. That fact, however, does not mean that the procedure appellant followed was improper. Such issues of fact or interpretation can exist in a challenge to the constitutionality or substantive validity of an ordinance, and appellant attempted to have these determined prior to review by the court of common pleas. Section 1009 of the MPC mates it clear that the court specified in §1002 is to pass on the substantive validity of an ordinance, and appellant did not act improperly by following the procedure prescribed by the MPC and filing an appeal with the Zoning Hearing Board under §910.</p>

Nor had there been any indication or threat of enforcement.” See also, <em>Home Life Insurance Company of America v.

This principle is applicable regardless whether the premature attack is by an action in equity or through the administrative framework, and it does not matter whether an individual is protesting a restriction on his use of his land or the permission given another to use the other’s land in a particular way. In §801 of the MPC the legislature has modified this rule somewhat as to a landowner who is restricted in the use of his land, but the Act in no way affects the rules governing an attack by an individual on an ordinance which grants permission to a landowner to use his land in a certain way.</p>

Should not the parties and the situation existing in the neighborhood at the time the permit is sought be considered in the determination of such questions?” Therefore, this controversy will not be ripe for adjudication until either someone is granted a building permit pursuant to Ordinance No. 191 or action is taken pursuant to MPC, §801.</p>
