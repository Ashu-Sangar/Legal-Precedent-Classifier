The four occupants of the airplane—the pilot and three passengers—were killed in the crash. Trespass actions were instituted by the personal representatives of the three passengers (appellants) against the estate of the pilot in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County and, after a jury trial in September of 1968, the jury returned a verdict against appellants and in favor of the pilot’s estate.

The owner and pilot of the plane was Henry P. McCrory, Jr. (Mc-Crory) and his three passengers were John A. Kuchinic (Kuchinic), George Airhart, Jr. (Airhart) and John O’Hara (O’Hara). McCrory and his passengers, residents of Pittsburgh, were personal friends who had gone to Miami to attend a football game.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[196,1379,1158,595]],["BL_379.1",379,[167,319,1151,655]]]'>Prior to boarding the plane, in Miami, McCrory called the weather bureau, received its report, and Mc-Crory, in turn, reported to the three passengers that the weather was bad further north in certain portions of the proposed flight route, and asked their opinions as to whether they should proceed with the flight. After a discussion of approximately 30 minutes, it was agreed that they would proceed at least as far as Jacksonville, Florida, and, possibly, further provided the weather was favorable. At approximately 4:30 p.m., someone in the plane contacted Joseph Koon, flight <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>controller at the Jacksonville Airport, to close ont the flight plan between Miami and Jacksonville as required by federal regulations and this was done at 4:37 p.m. Noon testified that he then notified the person in the plane with whom he was conversing of a weather forecast which indicated a cold front in the area of Brunswick, Georgia, and turbulences along the edge of the cold front. According to his testimony, he was then requested to “stand by”, to await a further message. Approximately one to one and a half minutes later, Noon was called again and advised that the plane would continue with its flight.</p>

The applicable law in this respect was summarized in <em>Heffernan v. Rosser, </em><a href="/pa/419/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="419 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1896841" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0550-01">419 Pa. 550</a>, 555, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20655" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="215 A.2d 655">215 A. 2d 655</a> (1966): “[I]f a plaintiffs case discloses no contributory negligence and if the defendant offers no evidence from which plaintiffs contributory negligence may be inferred, therefore, since it is defendant’s burden to establish contributory negligence, it is the duty of the trial court to give binding instructions that no such question exists in the case . . .

    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[219,431,1164,1646]],["BL_381.1",381,[163,328,1150,708]]]'>Appellants’ theory was that the airplane crashed by reason of bad weather conditions encountered south of Brunswick, Georgia, that McCrory was aware of the weather conditions and that he was negligent in continuing the flight in spite of the adverse weather forecast. As has been indicated, prior to leaving Miami, McCrory had talked with the weather bureau and he was then informed of possibly hazardous flying conditions further north but he nevertheless took off on the flight. Under the circumstances, such facts could well support a finding of negligence on McCrory’s part. See: <em>Gatenby v. Altoona Aviation Corp., </em><a href="/f2d/407/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="407 F.2d 443" data-case-ids="2112363" data-case-paths="/f2d/407/0443-01">407 F. 2d 443</a>, 447 (3d Cir. 1968). On the other hand, it is undisputed that the pilot and the three passengers in Miami discussed the weather situation at length before determining to take off on the flight, and the record discloses circumstances from which the jury could reasonably and well have inferred that the decision to proceed on the flight despite the weather conditions was one of mutual agreement between the pilot and the passengers; under such circumstances appellants’ decedents could well have been found guilty of contributory negligence. See: <em>Restatement (Second) Torts, </em>§§463, 466 (1965). Moreover, appellants produced the testimony of Koon to the effect that he had notified someone in the plane, at the time the plane was flying above Jacksonville, about the bad weather conditions existing around Brunswick.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Koon testified that, after he had relayed the weather forecast to an unidentified person on the plane, there was a substantial hiatus before that <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>person called back <em>to </em>inform Koon that they would continue on the flight despite the forecast. From this, the jury could reasonably have inferred that another discussion had taken place similar to that which took place in Miami and that the decision to go forward was by mutual agreement of the pilot and the passengers. A reading of the record convinces us that there was sufficient factual support for a finding of contributory negligence and that the trial court did not err in charging on that subject. See: <em>Nelson v. Barclay Motors, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/414/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="414 Pa. 633" data-case-ids="1890402" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0633-01">414 Pa. 633</a>, 634, <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%2048" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="202 A.2d 48">202 A. 2d 48</a> (1964) ; <em>Kimmel v.

    <p id="b381-3" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[159,1048,1152,874]]]'>Appellants’ next contention is that the trial court erred in charging the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows: “An opinion is what someone thinks about something and the thought may be precisely accurate or totally inaccurate and yet represent the absolute [sic] honest conviction of the person who expressed it.
