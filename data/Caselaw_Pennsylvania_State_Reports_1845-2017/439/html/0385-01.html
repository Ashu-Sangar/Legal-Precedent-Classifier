It advertises extensively by means of printed brochures which are mailed to corporate enterprises. Prior to June 26, 1968, Edward E. Emanuel was the president of AMR and a significant minority stockholder. His employment contract contained a non-competition covenant for a period of two years after leaving AMR. In June of 1968, this employment was terminated and thereafter Emanuel began doing business as Continuing Management Education Company [CME], a business which is engaged in activities similar to AMR’s.</p>

The complaint sought injunctive relief. Emanuel brought two counteractions against AMR.</p>

On January 9, 1970, AMR filed a petition alleging Emanuel had not complied with the settlement agreement and decree entered on November 13th. A rule was requested to show cause why the decree should not be enforced. Emanuel interposed preliminary objections challenging the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the petition. <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>These objections were overruled and Emanuel appealed. We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[228,426,1157,1354]]]'>The essence of Emanuel’s argument on appeal is that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the agreement which was incorporated into its decree of November 13, 1968. The basis of this allegation is twofold: Emanuel first argues that the “Supplemental Memorandum of Agreement” amounted to a novation, which extinguished the original agreement embodied in the court’s decree. We find this contention devoid of merit. This agreement expressly stated that it merely “supplemented” the agreement of November 8, 1968. And the tenor of the three provisions which make up this agreement amply illustrate that this was the case. The first provision merely provides that the instalment note referred to in paragraph 3 of the original agreement would be interest bearing at the rate of 6% on unpaid balances. The second provision is a gloss on paragraph 4 of the original agreement. It provides that $90,000 of the $110,000 payable to Emanuel under the note would be allocable to the purchase by AMR of Emanuel’s stock. The third provision merely states that AMR would post one-half of the 10,000 shares of AMR stock owned by Emanuel and to be transferred by him to AMR (pursuant to paragraph 4 of the original agreement) with an escrow agent, thereby giving Emanuel a security interest in the stock.</p>

It does not contain all of the essential terms of the original agreement and, at most, makes only minor changes in those provisions which it does deal with. But more importantly, the document cannot be read without reference to the original agreement. The repeated references to the original make it abundantly clear that it was not intended that the original agreement be extinguished. Without this essential element, i.e., the ex-tinguishment of the old contract, there can be no nova<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>tion. <em>Yoder v.

    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[176,702,1150,1138]]]'>Appellant thus argues that by his partial compliance with the court’s decree, i.e., marking the case settled and discontinued, he may thereby preclude the court from enforcing the remainder of the decree and, in effect, flout the chancellor’s further directives. Both common sense and common law militate against such a result. “The power of a court of equity to enforce its own decrees is a necessary incident to the jurisdiction of the court. ‘Without such power, a decree would in many cases be useless. “All courts [of equity] have this power, and must necessarily have it; otherwise they could not protect themselves from insult, or enforce obedience to their process. Without it they would be utterly powerless” ’. . . . <em>The jurisdiction of the court continues for the purpose of enforcing the decree. . . . </em>Where there is an unimpeachable final decree, contemplating the performance of a series of acts, the proceedings to enforce compliance with that decree must be through that proceeding. . . .” <em>Butler Co. v.
