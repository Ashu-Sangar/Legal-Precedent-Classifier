Two days later Miriam Becker, the decedent’s niece, petitioned the Register of Wills for letters of administration c.t.a. and offered for probate an undated document which purported to be decedent’s will. It was written on the back of an envelope, and read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b69-3" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[694,326,114,33]]]'>

    <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.7",69,[176,786,1150,690]]]'>Thereafter, an appeal was taken from the probate of that document on the ground<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> that a later writing dated August 3, 1967 represented the decedent’s last will. This last-mentioned writing consisted of five handwritten pages which (1) merely listed item after item of household furnishings and personal effects, and (2) then concluded with the following language: “Mr. Roland this is the list you ask for <em>come as soon as you can I want to make a will.</em>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">

    <p id="b69-7" data-blocks='[["BL_69.8",69,[174,1497,1149,423]]]'>After a hearing concerning the facts and circumstances pertaining to the August 3, 1967 writing, the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas concluded that the writing was not testamentary in character and dismissed the appeal from the probate of the above-quoted short will. Prom this decree, Anna Zerbe Good, Dorothy Zerbe and Helen Zerbe took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b69-8" data-blocks='[["BL_69.9",69,[173,1933,1148,210]],["BL_70.1",70,[209,320,1156,1025]]]'>The record discloses the following facts: On December 4, 1966, Maud Richards entered a nursing home in Lancaster County which the appellants (the Zerbe sisters) operate for the benefit of persons who are physi<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>cally or mentally unable to take care of themselves. Prior to this time, Maud Richards had been a patient at the Wernersville State Hospital. Some time in the spring of 1967, Attorney David Roland received a telephone call from Helen Zerbe, who stated that Maud Richards wished to confer with a lawyer. Mr. Roland suggested that the request be made by letter. This was done, and in response thereto Roland, on May 3, 1967, conferred with Maud Richards at the nursing home in the presence of Helen Zerbe. <em>Boland testified </em>that various matters were discussed at this meeting, including the preparation of a will, but <em>that Mrs. Richards at that time was undecided as to how to leave her property. </em>Also discussed at this meeting was Mrs. Richards’ concern about the handling of her property by her niece Miriam Becker, who managed her affairs under a power of attorney. Subsequent to this visit, Roland spoke with counsel for Miriam Becker concerning her management of Mrs. Richards’ affairs.</p>
    <p id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[212,1356,1155,974]],["BL_71.1",71,[179,335,1148,256]]]'>On July 7, 1967, Roland paid a second visit to Mrs. Richards at the nursing home; at this meeting, or conference, Helen Zerbe was also present. Roland requested Mrs. Richards to prepare a list of the household furnishings that had been in her former home in Mar-gate City, New Jersey. Mrs. Richards evidently was concerned with the whereabouts of these household furnishings. <em>When the question of a will arose, Mrs. Richards was still undecided as to how to leave her property. </em>Roland testified that Mrs. Richards had an accurate knowledge of her property, knew who her heirs were, and in his opinion had testamentary capacity to make a will. Roland further testified that after he left Mrs. Richards on this second visit, Helen Zerbe accompanied him down the stairs and out of the building, “. . . and she discussed with me that if Mrs. Richards did not know where she wanted to leave her property, I should suggest the Zerbe Sisters since they had taken <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>care of Mrs. Richards in the last number of months, but I made no reply to that.” Mrs. Richards, during the latter part of her stay in the nursing home, had evidently shared a room with the mother of the appellants.</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[179,613,1146,207]]]'>On August 5, 1967, Roland went on his vacation, as he had previously told Mrs. Richards he would. On August 9, 1967, Mrs. Richards died at the Zerbe nursing home at the age of 72.</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[176,832,1150,587]]]'>After Roland returned from his vacation, which was after Miriam Becker had offered for probate the above-quoted short will, he asked Helen Zerbe to search for any papers that belonged to Mrs. Richards. The above-mentioned August 3, 1967 writing was found by Helen Zerbe in an envelope which Roland had earlier used to enclose a letter to Mrs. Richards. This envelope was in a plastic bag inside a shoebox together with other papers in Mrs. Richards’ closet. All of these papers were sent to Roland, and subsequently to the Zerbe sisters, who appealed from the probate of the earlier will.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>
