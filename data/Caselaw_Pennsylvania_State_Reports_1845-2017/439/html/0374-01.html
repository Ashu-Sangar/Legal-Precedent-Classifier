We note, however, that none of the parties filed praecipes to settle, discontinue and end with prejudice. Neither did the court <em>order </em>that the action be so marked. Cf. <em>Murdoch v. Murdoch, </em><a href="/pa/418/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="418 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1896099" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0219-01">418 Pa. 219</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=210%20A.2d%20490" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="210 A.2d 490">210 A. 2d 490</a> (1965) ; <em>Baumgartner v.

Rather the court, apparently aware of the contingency on which the payment of the settlement was based, merely marked the case settled. This was in and of itself only a ministerial act—a notation on the docket—and did not “terminate” the action. The tentative nature of the docket entry—“Case <em>reported </em>settled” (Emphasis added.) — gives further evidence of this fact. Thus, the suit was still pending and the court did not lose jurisdiction over the cause of action.</p>

Thus it was appropriate under the circumstances for the court to entertain plaintiffs’ petition and to order a hearing. Had this been done properly, the present appeal might have been made unnecessary. But the court completely misconstrued its task. Although it entered judgment against <em>all </em>defendants, the court expressly stated that “any question of the liability inter se of the Defendants . . . was not an issue in the above-entitled case, is not an issue properly justiciable by the court as a part of the above-entitled case nor will any such issue be determined or prejudiced by judgment entered on the issues in this case.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

However, this was not the court’s intention and it is clear from the above-quoted language that the court did not consider whether or not A. &amp; P. was afforded coverage under the certificate of insurance referred to in the Settlement Agreement. The fact remains, however, that the court did direct that judgment be entered against A. &amp; P. and it did so, by its own admission, without any interpretation of the agreement on which the settlement was based. If the court did not predicate A. &amp; P.’s liability on the terms of the agreement, we are unable to discern <em>any reason </em>why judgment was entered as it was. Cf. P.L.E. Judgment §5.
