    <p id="b609-9" data-blocks='[["BL_609.12",609,[161,1182,1151,430]]]'>On June 27, 1966, at about 10:00 P.M., James T. Kester, Jr. was killed instantly as the result of a collision between a pick-up truck which he was driving and defendants’ bus. There were no eyewitnesses to the accident and plaintiffs’ case was based entirely on the circumstantial evidence of two witnesses. The facts of this collision can be thus summarized from the testimony of these two witnesses:</p>
    <p id="b609-10" data-blocks='[["BL_609.13",609,[157,1625,1152,710]],["BL_610.1",610,[242,335,1153,91]]]'>The collision occurred on an east-west, two-lane highway known as the Freemansburg Highway, between Bethlehem and Easton, Pennsylvania. Defendants’ bus came to rest completely off the south side of the highway in the front yard of plaintiffs’ witness, Wellington <em>G. </em>Frick, pointed in a southwesterly direction. Hester’s pick-up truck was partially off the eastbound lane on its south berm, headed in a southeasterly direction, approximately 180 feet to the east of the final position of the bus. The body of the decedent and the cab seat from the truck were in the westbound lane, near the center of the highway, to the west of the pick-up truck. The debris from the accident was scat<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>tered over a wide area of the highway, including both the east- and <em>westbound </em>lanes.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[242,446,1155,982]]]'>Plaintiffs’ first witness, Frick, testified that on the night of the accident he was sitting in his front living room, which faces on Freemansburg Highway. He testified that he heard the squeal of brakes on the highway in front of his house and was able to get “just a quick glance” of the tail lights of a passing vehicle before he heard a terrific explosion-like crash of two vehicles. He testified that the tail lights appeared to be going in an easterly direction, but he did not see the actual collision. He further testified about two different sets of tire skid marks at the scene of the accident. The first set started near the front of his home and extended approximately 180 feet on the south side or in the eastbound lane of the highway. The second set of skid marks were described as “dual wheel” marks to the east of the first set and were made by a dual wheel crossing the center line of the highway at either a north-south <em>or </em>south-north angle.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.6",610,[242,1440,1156,370]]]'>Plaintiffs’ second witness, Manuel Barbosa, who arrived at the scene after the accident, testified as to the existence of the first set of skid marks, which he described to be 60 or 90 feet in length. His testimony merely established that these skid marks were there after the accident on the south side of the highway, in the eastbound lane.</p>

Since a reasonably prudent man does not drive his vehicle on the wrong side of the highway, the jury could have found, without more evidence, that the bus driver was negligent. Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment of nonsuit, and remand for a new trial.</p>
