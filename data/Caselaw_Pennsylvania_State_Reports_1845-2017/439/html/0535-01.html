Larendon purchased certain tracts of land situated in Chester County and the improvements thereon (hereinafter “the property”), taking title thereto as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. On December 7, 1960, Larendon died in California where he Vas domiciled; following trial by jury in the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of San Diego, Dalton was convicted of having murdered Larendon, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal by the California District Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District.</p>

Thereafter, having been denied possession of the property by the ancillary administrator of Larendon’s estate (appellee herein),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Dresner sought a declaratory judgment in the court below as to the nature and extent of the interest in the property which Dalton had had and he (Dresner) had purchased. The lower court determined that the instant dispute was controlled by the terms of the Slayer’s Act, Act of August 5, 1941, P.L. 816, §1, 20 P.S. §3441 (hereinafter “the Act”); that Dalton’s interest in the property became a life interest in one-half of the property upon the death of Larendon; and that the estate of Larendon simultaneously became the owner of a fee interest in the other one-half of the property, together with a vested remainder interest in the other one-half of the property in which Dalton had a life estate. It thus followed, and the court so decreed, that Dresner’s purchase was a life interest in one-half of the property, the interest being measured by Dalton’s life. Upon reargument the court reaffirmed its original decision; this appeal followed.</p>

The intent of the Act is stated in Section 15 which provides that the “act shall not be considered penal in nature, but shall be construed broadly in order to effect the policy of this State that no person shall be allowed to profit by his own wrong, wherever committed.” 20 P.S. §3455. By its express terms, the Act attempts to insure that a person will not benefit from his misdeed, but there is no indication, express or implied, that the Act is meant to extinguish any property right enjoyed by the slayer <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>at the time of his misdeed nor should it he construed to have that effect unless necessary. The balance struck by the legislature is that between the prevention of the slayer’s self-enrichment by his crime, on the one hand, and his right to retain that property which he possessed immediately before the slaying, on the other hand. The principal focus of the Act is not as the appellee here contends one of balancing the slayer’s interests against the interests of his victim’s estate nor does the Act reflect a legislative intent to profit the decedent’s estate by diminishing any property right held by the slayer. As the Court said in <em>Kravitz Estate, supra, </em>at p. 327, the intent of the Slayer’s Act is “clear—a person convicted of murder is not entitled to receive any property of the person he (or she) wilfully or unlawfully killed.” While the operation of the Act may in certain situations redound to the benefit of the decedent’s estate, such instances are necessary by-products of the prevention of windfalls to the slayer.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[162,1377,1152,974]],["BL_602.1",602,[246,322,1153,257]]]'>Taken in the light of this understanding of the legislative intent, the initial point at issue in this case is the nature of Dalton’s interest in the property following the slaying of Larendon. The Act explicitly speaks to joint tenancies in which the slayer is a participant, and provides as follows: “One-half of any property held by the slayer and the decedent as joint tennants, joint owners or joint obligees shall pass upon the death of the decedent to his estate, and the other half shall pass to his estate upon the death of the slayer, unless the slayer obtains a separation or severance of the property or a decree granting partition.” 20 P.S. 3446(a). It is undisputed that upon the death of the slain joint tenant, his one-half interest in the property passes to his estate; because his estate will necessarily survive the slayer, title to the remaining one-half interest in the property will pass to that estate upon the death of the slayer. Section 6 of the Act does <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>not, however, explicitly define the nature of the slayer’s one-half interest and as is often the case, it is necessary for us to fill the interstices of the statute with meaning, acting with regard for the intent of the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[242,595,1160,1085]]]'>As noted above, the lower court concluded that the slayer’s fee interest in the jointly held-property was converted to a life interest at decedent’s death. We disagree. The vesting of a technical right of survivorship in the decedent’s estate is necessary to effect the statutory intent that the slayer should not benefit from his misdeed; that is, the slayer’s criminal act has prevented the victim himself from being the survivor, and unless 'the slayer’s right of survivorship is extinguished, he will have acquired gain from his crime. This vesting is also adequate to the statutory end, and no further change in the nature or extent of the slayer’s interest is required to prevent him from benefiting by his own wrong. We conclude that the slayer, at decedent’s death, retained that undivided one-half interest in the property (together with all normal incidents thereto) which he had previously enjoyed, except that passage of the remaining one-half interest to the estate of the decedent effectively extinguished the slayer’s right of survivorship.</p>

It is appellee’s position that the right of the slayer under §6 of the Act to obtain a severance is a right personal to him and the lower court specifically based its opinion sur reargument on this premise. We are not so persuaded and believe the answer to appellee’s contention is implicit in the above <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>reasoning as to the perseverance of the slayer’s interest in the property after decedent’s death.</p>

Section 6 of the Act by its express terms preserves the slayer’s ordinary right to sever or obtain partition. Moreover, severance of a joint tenancy may take place in the ordinary case either voluntarily or involuntarily, and it has long been the law in this Commonwealth that a sale upon execution of a judgment against one joint tenant effects an involuntary severance of the joint tenancy. <em>Lessee of Davidson v.

The Act, if thus construed, far from preventing the enrichment of the slayer, would in fact benefit the slayer by insulating his property from the reach of creditors. In the instant case, Dalton could not have prevented an involuntary severance of his interest for the benefit of his creditors prior to the death of Larendon; that he should be able to do so by virtue of having taken Larendon’s life would be a result too anomalous to countenance. We are persuaded that the legislature did not intend that such a result would follow from Section 6 of the Act and accordingly hold that an execution sale of a slayer’s jointly held property constitutes a severance of the joint tenancy; the buyer at such a sale takes a fee interest in the property purchased, free of the right of survivorship which had previously existed in the decedent’s estate.</p>

I disagree with the Majority’s interpretation of this “unless” clause because (to repeat) I believe (a) it is contrary to the recited purpose of the Act and the policy of our Commonwealth, and (b) it would allow (practically and realistically) a slayer or his family additional advantages and benefits from his killing which are not provided for in the statute.

While this is the result this writer would prefer to reach, it cannot be denied that under Pennsylvania law the slayer may personally obtain a severance or separation or partition. Regardless of the wisdom or necessity of such a provision, it is clearly unwise and improper to extend this personal right to the creditors of the slayer.</p>

To hold as the majority does that one-half of the property which passed to the decedent’s estate should now be taken away from his estate and thrown into the “pot” making it a subject of partition by a creditor flies in the face of the clear wording of the statute.</p>
