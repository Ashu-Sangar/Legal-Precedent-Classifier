    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.7",121,[158,601,1151,604]]]'>John Edward Garrett, Jr. was arraigned upon a bill of indictment for the crime of murder, to which he entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. On February 27, 1967, when the case was called for trial, defendant, while represented by a Court-appointed counsel, withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered (on the bill) an endorsed plea of guilty to the crime of voluntary manslaughter. Defendant was sentenced to pay a fine and costs, and to undergo imprisonment of not less than four years nor more than twelve years. No appeal was taken from the Judgment of Sentence.</p>

The sole issue before the Court on this appeal is whether appellant knowingly and understandingly waived his Constitutional right to trial hy jury.</p>

The testimony of both appellant and his trial defense counsel at the P.C.H.A. hearing fails to support appellant’s contentions.</p>

And you also knew that Mr. Aglow [defense counsel] said you might be convicted, you might not be found not guilty. A. Yes, there is a possibility of that.”</p>
