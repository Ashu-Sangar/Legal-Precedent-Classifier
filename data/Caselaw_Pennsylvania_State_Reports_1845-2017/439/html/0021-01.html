The proprietor, hoping to avoid trouble in his bar, asked them to leave. They did leave; the victim walked out the door first, and was followed by defendant, a few feet behind. Defendant had his right hand in the side pocket of his trousers. Shortly after the door closed, patrons of the bar heard what sounded to them like gunshots. The victim (McNeil) was found in the vicinity of the bar dying from bullet wounds which entered his body from the back. <em>Defendant’s landlady testified that later that evening defendant told her he had shot a man because “the man was bothering him” </em>Defendant did not testify.

At his arraignment, which was held immediately before the time scheduled for his actual trial, defendant pleaded not guilty to indictments charging him with murder, violations of the Firearms Act and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, all arising out of the shooting of McNeil. Following his arraignment but before a trial jury was selected, the assistant district attorney requested a meeting with the trial Judge in his chambers. The Judge asked whether the defendant should be present, but the defense attorney stated that would not be necessary. The assistant district attorney and the defense attorney thereupon met with the trial Judge in his chambers. The record does not disclose what discussions took place at that conference, but when the attorneys returned to the courtroom defendant’s attorney stated openly to the Court that the defendant <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>wished to change his plea and enter a plea of guilty generally to the crime of murder, which he did.</p>

He asserts further that since the discussions between the attorneys took place in the presence of the trial Judge, the trial Judge had in effect acquiesced in the bargain. Moreover, defendant’s counsel suggests that he may have misled the defendant into believing that <em>“the probabilities” were good </em>that the trial Judge would follow the recommendations of both attorneys. Whatever the probabilities were, our review of the part of the record which dealt with the examination of the defendant by both his trial counsel and the trial Judge makes it abundantly clear that defendant knew that no promises had been made by the Court, and that the Court was not bound by any of the discussions that had taken place. Defendant’s brief specifically states that the sentencing Judge did not “participate” in the discussion of a two-year maximum sentence.</p>

On the other hand, the examination of defendant by his attorney and the trial Judge at the time of the entry of the guilty plea shows that the various possible sentences were explained to him, and that he was advised of his right to a jury trial and his right to appeal from the verdict of the jury, and that no promises or representations had been made either as to the degree of guilt the Judge might find or as to the sentence which he might impose. Moreover, the psychiatrist, who was in the courtroom at the time of the entry of the guilty plea, testified that in his opinion defendant was competent at that time to understand <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>the questions which had been asked of him and the nature and extent of his act.</p>

Appellant has advanced a “fair and just” reason: He first believed that the judge had agreed to a plea bargain for a two year sentence, but later realized that the judge was not informed of, and did not concur in, the bargain. This erroneous impression was conveyed to him by the fact that the trial judge met with counsel in chambers before he withdrew his plea of not guilty, by the assistant district attorney’s recommmendation of two years at the degree of guilt hearing, and by the representations of defense counsel. Defense counsel in fact testified that “I would be less than frank . . . not to admit that I think I did raise in his [the defendant’s] mind the feeling that if both of us recommended it [a two year sentence] our recommendations would be accepted [by the trial judge].” The assistant district attorney testified: “I realize there was [sic] many pitfalls which the Commonwealth had in this particular case. ...
