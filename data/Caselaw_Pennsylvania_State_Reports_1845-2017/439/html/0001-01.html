In her will, she made no bequest to her husband, and indeed failed to mention him. Russell thereafter filed an election to take against his wife’s will. Edna’s executor filed a petition to revoke or vacate the surviving spouse’s election, based upon the Wills Act of 1947, P. L. 89, §9(a), 20 P.S. §180.9(a). Section 9(a) provides that “a husband, who for one year or upwards previous to the death of his wife, shall have <em>wilfully </em>neglected or refused to provide for her, or who for that period or upwards shall have <em>wilfully </em>and maliciously deserted her, shall have no right of election.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

It appears from the testimony that the couple experienced marital difficulties almost from the time of their marriage. As early as 1955, Russell refused to speak to his wife and would not eat breakfast or <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>lunch with her, even though she requested him to do so. Furthermore, on numerous occasions, Russell physically abused his wife.

We disagree. In <em>Jury Estate, </em>the husband, who claimed his intestate share,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">**</a> admitted he had not <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>contributed to bis wife’s support for two years prior to her death. However, the. question involved was whether the husband’s nonsupport of his wife for this period, without other evidence, raised a presumption that he had <em>wilfully </em>neglected or refused to provide for her. This Court said (page 176): “In the instant case, the learned court below very effectively read out of the statute the qualifying adverb, ‘wilfully’, by imposing upon the husband the burden of going forward with evidence to disprove that his failure to provide for his wife had been wilful when all that had been shown was his nonsupport of his wife.”</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.6",66,[203,978,1157,687]]]'>However, in <em>Jury Estate, </em>the collateral heirs did not introduce any evidence to prove that there had been a change in the marital arrangement from what it had been at its inception, which was undoubtedly consensual when it began. On the other hand, in the instant case, there is evidence that Edna and Russell contemplated the establishment of a common home, and in fact established one. It was because of Russell’s maltreatment of her that Edna left the common abode. Moreover, Edna’s executor presented substantial evidence of Russell’s wilful neglect or refusal to provide for her, and that Russell made no real effort to establish a reconciliation.</p>

Moreover, her husband’s total income for the period in question was $22.80, and he was obviously unable to support her. Under these circumstances, one cannot be said to wilfully neglect or refuse to provide for another if he or she is without financial means.</p>
