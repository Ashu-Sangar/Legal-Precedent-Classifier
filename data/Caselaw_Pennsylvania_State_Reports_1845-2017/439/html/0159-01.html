    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.8",223,[159,870,1150,635]]]'>The principal error alleged by Radcliffe in its appeal is that it was ordered to trial without legal counsel or adequate time to prepare a trial strategy. The following events led up to trial: The foreclosure action was commenced December 2, 1986. Phoenix gave notice of its intention to certify the case to the trial list on September 15, 1967, after pleadings had closed on August 28, 1967. However, to allow Radcliffe to explore the possibility of refinancing or selling the mortgaged property, and to allow Radcliffe’s attorney to take depositions, the case was not ordered upon the trial list.</p>

Leonard C. Hecht, an officer of appellant corporation, which is a family corporation comprised of Hecht and two sisters, wrote a letter to the court, dated February 4, 1968, opposing the Bowen &amp; Yalimont petition. On February 7, 1968, Phoenix filed an answer.</p>

The court administrator replied that the application for a continuance should be made in person. The caller stated that the firm was not associated with local counsel, that none of its members had qualified to practice in Bucks County under Supreme Court Rule 14, but that he would contact a specified Bucks County law office. This conversation was confirmed by a letter of the same date from Harvey S. Cohen, of the Hecht firm, to the court administrator.</p>

Near the close of what turned out to be a pretrial conference on June 18, Mr. Hecht, after contacting his brother, reported to the court that his brother would not be available to represent appellant on June 19, that Mr. Cohen was not registered to practice law in Bucks County, but that the Hecht law firm would have a specified Bucks County attorney present on June 19 to represent the appellant at trial.</p>

Although appellant’s brief admits that it had “the additional problem of not having fluid resources available to retain counsel,” it contends that this financial difficulty was not insurmountable because certain attorneys had expressed direct interest in the case.</p>

In fact, when the law firm of Bowen &amp; Valimont originally filed its petition for leave to withdraw on January 26, 1968, the case had not even been placed on the trial list. Nor was the case of a controversial variety so as to make it difficult to obtain counsel. See <em>Bierstein v.

Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Smith, </em>appellant was heard, since all its officers were present at trial. Under these circumstances, we do not believe that appellant Avas denied its constitutional rights to adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[211,1259,1156,808]]]'>Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in not informing Mr. Hecht, who is not an attorney, that he could subpoena witnesses, that he must come forward Avith evidence in support of appellant’s counterclaim, and that he must object to court rulings in order to preserve his rights on appeal. However, the first thing the court below did after the jury was sworn was to instruct Mr. Hecht about trial procedure, including the examination and cross-examination of Avithesses and objections to evidence. At the close of these instructions, the court expressly provided 'an opportunity for Mr. Hecht to raise any questions he had about procedures, and Mr. Hecht had none. During the course of trial, Mr. Hecht did not hesitate to ask questions about procedure Avhen he wanted information.</p>
    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.7",230,[212,2080,1155,262]],["BL_231.1",231,[133,350,1149,207]]]'>Furthermore, Mr. Hecht showed he was aware of the subpoena power when he successfully arranged for the attendance of Mr. Mignoni. With respect to the preservation of objections, the court frequently stated that its rulings would be preserved by objections or <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>suggested that objections be made if Mr. Hecht wished to do so. With respect to the counterclaim, appellant did offer evidence, but it was ruled inadmissible. We think the instructions were adequate.</p>
    <p id="b231-3" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[134,569,1149,252]]]'>Appellant next argues that the trial was not fair because the court made allegedly prejudicial remarks, gave a biased charge, and did not give appellant’s representative a sufficient amount of time to prepare his summation.</p>
    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[135,842,1151,582]]]'>We cannot agree with appellant. None of the remarks was prejudicial. The complaint about the length of time allowed for the preparation of Mr. Hecht’s closing speech is unfounded. Except for Mr. Mignoni’s brief testimony on Monday morning, the evidentiary aspects of the trial had been concluded early, the preceding Friday afternoon, so Mr. Hecht had the whole week-end to prepare his speech. Moreover, when the court stated its intention to allow ten minutes for preparation, Mr. Hecht made no objection and no request for additional time.</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[132,1444,1158,866]]]'>As for the court’s charge, appellant raises two alleged errors. First, appellant urges that it was error for the trial court to permit a paper setting forth Phoenix’s calculation of damages to go to the jury. However, this action, accompanied by the proper admonition that such a paper was not evidence, was entirely a matter for the trial judge’s discretion. <em>Solomon v. Luria, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/45/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="45 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 291" data-case-ids="1704333" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/45/0291-01">45 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 291</a>, 297-298 (C. P. Phila. Co., 1967), affirmed per curiam, <a href="/pa-super/213/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="213 Pa. Super. 87" data-case-ids="785218" data-case-paths="/pa-super/213/0087-01">213 Pa. Superior Ct. 87</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20A.2d%20435" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="246 A.2d 435">246 A. 2d 435</a> (1968). In the instant case, where appropriate instructions with respect to the paper were given by the trial judge, we cannot find an abuse of discretion. Secondly, appellant contends that the charge to the jury was additionally improper because it was “biased and unduly weighted in favor of the plaintiff.” We have read the entire charge. We do not agree with appellant.</p>
