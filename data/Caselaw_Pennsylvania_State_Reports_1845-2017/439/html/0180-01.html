Nelson &amp; Company, Inc. In 1962, he initiated an action in trespass against his employer’s insurance carrier, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty). Liability was asserted on the basis of an alleged duty arising out of the loss prevention service and safety counseling which Liberty offered to its policyholders. On November 15, 1966, this Court found that DeJesus had failed to state a cause of action, and affirmed the lower <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>court’s order dismissing the complaint in trespass. <em>DeJesus v.

This action lay dormant for five and one-half years, while DeJesus pursued his trespass action, until June 26, 1967, when Liberty served DeJesus with a rule to file a complaint. A complaint was filed three weeks after the rule, and an amended complaint was filed on December 26, 1967. The crux of the complaint, as amended, was that Liberty had contractually bound itself to Frank S. Nelson &amp; Co. to offer, institute and establish safety procedures, that DeJesus was a third-party beneficiary to the contract, that DeJesus had relied upon Liberty’s promise, that by reason of Liberty’s failure to properly perform its promise, the risk of harm to DeJesus was increased, and, finally, that DeJesus was injured due to such an increased risk of harm.</p>
