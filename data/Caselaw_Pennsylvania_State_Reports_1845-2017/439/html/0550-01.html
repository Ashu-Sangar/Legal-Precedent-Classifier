The aim of these statutes is to promote the presumed intentions of most testators. Since the statutes represent the Legislature’s judgment as to the normal intention of testators, the provision which renders them inapplicable must be unambiguous and open to no other interpretation. <em>In Re Shubert's Will, </em><a href="/ny-2d/10/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 N.Y.2d 461" data-case-ids="2260417" data-case-paths="/ny-2d/10/0461-01">10 N.Y. 2d 461</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20N.Y.S.2d%2013" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="225 N.Y.S.2d 13">225 N.Y.S. 2d 13</a> (1962).</p>

In the instant cáse the effect of utilizing Jane Laher’s proposed method of distribution would be to take the widow’s federal estate tax exemption and the more favorable state inheritance tax rate on the widow’s inheritances ánd distribute a portion of those benefits to Jane Laher, giving her $16,440.99 more than she would get under the executor’s proposed distribution and giving 'the widow correspondingly less.

Both the executor’s and Jane Laher’s proposed methods of distribution would be consistent with the direction that all taxes be paid from the residue. The question in this case is not whether the taxes are to be deducted from the residue, but from whose share of the residue they should be taken.

Act of August 24, 1951, amended by Act of December 22, 1965, P.L. 1204, 20 P.S. §883 (d). In light of this provision the decedent might well have added Item IV, which is not an uncommon clause, in order to insure the integrity of his specific bequests, and non-probate assets and not with any thought to affecting the proration of taxes between the two residuary legatees. Given this highly probable alternative explanation for the inclusion of Item IV, we are hardly willing to give it the much broader interpretation urged on us by Jane Laher.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
