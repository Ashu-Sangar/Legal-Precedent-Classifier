It is perfectly clear under Section 343(b), as quoted above, that Bobb would have no duty to warn an invitee, such as Palenscar, Jr., of a danger which was more obvious to and more likely to be discovered by Palenscar, Jr., than by any employee of Bobb. <em>Repyneck v.

The fact finder found that appellee knew that its system was obsolete and should be replaced. If appellee had had its entire electrical system inspected, as a reasonable possessor would have done, the defective wiring inside the switchgear box would have been discovered. Rather than pay someone to examine the entire system and replace all badly worn components, or at least identify them, appellee chose to make do with its obsolete system because of the impending condemnation of the building. This was unreasonable and a breach of a duty owed to appellant.</p>

I do not believe that such a rule has any applicability to the instant case. The appellant was not on the premises to eliminate all of the dangerous conditions in appellee’s electrical system. As the record shows, rather than have its system thoroughly overhauled, appellee had chosen to make do with patchwork repairs. The appellant was on the premises merely for the purpose of determining the cause of the power failure and making those repairs. As stated in appellee’s brief, “For all that the Bobb personnel knew of the matter, their lights might have been out because a fuse had blown.” There is no indication that the defective wiring in the switchgear box which had caused the explosion and the injury was also the cause of the power failure which compelled appellee’s original call for appellant’s father to come to the premises.</p>
