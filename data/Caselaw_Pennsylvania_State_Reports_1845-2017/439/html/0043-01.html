Bartow retained ownership of the surface/ On the dates here involved, the Thomas M. Stewart Estate, as Bartow’s successor in title, was the owner of the surface. Vincent C.

    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[215,560,1159,1360]]]'>In this regard, this Court recognizes that <em>“strip mining </em>is an accepted <em>manner </em>or <em>method </em>of coal mining, which, with the use of modern huge and efficient machinery, has become progressively more in vogue”: <em>Mt. Carmel Railroad Co. v. M. A. Hanna Co., </em>supra, at 240. And this Court does not wish to interfere with its use or hinder its economic viability. Yet we cannot help but realize that “in view of the surface violence, destruction and disfiguration which inevitably attend strip or open mining, ... no land owner would lightly or casually grant strip mining rights, nor would any purchaser of land treat lightly any reservation of mining rights which would permit the grantor or his assignee to come upon his land and turn it into a battleground with strip mining”: <em>Rochez Bros., Inc. v. Duricka, </em>supra, at 265-66. Therefore, “the burden rests upon him who seeks to assert the right to destroy or injure the surface” <em>(Merrill v. Manufacturers Light and Heat Co., </em>supra, at 73-74) to show some positive indication that the parties to the deed agreed to authorize practices which may result in these consequences.

See <em>Mt. Carmel Railroad Co. v. M. A. Hanna Co., </em>supra. Such an interpretation, however, fails to take into account that “ventilate” refers to “said mines.” This seems to connote that the mines for which provisions were made in prior clauses were expected to require ventilation, leading to the conclusion that the parties contemplated shaft mining.</p>
    <p id="b113-3" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[134,951,1153,594]]]'>Under this interpretation, the clause in the deed of severance granting a “full release of and without liability for injury to the surface, waters, or otherwise” would not relieve the C &amp; K Company of liability. It is a limited release from liability, because it is only applicable if the injury arises “from any of the said operations.” If there is only the right to shaft or deep mine, the reference to “said operations” limits the release to damages caused by such shaft or deep mining. It would not be applicable to damage caused by the use of strip mining processes.</p>
