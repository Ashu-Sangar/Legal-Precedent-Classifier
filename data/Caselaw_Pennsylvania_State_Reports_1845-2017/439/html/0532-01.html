    <p id="b595-8" data-blocks='[["BL_595.11",595,[192,1069,1151,819]]]'>This case is a trespass action filed by the plaintiff, Hazel Mardis Meagher, a resident of Indiana County, <em>against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. </em>The action was initiated by service of a copy of the complaint upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth and upon the Attorney General. The complaint and all other proceedings were written by the plaintiff without the assistance of an attorney and, needless to say, do not present the issues as clearly as they might. In essence, she states that the sale of a tract of land by officials in Indiana County for delinquent taxes and the subsequent removal of standing timber located thereon by various private individuals constituted an actionable trespass for which the Commonwealth must be held legally responsible.</p>

    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[193,472,1154,375]]]'>The lower Court concluded that the Commonwealth, by reason of its Sovereignty, was immune from such suits, and, as it has not consented to be sued in trespass, the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The lower Court, therefore, sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint.</p>
