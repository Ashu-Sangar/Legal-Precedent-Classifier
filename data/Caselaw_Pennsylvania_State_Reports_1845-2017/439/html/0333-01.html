The jury trial provided by Section 515 of the Code (26 P.S. §1-515) is a <em>de novo </em>proceeding. <em>Manganese Steel Forge Co. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/421/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="421 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1900304" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0067-01">421 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="218 A.2d 307">218 A. 2d 307</a> (1966).

Undue attention on appeal to the magnitude of the viewers’ award would effectively deprive the dissatisfied condemnee of his statutory right to a jury determination of damages. See, also, <em>Shotts v.

Rather than resting upon a comparison between the viewers’ award and the jury verdict, our decision as to whether a new trial is called for requires a review of the testimony presented at trial to determine whether the jury verdict was excessive.</p>

This disagreement as to highest and best use resulted in a considerable difference both as to the before-condemnation value and the damages attributable to condemnation. The appellees’ experts testified to a before-condemnation value in the neighborhood of $150,000 and to damages of approximately $30,000; appellant’s experts calculated a prior value of approximately $90,000 and damages of roughly $6,000.</p>

We cannot agree. One witness for the Stoners, Paul Sopensky, specifically stated that the Stoners’ property located along Eoute 15 was ready for sale for residential development. Appellees’ witnesses also stated that development Eke that which they projected for the Stoner property had reached similar areas in the adjacent sections of Cumberland County and that such development would soon come to the area of the Stoner property. As to commercial and industrial development, this testimony was strengthened by the fact that the Stoners’ property was served by an ample highway network. The farm had extensive frontage on <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>and unrestricted access to the highway known as old U.S. Route 15, which immediately north of the Stoner property leads to new Route 15, a limited access, four-lane highway.

The evidence presented was sufficient to persuade a jury that a buyer, at the time of condemnation, would have been influenced by this possibility of future development, and the size of the verdict returned reflects the jurors’ acceptance of the possible uses and the measure of damages advanced by the condemnees’ experts.</p>
