In the instant case, the majority refuses to consider an unobjected to error in the charge, an error which, to me, was at least as damaging as the error in <em>Williams. </em>Thus the majority demonstrates, once again, that it cannot apply its own “test” with any degree of uniformity. See <em>Commonwealth v.

It being my view that the unobjected to error in the instant case cannot now be raised, see <em>Commonwealth v.
