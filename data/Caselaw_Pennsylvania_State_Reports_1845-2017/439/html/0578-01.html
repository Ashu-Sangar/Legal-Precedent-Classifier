Patricia Graff was named executrix of her mother’s estate. On September 27, 1968, the executrix filed an inventory which valued the assets of the estate at approximately $45,000.

Both the petition and the exceptions were based upon the allegation that William Moore, for good and valuable consideration, had agreed not to take any share of his wife’s estate, and that her will recited this agreement.</p>
