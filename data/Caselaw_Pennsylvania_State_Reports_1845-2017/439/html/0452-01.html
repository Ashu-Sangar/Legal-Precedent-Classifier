In construing these leases, the touchstones of interpretation ought to be the similarity of the businesses from the point of view of the consumers and the extent to which customary business practice would consider the two operations to be coextensive. Using these standards, I think it clear that the provisions of the North Hills Village lease and the Eastland Shopping Center lease were meant to and do exclude competition from an operation such as Sterling’s.</p>
    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.7",518,[219,1947,1155,264]],["BL_519.1",519,[149,340,1153,653]]]'>The North Hills lease provides that the lessor shall not lease any of its other stores “for use as a drug store, with or without a prescription department,” and the evidence is that the products which Sterling’s North Hills store handles account for at least three-quarters <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>of Sun’s North Hills store’s business. I am at a loss to understand what type of business could more accurately be termed a “drug store without a prescription department.” Further, I do not believe that the next sentence in the North Hills lease—allowing other tenants to carry “many” of the same products carried by Sun—eviscerates the clear meaning of the restriction. gun clearly intended to permit some overlapping in the sale of its items, but I cannot believe that the ends of justice are served by reading the clause so as to nullify the protection sought by and given to Sun in the preceding sentence.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[153,1006,1154,1084]]]'>The Eastland Shopping Center lease provides that no other store may be used as “a drug store or a proprietary medicine store,” and the evidence demonstrated that Sterling’s Eastland store sold products which accounted for two-thirds of the Eastland Sun’s sales. I again fail to see how Sun could more clearly be protected. I also note that my brethren’s diversionary discussion of the possibility of shifting definitions of what a “drug store” is and of the virtues of free trade does not really answer the question whether Sun’s Eastland lease protected it against Sterling’s competition. I, too, am in favor of free trade and I, too, believe that shifting definitions might, in some contexts, be a problem <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">

      <em> </em>but I do not see how either issue is relevant in this case. No one has asserted that Sun’s business has changed substantially since this lease was written, and there is no doubt that this restriction is not an illegal restraint on trade. I would encourage my colleagues to eschew obfuscation and face the issues involved.</p>

I feel that Sun probably intended to insulate itself from the competition of a store such as Sterling’s, but I agree with the majority that this lease provision is too ambiguous to support such a conclusion. At the very most, this lease provision covers only situations in which more than fifty per cent of Sun’s sales is derived from products similar to those carried by the competing establishment.</p>

When more than half of Sun’s sales came from sales and operations in which Sterling #3 did not indulge, it is difficult to see how the latter’s business was “such as that of Tenant.” It is true that by excluding tobacco products, prescription drugs and fountain service, Sterling #3 carries 80% of the product lines sold by Sun, but when construing the “such as that of Tenant” phrase, there seems no reason to exclude those products and services. If Sun had desired a particular method of construing that phrase, it should have said so explicitly in the lease. In the absence of such a direction, this Court must make a natural and reasonable construction, and the percentages of sales figures discussed seem the most revelant ones for that purpose.</p>

However, a sentence appears after these words which casts great doubt on the meaning of the whole paragraph. The lease says “However, it is understood that other tenants in the shopping center may have for sale <em>many </em>of the items <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>being sold by this Lessee.” It is not clear whether this meant that many other tenants could have a few items each or whether one or more could carry many items that Sun sold. The lower court found that Sun’s North Hills store sold all the products Sterling <em>#2 </em>did, and that these accounted for approximately three-fourths of Sun’s business. Consequently, a full one-fourth of its business comes from products Sterling <em>#2 </em>does not handle.</p>
    <p id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[140,796,1158,1042]]]'>The question, therefore, is whether three-fourths is the “many” recognized in the lease. Certainly “many” can not mean 100%, for then “all” would have been used. But at what point below 100% does “many” become applicable? There is no absolute answer to that question, and under the principles of construction of restraints on trade previously discussed, the matter must be determined against the party relying on the restraint. If it is argued that such an interpretation makes the clause meaningless while another reading (perhaps 20-30%) might make more sense as far as Sun is concerned, it must be remembered that in construing these restrictions “nothing will be deemed a violation of such a restriction that is not in <em>plain disregard of its express words.” </em>(Emphasis supplied) <em>Great A. &amp; P. Tea Co. v. Bailey, </em>supra at 544. Sun must bear the consequences of the ambiguity it has created and can not rely on this Court to redraft its agreement in a way more favorable to it.</p>

I do not <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>•wish to indulge in problems of semantics by trying to define precisely what is a “drug store” or “proprietary medicine store.” To attempt such a definition would be pointless because the type of operation Sun, Sterling and other such companies run changes over time to meet new consumer wants and needs. To announce a definition based on type of product sold today (if a definition were to be written, only one on such a functional basis would make sense) would only produce confusion and uncertainty tomorrow as these companies altered the types of products sold and their general manner of merchandising to meet pressures of competition. In Ms testimony, Frank Adams, General Manager and Vice-President of Sun, recognized as much when he testified he would consider as a “drugstore item” anytMng the public accepted as sold at Sun and in which Sun’s sales were comparable to other sellers of the item. It is certainly conceivable that by expanding clothing, toy, appliance and other presently operated departments, Sun in the next few years could become what is today referred to as a “junior department store” and then claim protection under clause 8 against other “junior department stores” on the theory that Sun only operated a “drug” store.</p>

In <em>Sears, Roebuck and Co. v. Stiffel, </em><a href="/us/376/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="376 U.S. 225" data-case-ids="379713" data-case-paths="/us/376/0225-01">376 U.S. 225</a> (1964) and <em>Compco Corp. v.

It stated that restraints on tMs access were narrowly drawn and even then existed only because of important competing policy consideration (e.g., encouragement of invention). Even though the specific subjects of those cases were patent law and unfair competition, what is important in tMs context <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>is the emphasis on unfettered competition as the general rule with restraints being narrowly construed and existing only to promote specific policy objectives. In <em>Gulf Oil Corporation v. Mays, </em><a href="/citations/?q=401%20Pa.%20433" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="401 Pa. 433">401 Pa. 433</a>, 418, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.2d%20656" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="164 A.2d 656">164 A. 2d 656</a> (1960), we referred to “our basic anti-monopoly philosophy of unfettered competition in the market of goods and services.”</p>
    <p id="b527-3" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[183,691,1153,1592]]]'>Also, with shopping centers playing an increasingly large role in the commercial life of this country, it is important to note the different type of competition that exists in a “downtown” shopping area as compared to a shopping center. It is very rare for one individual or corporation to own a significant part of a “downtown” shopping area, and therefore there is no one party who can determine how many of a given type of store can exist. The success or failure of any one store will depend on the dollar “votes” cast by the consumer. In addition, it is very easy for a customer to get from one store to its competitor. In a shopping center the situation is quite different. The promoter of the center, acting under pressures from his major tenants, can restrict the number of a given type of store. Also, when a customer comes to a shopping center, it is generally by automobile, and while not terribly difficult, it is certainly inconvenient for that customer to go to another shopping center, which may be several miles away, in order to patronize a competitor of a store owner in the first center. The tendency of the customer is to go to one shopping center and complete all his business there. Thus, given that free and unfettered competition is our general policy, with respect to shopping centers the concept of competition <em>within </em>a given center is of central importance. Therefore, in order for a restrictive covenant as to a shopping center to be enforceable, it must be drawn with great particularity and precision.</p>

      <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>It is now necessary to construe clause 8 in the light of these principles. It seems clear from the testimony that the operation of a successful Sun or Sterling store involves two elements—the stocking of products the consumer desires and the merchandising of those products in a way that will attract customers. It also seems clear from the testimony that a revolution has occurred as concerns merchandising in what might be called the “health and beauty aid” field in the last few years. Apparently Sun, under pressure from its competitors, decided to institute a discount pricing policy and to emphasize the words “health and beauty aids.” Thus, the seemingly clear words “as a drug store or a proprietary medicine store” are actually quite ambiguous because the dynamics of retail merchandising make the “drug store” of 1961 obsolete. Given the rule of strict construction of restrictive covenants and the policy of favoring open competition, this Court should not grant a favored position to Sun. That is, we should not take an undefined (actually undefineable) and ambiguous term such as “drug store” as a basis for protecting Sun when that term changes meaning constantly. If Sun desires rights of this nature, it should have to specify them more particularly as this Court should not rewrite its agreement for it.</p>
