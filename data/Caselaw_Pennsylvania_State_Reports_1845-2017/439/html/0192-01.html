After questioning and an investigation by Pennsylvania authorities, an indictment was returned in Philadelphia County at April Sessions 1952. A trial was not had on this indictment, however, until March of 1959. At that trial appellee was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. No appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b256-7" data-blocks='[["BL_256.10",256,[181,1316,1158,861]]]'>In 1967 appellee filed a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, alleging that he was denied his right to appeal. Counsel was appointed, a hearing held and relief granted. Appellee then filed post-trial motions in which he alleged that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial and that an unconstitutionally obtained confession was admitted at his trial. The hearing court decided that his confession claim was not meritorious, but held that an evidentiary hearing was required to resolve the speedy trial claim. Believing that no procedure was available whereby evidence could be taken on post-trial motions, the hearing court granted appellee a new trial, at which time appellee could raise his speedy trial claim by way of a pre-trial motion to quash the indictment. The Commonwealth now appeals this ruling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Supreme Court has stated that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of a speedy trial “is an important safeguard to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial, to minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation and to limit the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself.” <em>United States v. Ewell, </em><a href="/us/383/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="383 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="6168414" data-case-paths="/us/383/0116-01">383 U.S. 116</a>, 120, <a href="/us/383/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="383 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="6168414" data-case-paths="/us/383/0116-01">86 S.
