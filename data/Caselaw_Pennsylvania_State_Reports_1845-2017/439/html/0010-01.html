Mrs. Kresovich was well acquainted with the route she had to travel in order to go from the church to her place of employment, since she regularly attended morning religious services at St. John’s prior to going to work, and she had been employed at Weis Market for approximately ten years prior to the day of the accident.</p>

When plaintiff and the man came face-to-face, she stepped aside to avoid him and thereby stepped into the hole. This Court held that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent as a matter of law, and pertinently said (page 282) : “. . . [S]he was too close to the hole when she stepped into it for either him or the children to have interfered with her seeing it at that time. It is evident she was then giving no heed to her own safety. When she stepped to one side and into the hole, she either saw it or she did not.

In <em>Knapp </em>the plaintiff testified that immediately before being distracted she looked down at the curb and saw the dangerous condition there. Despite this knowledge, she continued to walk, her attention distracted by the flow of traffic. Here, however, there is no such testimony. Plaintiff did, of course, know that the walk, in general, was in an abominable condition. After all, it had been in a state of disrepair for twenty to twenty-five years. But, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Knapp, </em>she did not first see the defect which caused her fall, and then fail to heed it. Bather, an outside peril kept her from seeing and avoiding the defect. In this respect, the instant case is exactly like <em>Pro v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>supra, in which the plain<a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>tiff “was fully aware of the very poor condition of the roadway,” but diverted her attention to avoid another danger. <a href="/pa/390/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="390 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1275659" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0437-01">390 Pa. at 440</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20920" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="135 A.2d 920">135 A. 2d at 921</a>.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[227,500,1155,701]]]'>In my view the majority is today unwisely and unnecessarily extending <em>Knapp, </em>and overruling <em>Pro, </em>by holding that plaintiffs who have a general knowledge of a defective sidewalk will be contributorily negligent, as a matter of law, if they trip, despite the fact that they reasonably did not see the offending defect before their fall. The result of such a rule of law will be to allow time to insulate a property owner from liability for his negligence. For the longer he allows defects to exist, the more people will know of the hazard, and, consequently, the more people will be held to have “seen” the danger and failed to heed it, and thus denied recovery.</p>

The majority’s holding today sets up a totally unrealistic and extremely high standard of conduct for the injured pedestrian, forgetting that the reasonable man “ ‘is not altogether devoid of human frailties.’ ” <em>Cerino v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/435/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="435 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1924363" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0355-01">435 Pa. 355</a>, 360, 362, <a href="/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20571" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="257 A.2d 571">257 A. 2d 571</a>, 573, 574 (1969) (dissenting opinion). And the majority continues to substitute its idea of due care for that of a jury’s, thereby further aggravating the unfair results of the defense of contributory negligence. A jury could very well have found that plaintiff was reasonably attempting to avoid colliding with another pedestrian. Certainly her “conduct was not so plainly and decisively negligent as to justify its being so characterized as a matter of law. As Mr. Justice Holmes remarked, ‘A choice may be mistaken and yet prudent.’ Kane v. Worchester Consolidated St. Ry., 1902, <a href="/mass/182/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="182 Mass. 201" data-case-ids="828928" data-case-paths="/mass/182/0201-01">182 Mass. 201</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20N.E.%2054" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="65 N.E. 54">65 N.E. 54</a>.” <em>Nicholson v.

The majority has forgotten what this Court said thirteen years ago <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>in <em>Pro </em>and in many other cases since: “This Court has frequently held that contributory negligence may be judicially determined only where it is so clear and unmistakable that there is no room for fair and reasonable persons to disagree as to its existence: [citing cases].” <a href="/pa/390/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="390 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1275659" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0437-01">390 Pa. at 441</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20920" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="135 A.2d 920">135 A. 2d at 922</a>.</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[137,672,1155,1304]]]'>I think that this Court should either return to a more realistic view of what constitutes contributory negligence as a matter of law, or abandon the doctrine that contributory negligence bars all recovery. Perhaps it is time that we adopt an approach allowing the jury to reduce the plaintiff’s verdict by the amount of his negligence. After all, the doctrine of contributory negligence as a total bar to recovery has been severely, and devastatingly, criticized. See, e.g., W. Prosser, Law of Torts 443-445 (3d Ed. 1964). We already recognize that juries do return compromise verdicts, and we have held that a grant of a new trial as to damages only is improper where there is evidence of such a verdict. See <em>Gagliano v. Ditzler, </em><a href="/pa/437/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="437 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1927843" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0230-01">437 Pa. 230</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20319" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="263 A.2d 319">263 A. 2d 319</a> (1970); O’Toole, “Comparative Negligence: The Pennsylvania Proposal,” <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Vill.%20L.%20Rev.%20474" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="2 Vill. L. Rev. 474">2 Vill. L. Rev. 474</a>, 475-76 (1957). I think it is time we formally recognize jury compromises and explicitly allow juries to reduce the verdict if the plaintiff was partially at fault. In this way a defendant whose negligence was so gross, blatant, and continuing as it was in the instant case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> would not be completely relieved of all liability simply because an unfortunate plaintiff failed to measure up to the extraordinary standard of care which the majority imposes.</p>
