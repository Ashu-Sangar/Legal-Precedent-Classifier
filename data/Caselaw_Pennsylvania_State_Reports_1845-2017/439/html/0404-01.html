The Grand Jury had begun sitting on April 8,1969, for the purpose of investigating organized crime and alleged corruption in the governmental departments and agencies of the City of Philadelphia.</p>

The questions concerned the involvement of certain City officials and persons allegedly connected with organized crime in real estate and urban redevelopment transactions. One of the questions related to an alleged bribery of a member,of Philadelphia’s City Council for a favor in connection with a land transaction in a redevelopment area.</p>
    <p id="b470-8" data-blocks='[["BL_470.10",470,[212,1548,1157,377]]]'>Appellant refused to answer the questions asked by the Grand Jury, asserting his Constitutional privilege against self-incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment. Later the same <em>day, </em>appellant reiterated his refusal before Judge Sloane in open court. Judge Sloane then affirmed appellant’s right to assert his privilege and to refuse to answer the questions.</p>
    <p id="b470-9" data-blocks='[["BL_470.11",470,[214,1936,1155,431]]]'>On January 30, 1970, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the District Attorney of Philadelphia filed a Petition for the grant of immunity under the Act of November 22, 1968, P. L. , 19 P.S. §640.1-6, together with a rule returnable on February 5, 1970 to show cause why appellant should not be compelled to testify under a Grant of Immunity.</p>

The Commonwealth presented evidence of the matter under immediate inquiry by the Grand Jury to show the need for appellant’s testimony. On February 19 and 20, 1970, the Court below heard extensive argument by counsel for appellant in opposition to the Commonwealth’s Petition for the Grant of Immunity.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[149,832,1150,375]]]'>On February 26, 1970, the Court below decreed that appellant must testify before the Investigating Grand Jury with the immunity provided under Act No. 333 of 1968.

The Commonwealth produced evidence of his refusal to answer questions asked by the Grand Jury. The Court then offered the appellant a chance to purge himself of any contempt by answering the questions. He refused to answer, asserting again that he had a Constitutional right to do so. The lower Court then ordered “that the respondent Mario Riccobene a/k/a Sonny Riccobene be forthwith committed to the County Prison and remain so committed for a period of six (6) months unless he shall sooner purge himself by testifying before the said Grand Jury, whereupon he shall be released.” From this Order, Riccobene has taken this appeal. This Order was undoubtedly a penalty or sentence of civil contempt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a>

      <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>On this appeal, Riccobene makes the same three basic contentions which he made before the Court below. He first asserts that the Immunity Statute is Unconstitutional and that he was thus still privileged to refuse to answer, because of his Constitutional privilege against self-incrimination (see infra). His second contention is that the petition for the grant of immunity was insufficient and inadequate and that immunity was improperly granted. Finally, he asserts that the lower Court improperly cited him for civil contempt when the only punishment provided by the Immunity Statute for a failure to answer is criminal contempt. We find no merit in <em>any </em>of these contentions.</p>

That, however, is not the posture in which this matter came before the court below. Judge Sloan® affirmed appellant’s light to assert his privilege and to refuse to answer the questions. The Attorney General and the District Attorney then sought to invoke Act No. 333 of 1968, and on February 26, 1970 the court decreed that appellant must testify before the grand jury with the immunity provided by that act. On March 6, 1970 appellant was asked the identical questions before the grand jury, and despite the granted immunity he persisted in his refusal to answer. The lower court then held a hearing to determine whether he should be held in contempt of court. The Commonwealth produced evidence of Ms refusal to answer the questions, and the court then offered Mm a chance to purge himself of any contempt by answering.

Therefore, when the legislature enters this field in which courts had no power previously, courts can only be deemed to have the specific power granted to them in the statute. Courts may not exercise their normal inherent powers in this situation because they could not exercise them in the absence of the statute and the legislation does not give them what they otherwise did not possess.

When a witness refuses to testify before a grand jury, notwithstanding statutory immunity or constitutional protection, and is brought before the court, directed to answer on proper notice, and refuses in open court to answer proper questions, a <em>criminal </em>contempt is committed in the presence of the court which may be punished summarily: <em>Commonwealth v. Butler, </em><a href="/pa-super/171/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="171 Pa. Super. 350" data-case-ids="475629" data-case-paths="/pa-super/171/0350-01">171 Pa.

    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[116,931,1156,765]]]'>Such are the consequences prescribed in Section 5 of the Act of November 22, 1968, P. L. , 19 P.S. §640.5, which states: “Any person who shall refuse or decline to testify or produce evidence of any other kind after being granted immunity and ordered by the court, shall be guilty of <em>criminal contempt, </em>and upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or to undergo imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, or both.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, under the specific statute granting immunity and under the case law in Pennsylvania, the proper sanction prescribed and mandated for the court to enforce its order in this situation was criminal contempt.</p>

He was asked the identical questions as previously before the grand jury, and, despite the granted immunity, he persisted in his refusal to answer. A hearing was held to determine whether he should be held in contempt of court, at which time the Commonwealth produced evidence of his refusal to answer the questions and the appellant was given an opportunity to purge himself of the contempt by answering. Appellant refused. The lower <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>court thereafter found appellant guilty of “civil contempt” and ordered him committed to the County Prison “for a period of six months unless he shall sooner purge himself before testifying before the said Grand Jury whereupon he shall be released.” This was error.</p>

For direct criminal contempt, committed in open court, punishment of imprisonment for a definite time is imposed, and commitment of contemnors until they purge themselves of the contempt is without authority of law and a nullity: <em>Rosenberg Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/186/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="186 Pa.

However, an order which confined a person for direct criminal contempt “for the period of one year or until the further order of the court” was valid as a confinement for the definite period of one year, since the additional language was considered as surplusage: <em>In Re: Donald MacDonald, <a href="/pa-super/110/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="110 Pa.

It in no way harmed the appellant and, at the same time, facilitated the possible enforcement of the court’s order that the appellant testify before the grand jury, which is for the benefit of the public and consistent with the purposes of criminal contempt. However, the mere finding of the appellant in “civil contempt” rather than criminal contempt in this case was of major consequence even though the sanction actually given was for criminal contempt. As a result, the appellant was thereby denied a right to trial by jury, as is now required under <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>
