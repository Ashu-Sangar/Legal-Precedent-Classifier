On October 21st, the condemnee filed a petition with the court to open, vacate and set aside its order of September 11th, and to grant a rehearing. This petition was denied on October 23rd. The instant appeal was filed on October 28th. It will be quashed.</p>

Hence, the time provided by the Code for taking the present appeal began to run on September 12th and the 45th day thereafter was October 26th. Since this day fell on a Sunday, the final day for taking the appeal was automatically extended to Monday, October 27th. The Statutory Construction Act, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Art.

An examination of the record discloses that the signature on the appeal form was verified by affidavit dated October 23, 1969, and sometime thereafter (the record does not disclose the date), the appeal form was mailed in Erie, addressed to the Prothonotary’s Office for the Western District of the Supreme Court in Pittsburgh. But, it was not received in the Prothonotary’s Office until October 28th. The appeal was docketed the very same day. This is the determinative day as to when the appeal <em>was filed. </em>Cf. <em>Malis v.
