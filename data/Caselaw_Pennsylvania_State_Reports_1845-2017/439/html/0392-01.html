The officers pursued the car and stopped it a block away. The driver of the automobile identified himself as William Price and produced a driver’s license and other identification. The passengers identified themselves as Jack Dussell and Frederick Zemaitatis. Price was unable to produce the owner’s registration card and a search of the body of the- car for such by the occupants proved fruitless. Price told the police that he was using the automobile with the permission of the owner whom he identified as a man named Mr. Lane—“a fellow he had met in a restaurant on Elmwood Avenue.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This explanation was not sufficient for the policemen and they then requested that the trunk be opened. Price took the key from the ignition and opened the trunk.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Therein, the police saw a set of golf clubs in the original retail packaging, together with other items. Having read in the newspaper that a Pro Shop in the police district had been recently burglarized and golf clubs were stolen, the <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>police reasoned that the articles in the trunk were the product of this crime. Thereupon the officers took the three men and the car to police headquarters “for further investigation.” The golf clubs and other items were seized by the police and subsequent investigation disclosed that at least some of the articles had been stolen in a burglary which occurred prior to the night involved. Dussell was arrested and convicted of participating in this burglary. At trial the seized items were admitted in evidence against him, over objection. It is now fundamental that if the property involved were the fruit of an unlawful search, the evidentiary use thereof was constitutionally impermissible and violated due process of law: <em>Mapp v.

L. 58, 75 P.S. §101 et seq.), i.e., proceeding through a red light and failing to have in his possession the owner’s automobile registration card, that this, without more, permitted a warrantless search of the automobile.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> But it does urge that, under the circumstances, the search was justified by the need to seize hidden weapons which might be used to assault the officers or effect an escape, as well as by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of a crime.
