        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is a will case which presents the oftentimes difficult question of when the principal of a testamentary trust vested, and, consequently, to whom it should be distributed. The lower Court decided that the interest of the widow of the life tenant was not vested and terminated at her death.\nThe testatrix, Louise Matthews, died on November 23,1945, leaving a will dated February 21, 1941. After certain minor bequests of personal effects and a provision for perpetual cemetery care, testatrix created two trusts, designated Trust No. 1 and Trust No. 2, each of which, was to be funded with an equal part of her residuary estate. We are here concerned primarily with the interpretation of Trust No. 2, which is contained in a very lengthy and at times confusing residuary paragraph of her will.\nParagraph Fourth of testatrix\u2019s will gave her residuary estate in trust, provided the trustee with very wide powers of investment, and also contained a subsequent and somewhat confusing spendthrift trust provision. It pertinently provided: \u201cFourth: ... (2) To divide the property which I have left in trust into two equal parts, designated as \u2018Trust No. 1\u2019, and \u2018Trust No. 2.\u2019\n\u201c(4) Trust No. 2. The trustee shall pay the income of Trust No. 2 to my brother William Matthews, in quarterly payments, during his lifetime. Upon the death of said William Matthews the corpus of Trust No. 2 shall become vested in Marguerite Hall Matthews wife of William Matthews, and William Matthews, Third, and Edward O. Matthews, children of William Matthews, share and share alike, but the corpus of Trust No. 2 shall not be distributed until Edward C. Matthews shall have reached the age of thirty years, nor in any case until the death of Marguerite Hall Matthews, during which time the trustee shall pay the income of Trust No. 2 to Marguerite Hall Matthews, William Matthews, Third, and Edward C. Matthews, in quarterly payments, share and share alike.\n\u201cIf either Marguerite Hall Matthews, William Matthews, Third, or Edward C. Matthews, shall die before my brother William Matthews [none did], the share of the deceased shall pass to the two surviving participants of this trust in equal shares, together with the right to receive the income therefrom should the time be prior to that at which Edward C. Matthews becomes thirty years of age or the death of Marguerite Hall Matthews.\n\u201cIf William Matthews, Third, and Edward C. Matthews die before their father, William Matthews [neither did], then the corpus of Trust No. 2 shall become vested in their children, if any, living at the time of the death of William Matthews, but that distribution of the corpus shall not take place until they reach the age of twenty-one years nor until the death of Marguerite Hall Matthews; the children to take by representation. . .\nWilUam Matthews, testatrix\u2019s brother, died in January 1966, survived by his widow, Marguerite Hall Matthews, and his two sons, William Matthews, Third, and Edward C. Matthews. Marguerite Hall Matthews died on June 25, 1968. She was survived by her two stepsons, William Matthews, Third, and Edward C. Matthews, who are still living. Edward C. Matthews is now past the age of thirty. At the audit of the trustee\u2019s second and final account, the executor of the will of Marguerite Hall Matthews made a claim for a one-third share of the balance of principal. This claim was refected by the Orphans\u2019 Court Division and her executor took this appeal.\n\u201cWe recently said in Carter Will, 435 Pa. 492, 257 A. 2d 843 (pages 496-497) : \u2018The law and the legal principles governing the interpretation of wills [are] well settled, but their application to poorly or ambiguously drawn.wills (especially to holographic wills and lengthy testamentary trusts) is often difficult. The pertinent principles may be thus briefly summarized: A testator\u2019s intent, unless unlawful, shall prevail; that intent shall be ascertained from a consideration of (a) all the language contained in his will, and (b) his scheme of distribution, and (c) the circumstances surrounding him at the time he made his will, and (d) the existing facts; and (e) canons of construction will be resorted to only if the language of the will is ambiguous or conflicting or the testator\u2019s intent is for any reason uncertain.

See also, Benedum Estate, 427 Pa. 408, 235 A. 2d 129.\u2019 \u201d Derham Will, 435 Pa. 590, 258 A. 2d 650.\nWhile some language in the will appears ambiguous or confusing, we cannot ignore the clear and definite language of this gift to Marguerite Hall Matthews. We are convinced that the testatrix gave and intended to give, upon the death of testatrix\u2019s brother William Matthews, to Marguerite Hall Matthews, the wife of her brother William Matthews, a vested interest in the corpus of Trust No. 2, with distribution of the corpus postponed until Edward C. Matthews reached thirty years of age or until the death of Marguerite Hall Matthews, the income to be paid in the meantime to her (and to William\u2019s two children) until the time for distribution of the corpus.\nDecree reversed; each party to pay own costs.\nitalics throughout, ours.\nIn the absence of a statute providing a different test: cf. Jaekel Estate, 424 Pa. 433, 227 A. 2d 851.",
