      {
        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nPlaintiff, Catherine Ford, filed a claim against A. E. Dick Company to recover compensation on behalf of herself and children for the death of her husband, James Ford, who, she alleged, died as the result of an accident, which occurred in the course of his employment with defendant. The latter\u2019s answer was that Ford had committed suicide. The referee\u2019s award in favor of claimant was approved by the board; on appeal, however, the Common Pleas of Schuylkill County sent the case back for further evidence. Again the referee found in favor of claimant, and the board approved; but the court below reversed and entered judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff has appealed to us.\nAll the evidence which we are about to recite was received without objection. Ford was a watchman for defendant company, his work requiring him to inspect and generally take care of the boilers at the company\u2019s coal mines during the night. He was found at his regular place of service early in the morning of October 4, 1921, by Frank Steibler, defendant\u2019s engineer, with his throat cut and traces of blood spread around the premises, indicating movements by the wounded man after his injury. Steibler, who was the first person to come in contact with Ford following the occurrence, at once asked him, \u201cWhat is the matter, are you sick?\u201d and received the reply, \u201cNo, I cut my throat.\u201d Steibler exclaimed, \u201cWhat?\u201d Whereupon Ford again said, \u201cI cut my throat,\u201d immediately adding, \u201cGo to hell.\u201d Steibler then inquired, \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d and the response was, \u201cWith a pocket knife.\u201d When asked by Steibler when this happened, Ford said, \u201cFifteen after eleven.\u201d\nWilliam Fox, foreman for defendant, was summoned by Steibler and arrived at about six o\u2019clock. Fox testified that one of Ford\u2019s sons, a boy, was there, who asked his father, \u201cPop, what happened to you?\u201d and he said, \u201cI got my throat cut.\u201d The boy inquired, \u201cWho done it?\u201d and the reply was \u201cMyself.\u201d Then the boy asked, \u201cWho told you to do it?\u201d and his father responded, \u201cNeil Ferry.\u201d This witness said that he had met Ford the night before and he seemed to be \u201cperfectly sober,\u201d \u201call right.\u201d Fox said he had made a search of the premises to discover any knife or other implement with which Ford could have cut himself, but found none. When asked about the state of mind Ford was in when he made the declarations in the witness\u2019s presence, he said: \u201cHe spoke straight enough to me; he could speak all right.\u201d Fox, like the witness Steibler, testified to blood being scattered about in several places; and, in addition to the above-quoted declaration on the part of deceased, he testified that he himself had asked Ford what happened to him, and the latter replied, \u201cI cut my throat.\u201d Then Fox asked, \u201cWliat did you blow the whistle for ?\u201d and the injured man said, \u201cFor help.\u201d\nAnother witness who testified to declarations by Ford was Dr. Wetterau, who was the first physician to attend the injured man. This witness said that he inquired of his patient how it happened and the reply was that he had cut himself with a knife. When asked by the doctor, \u201cWhy did you do that, Jerry?\u201d the witness testified that Ford \u201cclosed his lips and refused to answer anything further.\u201d This, the witness stated, was \u201call\u201d that Ford had said; he also stated that Fox was present on the occasion and in a position to hear everything that was said. It will be observed that the declarations of Ford reported by Dr. Wetterau .differ from those detailed by Fox, and that the latter, if he heard what deceased said to the doctor, made no reference to it in his testimony.\nThe testimony of the above three witnesses covers all the declarations made by deceased before his removal to the hospital. Several days after his injury, Ford\u2019s wife saw him at the hospital. At first he had nothing to say; but on her second visit, when asked, \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d she stated that he just lifted his hand and said, \u201cThere they come,\u201d and when asked \u201cHow many?\u201d replied, \u201cTwo.\u201d The witness testified that she thought her husband was sane at the time of these declarations; she said that, though Ford drank at times, he had not been indulging for some days before his death.\nBernard Carlin, a nephew of Ford, testified that he called at the hospital, and when he inquired of the patient, \u201cWho did it?\u201d Ford replied, \u201cI was tackled.\u201d\nJames Ford, a son of deceased, testified that he saw his father in the hospital and asked him, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d The reply was, \u201cNo.\u201d He then asked, \u201cWho did it?\u201d and the father said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d This witness expressed the opinion that the injured man was conscious and sane when he uttered the declarations just recited.\nDr. Gaughan, who attended deceased at the hospital, said that he arrived in a serious condition, \u201cwith the wind-pipe wide open.\u201d This witness stated, the patient was \u201cdelirious most of the time.\u201d\nTwo other witnesses were produced at the second hearing, and no objection has been made to their testimony. The first of these, Neil Ferry, said that he had known deceased for years and was on the most friendly terms with him; that he had never, under any circumstances, told him to cut his throat.\nSome point is made in the opinion of the court below about a statement in the testimony to the effect that there were two Neil Ferrys, and that the man who appeared might not have been the one meant by deceased; but it seems reasonably clear from all that was said on the subject of Neil Ferry that this was the one in question. There was nothing to show that the other Neil Ferry, if he existed, lived anywhere in the locality involved in this case, or who or what he was; whereas the testimony shows that the Neil Ferry who appeared was well known to all concerned, and everyone seemed to take it for granted at the hearing that this was the man in question.\nThe only remaining witness was a man named Thomas, who testified he had known Ford all his life; that he had met him going to work on the night before the fatality and observed nothing unusual about him. Thomas said he had talked with deceased that evening and found him \u201cjovial,\u201d \u201cin a good humor.\u201d\nSection 301 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1915, P. L. 736, provides \u201cthat no compensation shall be made when the injury or death be intentionally self-inflicted, but the burden of proof of such act shall be upon the employer.\u201d The compensation authorities believed and found that defendant had not borne this burden; while the court below believed and found to the contrary. Thus arises the point in the case.\nThere is a presumption against suicide or self-destruction on the part of a sane person, who came to his death under circumstances not explained (Continental Ins. Co. v. Delpeuch, 82 Pa. 225, 231, 235; Travellers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. McConkey, 127 U. S. 661, 667; Guardian Life Ins. Co. v. Hogan, 80 Ill. 35, 42; 22 C. J. 95; Chamberlayne, Modern Law of Evidence, section 1053), and this presumption is expressly recognized by the act before us when it casts on the employer the burden of proving the contrary state of affairs.\nIn Kelly v. Director General, 274 Pa. 470, 474, 475, we said: \u201cWhere a presumption in favor of a party entitles him to have his case submitted to [the triers of the facts] it cannot be withdrawn from them merely because ......other evidence [tends] to rebut that presumption [even though] the evidence to rebut the presumption may be very strong.\u201d There we called attention to the well-recognized fact that those who see and hear witnesses are best situated to judge the value of the evidence given by such witnesses, and said that, while \u201cthe force of the evidence may or may not be sufficient to convince them that the natural presumption arising from human instinct [has been] repelled, [yet,] before they can come to this conclusion, they must consider the circumstances under which the repelling witnesses testify.\u201d Finally, adding authorities, we said: \u201cWhether the presumption is rebutted is for [the triers of the facts] unless the evidence to the contrary is clear, positive, credible and either uncontradicted or so indisputable in weight and amount as to justify the court in holding that a verdict against it must be set aside as a matter of law.\u201d Here we have a guiding rule for the present case.\nOther guiding rules are stated in Vorbnoff v. Mesta Machine Co., 286 Pa. 199, 207, 209, as follows: \u201cThe compensation authorities are to decide all questions of fact and the courts are to decide those of law;...... mixed questions of fact and law......may be reviewed by the courts on their latter aspect alone.\u201d Again, as to findings of fact, the only question for the courts is, Does the record contain legally competent evidence to sustain them?\nDefendant contends that the only legally competent evidence on this record, as to how Ford came to his death, is that showing declarations by the deceased which tend to prove he committed suicide; that these particular statements are admissible as declarations against interest, while none of the declarations tending to show that deceased\u2019s wound was not intentionally self-inflicted have any legally sufficient grounds to support their admission in evidence.\nThere are several answers to the contentions just stated. To begin with, the presumption which carried plaintiff\u2019s case to the triers of the facts, though rebut-table, had the same probative force as direct evidence: Holzheimer v. Lit Bros., 262 Pa. 150, 152, 153, and other authorities supra. Next, the testimony of the witness Steibler, who first saw Ford after the accident, is competent as part of the res gestee (Smith v. Stoner, 243 Pa. 57, 63; Com. v. Puntario, 271 Pa. 501, 506), and his evidence does not show that deceased\u2019s wound was intentionally self-inflicted, it merely shows that he said, \u201cI cut my .throat,\u201d and told when it happened. Then, the physical facts attendant upon or accompanying the finding of deceased, as well as the evidence concerning the duties performed by him, etc., were for the consideration of the triers of facts, and properly may have had weight with them in reaching their mixed conclusion of fact and law that defendant did not prove deceased\u2019s wound to have been intentionally self-inflicted. But, since all the declarations of deceased were received without objection, both those given in evidence by plaintiff and by defendant, we must assume that both plaintiff and defendant elected so to try the case, and we have said that, under such circumstances, even evidence ordinarily incompetent may be considered (Poluski v. Glen Alden Coal Co., 286 Pa. 473, 476); though we have also said material findings cannot rest on that kind of evidence alone: McCauley v. Imperial W. Co., 261 Pa. 321, 326.\nHere, our review of the evidence shows several declarations by Ford which, though they fail plainly to say his wound was not intentional or self-inflicted, yet are consistent with the presumption to that effect, and in connection with these declarations it must be recognized that one often colloquially states, \u201cI cut myself,\u201d when the cut is purely accidental. It is possible that certain of Ford\u2019s declarations that are now sought to be used against him ought to be understood in this innocent sense. As we are now reviewing the work of a trial tribunal, \u2014 the compensation authorities, \u2014 which refused to find that Ford\u2019s wound was intentionally self-inflicted, whatever reasonable meaning the declarations now under consideration can be given which is consistent with the findings of that tribunal should be adopted by us; and this under the rule that a court of review must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who obtained the verdict on the facts. Then, again, the record now before us contains certain declarations plainly indicating that Ford\u2019s wound was not intentionally inflicted; since these declarations apparently were admitted by tacit agreement of both parties, they were not to be ignored, but were proper to be considered by the compensation authorities, with the declarations relied on by defendant and the other items of proof, \u2014 snch, for instance, as the significant fact that there was evidence that the knife was not found, after search, \u2014 in determining whether defendant had overcome the presumption against self-injury and proved suicide.\nIn Flucker v. Carnegie Steel Co., 263 Pa. 113, 119, we said that, \u201cwhen the dead body of an employee is found on the premises of his employer at or near his regular place of service, under circumstances fairly indicating an accidental death which probably occurred during the usual working hours of the deceased, the inference may fairly be drawn, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the employee was injured in the course of his employment.\u201d Had Ford been found at the place and hour disclosed by the evidence in this case, dead, with his throat cut, there Avould have been a presumption, under the authority just cited, that he had died an accidental death in the course of his employment. Suicide was suggested in the Flucker Case, and Ave said (p. 118) that the burden was on the employer to show this, adding that \u201cthe conclusion of fact as to the manner of [the employee\u2019s] death was for the compensation authorities to draAV, and, when made by the referee and affirmed by the board, it was not subject to reversal by the court below,\u201d citing Poluskiewicz v. Phila. & R. C. & I. Co., 257 Pa. 305. Of course, if the evidence relied on by the claimant was one-sided and conclusively showed a self-inflicted injury or suicide, the presumption to the contrary could not prevail; but that is not this case.\nHere, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the award in plaintiff\u2019s favor entirely lacks eAddential support ; no more can it be held that the evidence relied on by the other side is \u201cso clear, positive, credible, and uncontradicted,\u201d or so \u201cindisputable in weight\u201d as to justify the court below in holding that the employer had sustained the burden put on it, and, on this theory, to warrant it in setting aside the findings of the compensation authorities that defendant had not proved the injury which caused Ford\u2019s death to be intentionally self-inflicted, or in refusing to abide by the accompanying finding that deceased \u201cmet with an accidental injury while in the course of his employment, by which he sustained a lacerated larynx that contributed to his death,\u201d which second finding, under the circumstances of this case, logically followed the first one.\nThe court below, apparently under the mistaken impression that the law gave it the right to pass on the weight of .the evidence, and thus to change findings of fact made by the compensation authorities, and apparently entirely overlooking the presumptions in claimant\u2019s favor and the burden of proof resting on defendant, states in its opinion, \u201cWe think the testimony clearly shows decedent cut his own throat......[and] proves that the injury was intentionally self-inflicted......; it does not support the contrary finding.\u201d All of this indicates that the learned court below did precisely what, in Kuca v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., 268 Pa. 163, 165, and, later, in Vorbnoff v. Mesta Machine Co., 286 Pa. 199, 207-8, as well as in other cases there cited, we definitely decided the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act denied the courts power to do; that is to say, it weighed the evidence and changed the findings of fact made by the referee and the compensation board. In the VorbnofE Case, where the court below had made a like mistake, we said, after carefully examining the statute, \u201cThe court acted beyond its power......; [it] had no authority to weigh the evidence and thus change the findings and reverse the final action of the board.\u201d\nThe probable mental condition of Ford when he made the various declarations concerning his injury, and the opinions of the several witnesses in that regard, all have a bearing in this case, as to which the referee, who saw and heard the witnesses, was, above all others, in the best position to judge. It is difficult to understand how anyone, wounded as was Ford, \u2014 with his \u201cwind-pipe wide open\u201d and the great loss of blood which, according to the testimony, he suffered, \u2014 could have been able to make the many declarations attributed to him; but, be that as it may, it is 'not for us, any more than it was for the court below, to weigh the evidence, and thus decide the facts; the facts are for the compensation authorities to decide and the law is for the courts. When findings of fact have been made, only questions of law connected therewith can be ruled upon by the courts. The court below had the right and duty to apply the standard hereinbefore stated, and thus to pass on questions of law connected with the burden of proof, also to determine whether there was any evidence upon the record to support the findings of fact in claimant\u2019s favor, \u2014 particularly the two ultimate findings to which we have called attention, \u2014 or any legally competent evidence for that purpose; but it lacked power to go further and substitute its own findings according to what it conceived to be the weight of the evidence. It should be constantly remembered in administering the workmen\u2019s compensation law, not only that the authority of the courts must be found in the statute, but also that the statute evidences a contract: Anderson v. Carnegie Steel Co., 255 Pa. 33, 39; Liberato v. Royer, 281 Pa. 227, cf. 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 403, 408. In the present instance, the compensation authorities kept within their defined powers, under the act, but the court below did not; hence we are unable to sustain its disposition of the case.\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed; the award is reinstated and affirmed.\nMr. Justice Schaffer dissented.",

There is a presumption against suicide or self-destruction on the part of a sane person, who came to his death under circumstances not explained.\n2. Such presumption is recognized by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. J36, inasmuch as it provides \u201cthat no compensation shall be made when the injury or death be intentionally self-inflicted, but the burden of proof of such act shall be upon the employer.\u201d\n3. Where a presumption in favor of a party entitles him to have his case submitted to the triers of the facts, it cannot be withdrawn from them merely because other evidence tends to rebut the presumption, even though such evidence may be very strong.\n4. Whether the presumption is rebutted is for the triers of the facts unless the evidence to the contrary is clear, positive, credible and either uncontradicted or so indisputable in weight and amount as to justify the court in holding that a verdict against it must be set aside as a matter of law.\n5. The presumption which carries the plaintiff\u2019s case to the triers of fact, though rebuttable, has the same probative force as direct evidence.\n6. In workmen\u2019s compensation cases, the compensation authorities are to decide all questions of fact and the courts those of law, and mixed' questions of fact and law may be reviewed by the courts on their latter aspect only.\n1. In a workmen\u2019s compensation case, where suicide of the employee is set up as a defense, and there is in evidence declarations of the decedent tending to show that he committed suicide, and also declarations by him to the contrary effect, both being received without objection, it cannot be argued with reason that the declarations which tend to show suicide are admissible as declarations against interest, and should be considered, while the declarations to the contrary effect must be ignored.\n8. Where all the declarations have been received in evidence without objection, the court will assume that both plaintiff and defendant had elected so to try the case, inasmuch as, under the circumstances, even evidence ordinarily incompetent may be considered, in this class of cases, although material findings cannot rest on such evidence.\n9. Where the compensation authorities have refused to find that the deceased committed suicide, and their findings have been reversed by the common pleas, the appellate court must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the claimant, inasmuch as she has obtained the equivalent of a verdict on the facts.\n10. If some of the declarations, admitted by consent, tended to show that the wound of the deceased was not intentionally inflicted, such declarations could not be ignored by the compensation authorities, but were proper to be considered with the declarations relied on by defendant and other items of proof, in determining whether defendant had overcome the presumption against self-injury and proved suicide.\n11. Where the dead body of an employee is found on the premises of his employer at or near his regular place of service, under circumstances fairly indicating an accidental death, which probably occurred during the usual working hours of the deceased, the inference may fairly be drawn, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the employee was injured in the course of his employment.\n12. Where it cannot be said as matters of law that the award of the compensation authorities in claimant\u2019s favor entirely lacked evidential support and that the evidence relied upon by defendant was so clear, positive, credible or uneontradieted or so indisputable in weight as to justify the court in holding that the employer had sustained the burden put upon him, of showing suicide, the judgment of the court of common pleas in setting aside the award on the ground that this burden had been sustained will be reversed on appeal.\n13. The court of common pleas has no right to weigh the evidence and change the findings of fact made by the compensation authorities.\n14. Where the deceased has made conflicting declarations as to the cause of the wound which resulted in his death, some consistent with suicide and others not, his mental condition, when he made the various declarations, is for the consideration of the compensation authorities.\nMr. Justice Schaffer dissented.\nArgued November 29, 1926.\nBefore Moschzisker, C.
