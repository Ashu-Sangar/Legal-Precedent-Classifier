Accompanying the notes, and as the security on which his purchase was made, was the bond in suit in the following terms: “The Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York..... does hereby indemnify I. Sokoloff (hereinafter referred to as the obligee) against any and all loss by reason of the failure of the Commercial Acceptance Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the endorser), to make good within thirty days of maturity any default on the part of the maker of any of the promissory notes hereinafter described; it being understood a loss shall be deemed to have occurred upon the default in the payment of a note within thirty days after its maturity, and the amount of such loss shall be deemed to be the amount due on such <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>note; and it being further understood that all such notes were endorsed by the endorser and had been discounted by the obligee, all of such notes being made by Joseph L.

After date, I, we, or either of us promise to pay to Commercial Acceptance Corporation, or order, at the time or times as set forth in the schedule of payments in the margin hereof three thousand eight hundred fifty-nine dollars and 48/100 dollars with interest from maturity at the highest lawful rate, without defalcation, for value received” etc., signed Joseph L. Mazza and endorsed by the Commercial Acceptance Corporation. On the margin of the note was set out a schedule of twelve payments, the dates thereon corresponding to the due dates of the twelve notes appearing in the bond. Four installment payments on the note were made to plaintiff and default occurring in the payment of the others, this action was brought on the bond.</p>

The court below held that the mere form of the primary obligation which defendant undertook to make good to plaintiff was of no consequence as affecting defendant’s liability. In so deciding the court was correct. It is manifest that the payments intended to be secured by the bond were those set forth jn the pote <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>plaintiff received. Whether they were in the form of one note or twelve can make no' difference unless plaintiff received twelve other notes executed by the same maker, which he did not. The bond was drawn to plaintiff and if there were twelve other notes and they were negotiated elsewhere, this would not prejudice appellant, the bond not being one of general guaranty to any one who might hold the notes, but a personal covenant to plaintiff. Appellant’s counsel on this branch of his argument relies largely on Burdett v. Walsh, 126 N. E. Repr. 374, but there is an at once observable difference between that case and this one. There the bond was given to secure a note and no note was given. Here the note as given comported in every way with the liability assumed by the surety in amount, times of payment and other conditions.</p>

It was a surety for hire; not only was it paid for its assumption of liability, but in addition it received from the Acceptance Corporation ten per cent of the amount of all bonds which it executed for the former and on trial admitted that it had in its hands a sum of money in excess of the amount claimed in this action.</p>

The letter from the bank to defendant said that the plaintiff “I. Sokoloff has left with us a number of bonds executed by your company covering obligations of the Commercial Acceptance Corporation;......in the body of the bond you list certain notes. It appears to us, however, that the listing of the notes does not correspond with the actual obligations. For example, on your bond No. 1025580 you list six notes maturing at different intervals, whereas the obligation.....is in the form of one note only,......this note being payable in installments as scheduled on the side of the note. We assume it is your desire to cover the payment of the note as given.” To which defendant replied that the assumption was correct.

It set forth “it being understood that all such notes were endorsed by the endorser and had been discounted by the obligee, all of such notes being made by Joseph L. Mazza and or Commercial Acceptance Corporation.” These were not conditions precedent as argued by appellant, but representations of the genuineness of the paper which appellant cannot now deny. “The general rule is that sureties are estopped to deny the facts recited in the obligations signed by them, and this whether the recitals are true or false in fact.
