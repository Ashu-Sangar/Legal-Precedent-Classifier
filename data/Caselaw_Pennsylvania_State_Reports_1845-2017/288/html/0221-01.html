The court below denied the claim. Defendant was driving his touring car with the front seat crowded with his children. They would not behave and were pushing and jostling about in the machine. In an effort to correct the children, he took his hand off the steering wheel, and pushed one of them back. When he turned his attention to the highway immediately thereafter, appellant’s boy was in the way. Momentarily excited, he turned the car toward the curb, the fender striking the boy and badly injuring him; the car ran up on the pavement. The point of accident, while close to, was between two1 intersecting streets and immediately in front of the Robert Morris school. The school had just been dismissed and there were many children on the streets and sidewalks. It was broad daylight and there were no objects ahead to obscure the vision of the driver.</p>

    <p id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[121,1004,1154,803]]]'>Were there any circumstances appearing in the course of the driving to cause the operator, in the exercise of reasonable or ordinary care, to expect persons in his way or to anticipate their acts if not in the way? He was approaching a place where school children could be seen on the streets. He may not have known a school was located at this 'particular place; but the presence of children in large numbers in his immediate way, should have caused him to exercise the degree of care their presence required. Children are capricious, they act heedlessly without giving the slightest warning of their intentions. They dart here and there with the exuberance of youth. No law or court edict will stop them; we shall not attempt to do so, but rather warn those who may meet them to be on the lookout.</p>

In that case, no children in large numbers, leaving school, had congregated. There was nothing unusual to challenge attention or from which the driver might expect many acts of heedlessness within a designated place. But, where a condition as indicated by the facts in this case presents itself, it becomes his duty, in passing through or by these groups, to bring his car <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>under such control that it can be stopped on the shortest possible notice. It is when schools are being dismissed that the greatest danger is presented; it is as to that time and place we direct this opinion. Even then no responsibility may attach to the driver of a car, if, with the car under control, a child deliberately steps in front of it. It is a well known fact that a car cannot be stopped instantly, and traffic must move.</p>

Standing alone, this circumstance would not be proof of negligence, but the practice is inexcusable and to be highly condemned. The operator should be free in body, arms, hands, and mind to control his car. This case illustrates what may happen when the use of any of them is restricted by circumstances not connected with operating a cai’, especially by the driver’s own children, who are more likely to become unruly, as defendant’s children did. In an effort to correct them he took Ms hand from the steering wheel to push one back. Necessarily, his eyes followed his hand. It required only the space of time his eyes were off the road to cause the mischief and place the boy’s life in danger. It takes only the fraction of a second to get into trouble guiding an automobile. Where, in a place such as here described, a person driving on the public highway takes his hand off of the steering wheel and looks away from the road in front of him, and an accident immediately happens, the cause is refer<a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>able to this act, and is evidence of negligence, just as we have held a street car company negligent when the motorman operating the car looks away from the track and fails to observe objects on it.
