We sustained the act there in question on the express ground that “The business of insurance against loss by fire is, by reason of its magnitude, its importance to property owners, and the nature of the business, a proper subject for the exercise of the police power.” Many other authorities could be added to show that, in order to advance the public welfare, the protection of property owners, against both fraud and incompetency on the part of those with whom they must deal, is a consideration to bring a statute within the police power of the State, if those whose calling the act regulates are obviously important in number and the subject involved is one which calls for integrity, skill or competence; but in this connection it is necessary to mention only two cases. See, first, Engel v. O’Malley, <a href="/us/219/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="219 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="3653271" data-case-paths="/us/219/0128-01">219 U.

This provision that it shall be unlawful either to practice or offer to practice as an engineer without being duly licensed or exempted would, of course, subject to attack the validity of all contracts made in the course of such prohibited conduct, and the exemption of certain groups of persons from the necessity of registration is but a method of classification. That is to say, on one hand we have the general group, — including all persons except those exempted, — who must register under the act or be penalized for unlawfully pursuing the profession of engineering; and on the other hand we have several groups of persons who may practice that profession in our State without registering under the statute, and whose professional acts and contracts are all valid so long as they keep within the general law. Does this classification unwarrantably interfere with the equality of opportunity of “acquiring, possessing and protecting property” (section 1, article I, of our State Constitution), by pursuing one’s business or profession, guaranteed by the Constitution? Wherever such grouping as here involved is, on any substantial basis, a reasonable one, it is sustainable ; but where the grouping presents an unreasonable classification, the question arises as to its effect on the validity of the act in which it is found.</p>

As far as Pennsylvania engineers are concerned, such a classification may be, as argued by defendant, no breach of the federal Constitutional provision which guarantees to the citizens of each state the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states; but is it not a violation of the guarantee of equality of opportunity contained in the Constitution of Pennsylvania? While a temporary exemption from necessity of registration may be reasonable, such as granted to outside engineers actually practicing in Pennsylvania by paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 24 of the act, yet there is a grave question as to the legality of the permanent exemption granted by paragraph (a). It may be that paragraph (d), exempting employees of regularly registered engineers, is reasonable, on the theory that such employees are merely assisting duly registered practitioners. Likewise, the exemption in paragraph (e), of officers and employees of the federal government, may be justified, though not on the ground urged by defendants, that the State would have no right to interfere with such engineers while engaged in the business of the federal government; for the words of this exemption comprehend more than mere services for the United States, — they authorize such officers and employees “to engage in the practice of engineering,” and this general language may well be construed as meaning practice beyond their engagement with the federal government. Perhaps, however, this classification would be warrantable on the theory that the legislature might properly assume the federal government would employ none but qualified engineers. The same theory might sustain exemptions in favor of employees of the Commonwealth, contained <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>in paragraph (f); but for the final exemption, contained in paragraph (g), we can think of no conceivable justification.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[82,516,1165,1836]]]'>The exemption in question reads thus: “Officers and employees of a corporation engaged in interstate commerce as defined in the Act of Congress entitled ‘An act to regulate commerce/ approved February 4, 1887.” What reasonable grounds can there be for permitting officers and employees of corporations engaged in interstate commerce to practice the profession of engineering in Pennsylvania without registration, while requiring all officers and engineers of corporations not engaged in interstate commerce to be registered? It will be observed that this does not say that these officers and engineers are exempt merely while engaged in interstate commerce work; on the contrary, they are wholly exempt from registration, and may freely practice the profession of engineering in our State. Moreover, when we come to examine the Act of Congress referred to in the. exemption, we find that it does not cover all corporations engaged in interstate commerce, but only certain classes of them. Thus, in order to ascertain what the law of Pennsylvania is, we should be obliged to go to an act of Congress and read it into our own statute. True, in Com. v. Alderman, <a href="/pa/275/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="275 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1075628" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0483-01">275 Pa. 483</a>, we sustained another Pennsylvania act which required such a course. That, however, was under peculiar circumstances explained in our opinion, and the decision must be so confined. The exemption in hand is of doubtful validity on the ground last suggested, and, aside from that, it clearly makes an unwarranted and unjustifiable classification; this last conclusion leads to the question of the exemption’s effect upon the validity of the statute as a whole. In other words, with this exemption stricken out, may the remainder of the act still be upheld? This is the point referred to at an earlier stage of our opinion as “the ruling question in the case.”</p>

      <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>In considering the problem just put, it must be kept in mjnd that the present act has no provision such as is contained in the act passed upon in Bagley v. Cameron, <a href="/pa/282/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="282 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="1088385" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0084-01">282 Pa. 84</a>, 88, which stated explicitly that, in the event of any particular provision of the statute being unconstitutional, “the remaining provisions would have been enacted notwithstanding such judicial determination,” and were to stand just as though the part declared invalid had not been enacted. Even without such a provision, however, the law is that, wherever part of an act found to be unconstitutional can be severed from the rest of the statute without destroying its entirety of thought, such severance may be made and the act sustained, but where the severance would destroy the unity of thought, the whole act necessarily falls. This rule is expressed in Rothermel v. Meyerle, <a href="/pa/136/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="136 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="820027" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0250-01">136 Pa. 250</a>, 265, as follows: “If the part which is unconstitutional in its operation is independent of, and readily separable from, that which is constitutional, so the latter may stand by itself, as the reasonable and proper expression of the legislative will, it may be sustained as such; but if the part which is void is vital to the whole, or the other provisions are so dependent upon it, and so connected with it, that it may be presumed the legislature would not have passed one without the other, the whole statute is void.” See also Booth &amp; Flinn v. Miller, <a href="/pa/237/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="237 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="988993" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0297-01">237 Pa. 297</a>, 309. We cannot presume that the legislature would have passed the present act without the exemption contained in paragraph (g) of section 24, any more than we are warranted in thinking it would have passed the act even though all the numerous exemptions inserted therein had been omitted; hence, we must assume these exemptions to be inseparable expressions of the legislative will, and, as one, at least, of them is unconstitutional, the whole act falls.</p>

Thus far we have considered the act as: though it dealt with only a single subject, the profession of engineering; but, both in its title and throughout all of its provisions, this statute is written as treating of at least two subjects, first, “engineering,” and next, “land surveying.” As the act is drawn, the latter occupation is not treated as a mere subordinate branch of the former. The act constantly refers to “the profession <em>of </em>engineering,” and usually adds, immediately thereafter, “or <em>of </em>land surveying”; and thus, by using the conjunction “or” and repeating the preposition “of,” it conveys the idea of two professions. Furthermore, the act repeatedly refers to <em>“a </em>professional engineer” and to “a land surveyor,” and really treats them as separate subjects of legislation. Section 2 defines the term “professional engineer” in such a way as not to include a land surveyor; then, immediately afterward, it defines “land surveyor.” Had the legislature made the definition of engineer broad enough to include a land surveyor, as engaged in a minor branch of engineering, — and this, perhaps, it might have done, — there would have been no necessity for subsequently defining a land surveyor; the fact of the presence of the two definitions indicates in itself that the* first of them was not intended to include the second. Finally, when we look at section 17 of the act we find that one fee is charged to register an applicant as a land surveyor and a higher fee to register one <em>“both as </em>a professional engineer and as a land surveyor.” In short, the act in many ways, only some of which are here pointed out, deliberately treats a land surveyor as separate and distinct from what it calls a “professional engineer,” rather than as one following a minor branch of engineering. Thus it apparently sets up two subjects of legislation in one statute, which, of course, is forbidd; <em>a </em>by our Constitution.</p>

      <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>It is no answer to say, as defendants do, that a land surveyor can justifiably be regarded as a minor engineer, for the legislature here designedly chose to treat him otherwise. Again, it is no answer to argue that in several other instances learned professions have been divided into different branches by the legislature, and dealt with in a single bill; for when these instances are examined, it will be found that in each of them the legislature plainly treated a main subject as including minor branches. For example, the Act Mfay 5, 1915, P. L. 248, cited to us by defendants, is entitled, “An act regulating- the practice of veterinary medicine, <em>including </em>veterinary surgery and veterinary dentistry or any branch thereof,” etc.; and throughout this statute all the so-called branches are treated as part of the main subject. The Act of June 3, 1911, P. L. 639, relating to the medical profession, pursues the same course; it sets up a comprehensive definition and legislates accordingly. This latter act particularly provides, however, that certain practitioners, who might otherwise come within its general terms, are excluded therefrom, — for instance, dentists and osteopaths; and they are so treated because each is covered by a separate act relating to that particular profession or school of practice alone. We have construed this medical practitioners act to include, as coming within its general terms, a person practicing neuropathy (see Com. v. Seibert, <a href="/pa/262/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="262 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1044469" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0345-01">262 Pa. 345</a>), although such practitioners could, as well as the osteopaths, have been classified separately, had the legislature seen fit to pursue that course; but, had the law-makers ordained such a separate classification, they could not at the same time have included neuropaths in the general act without making it subject to the same fault as that in the present statute. It is only because the neuropaths were not classified separately that they came within the general medical statute. Of the numerous acts called to our attention regulating businesses and professions, the present statute is the only one which is not drawn in a <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>comprehensive way, so as to include all practitioners, major and minor, within a common statutory definition; though some of the statutes to which we refer may contain special regulations for designated grades of practitioners. Here the trouble is not that the instant act contains special regulations for “professional engineers” and others for “land surveyors,” but that, by the language employed, it deliberately treats, — both in the title and throughout all its provisions, — land surveyors as following an oceupátion separate and distinct from that of professional engineers, and thus, as we said before, it apparently sets up two subjects of legislation instead of one. While it has seemed wise to mention and discuss the point just made, so that it may be taken into consideration in the drawing of future legislation along the lines of the present act, yet we do not rule the case thereon.</p>

The title states, inter alia, that it is an act “imposing certain duties upon the Commonwealth and political subdivisions thereof in connection with public work”; and section 29 provides that it shall be “unlawful” for either the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions to engage in any construction work involving engineering “unless the plans, specifications and estimates have been approved by, and the construction supervised by, a registered professional engineer.” It is a grave question whether this provision can be held to be merely subordinate to the main thought of regulating the practice of engineering, and whether it does not, as contended by plaintiff, constitute a third and separate subject of legislation, namely, the regulation of the lawfulness of work, and, incidentally, of contracts, connected with public improvements. We shall not, however, rule the case on the effect of the presence in the act of section 29, though, for the reason stated at the end of the preceding paragraph of this opinion, it seems proper to call attention to the point in hand.
