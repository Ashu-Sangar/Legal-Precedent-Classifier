Thus the time for taking an appeal from a decision in such preliminary proceeding is definitely limited to fifteen days. The act then further provides that “a failure to appeal within the time specified will be deemed a waiver of all objections to jurisdiction over the defendant personally.” This clearly prohibits the raising of questions as. to jurisdiction of the person at any time thereafter; but it has no such effect where jurisdiction of the subject-matter is the issue involved. The right to appeal directly and <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>preliminarily is lost after fifteen days, whether jurisdiction of person or of subject-matter be the question, but, under the act, failure to appeal creates a waiver only in regard to the former; for jurisdiction of the subject-matter cannot be conferred by estoppel. So far as the latter character of jurisdiction is concerned, after the expiration of the fifteen days, the situation is exactly as it was before the Act of 1925, and the interlocutory order of the court below, except as to jurisdiction of the person, may be considered on appeal after final judgment on the merits.

That the Eiverside Company, during its active life and at the date of its dissolution, was registered in Pennsylvania and doing business here is conceded; and, after the surrender of its charter, all the business that remained, — and there was the business of settlement and liquidation, — was carried on within this State. Therefore, even if the case be regarded as to some extent affecting corporate affairs, there is no real question of the jurisdiction of our courts.</p>
    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[73,931,1154,588]]]'>The question is, Should our courts exercise their jurisdiction under the circumstances of the present case? There is, as defendants argue, a well established principle that courts will not interfere in the internal management of foreign corporations, but, as is pointed out in the passage above quoted, this principle is based on a rule of discretion; it rests, not on an actual lack of jurisdiction, but rather on policy which dictates a recognition of the want of power to enforce decrees made in such proceedings where, under the facts of any particular case, the power is lacking.</p>

The present case is one with which the court below could properly deal. The Eiverside Company, when a going concern, carried on no business and owned no property in West Virginia; it maintained its principal office and was doing business in Pennsylvania; all of the individual defendants resided here until shortly before <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>the filing of the bill, when one of them removed to Oklahoma; there could be no difficulty in enforcing the decree entered by the court below. The court did not attempt to exercise control over the management of the company; it ordered an accounting from defendants within its jurisdiction, and made no effort to pass upon the rights of stockholders, directors, creditors, or the corporation itself in the assets under defendants’ control.</p>

The bill prayed for an accounting and distribution, but the court below disregarded the latter prayer, and made no order whatever concerning payments or distribution. It may be that, under the before-quoted statute, the assets remain the property of the corporation until their distribution is formally ordered, and that the directors, in administering such assets, continue to represent the corporation ; further, that, on this theory, no disbursement of funds could be ordered unless the corporation were joined as a party; or it may be that the assets should be viewed as belonging to the shareholders and that the directors ought to be looked upon only as trustees for the latter. But whatever way these points may ultimately be determined, — if it should prove necessary to decide them at all, — for the present only an accounting has been ordered, which adjudicates nothing more than the obligation of' the individual defendants to account. However classed, these defendants are the liquidators of the corporation, and since it can move only through them, they, for purposes of performing the acts necessary to its liquidation, are in effect the corporation itself. Therefore, nothing would be gained by joining this purely artificial body — which is alive only to facilitate its liquidation — in the order to account, when its officers, who must do the accounting, are already in court; and we can conceive of no way in which rights of the individual defendants may possibly be prejudiced by the absence of the corporation’s name from the record at this time.</p>

      <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>Appellants do not deny receipt of the assets alleged in the bill; in addition to the strictly legal defenses already discussed, they resist the order appealed from largely on the ground that circumstances arising out of certain tax claims by the federal government make it inexpedient for them to state an account at the present moment. Defendants claim they have something less than $38,000 belonging to their company, and that, if they now disclose these assets, the government will claim the entire balance on hand; they express the hope that a compromise may be effected and the tax claims so reduced as to leave something for distribution to shareholders of the company. This is not a particularly appealing plea to set before a court. Then, again, more than seven years have elapsed since the legal dissolution of the Eiverside Company, and defendants occupy a fiduciary position in regard to its assets; plaintiff is entitled to know how they have been administered. The existence of these outstanding tax claims cannot justify the refusal of an accounting; no proceedings appear to have been instituted looking toward their hoped-for compromise, and there seems to be no certainty that any will be taken. Under such circumstances an accounting might be withheld indefinitely if the contentions of defendants were sustained. Finally, on this branch of the case, should the claims in question prevail, it would appear from the present record that there will be no balance to distribute, and under such circumstances the question of the power of the court below to order distribution would never arise.</p>

We repeat, that, if the case necessarily involved an order of payment and distribution, the presence of the corporation as a party might be essential; but as the case stands, with these appellants in control of the shell of the corporation, the <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>stockholders may properly be treated as the interested parties, at least to obtain an accounting; their interest is much more immediate here than it would be in the case of a going or live concern.

Here, if the corporation were to act, it would have to do so through these very defendants. To call upon the corporation to proceed against the directors on a charge of fraud, and for an accounting, would be to demand that these defendants proceed against themselves; that such a demand would be vain is obvious.
