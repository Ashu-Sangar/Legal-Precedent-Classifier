Later it applied for and obtained from the defendant another bond, in the sum of $10,000, in favor of the Commonwealth, insuring the latter that its deposits with the bank would be repaid. The Commonwealth had nothing to do with the application for the latter bond; the bank alone made it, and stipulated therein to indemnify defendant and save it harmless from all loss which could arise by reason thereof. Defendant’s business is the furnishing of surety bonds, upon the payment of stipu<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>lated premiums, and, in the case of each of those above specified, it received from the bank the premium required.</p>
    <p id="AHQH" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[102,510,1154,907]]]'>Through the dishonesty of certain of its employees, the bank suffered a loss far in excess of the $50,000 fidelity bond. By reason thereof, it became insolvent and it and its assets were taken over by the Secretary of Banking of the Commonwealth, as provided by section 21 of the Banking Act of June 15, 1923, P. L. 809, 819. Defendant thereupon paid to the Commonwealth $10,000, the amount of its deposit with the bank, and the then state treasurer gave to defendant an assignment of what had been the Commonwealth’s claim against the bank, by reason of the deposit. It is at least gravely doubtful whether the state treasurer had any legal right to make the assignment, but we need not consider the matter, since defendant expressly admits, in its brief, that the fact “is immaterial and has no effect upon the right of set-off” allowed by the court below in this case.</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[102,1442,1153,913]],["BL_326.1",326,[282,350,1149,97]]]'>Upon demand made, defendant promised to pay the secretary of banking the amount of the $50,000 fidelity bond, but failed to do it, whereupon he brought the present suit. Defendant then paid $40,000, and claimed that it was entitled to a set-off, to the extent of the $10,-000 it had paid to the Commonwealth, alleging that there were “sufficient funds in the hands of the plaintiff [the Secretary of Banking] to pay the claim of the Commonwealth in full.” There was no averment that, on settlement of plaintiff’s account, as required by the statute, there would, after paying the necessary expenses of the proceedings, still be enough on hand to repay the amount paid by defendant to the Commonwealth. The parties agreed that “no question of fact exists which calls for a trial by jury as respects said set-off,” and asked the court below, on the record as then made up, to “enter a final judgment” in favor of one of the parties. <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>This it did by entering judgment for defendant, and therefrom plaintiff prosecuted the present appeal.</p>

    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[278,784,1151,1069]]]'>As to the first of these contentions, it is sufficient to say it probably would not have been made, had the two bonds and the two contentions been treated as separate and distinct each from the other, as in fact and law they were. The covenant of indemnity set forth in the application, was an obligation of the bank and not of the Commonwealth, and a recovery thereon would have resulted only in a general judgment against the bank. Such a judgment would not have affected, however, the preference given to depositors by section 28 of the Act of May 13, 1876, P. L. 161, 170, since it would not have been a judgment for a deposit, but for a breach of covenant. It needs no argument to show that, as well before as after such a judgment, defendant could not use it as a set-off, since it cannot be known, until distribution is ordered of the funds in the hands of the secretary, in the way and at the time prescribed by the statute, whether or not there will be anything applicable on account of defendant’s claim under the covenant of indemnity. Certainly this record discloses nothing on the point.</p>

For the reason already suggested, we do not propose to decide that question at this time. We do not know, by this record, what will be the net balance for distribution after the secretary’s account has been filed, and the just debits and credits settled by the court,— whether it will be as much, or more, or less than the $10,000 sought to be set off. In view of the elaborate <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>statutory provisions regarding the collection and disbursement of the assets of such banks, as set forth in the Banking Act of 1923, supra, a set-off cannot be allowed, as against a claim admittedly payable to the secretary, if the alleged right of set-off arises in connection with the cause of the failure, or subsequent thereto. Fisher, Commissioner of Banking, v. Davis, <a href="/pa/278/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="278 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1080579" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0129-01">278 Pa. 129</a>, does not decide it could be allowed under such circumstances. There the set-off existed long before the failure, and we simply decided that only the net balance due, at the time of the failure, could be claimed by the commissioner. Here, however, defendant’s right arose subsequent to the failure, and hence its claim must be presented at the time and in the way prescribed by the statute, exactly as the Commonwealth would have had to present it if the amount of the deposit was still due to it. By payment to the Commonwealth, defendant did not acquire, either expressly or by implication, a greater or a higher right than the Commonwealth herself had.</p>

All the covenants and agreements set forth in that application are the covenants and agreements of the bank only. The provisions for indemnification and subrogation appearing therein are the bank’s and not the Commonwealth’s; the subrogation growing thereout must, therefore, be of the bank’s rights or remedies against third parties, to wit, the wrongdoers who caused the loss. So, also, the clause in the application which stipulated that defendant should “have every right and remedy which the individual surety acting without compensation would have,” can only refer to the rights and remedies of the bank. Whether defendant acquired any right of subrogation, except to the extent specifically provided for in the application, is the real question to be decided on the adjudication of the secretary’s account.</p>

Here defendant was paid a premium on $60,000 of insurance, and seeks, through subrogation, to escape liability beyond $50,000, though the actual loss exceeded twice that amount. According to defendant’s theory, had the Commonwealth’s deposit been $50,000, and the fidelity bond remained $50,000, then defendant would have received a premium for $100,000 of insurance and could never have been ultimately liable in excess of $50,000, unless the failure of the bank had been practically total, leaving little or nothing for the preferred depositors. The difference between this assumed case and the present is one of degree only, and not of kind. Surely neither of the parties could have thought, when the second bond of $10,000 was given, that payment under it would defeat pro tanto a claim on the earlier bond of $50,000, should the bank be looted by the employees whose fidelity was insured: see Annotated Cases 1917 B.? page 1137, note; Annotated Cases 1918 A, page 834, note.</p>
