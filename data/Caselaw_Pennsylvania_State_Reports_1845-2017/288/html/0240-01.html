It is there said: “The contention comes to this, so long as a foreign corporation engages in interstate commerce only it is immune from the service of process under the laws of the state in which it is carrying on such business. This is...... a novel proposition, and we are unable to find a decision to support it, nor has one been called to óur attention.” Such corporations are within the state, receiving the protection of its laws.</p>

The phrase “shall have an agency,” in the Act of 1851, supra, has been interpreted by this court as referring to branch offices or agencies for the transaction of the corporation’s business: Parke v. The Commonwealth Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/44/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="44 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="484262" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0422-01">44 Pa. 422</a>.

He communicated the shipper’s wish to the operating department. The shipper could have the connecting carrier do this just as well. As agent he might be helpful in ascertaining whether the shipment had reached defendant’s lines, but the connecting carrier could also do this. He had no authority to settle any claims either <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>for or against the company. Once a year he received a check from the shipper in adjustment of freight charges, and once in three years he delivered to a claimant a check for goods lost or injured.

The argument has force. This court has been careful to distinguish between acts which are in aid of a main purpose, and those necessary to its existence. The former are collateral or incidental, while the latter are direct. A railroad cannot exist as such unless it carries freight and passengers, but it is not necessary to establish soliciting agencies to secure either. That is self-evident; agencies to solicit, multiplied as competition increased. They are used as information or advertising bureaus. True, contracts may follow such acts, but these contracts executed constitute the business. Mr. Justice Sadler, in Gengenback v. Willow Grove Park Co., supra, states the law as to domestic corporations, and the Chief Justice, in Eline v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., supra, as to foreign corporations. Solicitation of business is not “doing business” within the Act of 1851. The minor acts, related above, of business courtesy not compulsory do not affect the main question; nor do the cases of Lobb v. Pennsylvania Cement Co., <a href="/pa/285/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="285 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1095128" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0045-01">285 Pa. 45</a>, or Kraus v.

    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[98,455,1159,1888]]]'>Considering the case from the viewpoint of the federal authorities, if we follow the Green Case, supra, we would hold that the acts do not measure up to “doing business.” There the railroad was all outside of the state, and, as an incident to its business, freight and passenger traffic was solicited in other parts of the country. For this purpose an agent was employed who had an office in that territory, whose business was to secure passengers and freight. He employed clerks and traveling agents who sold no tickets, and received no payment for transportation of freight. Instead, the agent procured from a connecting railroad an order which gave to the customer the right to receive a ticket over his principal’s line; and, as to freight, in some cases bills of lading covering the principal’s line were issued by the first carrier to the shipper. The court there held that, although the defendant was doing considerable business of a certain kind, the business shown was nothing more than that of solicitation, not sufficient to constitute ‘doing business’ in the sense that liability to service is incurred: Rosenberg Co. v. Curtis Brown Co., <a href="/us/260/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="260 U.S. 516" data-case-ids="11926296" data-case-paths="/us/260/0516-01">260 U. S. 516</a>; Davis v.

The court there said: “Here was a continuous course of business in the solicitation of orders which were sent to another state, in response to which the machines......were delivered in Kentucky. They might receive payment in money, checks or drafts. They might take notes in settlement payable in Kentucky banks.” This was held to be a course of business, not a single transaction. The court also said: “On the other hand, the mere solicitation of business, without more, would not be ‘doing business.’ ”</p>
