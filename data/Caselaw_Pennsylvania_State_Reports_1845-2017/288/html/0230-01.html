The contract of sale was made when we were actively engaged in war, and after the announcement by the government of the prices on coal.

They are not included within the constitutional prohibition which prevents states from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts, but equally with the states they are prohibited from depriving persons or corporations of property without due process of law.” Congress may impair contracts only where the act has a direct relation to some enabling power in the Constitution.

Had the Government taken the coal the last clause of the 5th Amendment would apply, but the voluntary sale by a citizen to a citizen is not a taking for public purposes within the 5th Amendment.

The government must preserve its republican form under that document, and it would indeed be strange that one of its provisions, relating to its individual members, should so overpower the war and other powers, as to cause, perhaps, the entire instrument, as well as the Nation, to fall. This right, claimed as being so all-powerful, is one appertaining solely to individuals, and, in this connection, a small part of the great whole that makes up the government and organized society. But we are relieved of the necessity of going outside of the Constitution to find, in the right to exist as a Nation, the power to enact such laws.

Such interrelated matters in time of war may extend to the regulation of the sale and distribution of food and fuel supplies which, under normal conditions, were free to commerce in its usual channels.

In two cases arising in different jurisdictions, section 25 of the Lever Act has been held constitutional: Lajoie v. Milliken, supra; Ford v. United States, <a href="/f/281/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="281 F. 298" data-case-ids="5721671" data-case-paths="/f/281/0298-01">281 Fed. 298</a> (reversed in the Supreme Court on other grounds). Consequently in view of the authorities considered above, and upon principle, we conclude that the Lever Act was within the implied powers of Congress.</p>
    <p id="b259-3" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[116,1402,1155,262]]]'>We do not here attempt to define or limit the “war power” of Congress and only decide that the sections of the Lever Act, under consideration, may be upheld under the war powers, having a direct relation thereto, to which contracts made during the war are subject.</p>

It is pointed out that, had the United States commandeered this coal, his compensation would be measured under the Fifth Amendment by just compensation, and that, as between individuals, the same rule should apply.</p>

It has been held that the Fifth Amendment imposes on the national power the same limitation as that placed on the powers of the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. The right to regulate the prices of <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>commodities under the war power may to some extent, be likened to the regulation of public utilities under the police power. We may assume for this discussion they have this point in common, that property shall not be taken without due process of law. Regulation is due process (White’s App., <a href="/pa/287/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="287 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1099652" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0259-01">287 Pa. 259</a>), but regulation that is unreasonable, or that in certain situations fixes prices at less than a reasonable return is not due process but is confiscation under the “war power” just as unfair return is confiscation under the police power. The United States can no more so regulate acting through the war power than the State can so regulate through the police power. Under the 5th Amendment, the United States may, through the war power, fix prices as a State may;' do so under the police power. Assuming then, in the instant case, that the war power is subject to the due process clause, what must be the measure of compensation?</p>
    <p id="b260-4" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[274,1289,1154,1073]],["BL_261.1",261,[99,353,1152,97]]]'>In Newton Coal Co. v. Director General, <a href="/pa/281/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="281 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1087001" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0074-01">supra, p. 85</a>, where the United States was concerned, we said “the exercise of the war power is subject to the Fifth Amendment, except in respect to property destroyed by military operation.” Just compensation must be made for private property taken for war purposes. The ascertainment of compensation is a judicial function. In claims against the federal Government “where private property is taken for public use......market...... price is just compensation”: Davis v. Newton Coal Co., <a href="/us/267/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="267 U.S. 292" data-case-ids="6139966" data-case-paths="/us/267/0292-01">267 U. S. 292</a>, 301. It has been held, dealing with the charges of profiteering during the war, that reasonable profit or “just compensation” would be the market price. See cases cited in United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., <a href="/us/255/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="255 U.S. 81" data-case-ids="341573" data-case-paths="/us/255/0081-01">255 U. S. 81</a>, 90, 91. There may be cogent reasons why market prices should apply to such cases, but the attempt to set up war time inflated markets of a commodity easily susceptible to such influence should not control or be accepted as the standard. Market price is the common law rule when the value may be easily and <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>fairly accurately ascertained. It is based on stable values which do not exist during war.</p>
    <p id="b261-3" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[98,462,1152,535]]]'>Fair return is the rule applicable to public utilities. No fixed standard can be called fair for commodities such as coal where a monopoly in its trade, in the course of things, cannot exist. What might be a fair return to coal mine “A” would be unfair for “B.” A uniform price could not always be made to apply equitably throughout even one small district. Cost plus a reasonable profit, also suggested as the correct measure of compensation, is not a dependable rule: Blake v. United States, <a href="/f/275/0861-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="275 F. 861" data-case-ids="3586856" data-case-paths="/f/275/0861-01">275 Fed. 861</a>, 867.</p>
    <p id="b261-4" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[95,1009,1155,910]]]'>What the plaintiff must show, at least when he invokes the due process clause, is that the President’s order is unreasonable. This may involve considerations which do not enter into cost plus, fair return or market value. But whether within or without the rule of market value, fair return, cost plus, or reasonable order, nowhere in the pleadings or proofs is it asserted or claimed that the government price violated any of them. There is not a word of evidence fixing the price or value of any of them though all this could easily have been shown. Appellant’s counsel urges, however, that without evidence, we should accept the price fixed by the contract as market price, or just compensation, or the equal of the other rules affecting compensation. The terms of an isolated contract without more do not fix nor are they evidence of market price, fair return, cost plus, or a reasonable price.</p>
    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[94,1932,1151,205]]]'>That the purchaser agreed to the price is. not material. When his attention was called to the government order, payment was refused except under the fuel administrator’s price. The unanswered question still remains.</p>
