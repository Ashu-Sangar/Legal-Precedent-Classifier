[thereof] <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>was compensatory damages and $5,000 was punitive damages.” It is the rule in Pennsylvania that an award of exemplary damages must bear a reasonable proportion to the award of actual damages. In Rider v. York Haven W. &amp; P. Co., <a href="/pa/251/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="251 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1019742" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0018-01">251 Pa. 18</a>, 26, 27, this court said: “In the present case the jury in a separate item found the compensatory damages sustained by the plaintiff to be $1,000.00, to which sum was added $2,700.00 for punitive damages, making the total verdict $3,700.00. We know of no case in our own State where punitive damages were allowed in almost treble the amount of the actual damage sustained......It is difficult, if not impossible, to lay down any definite rule as to the amount of punitive damages which may be allowed under the facts of a particular case. However this may be, we quite agree with the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Kentucky in Buford v. Hopewell, <a href="/ky/140/0666-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="140 Ky. 666" data-case-ids="4398319" data-case-paths="/ky/140/0666-01">140 Ky. 666</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=131%20S.W.%20502" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="131 S.W. 502">131 S.

The learned trial judge evidently entertained the same view, but felt constrained to sustain the verdict upon the theory that the testimony was sufficient to warrant a finding that the plaintiff had been actually damaged in an amount much larger than the jury found. We cannot regard this as a sufficient reason for approving an award of punitive damages so disproportionate to the amount of compensatory damages allowed.</p>

    <p id="b543-4" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[72,949,1155,1130]]]'>Appellant contends, however, that, since no division of the $6,000 awarded plaintiff appears in the record, aside from the above-quoted excerpt from the opinion of the court below, this court lacks official knowledge that the jury made such a division; to this we cannot agree. It appears that the jury did not hand in a written verdict, but announced its award orally; and the only notation of this found upon the record is a mere memorandum to the effect that the jury rendered its verdict in favor of plaintiff for $6,000. No effort appears to have been made to state verbatim the terms in which the verdict was rendered. Moreover, counsel for appellant does not question the correctness of the judicial statement made by the court below, that the foreman of the jury, “in delivering the verdict,” divided the damages in the manner already set forth. This is something more than what appellee calls the report of a mere colloquy between the court and jury; it is the only statement in the printed record of what actually occurred when the verdict was rendered, and, being unchallenged, we must accept it as a verity.</p>

In passing on the present verdict, the court below acted under a misapprehension regarding the law of Pennsylvania, as is evidenced in its opinion by the judge presiding, wherein he said, “It is not the duty of the court to interfere with the decision of the jury as embodied in the verdict.” Here, with the knowledge before it that the jurors had agreed upon and awarded exemplary damages in five times the amount of the actual damages fixed by them, it was the duty of the court either to reduce the exemplary damages (by an order affording plaintiff the privilege of accepting the reduction or a new trial) or to grant a new trial.</p>
