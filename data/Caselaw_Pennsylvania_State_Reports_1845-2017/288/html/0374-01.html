L. 194. For the defense it was urged that the name so <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>written in connection with these words was merely explanatory of the nature of the instrument and imposed no personal liability. The trial judge, being of that opinion, granted a compulsory nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to take off; hence, this appeal by plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[283,683,1153,1730]],["BL_399.1",399,[99,352,1152,423]]]'>In our opinion such refusal was right. The words “credit the drawer” are familiar in commercial and banking transactions and signify that the note is for the maker’s accommodation and that the proceeds thereof are his, notwithstanding it is drawn payable to another. It appears on the face of the note that Raesly was treasurer for the drawer, and, the fact that he signed his name so as to indicate the nature of the paper and its actual owner, imposed no personal liability. The same question was before this court in Temple v. Baker, <a href="/pa/125/0634-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="125 Pa. 634" data-case-ids="563996" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0634-01">125 Pa. 634</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20L.R.A.%20709" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 L.R.A. 709">3 L. R. A. 709</a>, where the late Justice Williams, speaking for the court, in a carefully considered opinion, holds that “The words, ‘credit the drawer,’ imply no promise or undertaking on the part of him who uses them, but are a direction, to all persons to whom the note may be presented, to treat with the drawer as the owner, notwithstanding the apparent title of the endorsee.” See also 7 Cyc. p. 806, note. Appellant, while not contesting the rule, contends it was changed by the Negotiable Instruments Law and cites section 64 thereof, inter alia, as follows: “Where a person, not otherwise a party to an instrument, places thereon his signature in blank before delivery, he is liable as endorser......” This must be read, however, in connection with section 63, which says: “A person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer or acceptor, is deemed to be an endorser, unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to be found in some other capacity.” In view of our decision in Temple v. Baker, Supra, the words, “credit the drawer,” above Raesly’s signature, Clearly are appropriate words to indicate his intention <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>to certify the character and ownership of the note and not to become an endorser. Furthermore, the president of the drawer, intending to become an endorser, signed his name on the back of the note; in view of which, it is highly probable that Raesly would have done likewise had he intended to assume personal liability. Of course an endorsement, while usually written on the back of a note, may be written upon its face.</p>
