Parker, who at that time was engaged in the storage business. Parker in turn arranged with plaintiff to assist in executing the contract. While they were so engaged, defendant visited Independence Hall and was informed by two of the persons in charge of the exhibit, neither of whom possessed experience in the restoration of oil paintings, that in their opinion the work was not being properly executed. Defendant knew Parker, in a vague way, as having a storage warehouse, and testified he was not acquainted with plaintiff, and had never heard of him, but was advised “by somebody who knew him” that plaintiff had been a park guard. As a result of the information he received concerning the work, defendant addressed a letter to the president of council which was read to that body, and published in newspapers, in which he said, among other things: “The present administration has made a contract for the manipulation [of the portraits] with a person of no experience or skill in such an art, and at a price far beyond the customary fee for the best work of the kind.</p>

Beyond this, the manner in which it was made is in itself sufficient to cast doubt on his motive for making it, and his admitted lack of knowledge or inquiry as to the truth of his charges is sufficient to raise a question whether as a fact reasonable or probable cause existed. The further fact that, at a subsequent hearing before a committee of city council, the letter was read and discussed and evidence of prominent persons, interested in art, submitted in defendant’s presence, tending to show plaintiff possessed the necessary qualifications to properly execute the work, but, notwithstanding this, defendant declined to retract or withdraw Ms charges, was a proper matter for the jury to consider pn the question of motive, as well as the question of dan;<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>ages. The case could not properly have been withdrawn from the jury, and we find no error in the manner of its submission.</p>
