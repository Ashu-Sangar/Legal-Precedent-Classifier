On his death, in 1900, the proceeds were paid to the guardian of the latter, and, when she became of age, the money was turned over to her. Notwithstanding the previous transfer, it was directed by the father’s will that this insurance, amounting to $10,000, should be treated as a part of his estate and invested, and the interest paid to Annie N. Shelley for life. If she had no surviving children, the principal was made payable to Goucher College. The daughter died in 1922, and later an account was filed by her surviving executor. The legatee in remainder under the will of William H. Shelley presented a claim before the auditor appointed to make distribution of her estate, for the amount of insurance received under the assigned policies, insisting this sum of $10,000 was either a debt due by the daughter, or a trust fund held for its benefit. The court below directed payment of this amount, thus reducing the assets of the estate, and causing a diminution to the extent of $2,500 in the shares of the four residuary legatees. Two of the four sued out writs of error, with the result that the decree entered was reversed, and the claim of the college disallowed: Shelley’s Est., <a href="/pa/287/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="287 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1099540" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0105-01">287 Pa. 105</a>. The record was remitted so that a new distribution might be made.</p>

The disposition re<a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>quested would permit <em>the </em>payment to the college of one-half of the claim, held to be without merit. The answer filed to the rule granted denied the appellee was entitled to any sum, its demand being single and indivisible. It was insisted its rejection here accrued to the benefit of the estate, and that the new division must be made as if no such debt or trust had been asserted. Under the circumstances appearing, it was urged the reversal was to the advantage of all the parties interested, whether they appealed or not.</p>
    <p id="b35-4" data-blocks='[["BL_35.4",35,[112,901,1152,1285]]]'>The question now raised has not been expressly passed upon in this State. It has frequently, been held that where a number of heirs or distributees are affected by the same legal ruling, subsequently reversed, only those appealing are benefited by the decision finally rendered. This is on the ground that the right to demand a share by each is a separate and distinct claim. Parties affected not suing out writs of error in such case, waive the right to further complain, and the decree setting aside the particular award reviewed cannot be taken advantage of by others. The authorities so declaring will usually be found to deal with the right to maintain joint appeals, it being held that a separate writ must be,taken out by each individual claimant: McGlinn’s Est., <a href="/pa/270/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="270 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1066132" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0373-01">270 Pa. 373</a>; Samson’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/22/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="22 Pa.

Or, they are decisions where separate' judgments were entered below, as in actions by husband and wife, or parent and child, for damages, and but one appeals. A reversal under such circumstances does not accrue to the benefit of the other: Saunders v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., <a href="/pa/255/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="255 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1027691" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0348-01">255 Pa. 348</a>; Rinker v.

Here, one claim for $10,000 was set up by the legatee of the father against the estate of the daughter. It is a single demand for a part of the assets of Miss Shelley’s <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>estate, to be deducted before any distribution is made to the residuary legatees, and not four claims against each one of those, who would be ultimately affected by its allowance. Two have appealed, and their standing to ask a review is not questioned. Though the two, who failed to appeal, would have lost their right to complain if these others, in control of their own writs, had later settled and discontinued, yet the case was here proceeded with to a judgment denying any liability on the part of the daughter’s estate for the sum asked and allowed below. If this demand had been severable, the appellee might still recover the one-half because of the waiver asserted, but the award of the |10,000 was based on a single claim against the estate, and not against the residuary legatees individually, though, of course, any reduction of the estate would proportionately affect their shares. The demand was enforceable in its entirety or not at all.</p>

J. 1206; 2 R. C. L., section 220; 2 Freeman on Judgments 481. This has been held where the suit was based on a joint contract when one party alone appealed (Boas v.
