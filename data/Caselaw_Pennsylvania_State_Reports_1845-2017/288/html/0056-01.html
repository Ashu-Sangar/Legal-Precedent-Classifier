Thus, if the clause in the contract of March, 1920, — as to Cascio taking over the Huston lease in case of their default, — be viewed as inserted for the landlord’s benefit alone, the evidence on the present record supports only one finding, namely, that plaintiff, the landlord, had permitted Cascio to take over the lease; on the other hand, if the clause in question be viewed as a mutual one, then, whether or not there was a surrender to the landlord by the Hus-tons, Cascio’s right under the written agreement could not be affected thereby: Hessel v.

He then said to Cascio, “Let it be understood between us here that......you are a tenant at will, and I can put you out any time I want to put you out,” and Cascio said in reply, “I no sign it......it is all right......I pay you the lease.” This was told at greater length in the testimony, but the above-quoted matter covers in substance all that was said at the time in question, which plaintiff claims constituted the new, oral, lease.</p>

This being the case, we need not consider collateral evidence of incidents from which plaintiff would have inferences drawn to corroborate his contention as to the existence of a legally created agreement for a new term, except to say that, plaintiff having undertaken, as a direct witness for himself, to prove an alleged oral lease, as superseding the original written lease, and, having failed to state facts sufficient to take the case to the jury on that issue, he could not, by such inferential evidence, relieve the situation thus created, nor could he send the case to the jury by stating his construction of the net result of the conversation between him and Cascio concerning the alleged oral lease, as he in fact attempted to do at several stages in his testimony.

Furthermore, there being no evidence sufficient to prove a new demise to Cascio, and nothing in the case to show either a physical “surrender of the premises or surrender of the [Huston] lease” by Cascio, and his term, as substituted tenant under that instrument, being for more than three years, again we agree with the court below that, under the statute of frauds and the decisions construing it, the testimony relied on by plaintiff to show that, despite the documentary contract to the contrary, Cascio was only a tenant at will, “cannot be permitted to prevail over the lease in writing.”</p>

To this point, with the exception of the holding as to the lawfulness of Berkebile’s possession as transferee of Cascio, the court below was undoubtedly correct; but the question is, whether that tribunal was right in entering a possessory judgment for Berkebile, on the theory that he was the lawful assignee, from Cascio, of the Huston lease and of the latter’s unexpired term thereunder. If that question is answered in the negative, and it should be held that Berkebile was not a lawful transferee, then the question arises, Did the justice, in the first instance, and subsequently the court below on appeal, have jurisdiction of the case?

As to this, the court below decided that the transfer from Cascio to Berkebile was no breach of the clause in question because “the covenant by the Hustons not to transfer [their lease] without approval in writing by plaintiff, was a personal one [which] did......not bind the subsequent assignee,” citing Lowry v. Atlantic Coal Co., <a href="/pa/272/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="272 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="1068403" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0019-01">272 Pa. 19</a>, 21, 22. To this we cannot agree. The present case differs from the Lowry case in that Cascio was not “an assignee” of the Huston lease in the proper sense of that term; he acquired no rights to that lease from the lessees named therein, but rather by reason of their default and abandonment of the premises. According to the terms of the contract of March, 1920, between plaintiff, the Hustons and Cascio, on the Hus-<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>tons’ default Cascio was to “take over their said lease”; and, when he took it over, he held directly from plaintiff, the original lessor, and was bound by the terms of that instrument, including the clause against transfer without plaintiff’s consent.</p>

Such warrants are “purely personal and bind only those who sign them; they are in a class by themselves, and do not bind others who may take over leases containing them, unless there is an express written stipulation, signed by the transferee of the lease, which in effect renews the warrant as against him. Moreover, in the particular lease under discussion, there are two clauses giving a warrant to confess judgment, both of which read, “The lessee hereby authorizes,” etc. On the other hand, the clause against transfers does not use that form, but employs these words, “The premises are not to be under-let, or this lease transferred without lessor’s consent, under penalty,” etc. This is some indication of a desire to cast the clause in question in the form of a general covenant, binding those who might, at any time, occupy the position of lessees, rather than a purely personal covenant, binding the original lessee alone. As said before, this clause, with the other general clauses in the lease of the Hustons, was binding on Cascio when, by virtue of the former’s default and the contract of 1920, he went into possession of the whole premises under that lease; therefore, he would have no right to transfer the lease to Berkebile without plaintiff’s consent, and the coifrt below erred in deciding otherwise.</p>

The cause of action in the case at bar is plainly shown by plaintiff’s statement of claim (from which we have quoted very fully) to be founded upon the allegation that Cascio was a tenant at will, or from month to month, who did not hold under a written lease, and upon the notice to quit, served on him. There is nothing in the statement of claim to indicate that plaintiff based his cause of action, as he now attempts to do, on the transfer from Cascio to Berkebile, as a breach of the Huston lease, giving rise to a right of immediate reentry. The transfer did not take place until seven days after the notice to quit was served on Cascio, and this fact, — since the procedure adopted by plaintiff depended on statutes requiring a notice to quit, — makes it evident the transfer was no part of the cause of action relied on by plaintiff in the justice’s court. Furthermore, had plaintiff based his cause of action on rights accruing to him because of the transfer from Cascio in Berkebile, the case would not have been within the jurisdiction of the justice under the acts invoked by plaintiff; and, therefore, it would not have been within the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas on appeal from the judgment of the justice. “If the justice had not jurisdiction, the common pleas cannot have it on appeal”: Moreland Township v.

This is not only a plain departure from the case pleaded in the justice’s court, but that court had no jurisdiction of a cause of action based on any such state of facts. As said by us in Koontz v.

Again, after Cascio turned over possession to Berkebile, plaintiff might have proceeded by ejectment directly against the latter; and if Berkebile had then pleaded his alleged right, as an assignee of the Huston lease, to possession of the demised premises, the question of forfeiture and right of reentry, which plaintiff now seeks to bring into this controversy, would have arisen. But on the pleadings and proofs before us, these questions cannot be made to control the case; for, as already shown, they were not present in the justice’s court, and, if they had been, the justice would have had no jurisdiction under the statutes invoked by plaintiff.

Soc., <a href="/pa/2/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="2 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="951331" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0293-01">2 Pa. 293</a>, 294, while we reversed a judgment in favor of the landlord, under which he had recovered possession, our final order was “proceedings quashed, but no writ of restitution awarded.” Again, in Hutchinson v. Potter, <a href="/pa/11/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="11 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="404673" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0472-01">11 Pa. 472</a>, 473, a proceeding instituted before <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>two aldermen to recover possession of real estate, wherein a writ of possession was granted in favor of the landlord, on appeal we reversed the court below stating, “We are constrained to quash the proceedings but will not award restitution.” Finally, in Hoffman v. Hafner, <a href="/pa/211/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="211 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="940058" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0010-01">211 Pa. 10</a>, 12, we ordered restitution, saying that this relief should be granted “unless there is something peculiar in the case,” but that, under exceptional circumstances, like those shown by the cases already mentioned, a judgment may be reversed and the proceedings set aside without the award of such a writ. The case now before us is like some of those above cited, where the court of first instance had jurisdiction, so far as the right to bring a possessory action therein was concerned, but subsequent developments demonstrated a lack of jurisdiction to enter the judgment appealed from, and where the equities of the situation were against the one asking for the writ of restitution; the latter is the position occupied by Berkebile, and in our judgment he is not entitled to such a writ. As herein-before stated, on the facts proved the assignment of the lease by Cascio to Berkebile worked a forfeiture of the former’s term. Under such circumstances, plaintiff might have entered and resumed possession of the premises without any process of law, provided he could have done so with no breach of the peace (Overdeer v. Lewis, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 90" data-case-ids="1852564" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0090-01">1 W. &amp; S. 90</a>, 91; Kellam v. Janson, <a href="/pa/17/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="17 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="967569" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0467-01">17 Pa. 467</a>, 469; Rich v.

Proctor, <a href="/pa/97/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="97 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="444769" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0486-01">97 Pa. 486</a>, 490, 491; Sweeney v.

Superior Ct. 69</a>, 71); or he could, by proper proceedings, have had the aid of legal process to restore him to possession. To oust him, then, by a writ of restitution in this proceeding would be useless, to say the least, since, so far as the record before us indicates, he could immediately recover in ejectment.</p>

    <p id="b95-4" data-blocks='[["BL_95.5",95,[92,791,1157,803]]]'>Another point to be considered is this: The court below not only entered a possessory judgment for Berkebile, but also included therein substantial damages, to cover the value of the term of which he had been dispossessed; whereas, on the evidence here produced, Berkebile’s claim of possession, not being rightful, could have no real value. It is unnecessary to discuss this point, however, because the case should have been dismissed for want of facts to bring it within the jurisdiction conferred by the acts invoked. For the reasons given, we shall not enter judgment for plaintiff; no more shall we affirm the monetary or possessory judgment of the court below in favor of Berkebile, though, as we shall explain in the next paragraph, the latter is entitled to a judgment for costs.</p>
    <p id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[88,1606,1157,805]],["BL_96.1",96,[284,359,1150,368]]]'>There is no way of telling from the present record what evidence was produced before the justice of the peace, so we have assumed it was the same as given in the common pleas; but, on the proofs there adduced, plaintiff himself showed a case not within the jurisdiction of the justice under the acts invoked for that purpose. This being the case, the justice, in the first instance, instead of entering judgment for plaintiff, should have dismissed the proceedings, and, on his failure so to do, the court below should have pursued that course and dismissed the proceedings ab initio, but without a writ of restitution. Since, however, plaintiff’s statement of claim pleaded a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the justice and the court below, on which issue was joined in the latter tribunal by Berkebile, as defendant, <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>and, since plaintiff failed to prove the case thus pleaded, Ms accepted opponent is entitled to a judgment for costs. In other words, although accepted by plaintiff as his opponent, Berkebile could not have successfully demurred to plaintiff’s case as originally averred by him; hence he had to answer, and, being obliged to answer, he is entitled to costs.</p>
    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[287,736,1148,263]]]'>The judgment in favor of Adam GL Berkebile is affirmed for costs only; aside from this limited affirmance, the judgment for him in the court below and that entered by the justice of the peace in favor of plaintiff are both set aside and the whole proceeding dismissed ab initio.</p>
