I. R T. Co., <a href="/ny/195/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="195 N.Y. 415" data-case-ids="6040299" data-case-paths="/ny/195/0415-01">195 N.

In a legal sense, however, it is more comprehensive and may mean a building regardless of habitation: 30 C. J. 472 ; 4 Words &amp; Phrases, 3351. Here it is used in conjunction with the phrase, “two stables or garages.” These words do not explain or modify “houses,” which precedes them, so as to confine its meaning to dwellings for single families. Stables and garages are used in connection with houses not' places of habitation, as, for illustration, a hospital. Clause “(d)” states that “stables or garages for the exclusive use of the oceupiers of ‘said dwelling houses,’ shall not be deemed offensive.” This is the first use of the term “dwelling house” in the covenant; assuming that “dwelling houses” refers to “houses” in clause “ (a),” we have held that “dwelling house” does not mean a single dwelling for one family, but is a more comprehensive term. Thus, in Johnson v. Jones, <a href="/pa/244/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="244 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1003488" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0386-01">supra,</a> an <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>apartment house was held not repugnant to the restriction “dwelling house,” though designed to admit of several families dwelling separately in house-keeping flats. We said (p. 389, 390): “The governing word......is “dwelling house”......[It] is [not] used in [a] qualified or restricted sense......A dwelling house is a house occupied as a residence in distinction from a store, office or other building. Neither the character of the structure here proposed, nor the use to which it is to be put, suggests anything that would bring [an apartment house] within any of these distinctions.” In Hamnett v. Born, <a href="/pa/247/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="247 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1009449" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0418-01">247 Pa. 418</a>, the restriction “one dwelling house” was held not to forbid the erection of an apartment or duplex house. In Taylor v. Lambert, <a href="/pa/279/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="279 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1083423" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0514-01">supra,</a> we held that “private dwelling house” had a more restricted meaning than “dwelling house,” and excluded all buildings used for residential purposes of a public character, including an apartment house.</p>

That the words “stables or garages” were not intended to restrict the character of structure to which they were attached becomes clear when we consider paragraph “(c).” It expressly refers to a building coming within the meaning of “houses,” as used in clause “ (a),” but which is clearly not such a structure to which the. words “stable or garage” are said to refer.</p>

Restrictions in deeds deal with property rights. They do not arise, nor can they be enforced, unless they appear in express terms. They do not arise by implication and where a right ordinarily appertaining to a grant is limited by an instrument in express language, a subsequent clause to extend the scope of the operation of the restriction must be expressed in clear and explicit language. No such intention is clearly expressed in this deed. The court below, in holding that an apartment house has many of the objectionable elements of a hotel, overlooks the fact that other buildings, even private dwelling houses, may have some of them. In balancing the various activities that go to make up dwellings, hotels, and apartments, the characteristics appertaining to the latter, resemble those of dwelling houses much more than hotels. The salient features of the two are alike. The apartment is devoted <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>exclusively to tenants by long term leases. The great bulk of hotel business is transient and a hotel is primarily a public house. The court below was quite correct in saying that the word “hotel” does not comprehend an apartment house, because a hotel and an apartment house are distinct and well known types of buildings. In common speech one is not confounded with the other. The learned judge should have stopped at this point. We hold the language “a building for any other purpose offensive to the owners or occupiers of other properties” is not sufficiently clear, explicit or definite in use or reference to restrict the use permitted under clause “(a)” on the word “houses” which concedes the right to erect an apartment house.</p>
