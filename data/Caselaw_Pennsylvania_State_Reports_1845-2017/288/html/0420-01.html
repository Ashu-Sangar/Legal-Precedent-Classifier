It agreed to and did furnish, in accordance Avith its custom, water to. the Stanley Aniline Chemical Works. This company was adjudged a bankrupt, and the property sold to appellant. Prior to the sale, appellant had been solicited to make the purchase, and its officers, with some citizens, appeared before city council for the express purpose of reaching an understanding on the subject of water supply. It was then verbally agreed between appellant and the city council that the agreement theretofore made with the Stanley Company would be carried out and the city would continue to furnish appellant a certain quantity of water free of charge for the balance of the ten years. Relying on this agreement, appellant purchased the plant at the trustee’s sale. It operated the works for eighteen months during which time no charge was made for water.</p>

The relation to the public created by its ordinances are, in such cases, not legislative, but contractual. It was because municipalities were similar to private corporations in supplying water that the controversy arose as to whether or not the Public Service Commission could regulate that service. We held in Barnes Laundry Co. v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/266/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="266 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1056039" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0024-01">266 Pa. 24</a>, where the question was elaborately treated, that municipalities were not included in the Public Service Act because the statute expressly eliminated them, and they could not, therefore, be brought in by implication.</p>

The proper practice (apart from legislative procedure) is by bill in <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>equity to restrain acts contrary to law or to compel the performance of acts required by law.</p>

L. 577, 578, the municipality was authorized to erect water works, and determine rates or prices for those using the water. By article V, section 3, clause 43, of the Act of 1913, supra, council was given the right to supply water at such prices <em>as may </em>he <em>agreed upon. </em>Under this act the city may make rules, regulations and rates* governing thq service.</p>

    <p id="b447-5" data-blocks='[["BL_447.6",447,[104,1496,1152,696]]]'>The agreement of a city to supply water free of charge is discrimination against other users and void as against public policy.

The discriminatory engagements of both are prohibited as matters of public policy for reasons so frequently stated, we need not repeat them here. The gift is of a commodity, the cost of the production of which is a continuing charge borne directly by the taxpayers.

A classification based on a particular business or use for a special purpose will not, without more, justify classification or discriminatory rates. We do not intimate in Barnes Laundry Co. v. Pittsburgh, supra, that a classification can be made whereby one of the classes receives water free of cost. On the contrary, we state that a “city operating a legalized monopoly, in the nature of a water plant, cannot give undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to, or make unfair discrimination among customers, any more than a private corporation similarly situated;” to give water away to a manufacturing plant is a discrimination. Appellant urges, however, that in Central I. &amp; S. Co. v. Harrisburg, <a href="/pa/271/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="271 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="295663" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0340-01">271 Pa. 340</a>, we decide that “if a city stipulates to supply a customer [with water] under special agreement for a specified term at a fixed price, it will be held to its obligation (Penn Iron Co. v.

Superior Ct. 478</a>); but, as in all cases, one claiming to enforce a contract must establish the fact that there was such an understanding, express or implied, as he seeks to enforce,” and the contract would be binding, assuming it was founded on a real consideration. This expression in that case must be read in connection with the express reference to discrimination mentioned in other parts of the opinion. In the Barnes Case, supra, p. 43, we said, “Neither by ordering nor using a necessity like water, from a plant which enjoys a monopoly of supply, can one be held estopped ......on the theory of implied contracts or otherwise (4 McQuillan on Municipal Corporations, section 1725, p. 3690; Id. p. 3729, n.8) from the right, in a due and proper proceeding, to question either the reasonableness of the ordained rate or the justness of its application, for rates unlawfully exacted .are treated in law as though assented to under duress......” The converse of this rule, “that the city may enforce its rates as to contracts in existence” must be considered in connection with what is said in Suburban Water Co. v. Oak<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>mont Boro., <a href="/pa/268/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="268 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1061592" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0243-01">268 Pa. 243</a>, 252, 253. It must be remembered that a city’s power to regulate rates and service is as extensive as a public service company’s. We said in the latter case, “All public service contracts are viewed in the light of having been made with an implied provision that the rate named therein is subject to change, according to law, so as to keep it reasonable and nondiscriminatory at all times.”</p>
    <p id="b449-3" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[95,777,1166,536]]]'>The reason for this rule is simple, as shown by the many cases which hold that “the change of a rate fixed by contract for the performance of service by a public utility company does not impair the obligation of the contract under the Constitution of the United States, and, if it did, the change would be unlawful...... The contract is simply modified or reformed so as to include for the time being the new rate fixed by law. The power to reform contracts of this kind was granted under the Act' of 1874, giving the courts jurisdiction over rates.”</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[94,1323,1153,423]]]'>So, even if we assume that the contract is legal, still it is subject to the change herein mentioned. The principle is controlled by what we said in Barnes Laundry Case, supra, that a city operating a legalized monopoly in the nature of water, cannot give undue or unreasonable preference or advantage or make unfair discrimination among customers any more than a private corporation similarly situated.</p>
    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[94,1757,1151,210]]]'>The gift of water, for purposes like the one before us cannot be sustained where the municipality does not have power to contribute money or property donations for purposes like the one now under consideration.</p>
    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.7",449,[94,1977,1151,96]]]'>After a careful consideration, the decree of the court below is affirmed at cost of appellant.</p>
