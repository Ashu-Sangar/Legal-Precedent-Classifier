But if my said husband die without having made such testamentary disposition then I direct that my said residuary estate shall be distributed in equal shares among such of my children as may then be living and the issue of such of them as may then be dead; such issue nevertheless taking and dividing equally among themselves such share only as his, her or their parent or parents would have taken if living at the time of death of my said husband.” This, of course, limited his power of appointment to testatrix’s descendants, between whom, however, he could parcel the estate, and declare trusts as to the individual shares, in such way as to him seemed best. There being no limitation as to the <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>character of such trusts, spendthrift trusts were, of course, included among them.</p>

Regarding the principal of her estate, it need only be said, that, as to it, he exceeded the power given to him; hence the corpus, subject to such of the provisions regarding income as are found to be valid, became the absolute property of testatrix’s four children, all of whom survived both their parents.</p>

    <p id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[255,1151,1153,964]]]'>At the audit, testatrix’s four children contended: (a) that the plan of distribution above set forth was not intended to provide for spendthrift trusts, so far as respects the income from their mother’s estate; (b) that if this be not so, then, in providing therefor, their father exceeded the power given by his wife’s will; and (c) in any event his paramount purpose was to carry into effect the illegal plan set forth in his proposed distribution of the principal, and that the two were so bound together that his attempted appointment must fail in its entirety. They therefore asked the court below to decree the entire estate to them absolutely, on the theory that, as a class, they alone were entitled to both the income and the principal in remainder, and hence, acting together, as they were, they had the right to have the trust ended and the property transferred to them. Because the court below refused to so decree, each of the children prosecuted one of the present appeals.</p>
    <p id="b374-7" data-blocks='[["BL_374.7",374,[254,2134,1150,261]],["BL_375.1",375,[93,334,1154,427]]]'>We have been favored with a learned argument on each of the above points, but fail to see that there is any doubt touching their proper solution. As to the first, it is difficult to understand how there can be a “precise conformity to the plan of distribution as to income” of <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>the donee’s own estate, unless we consider that plan in its entirety, including the spendthrift trust provision. There is no force in the contention that, since the latter is in a separate paragraph from the one indicating the shares the distributees were to receive, the former must be rejected. It is an integral part of the plan, and is legal; hence it must be carried into effect: Lewis’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="269 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1063566" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0379-01">269 Pa. 379</a>, 381.</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[94,772,1156,1178]]]'>The second of the above contentions is the one upon which appellants seem to pin their hopes; but it, too, is unavailing. If the donor’s will had been silent on the subject, the claim that Pepper’s App., <a href="/pa/120/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="120 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="559788" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0235-01">120 Pa. 235</a>, was controlling, would be entitled to much consideration. But it is not silent. The donor of the power in the present case, expressly provided that distribution should be made “in such shares and <em>upon such, </em>trusts, as my said husband may by his last will and testament direct.” Appellants admit that if the donor had herself directed the creation of such trusts, they would have been valid, because the property was hers, and such trusts are valid in this State. For like reasons, however, she could authorize her donee to create them, and he, having done so under that authority, it is her act, performed by another for her, and is equally binding. Although the exact question here was not at issue in Rafferty’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="281 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1087036" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0325-01">281 Pa. 325</a>, a cognate one was; the relevant authorities bearing on the entire subject were cited and considered, and the same conclusion was reached as that above set forth. This obviates the necessity for further review of those authorities.</p>
    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.6",375,[95,1970,1151,426]],["BL_376.1",376,[278,336,1151,794]]]'>Appellant’s final contention, citing Johnston’s Est., <a href="/pa/185/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="185 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="898030" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0179-01">185 Pa. 179</a>, and kindred cases, is that the donee’s paramount purpose was the illegal one regarding the principal of the estate, and, the distribution of the income being inseparably connected therewith, the whole plan must be declared invalid. Here, however, there is no connection whatever between the distribution of the income and that of the principal, except, as must always <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>be the case, that tbe latter is postponed until the trust as to tbe former is ended. It is clear, however, that tbe provision as to distribution of tbe income can readily stand alone, undisturbed and unaffected by tbe striking down of tbe invalid provision as to tbe principal; bence it must be sustained: Lawrence’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="136 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="819995" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0354-01">136 Pa. 354</a>; Whitman’s Est., <a href="/pa/248/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="248 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1011486" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0285-01">248 Pa. 285</a>; Jones’s Trust Est., <a href="/pa/284/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="284 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1092045" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0090-01">284 Pa. 90</a>; Ledwith v.

Tbe suggestion that tbe spendthrift trust should be declared invalid, because, notwithstanding it, creditors could sell tbe distributees’ estate in remainder, has no weight. If they did tbe spendthrift trust provision would continue to insure to tbe children tbe income during their lives,' and this is exactly tbe purpose for which such a trust is created.</p>
    <p id="b376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[277,1151,1150,141]]]'>Tbe decree of tbe court below is affirmed and each of these appeals is dismissed at tbe cost of tbe appellant therein.</p>
