    <p id="b250-7" data-blocks='[["BL_250.9",250,[282,1089,1150,152]]]'>Defendant has moved to quash, on the grounds that the “order appealed from is purely interlocutory” and that “there is no act......which authorizes the appeal.”</p>
    <p id="b250-8" data-blocks='[["BL_250.10",250,[279,1252,1152,747]]]'>The Act of June 12, 1879, P. L. 177, provides for an appeal “in all cases in equity in which a......preliminary injunction has been refused.” The present case involves an appeal from an order dissolving a preliminary injunction. The injunction under attack was first granted subject to a motion to continue, which motion was afterward overruled and the injunction dissolved. This state of affairs has repeatedly been treated by us as equivalent to the refusal of a preliminary injunction and as constituting an appealable order within the meaning of the Act of 1879; for recent instances see Lockwood v. Ambridge Borough, <a href="/pa/233/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="233 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="981117" data-case-paths="/pa/233/0521-01">233 Pa. 521</a>; Casinghead Gas Co. v.

    <p id="b250-10" data-blocks='[["BL_250.11",250,[280,2011,1147,257]]]'>Plaintiff’s reply to defendant’s motion to quash states that the “main issue” involved is the constitutionality of the Act of May 10, 1921, P. L. 442, and that this “can be disposed of upon the pending appeal and will probably be conclusive of the case.”</p>

When on such an appeal it appears, from the facts as presented by the record, that the court below based its action on a fundamental error of law, the propriety of the decision is squarely raised and may be disposed of without any infringement of the governing rule.” But “the rules of law relied on [by the court below must be] palpably wrong or clearly inapplicable” (Sunbury Boro. v. Sunbury Co., <a href="/pa/241/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="241 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="976034" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0357-01">241 Pa. 357</a>, 359) before we will review them on such an appeal.</p>

In short, no point is passed on which is not absolutely essential to the determination of the single question, Is the order appealed from obviously erroneous? With this warning to appellant,</p>
