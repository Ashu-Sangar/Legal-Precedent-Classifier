    <p id="b62-8" data-blocks='[["BL_62.13",62,[273,1218,1156,795]]]'>The testament provided for the creation of a trust of one-half of the residuary estate, the income from which was to be paid to a granddaughter, Florence Bonsall Judge, during life; upon her death the principal was to go to her child or children, but if she should die “without leaving child or children surviving or children of deceased child or children, then and in such case the principal monies of said Trust Fund shall go to and vest in my lineal descendants according to the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania.” Florence Bonsall Judge [DeHaven] did so die. Are the lineal descendants to be ascertained as of the date of testatrix’s death or the death of the life beneficiary? The orphans’ court adopted the latter date applying as the rule of construction the provisions of the act to which we have referred.</p>

    <p id="b63-9" data-blocks='[["BL_63.6",63,[99,1225,1166,1075]]]'>The statute uses the words “similar or equivalent,” and some effect, if possible, must be given to each of them. They should not be declared tautological unless such a conclusion is without escape. In the New Standard Dictionary, “similar” is defined as “bearing resemblance to something else; being alike in quality, nature, degree, purpose or other characteristics, <em>hut not the same or </em>identicalAccording to the Oxford Dictionary, it means “having a marked resemblance or likeness; of a like nature or kind.” In Webster’s International Dictionary the definition is “nearly corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat like; having a general likeness.” On the other hand, the Oxford Dictionary defines “equivalent” as “having equal or corresponding import, meaning or significance; what is .virtually the same thing; identical in effect.” According to Webster it means “equal in worth or value, force, power, defect, import and the like; alike in significance and value; of the same import or meaning.” The synonym given is “identical.”</p>
