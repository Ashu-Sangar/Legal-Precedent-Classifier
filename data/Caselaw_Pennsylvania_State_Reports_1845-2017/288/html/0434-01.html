The plan with its streets was adopted by the Borough of Milford, after its incorporation in 1874. Biddis sold lots with reference to these streets, and appellant’s deed contained the following clause as a conveyance of the land in dispute: “All the right, title and interest of the grantors in and to all that certain piece ......of land laid out upon the map......as part of Anne Street.” This street, as it appeared on the plan, was sixty feet in width, extending from the town limits to the Delaware River. It was opened and used through the town to the top of the river bank. From that point to the river there is a precipitous drop of over 100 feet, within a distance of from 200 to 250 feet. Appellant, relying upon his grant, started to build a wall across Anne Street on the hill side, when the borough, claiming the ground as a public highway, brought this bill to enjoin him. The lower court found as a fact that the land in question was not a public highway, and dig-<a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>missed the bill. The Superior Court reversed the decree, reinstated the bill and directed the injunction to issue.

[It] relates to what......would be......streets laid out by owners thereof but not opened or used by the public for ‘twenty-one years next after the laying out of the same’; and its purpose is [after the expiration of that length of time] ‘to relieve land upon which streets have been laid out by the owner’ from the servitude thus imposed.”</p>

Hollidaysburg Borough, <a href="/pa-super/47/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="47 Pa. Super. 41" data-case-ids="422995" data-case-paths="/pa-super/47/0041-01">47 Pa. Superior Ct. 41</a>, 49. This is subject to an important qualification. When the municipality, through one of its officers, fixes the lines of a street or highway, and property is built on the lines as given, such acts will estop the municipality from claiming that the building is an encroachment. As stated in Lenhart v. Wright, <a href="/pa/286/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="286 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1096527" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0351-01">286 Pa. 351</a>, 355, “where a definite boundary line is disclosed by the presence of some building or fence placed,......by direction or with consent, of the duly authorized officers, or the line has been subsequently fixed and designated by them, an estoppel may be worked, so as later to prevent an alteration of the situation to the detriment of the abutting owner.” Consequently, if the user of a part of the alleged highway from the top of the hill to the Delaware River had been made to appear, the municipality could have claimed its entire width. But evidence of zigzag paths (not entirely within the lines of the proposed highway) used in the manner described by the witnesses, was obviously insufficient for this purpose. The mere fact of the use of a part of the way longitudinally, and its acceptance by the municipality as a public street over the part so used, does not draw to it another part of the same highway or street not so used or accepted. A use, under the law, covers only so much of the street on and over which the use takes place; it cannot be made to embrace and include longitudinal extensions not so used and accepted : Oakley v. Luzerne Borough, <a href="/pa-super/25/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="25 Pa. Super. 425" data-case-ids="851963" data-case-paths="/pa-super/25/0425-01">25 Pa.

And where the trier of the facts, in considering the evidence, finds that the municipality has pot accepted the dedication, his <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>conclusion is final, unless the finding is the result of capriciousness of the fact finder. A reviewing authority will not arbitrarily disregard the trier’s right to pass on the credibility of the witnesses, and substitute its judgment for that of the fact finder. Especially is this emphasized when the evidence before the fact-finder is disputed, as it was in this case. We have repeatedly stated that the findings of fact of a chancellor have the force and effect of the verdict of a jury, and will not be disturbed if there is evidence to support them: Glenn v. Trees, <a href="/pa/276/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="276 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1077529" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0165-01">276 Pa. 165</a>, 167, and cases there cited. In reviewing an appeal from, the Superior Court in Platt-Barber Co. v. Groves, <a href="/pa/193/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="193 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="910341" data-case-paths="/pa/193/0475-01">193 Pa. 475</a>, we stated that the case was peculiarly one for the application of the general rule that the findings of an auditor on the facts should not be reversed except for very plain error.</p>
    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[280,1215,1150,905]]]'>The chancellor who heard this case found as a fact that the municipality had not accepted the way. He had the benefit of seeing the witnesses and hearing their testimony, and was in a better position to determine their credibility than the judges of an appellate court. The rule above announced is as much binding on the Superior Court as it is on this court. The question at issue in the court below was purely one of fact and the learned judge took into consideration the legal principles above announced as applicable to the facts of the case; he also reached a conclusion on the facts clearly justified by the evidence, which was meager and disputed. But even if our judgment on it should be different, under the rule above announced, the chancellor’s finding must stand. Should the borough wish to open this street or any highway to the river, they have that right under the law by eminent domain.</p>
