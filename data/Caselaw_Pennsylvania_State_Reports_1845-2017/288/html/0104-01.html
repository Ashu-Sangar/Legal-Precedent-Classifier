Carville, plaintiff’s husband, died as the result of an explosion which occurred at the cleaning and dyeing works of defendant company.

In 1919 his salary as vice-president was fixed at $7,000, which salary was the only compensation he was receiving at the time of his death in 1925. He drew this salary in irregular weekly amounts, the difference being adjusted at the end of each month. The corporation was more or less of a family affair; deceased was a nephew of the president; another nephew occupied the position of secretary and treasurer, who, at his death, was succeeded by his wife, at a somewhat reduced salary. These men, in addition to performing their executive duties, worked around the plant when occasion required it. The by-laws did not define the duties of the official position occupied by deceased, who made himself generally useful in the affairs of the corporation, usually confining his activities to the dyeing and cleaning department, — in which lines he was an expert, — and, if necessary, taking part in the manual work incident to this branch of the business. At the time of his accidental death, Carville, with the president of the company, was at the factory to investigate a naptha leak, which, apparently, caused the explosion; deceased was telephoning when it occurred.</p>

In distinguishing the Gray Case, the court below correctly states that it was an instance where four men owned all the stock of the defendant corporation; that these men did not receive compensation as officers of the corporation, but each had his own duties to perform in the conduct of the company and the work in and out of the plant, being authorized to draw $40 a week for the services which he rendered, and, if the business was successful, an additional amount. Both the court below and the Superior Court adopted the findings of the compensation authorities and decided that, owing to the peculiar character of the organization and the conduct of defendant corporation, there was foundation for the conclusion that these men were acting and receiving wages as employees, rather than as salaried executive officers. In this connection, the Superior Court calls attention to the fact that some of the men acted in <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>capacities “clearly in the nature of a servant,” which was the position of claimant’s deceased husband in that decision; this cannot be said of the deceased husband in the case now before us.</p>

L. 736, as amended by the Act of June 26, 1919, P. L. 642, we determined that where, in a hearing before the compensation authorities, one undertook to prove a point material to the decision of the case (par. 14 of Vorbnoff opinion) and the evidence for the purpose lacked legal competency, if, on appeal, this lack was the only reason for reversal, the court, in the words of the statute, had to “remit the record to the board for further hearing and determination” (paragraph 12),— or, in other words, to afford a second opportunity to prove the fact at issue by legally competent evidence; though if the party bearing the burden of proof had entered on no undertaking before the compensation authorities to establish the fact in question, and had offered no evidence whatever for that purpose, the courts were not obliged to give a “further opportunity” so to do <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>(paragraph 14); nor, on the complaint of one who had failed to obtain a desired finding were they obliged to return the record for further testimony where the evidence originally produced was “merely wanting in persuasiveness or weak in fact” (paragraph 13). We there pointed out that findings of fact made by the compensation authorities could be excepted to on appeal to the courts only on the ground that they were “unsupported by competent evidence” (paragraph 12), and that this meant evidence “answering all requirements of the law” (paragraph 8). In brief, as there stated, “the compensation authorities are to decide all questions of fact and the courts are to decide those of law” (paragraph 9) and “findings” containing “mixed questions of fact and law ......may be reviewed by the courts on [their] latter aspect alone” (paragraph 10). In the case now before us, neither side denied that Carville was in the service of defendant; the question between them was, and is, whether he was in the “employ” of defendant in the sense of being its “servant,” within the meaning of that term as used in the Workmen’s Compensation Act.</p>

Viewed from this aspect, we have before us only a question of law, not one of fact, and there is nothing in the statute requiring a return of the record for further evidence. If, however, the ends of justice required a return of the record for that purpose, we should pursue such a course; but we are not so impressed in this case. On the contrary, we agree with the court below that, taking into consideration all the underlying findings of fact which have competent evidence to sustain them, and all the evidence in the case, and giving to both the most favorable consideration for plaintiff, it is plain therefrom that, at the time of the accident, her husband was not in the “employ” <em>of </em>defendant as a “servant” within the meaning of those terms as used in the act (McCarthy v. Dunlevy-Franklin Co., <a href="/pa/277/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="277 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1079492" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0467-01">277 Pa. 467</a>, 471), and that the fixing of his compensation by the referee on a weekly wage basis is entirely without competent evidence to support it. At the time of Carville’s death, and for some years prior thereto, he had been an executive officer of defendant corporation at a salary of $7,000 a year, fixed by resolution of the board of directors. The weekly wage <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>rate stated in the report of the referee does not appear as the result of a contract made before the accident with defendant corporation, or of a mutual understanding between deceased and his company, but was arrived at by an allotment or allocation, out of Carville’s $7,000 salary, purely for the purposes of this proceeding.</p>

Groner, <a href="/pa/258/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="258 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1035096" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0473-01">258 Pa. 473</a>, 478. Section 103 of the Act of 1915 provides that “the term of ‘employer’......is declared to be synonymous with master”; section 104 defines “employee” thus: “The term ‘employee’......is declared to be synonymous with servant.” No particular definition is given in the act either of “master” or “servant”; so these words must be taken in the ordinary sense in which they are understood in the law, and which the purpose and general content of the act indicates they were intended to have. Ordinarily, a corporation which pays a substantial salary to an executive officer, such as its vice-president, would not be understood to occupy the position of master over such a person, and one in the position of Carville, who, under the by-laws of the company, was to take the place of the president in his absence, and who, individually, owned one-fifth of the stock of the corporation, would not, in common parlance, be understood to occupy the place of an employee, particularly under a statute wherein that term is used as synonymous with servant; the law would not consider such an employer as a master or such an employee as a servant. These terms, master and servant, have a very broad meaning and likewise a very restricted meaning, both in the field of law and of fact, and, in each instance where they are used in a statute, it becomes <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>necessary to ascertain from the act itself what meaning must be given to them. In the present case, it is only necessary to say that, under the statute now before us, the term “master” was not intended to cover a corporation paying a substantial salary to an executive officer, or the terms “employee” and “servant,” one occupying the position which Carville did in the organization of the defendant corporation. That is all it is necessary to decide, for this is not the case of an ordinary employee, on wages, being used pro forma as an executive officer of defendant company, nor is it the case of one with the title of an executive officer but really serving as an ordinary employee and receiving a fixed or ascertainable compensation for his work as such. We will decide whether those cases are within the Compensation Act when they come to us.</p>
