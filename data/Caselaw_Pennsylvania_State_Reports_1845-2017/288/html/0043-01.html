The court below decreed that appellee was entitled to have said license tax based upon the aggregate amount of business done regardless of the number of stores operated by it, and accordingly entered judgment in favor of appellant, the City of Johnstown, in the sum of only $100 instead of $915, the amount claimed by said city.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[282,901,1150,313]]]'>The city appealed and assigned for error the entering of said decree. There was no dispute about the facts.

In its opinion, holding that appellant is not entitled to levy and collect a separate tax on each store operated by appellee, the court below said: “The language of the act merely refers to dealers and not to places of business. While we believe that this construction of the act is indicated clearly in the language used we also find the ordinance itself confirms such a reading, for example, in the case of the taxation of a street railway company a tax is placed against the company generally and later on a tax is placed upon each car. In the case of livery stables or automobile garages there is a general tax upon the persons engaged in such business, and an additional tax upon each vehicle used. Counsel for the defendant relies for support of his contention upon the cases of Atlantic Refining Co. v. Yan Yalkenburg, <a href="/pa/265/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="265 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1051949" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0456-01">265 Pa. 456</a>; Com. v.

The disposition of the only question that was really before the court below did not require it to decide whether appellant had power and authority to pass an ordinance taxing each place of business.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[273,615,1151,683]]]'>It is expressly provided by the said amendment of 1919 to the Third Class City Act that the license taxes here in question are to be levied and collected for general revenue purposes and it may therefore well be doubted whether appellant has, in the exercise of its police power, authority to impose a tax as suggested by the court below. That question, however, is not involved on this appeal and we express no opinion upon it. The sole contention of the appellee is that appellant has not taxed its separate places of business in enacting the ordinance in question but has only taxed “persons, firms or corporations” engaged in, inter alia, the grocery business.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.6",68,[272,1319,1150,369]]]'>It is admitted by the learned city solicitor that it is not possible “to place one’s finger on actual words in the above act of assembly stating that a corporation, or an individual, carrying on a business taxed under said act shall pay a license tax for the business transacted at each store,” but it is argued that it is reasonable to infer that such was the intention of the legislature.</p>

      <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>The difficulty with the cases cited in behalf of appellant relating to the imposition of the mercantile license taxes is that these taxes are imposed under a system of statutes authorizing their imposition on each separate place of business carried on by the same person or corporation. For instance, in Atlantic Refining Co. v. Van Valkenburg, <a href="/pa/265/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="265 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1051949" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0456-01">265 Pa. 456</a>, it is expressly pointed out in the opinion of our Supreme Court that prior legislation covering that case, and not repealed by the Act of May 2, 1899, P. L. 184, required that where a person shall have more than one store in which merchandise is vended such person shall be required to take out a license for each and every store.</p>

Superior Ct. 467</a>, Porter, J., clearly points out that the Act of April 10, 1849, P. L. 570, in so far as it relates to eating-houses, restaurants and oyster cellars, was not repealed by the Act of May 2, 1899, P. L. 184, and that said prior act required the appellant in that case to take out a. separate license for each separate establishment which it maintained in a city in this State. The character of the tax imposed under the statutes involved in that case is thus described in the opinion: “The amount which the eating-house keeper pays for his license is not in the nature of an occupation tax, a fixed charge imposed on all who follow a certain calling; neither is it a general tax upon the particular business of buying and selling food-stuffs, whether prepared or unprepared for immediate use.”</p>
