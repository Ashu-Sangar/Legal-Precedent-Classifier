The former had acquired knowledge of coal properties in southwestern Pennsylvania, and at various times had interested the latter in purchases and sales of such. In June of 1919, he learned that the Ellsworth Collieries Company desired to secure a certain acreage, which he could buy, and that it was willing to sell a portion of its tract. It was orally agreed between the two that the first properties should be acquired, and deeded to the company named, which should then trans<a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>fer in return a part of its land to Hillman. To effect this result the necessary funds were supplied solely by the defendant Davis contributing his services in conducting the negotiations, and was promised in consideration one-half of the gain which might be secured on a resale for the best price obtainable. On October 18, 1920, the conveyance of the land, purchased for $574,-274.64 was made to the Collieries Company, and it in turn deeded to Hillman 630 acres of its property, as promised. After this date defendant denied that plaintiff had any interest, and, on November 4th of the same year, the former conveyed the land to the Hillman Gas Coal Company, a corporation of which the stock was nearly all owned by him, for the sum of one dollar, setting forth in the deed that it had been acquired from the Collieries Company in trust for the grantee.</p>
    <p id="b41-5" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[102,1231,1154,1080]]]'>The statement filed sets forth the verbal agreement, which it was claimed had been repudiated, as already recited, and asked as damages, for loss of the bargain, one-half of the excess market value over the sum paid by Hillman. It is further alleged that the transfer to the Gas Coal Company, later made, was fraudulent, and, as appellant states in his argument, was in reality a “conveyance to himself.” No averment appears that any offer to purchase at an increase has been made, or could have been secured, plaintiff contenting himself with the statement as to market value, nor is it set forth that there had been any profit made when the property was deeded for one dollar in November. An affidavit of defense was filed, raising the legal question of the sufficiency of the statement to show a good cause of action, and denying the enforceability of the oral agreement in view of the prohibition of the statute of frauds. The trial judge sustained the objections, and dismissed the proceeding, a conclusion approved by the court in banc, and this appeal resulted.</p>

It sets forth that the contract was repudiated on October 18,1920, and claims the right to damages from that date, when defendant refused to perform.

If in fact the ownership remained in him, this action must fall, and if transferred, the same is true, unless he realized thereby a profit, a fact not asserted. It was not claimed that any other purchaser was produced, or was willing to give a price which would net an excess, or that such was received from the grantee. As we have heretofore noticed, the refusal to carry out the oral agreement did not form the basis for a recovery. The denial of any interest in Davis is not evidence of fraud, and such must be established, if there is to be an award for the loss of the bargain, as here claimed, based on the market value of the land on October 18, 1920.

The facts and inferences therefrom must be taken as <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>true. Davis, the plaintiff, knew the Ellsworth Coal Company wanted to buy additional coal lands and sell part of its holdings. He knew he could buy the land Ellsworth wanted and that its land could be resold advantageously. He lacked the money necessary to handle the deal. Having had business relations with Hillman, the defendant, he submitted the matter to him. It was agreed between them that Hillman was to secure the money and plaintiff was to furnish all the services in the negotiations, closing the deals and all matters in connection therewith. The land received from Ellsworth was to be sold and they were to divide equally the profits realized on the sale. The title to this land was to be in Hillman’s name. The bargain was faithfully carried out up to the point of reselling these lands and dividing the probable profits of $400,000. Here is where the red line indelibly marks the transaction. When Hillman found title to the land securely lodged in him, he “fraudulently conveyed said coal land to Hillman Gas Coal Company, a corporation in which the defendant was then and there largely interested, for the consideration of one dollar.” The inference is manifest. It was to deprive the plaintiff of his share of the gain. Hillman knew the small minority interest in the company prevented its being a sale to himself under the cloak of corporate entity, and that no matter what the real transaction was if the consideration was named as a dollar, no profit could be claimed, though he unblushingly admits that the land in the market was worth $400,000 more than had been paid for it. When he is asked to give plaintiff what was due him, he says, “No, the statute of frauds will not permit him to get any part of it,” and the majority opinion in this case sustains that view. All these facts and inferences therefrom must be taken as true; that is the story and the plaintiff is cast out by what I believe to be a misapplication of the statute. No further action may be instituted as the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. This is the last of repeated efforts to secure justice.</p>

The penalty for failure to observe the law is that no action can be brought to enforce it until the omission is made good, or unless the facts fall within one or two recognized exceptions.

Kelly, <a href="/pa/149/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="149 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="832552" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0473-01">149 Pa. 473</a>, 475, it was held that an interest in contingent profits, arising from a sale of real estate, to be made thereafter, does not amount to an interest in the land itself, within the meaning of the statute of frauds. This rule is not limited to cases of partnership: see Everhart’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="106 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="455641" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0349-01">106 Pa. 349</a>.

The eases cited above are distinguished on the ground that the principle stated applies only where the agreement has been executed, and a sale made. The majority opinion suggests that in Everhart’s App., supra, recovery was specifically denied as to lands which had not been sold, quoting from Benjamin v. Zell, <a href="/pa/100/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="100 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="498481" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0033-01">supra.</a> We need not discuss this, and may assume, for the purposes of this case that the defendant could have retained the land in question as long as he desired to do so, yet I believe that the facts averred in the statement give the plaintiff a right to recover. Here we have a very different, and a stronger case. Here the defendant has done something more than merely repudiate his contract. He has, in bad faith, transferred the property for a nominal consideration to a corporation, of which he owns the controlling interest, thereby making performance of his agreement with this plaintiff impossible. In my opinion the case turns upon this point. Conceding (as I said above, for the purpose of argument) that the defendant could have retained the title, and even that he could have given it away, nevertheless he becomes liable in this case because the conveyance was made fraudulently (as the jury might well have found under the pleadings) for the purpose of preventing the plaintiff from receiving his share of profits which might be realized upon a sale of the land. The case is analogous to that of an attorney, employed under a contingent fee contract, whose client settles the case without his knowledge or consent. It is clear that the attorney may recover: Thole v. Martino, <a href="/pa-super/56/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="56 Pa.

If “fraudulently” is to be construed as asserting only a conclusion of law, the words “with intent to defraud” if they had been used, would have constituted an allegation of fact, and hence, to turn a man out of court because of the use of the former expression instead of the latter, would be an inexcusable and unnecessary relegation to the days of strict pleading, when a man’s rights were determined by his ability (or that of his attorney) to guess the correct word.</p>

This right cannot be affected by the mere fact that the statement of the amount of his claim is based upon the wrong measure of damages. That is a question of law, to be determined by the court in submitting the case to the jury.

Is it posf sible that our powers, equitable or otherwise, are so supine and helpless that they cannot prevent such overreaching or restore an injured person to his rights?

On the contrary, this is precisely what the statement says: “Afterwards, on November 4, 1920, the defendant wrongfully and fraudulently conveyed said coal land -----...The said coal land in the latter part of October and November 1920, was of the......market value of ......$400,000 and upwards above the cost price......
