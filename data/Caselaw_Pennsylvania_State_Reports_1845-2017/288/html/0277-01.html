Briefly, it was agreed a company should be organized to take over defendant’s business and assets: Preferred stock was to be issued to him for the value of his property. Plaintiff was to receive the common stock, and to assume the active management of the company. Defendant declined to proceed with the contract. No company was organized, and consequently no com<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>mon or preferred stock was issued. This action was then brought.</p>
    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[112,464,1157,1351]]]'>The only question at issue in the court below was the measure of damages plaintiff was entitled to receive to compensate him for defendant’s failure to perform the obligations of the contract. The stock not being in existence, had no market value. Plaintiff was not to be deprived of the value of his contract merely because the property he was to receive did not possess a market value. Where stock has been issued which has no market value, the intrinsic or real worth is the measure of damages: Duroth Mfg. Co. v. Cauffiel, <a href="/pa/243/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="243 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1001652" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0024-01">243 Pa. 24</a>, 30. In an action to assess damages for breach of contract which promised, as one of the considerations, common stock of a company to be organized, but which was not, the measure of damages is the intrinsic or real value as of the date it should have been issued, and as though issued. This may be shown by evidence of the net worth of the assets or by evidence of the net profit: Crichfield v. Julia, <a href="/f/147/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="147 F. 65" data-case-ids="1907906" data-case-paths="/f/147/0065-01">147 Fed. 65</a>, 71, 73, 74; Huse &amp; Loomis Ice Co. v.

This correspondence particularly referred to the agreement between the parties. Nor was the rejection of Weissinger’s testimony error.
