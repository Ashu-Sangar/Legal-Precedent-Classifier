At the same time he owned and managed a pawnbroker’s shop. In 1922 a charge of receiving stolen goods was lodged against him while engaged in the latter capacity, and a conviction resulted, affirmed on appeal: Com. v. Wolfe, <a href="/pa-super/81/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="81 Pa. Super. 512" data-case-ids="655642" data-case-paths="/pa-super/81/0512-01">81 Pa. Superior Ct. 512</a>. A pardon was granted by the Governor on July 3, 1924, before the completion of service of the minimum sentence imposed. In November of the same year, the Law Association presented a petition asking that his name be stricken from the roll of attorneys, on the ground that the proven conduct disclosed unfitness to continue in practice. On December 29, 1925, an order was entered disbarring the respondent (Wolfe’s Disbarment, 7 Pa. D. &amp; C. R. 71), and the present appeal raises the question of the correctness of that decree.</p>

The court’s determination of the facts shown can be best stated in its words as set forth in the opinion filed: “We have considered [the] evidence with care, and are forced to the conclusion that, prior to his indictment, the respondent, in addition to his activities as a practicing attorney, conducted the business of a pawnbroker; that in this business he made a practice of receiving stolen goods from known thieves; that he represented himself <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>as able in Ms professional capacity, to aid them in procuring immunity from the law, should their criminal acts be detected, and thereby encouraged and solicited further business of this unlawful character; and that his conduct in this respect was deliberate and systematic.”</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[278,677,1151,857]]]'>Our examination of the record convinces us the findings as quoted were justified, and, unless some of the legal reasons advanced make improper the entry of the order disbarring Wolfe, the decree appealed from should be affirmed. Before admission to the bar the court must be satisfied of the moral fitness of an applicant, and, if it subsequently learns that the attorney is no longer to be trusted, it becomes its duty on proper application, to see that he ceases to be held out as worthy of professional employment: Davies’s Case, <a href="/pa/93/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="93 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="442143" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0116-01">93 Pa. 116</a>. The exercise of this power is inherent in the court, and not limited by reason of the legislative provision for summary proceedings, where money of a client has been improperly retained, especially directed by the Act of 1834 (April 14, P.

Courts can command public confidence only as those who serve therein are themselves observant of the law which it is the duty of the courts to enforce. In his high office the attorney is a minister of justice; he ceases so to be when, whether in the line of his professional work or outside of it, he prostitutes his knowledge of the law and the skill he has <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>acquired therein to thwart the law hy deceit and falsehood in its one and only purpose, viz: to accomplish distributive justice among men.” So this court has held that a practitioner, who conspired to fraudulently conceal assets from a trustee in bankruptcy should be disbarred, and a like conclusion was reached where the evidence disclosed the encouragement of others to violate a federal statute: Margolis’s Case, <a href="/pa/269/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="269 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="1063513" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0206-01">269 Pa. 206</a>.</p>

The court was really called on there to decide the effect of the passage of a federal act compelling attorneys admitted to the United States courts to take oaths that they had not borne arms against the government during the Civil War. This legislation was held to be ex post facto, and therefore void as to one already practicing. Such conclusion finds apparent support in Dent v.

S. 265</a>, more clearly meets the present situation, when it was said: “The proceeding [to disbar] is in its nature civil, and collateral to any criminal proceeding by indictment. The proceeding is not for the purpose of punishment but for the purpose of preserving the courts of justice from the official ministrations of persons unfit to practice in them.”</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[272,1379,1152,1019]],["BL_359.1",359,[71,336,1155,535]]]'>Though the decisions in the various states are not in harmony as to the effect of the exercise of executive grace on a convicted defendant, when subsequent disbarment proceedings are instituted, the weight of authority is to the effect that such action does not make it improper for the court to proceed. The generally accepted rule has been thus stated: “In a proceeding to disbar an attorney on the ground that he has been convicted of a crime, the fact that he may have been restored to his rights of citizenship by pardon, by serving out his term of imprisonment, or by the payment of a fine is not, in most jurisdictions, a defense to proceedings for disbarment”: 6 C. J. 587; 2 R. C. L. 1102; Annotated Cases, 1917A, note 1226. Pertinent authorities upholding the right to proceed will be found at the pages referred to. It may be observed that it is the rule approved in New York, Illinois, California, Colorado, Oregon and Kentucky, where the question has been considered. The decisions to the contrary in Texas and Maine <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>can be readily distinguished. In the first the proceeding was set aside because based on the record of the conviction, and in the second because of delay in instituting the action. Acquittal of a criminal charge in Pennsylvania is no defense to actions where the misconduct under investigation shows unfitness of the attorney to be entrusted with the powers and obligations of his profession, and there is no reason why the pardon should have greater effect. It was so held without discussion in Ingersoll’s Case, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%2018" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 18">1 W. N. C. 18</a>.</p>
