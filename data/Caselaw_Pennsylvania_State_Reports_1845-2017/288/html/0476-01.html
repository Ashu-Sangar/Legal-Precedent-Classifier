Miller, deceased; the court below sustained the probate, refusing to submit to a jury the evidence relied on by contestants; hence the present appeal.</p>

When the answer to this question is in the affirmative, the judgment appealed from will not be disturbed.” This decision has been followed in numerous subsequent cases (as may be seen by consulting Shepard’s Pa. Supreme Court Citations), and, when the test therein stated is applied to the evidence now before us, we cannot say that the conclusion reached by the court below as to the validity of the will is unsustainable; on the contrary, considering the unfavorable impression which many of the witnesses called by appellants made upon the judge of the court below, who saw and heard them, the conclusion under attack is an entirely reasonable one. Further discussion would serve no useful purpose.</p>
