        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nWhile the codicil is somewhat obscure, yet when read in connection with the original will of Alexander W. Tidball, deceased, it is plain that the contingent character of Mr. Fife\u2019s estate was not iutended to be changed. The preferred object of testator\u2019s bounty was his daughter, Mrs. Fife, and her children. It was only in the event of her dying without children, or her husband surviving, that the latter could by any possibility become entitled to a life estate in severalty and possession. Mrs. Fife living, his interest was purely contingent; if she survived him, or die leaving children, it could never vest in-possession, but must thereupon end; and there need be no citation of authorities to show that the benefits so intended for testator\u2019s daughter and her children could not be taken away and given to Mr. Fife, a stranger in blood, without express words, or necessary implication.\nIt is conceded by appellant that the effect of the codicil was to enlarge the quantum of Mr. Fife\u2019s estate; but did it revoke the double contingency so that he took a vested fee in remainder dependent on the,life of his wife? It is insisted on the part of the plaintiffs that this is implied in the use of the word \u201ccanceled.\u201d But if the parenthetical clause be stricken out in accordance with this suggestion, and the codiciliary provision substituted, the result would be insensible. The devise would then \u201c read\u201d : \u201c To my daughter Margaret, the mansion house .... to be used and controlled by her and her husband during her lifetime for their own benefit and advantage .... (my son-in-law, Samuel Fife, instead of only having a life estate in it, shall own and possess it as his own without let or hindrance. . . . ).\u201d It will be seen at a glance that this \u201creading\u201d must be abandoned. It is clear that the codicil cannot operate by way of cancellation and substitution.\nOn the other hand, if the purpose of the codicil was that of alteration simply, and the parenthetical clause be filled, it ought to furnish the measure of change. \u201cI-hereby \u201d says the testator, \u201c alter that part of (my) will .... in parenthesis, so that it shall read that my son-in-law, Samuel Fife, instead of only having a life estate in it, shall own and possess it as his own without let or hindrance.\u201d The \u201c life estate,\u201d it will be seen, is here made the starting point of alteration. \u201c Instead \u201d of this, Mr. Fife \u201cshall own and possess\u201d what? Certainly nothing which can avail as against Mrs. Fife or her children. As they had been by express words made preferred devisees, the presumption must be that they would so continue until they should be displaced by equivalent phrase, and none such was used. There are neither express words nor necessary implication of alteration as respects them. Even were the matter in doubt, the doubt must be resolved in their favor. If the clause of alteration be operative at all, it can only be so as against those whose interests had been postponed to Mr. Fife\u2019s \u201c life estate.\u201d\nSo far as appears therefore on the face of the codicil, Mrs. Fife and her children are still preferred devisees, and the double contingency, upon the happening of which Mr. Fife could take any interest in remainder, remains unaltered. If he should die leaving his wife or she should leave children, whatever interest he has, whether under the will or codicil, must thereupon end. Mr. and Mrs. Fife can of course convey such limited interest as they have; but cannot warrant as against the possibility of issue, nor as against the children of testator\u2019s son Alexander and daughter Rachel who have not been made parties to this proceeding. It follows that they cannot convey a good title to the land which was the subject of devise, and hence the judgment of the court below must be reversed. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to express any opinion as to the question of sufficiency in the form of the deed tendered.\nJudgment reversed, and judgment on the ease stated is now entered in favor of defendant with costs.",

Miller, Appellant.\n[Marked to be reported.]\nWill\u2014 Codicil\u2014Life-estate\u2014Marketable tille.\nTestator by his will directed as follows: \u201cTo my daughter Margaret I will the mansion, house, already mentioned, and with it fifty acres of land and twenty-three pei'ches, more or less, to be used and controlled by her and her husband during her lifetime for their own benefit and advantage, subject, however, to the dower already mentioned, and to the legacies yet to be mentioned (and in case she dies without children her husband, if he survive her, shall have the use of it for his benefit during his lifetime, and then it is my will that it shall go to and be inherited by my grandchildren, viz: The children of my son Alexander and daughter Rachel, both deceased, to be theirs and their heirs after them forever, and to be divided amongst them in equal proportions.) \u201d By a codicil he directed as follows: \u201cCodicil. 1st. I hereby alter that part of the will at the end of the twenty-second line, that now is canceled, to the middle of the thirty-second line, marked in parenthesis, so that it shall read that my son-in-law, Samuel Fife, instead of only having a life estate in it, shall possess it as his own without let or hindrance, except as subject to the legacies, of which he is to bear his part, as mentioned in the body of this will.\u201d Held (1) that, under the will, Samuel Fife would only be entitled to take in case he survived his wife, or she died without children, and that no change was effected by the codicil as to the contingency upon which he should take; (2) that Mr. and Mrs. Fife could not together make a marketable title to the land.\nArgued Nov. 5, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 243, Oct. T., 1894, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., July T., 1894, No. 668, on case stated in favor of plaintiffs.\nBefore Stereett, C. J., Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nCase stated to determine the marketability of title to land sold by plaintiffs to defendant in fee.\nPlaintiffs took title to the land under the will of Andrew W. Tidball, the material portions of which are as follows:\n\u201c To my daughter Margaret I will the mansion house, already mentioned, and with it fifty-one acres, twenty-three perches of land, more or less, being the one-half of one hundred and two acres and forty-six perches, as will appear from the plot of said land, to be used and controlled by her and her husband during her lifetime for their own profit and advantage, subject to the dower already mentioned and to the legacies yet to be mentioned (and in case she dies without children, her husband, if he survive her, shall have the use of it for his benefit during his lifetime, and then it is my will that it shall go to and be inherited by my grandchildren, viz, the children of my son Alexander and daughter Rachel, both deceased, to be theirs and their heirs after them forever, and to be divided amongst them in equal proportions).\u201d\nBy codicil he provided as follows:\n\u201c First: I hereby alter that part of will found recorded on second page of this will, and at the end of the twenty-second line that now is canceled to the middle of the thirty-second line marked in parenthesis, so that it shall read that my son-in-law, Samuel Fife, instead of only having a life estate in it, shall own and possess it as his own without let or hindrance, except as subject to the legacies, of which he is to bear his part as mentioned in the body of the will.\u201d\nThe daughter Margaret mentioned in the will, and her husband, testator\u2019s son-in-law, Samuel Fife, are still living, and have no children, and are the plaintiffs in this case.\nThe court entered judgment for plaintiffs on the case stated.\nError assigned was entry of above judgment.\nJ. 0. Boyer, for appellant.\nTestator expressed an intent to make a change in the part of the will inclosed in parenthesis, to \u201c alter \u201d this part of the will, and the change or alteration consists of ah enlargement of the life estate devised to his son-in-law. The word \u201c alter \u201d means \u201c to make a thing different from what it is.\u201d Anderson\u2019s Dict.; Haynes v. State, 15 Ohio St. 455.\nAn instrument of writing cannot at one and the same time be both altered or changed and canceled or stricken out of existence, nor can a written instrument be canceled or stricken out of existence \u201c so that it shall read,\u201d etc.\nThe life estate given by the will, and for which the fee given by the codicil (if the codicil be not void for want of certainty) was substituted, was a contingent life estate. By the codicil this contingent life estate, in remainder, is enlarged to a contingent fee in remainder. To go farther than this is to do violence to the original will and to established rules of construction.\nIf the devise in the will be clear, it is incumbent on those who contend that it is not to take effect by reason of a revocation in the codicil to show that the intention to revoke is equally clear and free from doubt with the original intention to devise, for if there is only a reasonable doubt whether the clause of revocation was intended to include the particular devise, then undoubtedly such devise ought to stand: Hearl v. Hicks, 8 Bing. 475; Murch v. Marchant, 6 M. & G. 813; Robertson v. Powell, 2 H. & C. 762; Barclay v. Maskelyne, 5 Juris. N. S. 12; Butler v. Greenwood, 22 Beav. 303; Pilsworth v. Masse, 14 Ir. Ch. 163; Johns Hopkins University v. Pinkney, 55 Md. 365; Spang v. Hill, 2 Woodw. 45; Lewis\u2019s Ap., 42 Leg. Int. 336; Reichard\u2019s Ap., 116 Pa. 232; Wms. Exrs., 6th Am. ed. 220; 1 Jarm., 6th Am. ed. 145; Quincy, Ex\u2019r, v. Rogers, 9 Cush. 291.\nIt is contended that the codicil should be read into the parenthetical part of paragraph five of the will. This can be done so as to give full effect to the codicil, and at the same time to the provisions of the will or at least to the main intent of the testator: Schreiner\u2019s Ap., 53 Pa. 106.\nThe reading contended for is also in accordance with the rule that, \u201c The disposition of a will will not be disturbed further than to the extent necessary to give effect to the codicil: \u201d Hard v. Ashley, 117 N. Y. 606; 1 Jarm., 6th Am. ed. 139.\nAnd in accordance with the rule that, \u201c the heir at law will not be disinherited by anything less than a clearly apparent intention to pass the estate to another line of succession : \u201d Faulstich\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 188; Cowles v. Cowles, 53 Pa. 175; France\u2019s Est., 75 Pa. 220; Rupp v. Eberly, 79 Pa. 141; Bender v. Dietrich, 7 W. & S. 284; Howard v. American Peace Society, 49 Me. 288; 1 Jarm. 165.\nAlex. Grilfillan, for appellees.\nThe manner of erasure and cancellation is not material, provided the intention to destroy and revoke the parts of the will so canceled be glaring. It is solely a question of intention: Evans\u2019s Ap., 58 Pa. 238; Fuguet\u2019s Will, 11 Phila. 75; Warner v. Warner, 37 Vt. 362.\nThe cancellation of a portion of the devises in the body of a will, leaving it otherwise complete, with the declaration of intention by testator to annul only what was canceled, leaves the residue a valid will: 1 Wms. Exrs. 179.\nA will and codicil are to be construed as one instrument, and are to be reconciled if possible, but if plainly inconsistent the codicil must prevail, and it is held that the determination expressed by a codicil to alter the will in a specific' particular, negatives by implication any intention to alter it in other respects: Schouler on Wills, 487.\nA codicil will stand even if inconsistent and repugnant to a clause in the will, and in so far as it is inconsistent with the will it will act as a revocation : 3 A. & E. Ency. L. 296.'\nWhere there is a codicil, that and the will are to be construed in reference to each other to determine from change of circumstances, or otherwise, what it is intended to alter, and what to retain and confirm: Quincy v. Rogers, 9 Cush. 295; Bedloe v. Homer, 16 Gray, 432; Wetmore v. Parker, 52 N. Y. 450; 1 Jarm. 196.\nIt is the established rule not to disturb the dispositions of the will further than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the codicil: Kline\u2019s Ap., 86 Pa. 363; Reck\u2019s Ap., 78 Pa. 435; 3 A. & E. Ency. L. 294.\nJan. 7, 1895:"
