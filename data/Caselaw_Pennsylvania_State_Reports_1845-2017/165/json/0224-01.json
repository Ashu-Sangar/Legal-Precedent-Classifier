        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nIn the indictment before us the Burgess and Town Council of the Borough of Leechburg are charged in due Jorm with maintaining a common nuisance, the nature and character of which are fully set forth in that instrument. As described in the indictment, and by the first witness examined on the trial, the purposes fox\u2019, and the manxxer in which, the sewer in question was used, and the filthy condition in which the defendants permitted it to remain, made it exceedingly offensive to everybody in the neighborhood axid rendered it a veritable disease and death-breeding nuisance.\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the persons named in the indictment, as then being the burgess aixd councilmen of said borough, were indicted as individuals and not in their corporate capacity.\nIn 1850, the town of Leechburg was erected into a borough, by the name, style and title of the \u201c Burgess and Town Couxxcil of the Borough of Leechburg: \u201d Act March 22,1850, P. L. 305. In 1888, the borough accepted the provisions of the general borough act of 1851, the 13th section of which invests borough officers with the power \u201c to prohibit arxd remove .... any nuisance or offensive matter, whether in the highways or in public or private grounds; \u201d and section 17 of same act gives them power \u201c to make such other regulations as may be necessary foi; the health and cleanlixless of the borough.\u201d It does not appear that any such regulations were ever made. The power to abate the nuisance complained of was therefore exclusively in the defendants; and oxx them, as burgess and councilmen of the borough, rested the public duty of abating it. Their neglect to do so was a misdemeanor, punishable by indictment, etc. It would be a bad state of affairs if the law were otherwise. The principle is thus stated in Dillon on Municipal Corporations, sec. 932: \u201c Corporations are generally regarded as indictable for misfeasance, as well as non-feasance, respecting duties of a public nature plainly enjoined by the legislature for the benefit of the public. The modern view is to assimilate corporations, as to their duties and responsibilities, so far as possible, to individuals. It is admitted that they cannot be indicted for felonies, but it is clear that they may be indicted for acts done to the injury and annoyance of the public, and which amount to a nuisance.\u201d Where duties of a public nature are imposed upon municipal corporations, they are liable to indictment for neglecting to properly discharge such duties : 15 Am. & Eng. Enc. of Law, 1196,1197, Wartman v. Philadelphia, 33 Pa. 202, 210.\nThe indictment was based upon the return made by the borough constable to the court of quarter sessions. It was his duty to make the return, and while it was informal, as many of such returns are, it was deemed sufficient by the court, and we are not prepared to say it was insufficient. It was made under oath and, in answer to the question: \u201c Any other violation of law?\u201d the constable\u2019s reply was: \u201cYes; see notice hereto attached.\u201d The notice being thus, in effect, made part of his return, the latter was sufficient to support the indictment.\nThere is no merit in the last specification of error. For aught that appears, the defendants were all in office when they were found guilty of maintaining the nuisance. If, as to some of them, their terms of office subsequently expired, it may be a sufficient reason why that part of the sentence,\u2014requiring abatement of the nuisance,\u2014cannot be enforced against them, but it is no good reason why they should not be compelled to comply with so much of the sentence as relates to payment of costs. The court below will see that no injustice is done either of them in that regard.\nNeither of the assignments of error is sustained. They are all sufficiently technical, but lacking in merit.\nJudgment affirmed with costs to be paid by appellants; and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court below, to the end that the sentence (as far as practicable) may be enforced.",

T., 1894, by defendants, from judgment of Q. S. Armstrong Co., Sept. T., 1893, No. 88, on verdict of guilty.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nIndictment for nuisance.\nFrom the record it appeared that at June Term, 1893, the constable of the borough of Leechburg made return to the court of quarter sessions which was in part as follows :\n\u201c The undersigned, constable of the borough of Leechburg, in said county, respectfully makes return as follows:\n\u201c16th Question: Any other violation of law? Answer: Yes. See notice hereto attached.\u201d\nTo the return was an affidavit by the constable as to performance of his duties under the liquor license laws and that \u201c there is no place where said laws are violated except such as are hereinbefore returned and that I do not know of any other violation.\u201d\nThe notice attached to the constable\u2019s return was as follows:\n\u201cN. K. Coller, Esq.,\n\u201c Constable, Leechburg, Pa.\n\u201c You will please make the following return to the next Court of Quarter Sessions of Armstrong County :\n\u201c That the sewer running from the north side of Main street, at the residence of John Taylor and the M. E. Church, and crossing said street and running west to Second street, thence south along Second street to the Kiskiminetas river, being partly covered and partly open, into which is dumped and drained all the filth and offal from a large area, and from water closets, etc., and is a veritable cess pool, disease and death breeder, and we believe has produced within the year, along its borders, 25 cases typhoid fever, 12 cases diphtheria and 7 deaths, and that the same is kept and maintained by the Borough Burgess and Council, namely: E. Bredin, Burgess; J. C. Kirkpatrick, A. Hicks, Alex. Wilson, Isaac Milliken, John True, J. C. McGeary, Councilmen.\u201d With the names and occupation of 15 citizens appended.\nAn indictment based upon this return was prepared by the district attorney, and the grand jury found a true bill against defendants.\nDefendants moved to quash the indictment for the following reasons:\n\u201c 1. A municipal corporation cannot be indicted for maintaining a nuisance where said corporation is a borough, incorporated and acting under the general borough law of 1851.\u201d\n\u201c 2. The individual members of the town council and the burgess, cannot as such, be indicted for maintaining a nuisance which is maintained by the borough whose officers they are.\u201d\n\u201c 3. The alleged return of the constable upon which the indictment in this case is based is insufficient to sustain an indictment.\u201d\n\u25a0 The court overruled the motion to quash, and the case went to trial. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.\nThe court sentenced defendants \u201c to pay the costs and abate the nuisance.\u201d\nErrors assigned were (1-3) in overruling grounds for quashing indictment; (4) sentence; quoting reasons and sentence respectively.\nM. F. Leason, for appellants.\nMunicipalities cannot be in-dieted for maintaining a nuisance : Del. Div. Canal Co. v. Com., 60 Pa. 371; Northern Cent. R. R. v. Com., 90 Pa. 305.\nWhere any person has the right to demand the exercise of a public function, and there is an officer or set of officers authorized to exercise that function, there the right and authority give rise to the duty; but where the right depends upon the grant of authority, and that authority is essentially discretionary, no legal dutjr is imposed: Rapho v. Moore, 68 Pa. 404; McDade v. Chester City, 117 Pa. 424; Dil. Mun. Corp. \u00a7 789.\nMunicipal officers are generally liable for indictment for misdemeanor in office; the misdemeanor complained of, however, must be the individual act of the officer, and he is indicted as an individual and not as an officer.\nThe legislature confers certain powers and duties upon the municipal corporation of Leechburg borough and not upon any individual citizen therein ; a failure to perform these duties must be charged to the corporation, and an indictment, if preferred, must be against the corporation by its corporate name: Com. v. Kinports, 12 Pa. C. C. R. 463; Com. v. Lansford Borough, 14 Pa. C. C. R. 376; Uniontown Borough v. Com., 34 Pa. 293.\nThe constable\u2019s return was insufficient to support an indictment: McCullough v. Com., 67 Pa. 30.\nThe present case violates the constitution : Art. 1, \u00a7 8.\nW I). Patton, II. W. Snyder with him, for appellee.\nThe argument that mandamus is the proper remedy is unfounded. This is a public wrong that we are trying to redress. Public nuisances are indictable only, not actionable : Rung v. Shoneberger, 2 Watts, 26; Mechling v. Bridge Co., 1 Grant, 416.\nIn all cases where duties of a public nature are imposed upon municipal corporations, such corporations are liable to indictment if they fail to discharge those duties according to law: 15 A. & E. Ency. L. 1196 and note 2, 1197 and note 1.\nThe borough authorities having once erected a sewer are liable like an individual for any negligent omission of duty: 6 A. & E. Ency. L. 24, 28; Angell & Ames, Corp. \u00a7 394.\nWhen the injury is common to all the citizens, then the source of complaint becomes a common nuisance and the rule of law is clear that the remedy must be by indictment: Marriot v. Mayor, 66 Am. R. 331.\nDefendants are indictable as the Burgess and Town Council of Leechburg Borough, giving the individual names of the Burgess and Town Councils: Act of March 22, 1850, P. L. 305; 2 Whart. Precedents for Indictments, 788; Edge v. Com., 7 Pa. 275. '\nA constable is bound to present to the term or last court all offences inquirable in those courts: 2 Hawk. P. C. 10, \u00a7 34 McCullough v. Com., 67 Pa. 32; Davidson v. Com., 5 Cent. R. 484; Com. v. Green, 126 Pa. 531.\nJan. 7, 1895:"
