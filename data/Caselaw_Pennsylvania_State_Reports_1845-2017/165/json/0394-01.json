Henry Stewart et al., Appellants.\nAffidavit of defence\u2014Contract\u2014Paving\u2014Arbitration\u2014Engineer\u2014Fraud \u2014Waiver of negligence and mistakes.\nWhere the parties to a paving contract agree that \u201c to prevent all disputes and litigation \u201d the decision of the city engineer, as to any of the matters referred to in the contract, should \u201c be final and conclusive,\u201d an affidavit of defence in an action for the cost of the paving is insufficient which avers that the city engineer was negligent, careless and made mistakes. When the parties agreed to make the engineer\u2019s decision final and conclusive, they waived the risk of negligence and mistakes.\nArgued Oct. 24, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 106, Oct. T., 1894, by defendants, from order of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny County, Oct. Term, 1898, No. 535, making absolute a rule for judgment for want* of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nBefore Sterrett, O. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover contract price for paving a portion of Versailles avenue in the city of McKeesport.\nFrom the record it appeared that the contract under which the work was done, contained a clause making the city engineer\u2019s decision final.\nDefendants filed, an affidavit of defence in which they averred that plaintiffs had violated their contract in many essential particulars ; that the estimate of the engineer employed by them showed that the entire grading of the avenue did not exceed 13,961 cubic yards, while the city engineer\u2019s estimates for the grading amounted to 25,195 cubic yards; and that on a street 3,280 feet in length, and 50 feet in width, defendants\u2019 engineer found that 1,237 lineal feet of curbing was soft common sandstone, and not at all according to the specifications; that he also made a test of the brick used and found that from one fourth to one third of the brick was defective and was only ordinary fire brick, pervious to water and easily disintegrated by frost and sun, wholly \u2022 unfit for the purpose and already showing manifest evidence of decay.\nOn a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence the following opinion was filed by White, J.:\n\u201c The resolution of the city councils granting permission to the defendants (or the property-holders represented by the defendants) \u2018to contract for, and have graded, curbed and paved with fire brick at their own expense,\u2019 Versailles avenue, expressly provided that it should be done \u2018 under the direction of the city engineer,\u2019 and he was \u2018 directed to see that the work is properly done.\u2019 Under this resolution the defendants made the contract with the plaintiffs to do the work.\n\u201c The contract was very full and specific, describing in detail all materials and work. Section 4\u00b1 provided that \u2018To prevent all disputes and litigation it is further agreed by and between the parties to this contract that the engineer shall in all cases determine the quantity and quality of the several kinds of work which are to be paid for under this contract, and their decision shall be final and conclusive in the premises; and they shall determine all questions in relation to lines, levels and dimensions of the work, or as to the interpretation of the plans and specifications.\u2019\n\u201c The comprehensive language of this section covers all questions or disputes that might arise between the contracting parties, and is also conclusive upon the city. It embraces materials as well as work, for it embraces all \u2018 which are to be paid for under this contract.\u2019 The cit}r engineer was made the final arbiter in all matters.\n\u201c The affidavit of claim avers that theplaintiffs performed said contract, under the directions of F. W. Patterson, city engineer of said city, and to his satisfaction; . . . . that at the completion of the work, the said engineer made a final estimate thereof, showing the amounts due plaintiffs; . . . . and plaintiffs, during the year following the completion of the work, made all repairs required by said engineer.\u2019 None of these averments is denied in the affidavit of defence.\n\u201c The contention of the defendants is, that the engineer was negligent and careless in superintending the work, and making his estimates; that some of the materials\u2014bricks and curbstones\u2014are not the kinds required in the contract; that the foundation of the brick pavement is not in accordance with the contract; that his estimates for grading and other work are excessive.\n\u201cThe affidavit also states that the defendants made complaint of these matters to the city engineer during the progress of the work, and after its completion; that the engineer made some correction in his estimates. It thus appears that the city engineer, the arbiter appointed in this contract, was appealed to upon these disputed questions, and he passed upon them. Is not his decision final and conclusive ?\n\u201cThe measurements and calculations of Mr. Taylor, an engineer employed by the defendants, differ considerably from those of the city engineer. Which is correct ? It was for this, very purpose of preventing just such \u2018 disputes,\u2019 and avoiding \u2018litigation,\u2019 that the parties agreed that the city engineer\u2019s \u2018 decision shall be final and conclusive in the premises.\u2019\n\u201c There is no allegation of fraud or collusion between the city engineer and the plaintiffs. The only averments are that the city engineer was negligent and careless and made mistakes. Take all the facts set forth in the affidavit of defence and they amount to nothing more than this. When the parties agreed to make his decision final and conclusive, they waived the risk of negligence and mistakes.\n\u201c The principle governing cases of this kind has been sustained by numerous decisions, from Monongahela Nav. Co. v. Fenlon, 4 W. & S. 205, to Hart\u00fcpee v. City of Pittsburg, 131 Pa. 535. Fraud will impeach and set aside any award or judgment. But it must be an \u2018 actual and intentional \u2019 fraud, as said in Hostetter v. City of Pittsburg, 107 Pa. 419, \u2018 and not constructive, such as flows from an erroneous or unjust judgment. Partiality and some improper conduct of the arbitrator in making the award will not impeach it unless the party benefited thereby be implicated in that misconduct.\u2019\n\u201c Rule for judgment made absolute.\u201d\nFrror assigned was above order.\ntT.

Pittsburg, 107 Pa. 417; Hartupee v. Pittsburg, 131 Pa. 535.\nJan. 7, 1895:"
