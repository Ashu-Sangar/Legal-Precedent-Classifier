Evan Jones, Appellant.\nTrespass\u2014Damages\u2014Evidence.\nIn an action of trespass against a contractor engaged in grading a street, to recover damages for filling in a part of defendant\u2019s lot and destroying his vegetables and fences, evidence that the lot was benefited by the fill is inadmissible.\nArgued Nov. 2, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 242, Oct. T., 1894, by-defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., April T., 1891, No. 785, on verdict for plaintiffs.\nBefore Green, Williams, Mitchell, Dean, and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass quare clausum fregit. Before Macee, J.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 statement claimed to recover damages to vegetables and fence, and averred that defendant spoiled the soil of the close, and by reason of the premises plaintiff\u2019s close became injured in value, and other wrongs and injuries to plaintiff\u2019s close then and there did, to the damage of plaintiffs, etc.\nAt the trial it appeared that defendant was a contractor engaged in grading Omega street. Plaintiffs offered evidence tending to show that defendant, while engaged in grading the street, broke down the fence around plaintiffs\u2019 lot, and filled in a portion of the lot, destroying the vegetables growing thereon.\nDefendant presented this point :\n\u201c If the benefits to the plaintiffs\u2019 lot resulting from the filling in of dirt thereon by defendant equaled or were greater than the amount of damage done, there can be no recovery by the plaintiffs in this action for more than nominal damages. Answer: This point is refused. The issue involved in this trial does not relate to the filling in of dirt on the lot o'f the plaintiffs except in so far as it affects the destruction of plaintiffs fences and the vegetables on the lot as a trespass committed by the defendant, and the advantage to the lot, which might arise from a fill, is not an element which enters into the question in this case.\u201d\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiffs. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was above instruction, quoting it.\nCharles W. Jones, for appellant,\ncited: Ry. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 325 ; Sedgwick on Damages, \u00a7\u00a7 63, 1125 ; Murphy v.
