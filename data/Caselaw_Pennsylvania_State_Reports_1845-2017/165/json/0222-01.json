        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Fell,\nThis appeal is by the commonwealth from an order of the court of quarter sessions made in arrest of judgment. The defendant was charged in the first count with fornication and bastardy, and in the second with incestuous fornication and bastardy, and was found guilty in manner and form as indicted.\nIt is difficult to understand upon what view of the law the action of the court in arresting judgment was based. The causes assigned constitute no valid reason for interference by the court, and the reasons stated in the opinion throw little light upon the subject, and are wholly untenable. That it appeared at the trial that the defendant had been guilty of three offences, and had not been indicted for the greatest of them, did not prevent his conviction of the two covered by the counts.\nThe case presents the anomaly of an arrest of judgment not for defects appearing upon the record, but for causes entirely foreign to it. The indictment was in proper form, nor is it suggested that its averments were not fully sustained by the testimony, and unless tlie defendant was to go free there was no alternative but to enter judgment on the verdict. In any subsequent attempt to convict tbe defendant of adultery the prosecution would be met with the difficulty that the substantial offence was the same in each charge, and that the evidence necessary to support the second indictment was sufficient to convict, on the first. See Com. v. Arner, 149 Pa. 85. There was no sufficient- ground for the arrest of judgment.\nThe judgment is reversed and tbe record remitted to the court of quarter sessions to proceed to sentence according to law.",

T., 1894, by Commonwealth, from order of Q. S. Armstrong Co., Dec. T., 1892, No. 79,.arresting judgment on a verdict of guilty.\nBefore' Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nIndictment for fornication and bastardy and for incestuous fornication and bastardy. Before Rayburn, P. J.\nDefendant\u2019s points were as follows:\n\u201c 1. It being clearly proven by the defendant and admitted by the commonwealth that the defendant was a married man at the time the offence is charged to have been committed, their verdict must be not guilty.\u201d Refused.\n\u201c 2. The indictment charging fornication and bastardy, and the defendant being a married man, he cannot be convicted under this indictment.\u201d Refused.\n3. As to the second count he cannot be convicted under the evidence.\u201d Refused.\n\u201c 4. That under all the evidence the defendant cannot be convicted under this indictment.\u201d Refused.\nA motion was made to quash the second count in the indictment for the reason that it is not supported by the information, the information charging nothing but \u201cfornication and bastardy,\u201d and nowhere charging incest or relationship. This motion to quash was overruled, to be considered on a motion in arrest of judgment or for a new trial.\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty.\nA motion in arrest of judgment was made for the following reasons: \u201c1. That the court overruled the motion to quash the second count of the indictment. (2) That the court refused the points submitted by defendant for the instruction of the jury.\u201d\nThe opinion of the court below was as follows :\n\u201cThe position of counsel for defendant we think well taken. It appeared upon the trial of the cause that the defendant was a married man at the time of the commission of the alleged offence. The indictment charged defendant in the first count with fornication and bastardy; in the second count with incestuous fornication. The act of assembly making illicit intercourse a crime sets forth in distinct terms what shall constitute fornication. And the same act in another section sets forth in like distinct terms what shall constitute the crime of adultery. The defendant being a married man, should, in order to be convicted and sentenced, have been indicted for adultery and bastardy and incestuous adultery, and the motion should prevail. And now, February 7,1894, judgment is arrested and the defendant directed to be discharged.\u201d\nErrors assigned were (1) opinion in arrest of judgment; (2) arrest of judgment; quoting opinion, motion, indictment, points, answers and decree.\nW.
