        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Mitchell,\nPlaintiffs offered in evidence their abstract whereupon defendants admitted title in Hartzell. Plaintiffs then proved the lease by Hartzell to them, their entry under it, and the putting down of one well. They thus made out a complete prima facie case, which called on defendants to show a better title. But it is said, and the court below appears to have adopted this view, that plaintiffs went further and gave evidence of an abandonment of their possession. This however will not support a compulsory nonsuit. Abandonment is a mixed question of acts and intention, and therefore is ordinarily for the jury, and there is nothing in this case to take it out of the rule, for the abandonment was denied in plaintiffs\u2019 abstract, and was therefore incumbent on defendants to prove before they could avail themselves of it. Whether the evidence on the part of plaintiffs showed an abandonment by them did not depend exclusively on the length of time that operations had ceased but also on the intention, and that again was largely dependent on the \u2022agreement and understanding of the parties. The plaintiffs \u25a0denied the intention and the court therefore could not declare the abandonment as a matter of law but should have left it as \u25a0 a fact to the jury.\nThe plaintiffs further offered evidence by Burton and Hart-.zell to show the agreement of the parties as to due diligence \u2022 and abandonment. This should have been admitted. It was \u2022not in any sense an attempt to modify or alter a written contract. The lease provided that the work when commenced \u25a0should \u201cbe prosecuted with due diligence until completion or \u2022abandonment,\u201d but what should constitute due diligence was .a question of fact on which the parties might agree, either at the time or afterwards, and if they did, then neither court nor jury \u00a1had any right to adopt a different standard. If due diligence lhad been defined in the writing no pretence of such right could ihave been set up. But parol proof of the understanding and \u25a0agreement of both parties was just as effective as a writing, for it went not to a construction of the paper, but to the definition \u25a0of a fact referred to. Whether any such understanding not expressed in the paper would affect others subsequently acquiring rights from one of the parties, without notice, we need not consider, for there is no evidence that any such others are before us. The ease was not allowed to get that far.\nBut the nonsuit was erroneous for another reason. Even if there had been a want of due diligence and an abandonment by plaintiffs, no one could take advantage of it but the lessor or one succeeding to his rights, and there was no such party yet in the case. So far as the evidence showed, defendants had neither Hartzell\u2019s title nor any other beyond that of mere squatters. As against them plaintiffs as already shown had made out a prima facie case. The error of the appellees, and apparently of the court below, was in regarding the estate of plaintiffs under the lease as terminated ipso facto by the failure in diligence or the abandonment. But it required the act of the lessor. Repeated decisions of this court from Wills v. Gas Co., 130 Pa. 222, to Cochran v. Pew, 159 Pa. 184, have established that the clause of forfeiture or termination of the estate is for his benefit, and no act of the lessee can produce that result without his concurrence. Still less can any action of a stranger enforce it. As against any but the grantor, an abandonment is not complete until the statutory period of limitation, or the end of the term granted, and possession may be resumed by the grantee at any time previous.\nThere is nothing in the cases cited, Munroe v. Armstrong, 96 Pa. 307, and Venture Oil Co. v. Fretts, 152 Pa. 451, in conflict with these views. In the former the lessor had expressly declared the forfeiture and made a new lease to the plaintiff, and in the latter he had asserted it by implication by a new lease to parties who defended under his title.\nBut it is said that appellees here defend under Hartzell\u2019s title, and that their abstract shows the fact. The abstract however was not in evidence as it should have been if relied on for affirmative proof. The practice in the analogous case of statements and affidavits of defence, which under rule of court are to be taken as admissions of all material facts not denied therein, is shown in Neely v. Bair, 144 Pa. 250. The respective abstracts of title in ejectment filed by the parties under the rule of court in the present case, stand upon the same basis, having the same object as stated by the present Chief Justice in Neely v. Bair, to narrow the trial down to material matters which are really disputed. The defendants may be in possession under Hartzell\u2019s title, and the case therefore analogous tq Venture Oil Co. v. Fretts, but it has not yet been shown to be so. The issue was determined prematurely.\nJudgment reversed, and procedendo awarded.",

An entry of nonsuit under such circumstances would be a premature determination of the issue.\nArgued Oot. 17, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 253, Oct. T., 1894, by-plaintiffs from judgment of O. P. Butler Co., June T., 1892, entering a nonsuit in favor of defendant.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nEjectment for land covered by oil lease. Before Greer, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that, on Sept; 8,1888, J. A. Hartzell leased to plaintiffs seventy acres of land for oil purposes. The lease was for the term of ten years. By the terms of the contract plaintiffs were to commence operations for mining purposes within thirty days from the execution of the lease, and when work was commenced it was to be prosecuted with due diligence until completion or abandonment. Plaintiffs commenced operations upon the land within fifteen days after the execution of the lease and drilled a well, finishing it the latter part of October, 1888. Defendants in their abstract of title claimed title under Hartzell, by lease dated in 1891, and averred that plaintiffs had abandoned their rights under their lease. Plaintiffs filed a counter abstract in which they denied that they had abandoned or surrendered the lease.\nPlaintiffs gave in evidence their abstract and lease.\nPlaintiffs then proposed to show by W. \u00abT. Burton that about January, 1890, Hartzell, the lessor, recognized the validity of the lease and entered into negotiations with plaintiffs for the surrender of the lease, and recognized their right to it and waived any claim to abandonment. Defendant objects because the offer to show that Hartzell recognized the lease without showing how he recognized it, to show that he entered into negotiations for the surrender of it without showing with whom, to show that he waived the abandonment of the lease without offering to show how, would be objected to in any case, but it is objected to now because there is no offer to show that notice of the arrangement, recognition or waiver was given to defendant. Objection sustained and exception. [1]\nJ. A. Hartzell, a witness for plaintiff, was asked: After they (plaintiffs) had drilled that well, from that time on as long as you knew this property, state whether you attempted to forfeit the lease in any way, or made any claim that it had been-lost or abandoned by the Farmers\u2019 Oil Company. Objected to because as a fact that covers a space in which the court has already ruled this testimony as incompetent, and because what, he may have done or not have done, not being communicatedi to Mr. Phillips, is incompetent. Objection sustained and exception. [2]\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit and subsequently-refused to take it off. Plaintiffs appealed.\nFrrors assigned were (1, 2) rulings on .evidence, quoting-bills of exception.; (3) refusal to take off nonsuit.\nT. Q. Campbell, Lev. McQuistion, W. A.
