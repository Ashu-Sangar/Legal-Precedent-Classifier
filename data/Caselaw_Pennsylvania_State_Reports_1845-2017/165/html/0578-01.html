The defendant said “ If your leather is thoroughly tanned,” etc. The word “if” made the order conditional and when the plaintiffs shipped leather after that, to the defendant, it was upon the express condition that it should be “ thoroughly tanned.” As we understand the correspondence this condition attached to all shipments to be made subsequently thereto. We have no hesitation in placing the contract within the line of cases illustrated by Phila. &amp; Read. Coal &amp; Iron Company v.

Mr. Justice Paxson, delivering the opinion, said, “The acceptance of the plaintiff’s offer was an agreement to send him a car load of good salable corn, and not a car load of corn generally, without regard to quality, as was assumed by the referee.

There were special reasons why the defendant was obliged to have that particular quality of leather. He wanted harness leather and he offered to prove that harness leather must be thoroughly tanned and could not be used as such unless it was. He certainly should have been permitted to make such proof. All the offers of testimony by defendant were rejected. We are clearly of opinion they should all have been received so that the case could go to the jury on its merits. The assignments of error are all sustained.</p>
