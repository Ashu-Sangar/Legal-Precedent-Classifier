P. Fergus signed and became bound to pay, was not the property of R. Burford at the hour or time that this $859 note that is offered as a set-off became the property of Mr. Fergus. They <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>say that R. Burford’s $750 note, which he held against S. P. Fergus,-was assigned to Messrs. Braden and Sprowls before Samuel Fergus got the title to this $859 note. Now, the law, as we understand it, casts the burden on the use plaintiff, if there is a dispute as to the hour of the assignment on this 8d day of June, to show that the assignment of the $750 note was before the time the $859 note was assigned to Fergus. We say the burden of proof is on the use plaintiff.] [1] The law allows a man who owes money on a note to buy the payee’s paper for the purpose of setting it off until he has notice that the title to the note he gave, and the right to collect the money thereon, has passed from the payee into somebody else. He can presume that his note remains in the hands of him to whom he became obligated to pay the money. The defendant in this case had a right to presume that the $750 note was still in the hands of Burford until he had notice that it had left them. Now, the question that arises on this branch of the case is, was this note that Fergus signed and gave to Burford, or the claim or the debt that the note represents, assigned to Mr. Braden and Mr. Sprowls, on a day or at an hour preceding the time that Fergus got the legal title to tile Town note. You have heard the testimony in regard to this dispute and the comments of counsel, and if you are satisfied that Mr. Fergus bought the Town note so as to put the legal title into him, and are satisfied that he bought it and got title before he had any notice of the assignment of the R. Burford note of $750 to Braden and Sprowls, then we say he would have a right to make such purchase, believing that his note still remained in the hands of Burford, and to use it as a set-off against the same. On the other hand, if you are satisfied that Mr. Fergus, or Mr. Don-nan, who appears to have been his active agent in the whole transaction, had notice of the assignment of the Burford note to Mr. Braden and Mr. Sprowls before this title vested in Fergus, then your verdict ought to be for the plaintiff, because Mr. Fergus would be too late in making his purchase, and he could not use his note as a set-off, because, after he had notice, he had no right to buy the note for that purpose.”</p>

It is true that the jury must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was a bona fide holder of the Town note before he or his attorney had notice of the assignment of the Burford note to Braden and Sprowls, but if the defendant has shown to the satisfaction of the jury that he was the bona fide holder of the Town note before his note to Burford became due, then the plaintiff must show that the Burford note was assigned to Braden and Sprowls (if the note does not already appear in the evidence) before the defendant became the bona fide owner of the Town note.” [2]</p>

The action was on a note under seal made by the defendant to the order of R. Burford, the legal plaintiff, and by him assigned to the equitable plaintiffs. The defendant, before suit brought, purchased the overdue note of the legal plaintiff to the order of Town Brothers, and at the trial offered it in evidence under the plea of set-off. • The execution and consideration were admitted as to both notes, but it was claimed <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>bjr the equitable plaintiffs that the defendant had notice of the assignment to them of his note to Burford before he purchased the note of Burford to Town Brothers which he sought to use as a set-off.</p>

The single question related to the burden of proof of the notice of assignment.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.6",338,[259,992,1162,1060]]]'>This was a theoretical rather than a practical question, as the testimony was presented in a regular and orderly manner at the trial and the jury was instructed in a clear and well considered charge which covered the points of the case in the order in which they had arisen, and particular directions were given as to the preponderance of evidence which should influence their finding.' The burden of establishing a fact by proof rests upon the party asserting it. It may be shifted by the pleadings, or changed in the course of the trial by the order in which the testimony is presented. When the plaintiffs put the note in evidence, with the assignment to them, they established prima facie a right of recovery against the defendant. When the defendant offered the Town note with proof of his ownership before suit brought, he established a valid set-off. He could have rested there, as he was not bound to show more. He had answered the plaintiffs’ ease fully. The fact of the assignment to them did not affect the right of set-off; proof of notice of it to the defendant before he acquired the claim used as a set-off would have done so. Proof of no notice was not required to establish the right of set-off, but proof of notice was necessary to defeat the right.</p>

The case is authority for nothing else. The service of the attachment was notice to the garnishee of the interest and equity of the plaintiff and fixed the rights of the parties as of that date, as the service of the summons did here, and the garnishee could defend on no cause of action at that time incomplete.
