Andrew Despar, the defendant, went into the employ of the plaintiff in 1882 as a general hand, doing the hauling, teaming and other work around the establishment, in the hauling of material and the delivering of goods, and had not.a knowledge of the secrets of the business. The defendant had first received $10 per month, and was, at the date of this agreement, in receipt of-$15 a month as wages. Gilbert Frisbee having died shortly before this agreement was made, and the plaintiff, proposing to employ the defendant to aid him in the manufacture, proposed to instruct him in the process, give him the secrets of the business, and to employ him therein at increased wages, there being no definite amount of increased wages agreed on at that time. That agreement was read over to the defendant, was thoroughly explained to him, and -he understood it fully, and knew what he was doing, and why the agreement was made. Thereafter the plaintiff revealed to the defendant the secrets of the business in consideration of that agreement, and raised his wages gradually, until, within a short time, and for years prior to defendant’s leaving plaintiff’s employment, he had been receiving $50 a month, and was furnished steady employment. The defendant, from April, has been using the secrets and formula so obtained under said agreement and employment for his own private use, and has associated himself with one M. B. Moseley, and has been manufacturing, ’ compounding and selling the manufacture under this .secret process, from his knowledge so obtained while in the employ of the plaintiff, and has been selling to the trade, and representing that it ‘ is the same axle grease ’ manufactured by the plaintiff.</p>
