Webb, one of the executors, the last payment being in January, 1892, when Wm. M. Webb told him that they would have to raise some money on the judgment; that they needed money to pay legacies and they would have to sell it. Curry told him that he thought he could pay it, and asked the advantage of lifting it. William then said that Walter Graham was their attorney, and that he (Curry) could see him and make arrangements to pay it as soon as convenient; there was no time set. Curry came to Butler, saw Mr. Graham, the attorney, and told him what William M. Webb had said. Graham .was willing to accept the money and receipt for it, and made arrangements for a meeting of Curry and the executors at Butler. At the time fixed, January 26, 1892, Curry came to Butler, but did not meet the executors. Hearing that John Webb’s wife was to be buried that day, he paid the money to Walter L. Graham, Esq., who gave him a receipt on the docket.

The loan was made by the decedent who took a judgment note for it, payable five years after date, and it did not mature until January 11, 1894. The decedent employed Mr. Graham, a member of the bar, to enter the judgment, and Mr. Graham did so and entered his appearance for the decedent as plaintiff in the judgment. The record remained in this condition until the death of the decedent, Avhich occurred in 1890. The executors employed Mr. Graham as their counsel in the settlement of the estate. During the life of John Webb the interest was paid to him as it fell due, and after his déath several interest payments were made to the executors. In January, 1892, the last of these payments of interest was made to the executors, and Mr. William M. Webb, one of the executors, then told Mr. Curry, the judgment debtor, that they would need some money to pay legacies, and supposed they would have to sell the judgment. Mr. Curry then told Mr. Webb that he would like to have the opportunity of paying the judgment and said he thought he could pay it. Mr. Webb then told Mr. Curry that Mr. Graham was their attorney and he should see him about it, and arrange the payment as soon as was convenient. Afterwards, about January 26,1892, Mr. Curry paid the money to Mr. Graham who thereupon satisfied the judgment of record.</p>

At the meeting before the auditor on October 12th, 1893, both of the executors testified that they had no knowledge of the payment of the money due on the Curry judgment, either when it was paid or afterwards, until they heard of it on that audit.

      <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>The leading case in Pennsylvania on this subject is Calhoun’s Estate, <a href="/watts/6/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="6 Watts 185" data-case-ids="1846025" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0185-01">6 Watts, 185</a>. There the testator had recovered a judgment against solvent debtors and held it at the time of his death. The executors issued a sci. fa. to revive, employing the same counsel who had been employed bjr the testator. Judgment on the sci. fa. was obtained, execution issued and certain lands were levied upon and condemned as the property of the defendants in the judgment. Nothing further was done for several years when another sci. fa. was issued and to that the surviving defendant pleaded payment with leave, and then that proceeding rested. Subsequently other proceedings were had which so resulted that if the money was collected by the counsel of the executors it was embezzled by him, and if not it was lost through his neglect in conducting the proceedings. Testimony was given to show that the attorney had collected the money and used it himself. On the settlement of the executors’ account an attempt was made to surcharge them with the money lost. The orphans’ court surcharged them but this Court reversed the decree and held that the executors were not liable. Mr. Justice Rogers, delivering the opinion, said, “ Thus executors, administrators or trustees acting with good faith, and without any willful default or fraud, will not be responsible for any loss that may arise. All that a court of equity requires from trustees is common skill, common prudence and common caution. Executors, administrators or guardians, are not liable beyond what they <em>actually </em>receive unless in case of gross negligence; for when they act as others do with their own goods and with good faith, and not guilty of gross negligence they are not liable: 1 Penns. Rep. 213, Konigmacher, Appellant, v. Kimmell, Assignee; Thompson v. Brown, Fay and others, 4 Johns. Cha. Rep. 619. A court of equitjr, as is said in Thompson v. Brown, always treated trustees, acting in good faith, with great tenderness. ... In Routh v. Howell, 3 Ves. 567, the same point was ruled. Executors were discharged from liability for a loss arising from the insolvency of a banker whom the testator had trusted and with whom they suffered stock, deposited by the testator, to remain. This principle has an exceedingly strong bearing on the case in hand.” Speaking of the action of the executors it was further said, “ They reposed confidence where the testator had reposed it; for it <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>must not be forgotten that Mr. Wright was the counsel selected by the testator himself. . . . Nor can it affect the liability of the executors whether Mr. Wright received the money or not, nor in what capacity he received it, as they had a right to repose confidence in his skill. The money was lost by his mis conduct, and the cases cited show that trustees who act with good faith, are not liable for such mismanagement of their agents as they can neither foresee nor control.”</p>

The attorney having collected the money and embezzled it, gave the guardian his judgment note for the amount which proved worthless by reason of the maker’s insolvency. In such case the fact that the guardian declined to incur costs in a fruitless effort to enforce payment of the note by ordinary process, or to apply to the court for a rule on the attorney, or to institute a criminal prosecution against him, was not such negligence as would warrant a surcharge of the amount of the note.</p>

They were guilty of no negligence in allowing him to receive it. He was trusted by their testator and their trusting him was no proof of negligence. They were guilty of <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>no willful default and of no fraud. They did not know the money had been collected by him at the time, even when their last account was filed, and at the time of the audit they had ho sufficient opportunity to enforce collection from him by adverse proceedings. They testify that he assured them the money would be forthcoming when the account was confirmed. While that is no excuse for his not paying over the money, it is a reasonable excuse for their not having it at the moment they discovered he had received it, and even at the close of the audit. It is true the orphans’ court referred the matter back to the auditor to hear further testimony, and such testimony was taken in May, 1894. The accountants were then examined in relation to this matter and they gave full testimony upon the whole subject. But for some unaccountable reason they were not asked, by counsel on either side, what was the reason they had not collected the money from Graham, nor whether they had or had not taken any steps to collect it, nor whether Graham was insolvent. This was dereliction on the part of counsel on both sides for which we do not feel disposed to surcharge them at this time. As the asset is one that has not yet been administered it is still the subject of a future accounting to which the executors may yet be summoned by citation, when the whole subject can, and certainly ought to be thoroughly investigated, especially the question-of Graham’s solvency. We only decide now that on the present state of the record we do not think the executors should be surcharged with this debt. Should they fail to show hereafter that they could not have collected the money after they were informed of its payment to Graham, a very grave question as to their liability to be surcharged will arise. If any false sentiment about exposing the insolvency or dishonesty of their own attorney should deter them from a thorough exhibition of the matter they must take without complaining whatever consequences may result.</p>
