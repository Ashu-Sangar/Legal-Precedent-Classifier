Hartzell leased to plaintiffs seventy acres of land for oil purposes. The lease was for the term of ten years. By the terms of the contract plaintiffs were to commence operations for mining purposes within thirty days from the execution of the lease, and when work was commenced it was to be prosecuted with due diligence until completion or abandonment. Plaintiffs commenced operations upon the land within fifteen days after the execution of the lease and drilled a well, finishing it the latter part of October, 1888. Defendants in their abstract of title claimed title under Hartzell, by lease dated in 1891, and averred that plaintiffs had abandoned their rights under their lease. Plaintiffs filed a counter abstract in which they denied that they had abandoned or surrendered the lease.</p>

    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.10",352,[244,572,1174,1059]]]'>Plaintiffs offered in evidence their abstract whereupon defendants admitted title in Hartzell. Plaintiffs then proved the lease by Hartzell to them, their entry under it, and the putting down of one well. They thus made out a complete prima facie case, which called on defendants to show a better title. But it is said, and the court below appears to have adopted this view, that plaintiffs went further and gave evidence of an abandonment of their possession. This however will not support a compulsory nonsuit. Abandonment is a mixed question of acts and intention, and therefore is ordinarily for the jury, and there is nothing in this case to take it out of the rule, for the abandonment was denied in plaintiffs’ abstract, and was therefore incumbent on defendants to prove before they could avail themselves of it. Whether the evidence on the part of plaintiffs showed an abandonment by them did not depend exclusively on the length of time that operations had ceased but also on the intention, and that again was largely dependent on the •agreement and understanding of the parties. The plaintiffs ■denied the intention and the court therefore could not declare the abandonment as a matter of law but should have left it as ■ a fact to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.11",352,[242,1640,1172,760]],["BL_353.1",353,[150,374,1164,196]]]'>The plaintiffs further offered evidence by Burton and Hart-.zell to show the agreement of the parties as to due diligence • and abandonment. This should have been admitted. It was •not in any sense an attempt to modify or alter a written contract. The lease provided that the work when commenced ■should “be prosecuted with due diligence until completion or •abandonment,” but what should constitute due diligence was .a question of fact on which the parties might agree, either at the time or afterwards, and if they did, then neither court nor jury ¡had any right to adopt a different standard. If due diligence lhad been defined in the writing no pretence of such right could ihave been set up. But parol proof of the understanding and ■agreement of both parties was just as effective as a writing, for it went not to a construction of the paper, but to the definition ■of a fact referred to. Whether any such understanding not <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>expressed in the paper would affect others subsequently acquiring rights from one of the parties, without notice, we need not consider, for there is no evidence that any such others are before us. The ease was not allowed to get that far.</p>
    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[152,577,1168,1018]]]'>But the nonsuit was erroneous for another reason. Even if there had been a want of due diligence and an abandonment by plaintiffs, no one could take advantage of it but the lessor or one succeeding to his rights, and there was no such party yet in the case. So far as the evidence showed, defendants had neither Hartzell’s title nor any other beyond that of mere squatters. As against them plaintiffs as already shown had made out a prima facie case. The error of the appellees, and apparently of the court below, was in regarding the estate of plaintiffs under the lease as terminated ipso facto by the failure in diligence or the abandonment. But it required the act of the lessor. Repeated decisions of this court from Wills v. Gas Co., <a href="/pa/130/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="130 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="568992" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0222-01">130 Pa. 222</a>, to Cochran v.

Still less can any action of a stranger enforce it. As against any but the grantor, an abandonment is not complete until the statutory period of limitation, or the end of the term granted, and possession may be resumed by the grantee at any time previous.</p>
