It is therefore the general rule that the cross demands must be held by the same persons and in the same rights, so that actions may be maintained thereon each against the other. But the whole doctrine is founded on equitable principles. It has frequentlj' been held that our defalcation act is much broader than the English statutes, and it was said by Chief Justice Gibson in Frantz v. Brown, <a href="/pen-w/1/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Pen. &amp; W. 257" data-case-ids="1826164" data-case-paths="/pen-w/1/0257-01">1 P. &amp; W. 257</a>, that “ Set-off was originally nothing more than an equitable defence which the legislature has thought fit, in plain and simple cases, to subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of common law, reserving to chancery its original jurisdiction of cross demands which do not fall within the statute. . . . The courts would be competent to do complete justice without the statute, as is shown by their having frequently gone beyond it,” instancing Chil<a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>derston v. Hammon, 9 S. &amp; R. 68, where it was held that two defendants sued jointly may set off a debt due by plaintiff to one of them, and this although the set-off was not a debt of the plaintiff but of one for whom he was alleged to be a mere trustee. And to the same point is Stewart v. Coulter, 12 S. &amp; R. 252, where the decision was expressly put on equitable grounds and subject to the limitation that no superior equity be shown in a third person. In the same line of illustration may be noted Crist v.

Defendant and Wingenroth are sureties on a recognizance in error for one Woog, which has been forfeited. Defendant with the consent of Wingenroth asks to set off a judgment in favor of the latter against the plaintiff. If the recognizance had been joint as well as several, and defendant and Wingenroth had been <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>sued together on it, there could have been no doubt about the right of set-off. Childerston v. Hammon, 9 S. &amp; R. 68, would have been exactly in point. Why should the result be different when they are sued separately ? It is not the intermeddling of strangers. Though not parties to the same record, they have a common interest, each in the suit against the other, arising out of the right of contribution between co-sureties. If this set-off is not available to defendant then he will have judgment against him for the whole amount, and when he has been compelled to pay that, is he to have contribution from Wingenroth ? If not then he has lost his light of contribution without any fault of his own ; if he is to have it, then Wingenroth has to that extent been deprived of his unquestionable right to the set-off ; in either case an unjust result which equity should not permit.</p>

The special equity that exists here did not appear there because the cause of action being joint the judgment against the one sued would discharge the co-obligor, and the right of contribution had been released.</p>
