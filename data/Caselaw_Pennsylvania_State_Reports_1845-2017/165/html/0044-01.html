Its railroad is located in the anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania, and, including branches, is about sixty miles in length. It runs in a devious course, and thus, and by means of branches from the main line, reaches a number of collieries, nearly all of which are owned and controlled by the firm of Coxe Brothers &amp; Company, who also own nearly all the shares of stock in the railroad company ; it was built for the purpose of connecting these collieries with the various railroads which traverse that region, and does connect with the Pennsylvania, the Beading, the Lehigh Yalley, and <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>the Jersey Central railroads; thus giving the owners of these collieries, and of this railroad, not merely access to the various markets for coal,-—east, north and west—but also choice of roads over which to reach these markets, and with which to make traffic contracts.

Co., <a href="/mass/94/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="12 Allen 298" data-case-ids="1196919" data-case-paths="/mass/94/0298-01">12 Allen, 298</a>, contains an admirable discussion and exposition, by Bigelow, C. J., of the difference which may exist between the value of the tangible property and assets of a corporation and the value of its capital stock, which is so apt for our purpose that we make copious extracts therefrom, with the remark that the whole opinion ought to be read in this connection. Assuming that the value of the capital stock of a corporation is equal to the value of all its shares—the theory of the act of 1891, which makes the market price of the shares a test of the actual value of the capital stock—he says: ‘ The aggregate market value of all shares, b3r which we understand the cash price for which the shares will sell in the market, does not necessarily indicate the actual value or amount of property which a corporation may own. The'price for which all the shares would sell may greatly exceed the aggregate of the corporate property, or it may fall very far short of it. Undoubtedly the amount of property belonging to a corporation is one of the considerations which enter into the market value of its shares; but such market value also embraces other essential elements. It is not made up solely by the valuation or estimate which may be put on the corporate property, but it also includes the profits and gains which have attended its operations, the prospect of its future success, the nature and extent of its corporate rights and privileges, and the skill and ability with which its business <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>is managed. In other words, it is the estimate put on tbe potentiality of a corporation, on its capacity to avail itself profitably of its franchise, and on tbe mode in which it uses its privileges as a corporate body, which materially influences and often controls its market value. . . . There may be two corporations organized with similar powers, having the same number of shares, the same amount of property, of capital, and both-may be engaged in the same branch of business. The market value of the shares in one corporation may be double that of the other, because one is prosperous and likely to make large gains, while the other is unsuccessful, and is carrying on a business which may prove unprofitable, or lead to heavy loss. . . . The tax is therefore laid, not on capital stock as signifying the money paid in to cany on the business of the corporation, or the property purchased and owned by the corporation, but on capital stock representing the- aggregate of tbe market value of the shares. The price for which shares may be sold does not depend on the value or amount of property belonging to a corporation, but rather on the capacity of the corporation to use its. property, in connection with its corporate powers and privileges, advantageously and profitably, and upon the present prosperity, prospective earnings and profitable final re-’ suits of the corporate business. . . . Nor are we able to see any reason why the aggregate market value of all the shares' of a corporation, representing as it does the estimate put, not merely on the property of the corporation, but also on the rights, privileges, capacities and present and prospective re-suits of the corporate organization and business—in other words, on its franchise—is not a legitimate and just method of arriving at a basis on which to calculate an excise or tax.’</p>
