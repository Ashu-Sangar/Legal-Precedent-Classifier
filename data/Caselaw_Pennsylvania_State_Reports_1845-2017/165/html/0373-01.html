If he has satisfied you'on that point, you will allow that on the bill, and if it comes to more than the bill, the balance you certify to the defendant.

[Now, it is undisputed that these goods were paid for shortly after they were delivered; he sent the money for them and got the discount. It is said they were only to be paid for when they were ap<a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>proved, and that he approved them. Well, when he paid the bill, he did not look at them to examine them. His allegation is that to get the discount he paid for them immediately.] [1] Without anything else in the case, if you get a bill of goods on approval or inspection, and you choose to pay for them and send the money, you cannot recover that money back, unless you show some good reason why, because you ought not to have sent the money until the goods were approved. Hence, it devolves upon the defendant to satisfy you that the circumstances were such as would enable him to recover that money. [He says that, by paying in a certain time, he got a discount, and that afterwards he found out the goods were not as represented, and he immediately notified them; that the plaintiffs, through their agent, agreed that they would make it all right, and that they should stay there, they did not want them sent back. If he has satisfied you of that, he would be entitled to a reduction for what was the reasonable worth of those goods, and that is all there is about it.] [2] You have the testimony on both sides, and it raises a question for you business men to determine.”</p>
