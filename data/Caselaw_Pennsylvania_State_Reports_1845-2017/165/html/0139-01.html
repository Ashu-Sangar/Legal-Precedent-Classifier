    <p class="summary" id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.7",166,[238,1194,1168,1165]]]'>“ The defence contends that in the present action plaintiffs are not entitled to recover more than the attorney actually received. That in fact whatever money was received by the defendant’s intestate, in the shape of interest or as consideration for the land conveyed, was paid to the parties entitled thereto, as is evidenced by the receipts dated Aug. 14, 1886; and that judgment for this reason ought to be rendered in favor of the defendant. To sustain this contention, we are referred to Lee'v. Wright, 14 S. &amp; R. 105, and to Rush v. Hart, lb. 230. These actions were against trustees; and it is expressly decided that the plaintiff in assumpsit can recover no more than the defendant has actually received in money in any action for money had and received. The facts in the present case are somewhat different. The defendant’s intestate was the attorney in fact. As such agent his duties are clearly defined, and so are his liabilities. The principle laid down in Opie v. Serrill, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 269" data-case-ids="480209" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0269-01">6 W. &amp; S. 269</a>, applies more certainly to the facts of this case, and the attorney would be liable for the money he ought to have received. If the instructions were clearly violated and the land sold for bonds without authority, an action of assumpsit would likely lie for the amount of the consideration. In the view we take of this case, it is unnecessary to dispose of it on this technical ground.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b166-7" data-blocks='[["BL_166.8",166,[284,2368,1116,42]],["BL_167.1",167,[140,369,1166,1274]]]'>“ [The letter of attorney authorized James L. Thompson to <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>‘ grant, bargain and sell the same, or any part or parcel thereof, for such sum or price and on such terms as to him may seem meet.’ There was no other authority to make the sale. Both parties are bound by the language of the power of attorney. If the language be doubtful, it would be taken most strongly against the plaintiffs, whose language it is. There was a clear authority to sell. The only question is, whether there was any authority to make a sale for other consideration than lawful money. The word ‘ sum ’ naturally imports a sum of money, and so does the word ‘ price ’ as ordinarily understood. The latter word, however, has not necessarily such a restricted meaning. It is sometimes used in the sense of reward or equivalent. But, without basing a decision on the technical meaning of these words, there is a clause which seem? to give to the attorney ample discretionary power. ‘ And on such terms as to him may seem meet.’ This clause does not necessarily refer to the time of payment, but, we take it, it gives some discretion also as to the manner of payment. ‘ Terms ’ are the equivalent of ‘ conditions ’ in contracts. Webster defines ‘terms ’ as ‘ propositions stated or promises made, which, when assented to or accepted by another, settle the contract and bind the parties.’ The letter of attorney, therefore, if this view be correct, empowered James L. Thompson to negotiate for the sale of the farm and to sell for such price and on such conditions as to him might seem meet.</p>

But there is no allegation of bad faith, or negligence, on his part. The transaction was in good faith. The uncontradicted evidence shows that the coal was sold at the best price and the best terms obtainable at the time. The attorney in fact sold his own coal on the same terms and an offer was made to show that three thousand acres of adjoining coal was purchased about the same time and on like terms as to price and payment. It is true, this offer was excluded, as it did not seem pertinent under the issues, but, on the question of good faith, it would have been material. Coal fields are not infrequently taken up in this way. The money actually received by Thompson was promptly paid to the parties in interest and releases taken therefor. Part of this was the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>proceeds of coupons paid by the Westmoreland County Coal &amp; Coke Co. before the default was made.</p>

The evidence shows that defendant’s intestate held no money received for the use of the plaintiffs ; that if there is any liability it is by holding him responsible for what he ought to have received. The consideration mentioned in the deed as $6,000 lawful money of the United States is not conclusive. The fact is, that money was not received but, instead, $6,000 bonds of the Westmoreland County Coal &amp; Coke Co. That James L. Thompson acted in perfect good faith is apparent, as he sold his own coal on the same terms and conditions. Under these circumstances we are not to construe the letter of attorney most favorably to the plaintiffs. The letter admits of the construction we have already given it, and it would be a great hardship to otherwise hold. All were confident of the success of the undertaking at the time, and that the company afterwards failed cannot be charged to the attorney in fact. He was constituted attorney with full discretionary powers, and having acted in good faith, there ought to be no responsibility in this or any other form of action.</p>

He is' in general bound to obey the orders of his principal exactly, if they be imperative and nob discretionary; and in order to make it the duty of a factor to obey an order it is not necessary that it should be given in the form of a command.

    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[264,1045,1166,956]]]'>The foregoing authorities are not, and cannot be, controverted, and it is only necessary to show that they are applicable to the present case. The letter of attorney under which the defendant’s intestate sold the plaintiffs’ land authorized him to sell the same, “ for such sum or price and on such terms as to him shall seem meet,.... and to ask, demand, recover and receive all sums of money which shall become due and owing to us by means of such bargain, sale or lease and to take all lawful ways and means for such recovery thereof.” By virtue of the authority thus conferred, the attorney in fact, James L. Thompson, very shortly after the date of the letter of attorney, which was Dee. 23, 1882, sold and conveyed the- coal underneath the land of the plaintiffs, by deed dated Jan. 13, 1883, to one R. C. McCurdy for the sum of “ six thousand dollars lawful money of the United States,” as is recited in the deed. In point of fact the agent instead of requiring money from the purchaser took from him six thousand dollars of bonds of the Westmoreland County Coal &amp; Coke Co. which proved to be utterly worthless and of no value whatever.</p>

We cannot assent to that proposition. The word “ terms ” in such a connection in ordinary acceptation means the times and amounts of the payments. If there are any deferred payments, it may also embrace stipulations as to how <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>such payments shall be secured. It certainly does not import that the attorney has license to take anything he pleases as payment whether it has value or not. Nor, we apprehend, does the use of this word authorize the attorney to subvert the rule of law applicable in such cases and substitute for money, which the law implies, specific property of any kind. The court also thought that because the word “ price ” was used it might authorize the acceptance of some other form of payment than money, though the decision was not put upon that ground. As however counsel for the appellees has pressed this ground in the argument, we only stop to say that we regard it as altogether untenable. In the connection in which it is used here we cannot recognize any distinction between it and the word “ sum.”</p>
    <p id="b173-3" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[157,1105,1168,503]]]'>A point was also suggested by the court, and insisted upon by appellee’s counsel in argument, that this is an action for money had-and received, and therefore nothing can be recovered but money actually received by the defendant. This was not really true even before the practice act of 1887 was passed: Opie v. Serrill, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 269" data-case-ids="480209" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0269-01">6 W. &amp; S. 269</a>, in which it was held that the action included all money which the defendant ought to have received. But since assumpsit has become a statutory remedy its scope has been vastly enlarged and without any doubt embraces everything claimed in this action.</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[161,1616,1166,849]]]'>The findings of the court below do not inform us as to whether the plaintiffs ever had any knowledge that the bonds in question were taken in payment for their coal, nor whether they ever assented to that kind of payment, but certain it is the bonds were never delivered to the plaintiffs, because they were found among the papers of the attorney after his death. Nor is there any finding or evidence that the bonds were ever tendered to the plaintiffs. If they ever did have any value and had been delivered or tendered to the plaintiffs at the time they were taken in January, 1888, there would have been an opportunity to realize on them at least what thejr were worth in the market. When the attorney chose to keep them in his own possession he is certainly chargeable with the loss which resulted during his retention of them. So far as this record shows he never gave his principals anything for their coal except a few dollars which he paid some of them in 1886 and for which sums he took their releases.</p>

But for the courts to sanction the degree of license in dealing with the property rights intrusted to him by his principals, which he practiced in this instance, would be so wide a departure from the law as we understand it that we cannot give it any Sanction. We cannot agree that an attorney in fact with power to sell the lands of his principal for lawful money, may accept as payment the worthless bonds of an insolvent company and thereby discharge himself of all liability to his principals.</p>
