    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.7",184,[261,411,1163,1095]]]'>This is a proceeding under the act of 25th of May, 1878, to reform a defective certificate of the acknowledgment of a mortgage by a married woman. The defect in the certificate which it is sought to remedy is that it does not appear that upon her separate examination by the magistrate he read or otherwise made known to her the full contents of the mortgage and that she thereupon declared that she did voluntarily and of her own free will and accord sign and seal and as her act and deed deliver the same. It is alleged in the bill that the mortgage was in fact properly acknowledged in due form of law, and that the magistrate through inadvertence or otherwise neglected or omitted so to certify the same. The answer denies that the acknowledgment was otherwise than as shown by the certificate or that there was any omission through inadvertence or neglect. Section one of the act of 1878 confers upon the common pleas the power, when it is satisfactorily shown that “ a certificate of acknowledgment defective in form was in fact really and properly acknowledged in due form of law,” to make a decree for the reforming of such certificate in accordance with the actual facts. And section 2 provides that the proceeding “shall be by bill in equity, as in other cases for the reformation of a written instrument.”</p>

In this state her right to convey or charge her real estate is derived solely from the act of Feb. 24, 1770.

Barnett: “ It does not appear by the certificate of this acknowledgment that the contents of the deed were made known to the wife by the justice who took her acknowledgment, or that she did in fact know them. It has been expressly decided by this court that this is an incurable defect.”</p>

If what is certified fails to show a substantial compliance, the defect is incurable. The act of 1878 does not change the law, but provides only for reforming the certificate so that it shall conform to the facts.

The proceeding was in equity and the well recognized rules of evidence in relation to the reformation of written instruments apply. The answer was responsive to the bill. The certificate was evidence only of what it contained, and no presumption arose that anything took place before the magistrate except that to which he certified. As was said by McCollum, J., in Hand v. Weidner, <a href="/pa/151/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="151 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="836700" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0362-01">151 Pa. 362</a>, “The certificate <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>of acknowledgment is, in the absence of fraud or duress, conclusive of the facts therein stated, but it does not tend to establish the existence of other facts.”</p>
