As already observed, not a single item of plaintiff’s claim nor a single averment of fact in support thereof, was specifically traversed and denied, and hence, as was his right under the rule, the plaintiff introduced them as admitted, and then rested. The defendant thereupon, assuming the burden, undertook to prove his counterclaim, when he was met by the objection that he had not complied with the rule as to notice. It is not a sufficient answer to say that the defence was not set-off and therefore the rule was not applicable. The first item of defence, as we have seen, is clearly a counterclaim for damages resulting from refusal to deliver certain pieces of carpet, etc. It may be that in the technical sense of the word the other items are not strictly “ set-off,” but the rule was never intended to have any such restricted meaning. It was meant to embrace every species of counterclaim that under our more liberal practice may be legally or equitably interposed as a defence: Bair v. Hubartt, <a href="/pa/139/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="139 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="11250598" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0096-01">139 Pa. 96</a>, and <a href="/citations/?q=27%20W.N.C.%20272" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="27 W.N.C. 272">27 W. N. C. 272</a>. As was well said by our brother Mitchell in that case: “ The object of the rule .... is manifestly to reduce the contest at the trial to the points actually in dispute, and whenever any matter sought to be introduced at the trial, called bjr whatever name it may be, is such as to require notice to the other side, the object of the rule would seem to demand its application.” With the view of eliminating every uncontroverted fact, and thus narrowdng the controversy to the points actually in dispute, it is just as impor<a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>tant that the plaintiff should be required to answer the counterclaim iuterposed by the defendant as it is that the latter should be called upon to specifically traverse and deny the items, etc., of the plaintiff’s claim. If the defendant had given the required notice in this case, non constat that the plaintiff could have denied, the items of his counterclaim. In that event, it would have been unnecessary to take up the time of the court in calling witnesses and attempting to make the necessary proof.</p>
