I said there was testimony tending to show, not only that the building was completed substantially in accordance with the plans and specifications, but there is testimony also that the defendant himself considered it á substantial compliance, and accepted it as such. That evidence you have heard. He accepted the keys. He said he accepted the keys conditionally, that he would take them if the house was completed strictly in accordance with the plans and specifications and contract. But you have, gentlemen, not only his acceptance of the keys, which would not be conclusive evidence in itself; you also have evidence that he moved into the house shortly after its completion in the latter part of July or in August of 1892, and has been living in it and enjoying it ever since. [Now, a man cannot accept a building from the hands of a contractor, move into it, use it and enjoy it without paying for it, whatever it is reasonably worth. His acceptance of the keys, his moving into, occupying, using and enjoying the premises is testimony tending to show that he did consider it a substantial compliance with the contract, and if you should so find, then he must make these payments in accordance with the terms of the contract, deducting therefrom whatever you should find to be a fair estimate of the defects, if there are any, in this plastering for which he claims so large a sum. That I take it is the important question for you to determine.] ” [4]</p>

In the case referred to, suit was brought to recover the second payment provided for in the contract. This and the other action that was tried with it were brought to recover the last two payments respectively under the contract.</p>
    <p id="b635-11" data-blocks='[["BL_635.13",635,[147,1568,1170,904]]]'>The claim in this was for $700 alleged to be payable when the plastering was completed, and, in the other, it was for $718, alleged to be payable when the house was completed. The main contention of the defendant was that the contract is entire and that no action could be maintained thereon until the building was fully completed according to the contract; and that inasmuch as the plaintiffs failed to so erect and complete the house, they were' not entitled to recover in either action. As to the alleged entirety of the contract, the learned court rightly ruled against the defendant; and the cases' turned mainly on the questions of fact, whether or not the contract, on the part of the plaintiffs, had been substantially performed, and whether the defendant had accepted the house as completed ;• and if not, what deduction from the contract price, if any, should be made for defective workmanship, etc. These and other questions of fact presented by the testimony were for the jury, and to them they were submitted with instructions that appear to be free from substantial error.</p>
