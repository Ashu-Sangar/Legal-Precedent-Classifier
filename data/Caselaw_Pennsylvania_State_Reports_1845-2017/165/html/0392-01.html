The reasons for the reversal as to the wife by the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 do not appear, but as it was upon depositions on a certiorari it was clearly erroneous.

No such conclusion follows in the present case because plaintiff brought his first action in proper form to charge both. The restriction of his recovery to the husband alone was no fault of his, but the action of the court in invitum. He could not join the husband in the second suit because as to the husband the judgment in the first suit was a bar. But as to the wife it was not, and the present action was therefore from the necessity of the case brought against her alone. The jury have found that the goods were sold to her on her separate credit. It was error to enter judgment in her favor against this finding.</p>
