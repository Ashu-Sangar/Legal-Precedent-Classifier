The net price agreed upon for his interest was $1,689.30. For $500 of this he received his vendee’s check at the time. The residue was to be paid when three wells, then being drilled for the Jefferson Company, were completed. When that occurred, plaintiff, through his attorney, demanded payment, and a check for $1,189.30 was sent him. This, as well as the former check, he had certified, and retained possession of both until after the hearing in this case had commenced and then he had them cashed, and thereafter continued his efforts to realize more. If there had been any such proof of concealment and fraud in effecting the sale as would have justified him in rescinding, he should have prepared the way for so doing by at least offering to put his vendee in statu quo by refunding the consideration money.
