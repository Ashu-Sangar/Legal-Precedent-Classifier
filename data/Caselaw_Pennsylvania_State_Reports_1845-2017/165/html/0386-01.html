They also found that the change involved an additional cost of about a thousand dollars, but that the benefit of the change was fully equal to the additional cost and damage and that the properties along the line of the street were benefited to the extent of any and all damage which may have been caused'by the change. They also found that the total amount of damages, costs.and expenses of the im-' provement was $18,126.61, and that said total amount is not in excess of the worth and value of the improvement. They then ascertained and reported the damages sustained- by the owners and the benefits conferred by the improvement, and fixed and reported the amounts to be paid by the owners who were benefited.</p>

The exceptants claim that this change could not be made without a special ordinance to that effect. The power of the councils to change the grade by means of a special ordinance is not controverted. But it is very familiar doctrine that councils may by subsequent ratification validate and adopt an unauthorized act of their agents, officers and employees.</p>

Gordon, J., delivering the opinion, said: “ The difficulty however is found in the fact that between the time of the making of the ordinance and the letting of the contract a grade for Ridge street was adopted by the proper authorities. Such being the case, the engineer exceeded his authority when he disregarded that grade and adopted a new one, and the city, at any time before the adoption by it of the work done bjr the contractor, might have repudiated the act of its engineer and avoided the contract. But it could not do this after such adoption; for as in the case of a private person, it having the power to contract, the power to adopt a contract made for its <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>benefit is necessarily involved in the original power. It is indeed bat a question of power that we have to consider; that being determined all is determined. Hence, we repeat, the city having the undisputed power to establish grades and to make contracts for paving, the correlative power of adopting grades and contracts, made by its officers for its own benefit, necessarily follows.”</p>

The only remaining question therefore is upon the adoption and ratification of the work done upon the street after the change of grade.. Upon that subject there is no possibility of controversy because the claim of the city is founded upon the work thus done. The report of the viewers sets out the fact of the change and describes the character, cost and expense of the work, and fixes the amount to be paid by each owner under the assessment for benefits occasioned by the work.
