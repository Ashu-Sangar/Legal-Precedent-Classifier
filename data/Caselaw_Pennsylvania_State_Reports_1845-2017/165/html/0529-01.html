Upon putting it in the well it was found to be defective and not suited for the purpose for which it was sold. It was drawn out and replaced several times before the cause of the trouble was ascertained, which was that the collars or thimbles were not fastened as tightly as they should have been, and did not fit the opposite joint, and that the ends of the pipe came together before the collars had taken proper hold and prevented the joints from being tightly screwed together. That this defect could not have been discovered on inspection, and that as a natural consequence the defendant was put to large expense in testing, removing and replacing the pipe, etc., all of which was necessary for the protection of this well. Objected to as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial. The Court: We do not understand the defendant to offer to prove anything with respect to the terms of the sale and the nature of the defects materially different from that which has already been proven, the present question being upon the proof of damages. So understanding the offer, we sustain the objection and seal a bill for defendant. [2]</p>

There was but one witness examined for the defendant and his testimony failed to show anything more than an order for Pennsylvania tubing and without any agreement or even proposition that it should be “ tested.” Nor does the testimonjr show, any representation by the plaintiff’s agent that the tubing should be any other than Pennsylvania tubing which he said, it is true, was as good as any in the market, but which he did not engage to furnish of any particular quality nor for any particular purpose.
