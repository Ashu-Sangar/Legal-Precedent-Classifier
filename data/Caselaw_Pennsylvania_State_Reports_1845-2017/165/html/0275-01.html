Brown, in whom the record title stood. Defendants attempted to show a resulting trust for an undivided interest in the property in Brown’s wife by payment of part of the purchase money. Both defendants testified that the payments were to be made with her money under the express agreement that she was to have title in proportion to the payments made with her money. They testified that Mrs. Brown received her money from her father’s estate in sums of $15 and less, and laid it aside to pay for the property. Brown testified that he used it to pay on account of the property, but also that some of it was used to buy stock with and for other purposes, and the sums paid were not clearly identified.

All she testifies to in relation to this matter is what she receives from her.husband, and that is secondary evidence. Then all the evidence that you have before you on the question of the payment of her <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>money, upon the difference between these lands, is solely upon his testimony. So far as appears in the evidence—and what does not appear must be presumed not to exist—no one ever heard of the alleged agreement until the day of the sheriff’s sale, when it was unearthed; when in the throes of labor after nearly twenty-three years of gestation it was born out of time and then claiming in size to be five sevenths of the whole property, and now upon the trial it has dwindled down in size to three-fifths. Every act of the defendant’s husband in this matter relating to this whole transaction, in taking the deed, in conveying his own, in giving the bond, his own testimony in regard to assuming the judgments, is in perfect harmony with the actual ownership of the land, and that the money of his wife’s separate estate used was either a loan or gift to him and not an investment. The deed was made direct to him; the bond to .his vendee for the difference between the liens and boot money was his bond, his wife’s name not referred to; the receipts upon the record when the judgments against the land, received by the conveyance from Miss Christie, were paid, do not show, as they were read in evidence, any relationship to Mary M. Brown. It is a singular coincidence that in the papers offered there is not one scintilla of evidence that she had any interest in this transaction. The assessment of the property for tax purposes was in his name, the use of the property was as though it was actually his; the possession of it for so long a time raises a presumption of actual ownership in Matthew J. Brown, not in his wife.</p>

Titles are dependent to a great extent upon records, and in cases of alleged .resulting trusts which are supported by oral evidence alone, the law properly requires that the evidence to prove the needful facts must be of a very high quality.</p>

Evidence which is clear, evidence which is direct, positive, and evidence which is not doubtful. Every element of such a trust must be proved by clear, explicit and unequivocal evidence, and if any element of the case fails in these respects, although the other elements may be made out by evidence which comes up to the proper standard, the case fails. Applying that principle to this case, before defendant can defeat plaintiff’s recovery of the land in suit in whole or in part, on the ground or by reason of a resulting trust in her, she must prove, as we have already stated, an agreement made before the taking of the title to the land by her husband; she must also prove that in pursuance of that agreement her money was applied—not afterwards applied or voluntarily by herself, that is not enough—but that her money was so applied in fulfillment of the agreement, and if the agreement entered into before the land was taken by her husband did not include this fact that she was to apply her money to the payment, then we say to you that you must find for the plaintiff. In other words, the agreement preceding the taking of the land must have provided for these three things: First, that her husband was to take the land for her benefit in w'hole or in part.

Brown. No question is raised over the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>regularity of the proceeding or the validity of the sheriff’s sale. On the contrary it is conceded that the purchaser acquired the title of the defendant. The defence set up relates to an undivided three fifths of the farm which, it is alleged, Mary M. Brown, wife of Matthew J. Brown, is entitled to under a resulting trust originating in 1868. The facts relied upon to raise the resulting trust are as follows : Brown was the owner in 1868 of a farm on which he resided containing thirty-seven acres. Margaret E. Christie owned another farm in the same region containing one hundred acres. For their mutual benefit an exchange of these farms was agreed upon, the difference in values to be left to three men selected by the parties to determine, and to be paid by Brown to Margaret Christie so as to meet the liens resting on her farm. In pursuance of this agreement the three appraisers valued the Christie farm at eighteen hundred and seventy-five dollars, and the Brown farm at twelve hundred. This left a difference of six hundred and seventy-five dollars to be paid to Margaret E. Christie in money.. Deeds were exchanged in October, 1868, and Brown assumed the payment of the judgments against the Christie farm, amounting to four hundred and thirty-two dollars and fourteen cents, and gave his bond to Miss Christie for two hundred and forty-two dollars and eighty-six cents to make up the full sum of six hundred and seventy-five dollars, the difference between the appraised values of the two farms. Mrs. Brown alleges, and it does not seem to be seriously controverted, that she furnished the money to pay the judgments and the balance due to Miss Christie, from her separate estate. This she claims she did upon an agreement that she was to have an interest in the land corresponding to the part of the whole price paid by her. By virtue of this agreement and the payment of the six hundred and seventy-five dollars of the purchase money, she contends that her husband became a trustee for her as to such part of the title as was paid for with her money.</p>

    <p id="b307-3" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[163,837,1166,1269]]]'>The answers to the first and second of the plaintiff’s points require qualification, for as they stand they would be misleading. It is not necessary that the money of the wife should have gone “into the land at the inception of the husband’s title ” by an actual payment of it at that date. It is enough if it be paid as installments or incumbrances fall due, provided such payments are made in pursuance of the contract under which the title was acquired, and upon the- agreement that she is to recover the title to so much as she pays for in exchange for her money. The same error runs through the answers to other points, particularly that to the defendants’ fourth point. This point asked an instruction upon the sufficiency of certain assumed facts to raise a resulting trust. The answer was in these words: “ This is not affirmed unless the jury also find that the money or some of it was actually paid in consideration of the land at the inception of the title, and the other or remainder was actually set apart at the time for the purpose of pajdng for land.” This would be understood as an instruction that payments of purchase money made subsequently to the date of the contract, although in strict compliance with its terms, would not support a resulting trust, no matter how clear and distinct the agreement might be that she should be treated as a purchaser to the extent of the money furnished by her. If the case had gone to the jury this instruction could have been successfully complained of.</p>
    <p id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[166,2116,1162,298]],["BL_308.1",308,[267,375,1161,200]]]'>The fifteenth assignment raises a question that has no practical importance in this case. If the testimony of Brown and his wife had been submitted to the jury it would have been important that the jury should know whether they were to be treated by them as one or as two witnesses; but as the testimony of both of them was, in the judgment of the learned judge, <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>too loose, indefinite and unsatisfactory to sustain a verdict, and was for this reason withheld from the jury, the question played no part in the determination of this case in the court below, and in this court it is a question in thesi merely.</p>
    <p id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[265,582,1177,654]]]'>The last assignment alleges error in the withdrawal of the case from the jury. We cannot sustain this assignment. The judge was, as to the question of the existence of the resulting trust, a chancellor. If the evidence was in his judgment insufficient to sustain a verdict, it was his duty to withhold it from the jury: Reno v. Moss, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20Pa.%2067" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="120 Pa. 67">120 Pa. 67</a>; Wylie v. Mansley, <a href="/pa/132/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="132 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="970595" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0065-01">132 Pa. 65</a>. In such case it becomes unnecessary to answer points asking instructions to the jury, since the case does not go to them. It is enough if the judge puts upon the record his reasons for refusing to submit the case to the jury so that they may be reviewed by this court. That was done in this. case. We are satisfied with the reasons given, and upon that ground the judgment is affirmed.</p>
