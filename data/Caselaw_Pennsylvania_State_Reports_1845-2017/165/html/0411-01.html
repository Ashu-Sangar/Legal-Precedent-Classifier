By the Court: What do you propose to show? By Mr. Carpenter : I propose to show that this money was not in fact paid to Mr. O’Donnell as Mr. O’Donnell’s money, but it was a voluntary act upon the part of the company, not on the ground of any indebtedness, but merely for the purpose of avoiding difficulty with persons who had done work for Mr. O’Donnell, that it was in the nature of a gift from the company. “ Q. Under the contract which has been offered in evidence, the work was to be completed in a given time, and a penalty was attached for a failure to do so. Now, what made up this $2,400 ? ” Objected to, because it is an offer to show something in reference to this $2,400 outside of the agreement in reference thereto, which is in writing. By Mr. Carpenter: I propose to prove by the witness on the stand that the $2,447.58 paid by the Crescent Pipe Line Company to Mr. O’Donnell after the attachment, was not paid upon any admission of liability, but was a voluntary act upon the part of the company, as a donation to Mr. O’Donnell, to enable him to pay pressing claims against him personally along the pipe line where he had his contract. Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant, especially because the contract or agreement is in writing, and the very fact sought to be proved appears in the writing itself. By the Court: As I understand the offer it is not to show what was due to him under the contract but to show that they paid this money because they waived the claim that they had against him—the certain forfeitures for delay, probably upon the con<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>ditions substantially as recited in the bond.

By Mr. Carpenter: I propose to show by the witness on the stand that Mr. O’Donnell did not lay the pipe as a whole, the required depth, that is, he did not ditch the required depth, that the average of his whole work from end to end is less than the depth called for by the contract. Objected to, for the reason that the measurements as to extra depth were referred, by Mr. O’Donnell and the Crescent Pipe Line Company, to arbitrators, who have made a report which is binding upon both parties, under the terms of the agreement.

Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant. By the Court: ■ If the offer were to prove any specific failure to perform any part of the contract and damages therefrom, we would allow it; but as we understand it, it is only to show that the calculation on this report shows that the average depth would not amount to the depth required by the contract; and inasmuch as the question of the depth was not submitted to these arbitrators, a calculation of that sort would not be binding upon either party. It cannot be made the basis of testimony. By Mr. Carpenter: “ Q. How much of the line did you measure? A. We made the tests over the entire contract of Mr. O’Donnell at regular intervals. Q. Of how many feet? A. Every four hundred feet. Q. You made your calculation for the entire length of the line ? A. Yes, sir. By <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>Mr. Shields: Q. And that is all that appears in this report? A. Nothing but the extra depths appear in our report. We didn’t report those that were under depth. By Mr. Carpenter: Q. But you kept a record of that ? A. No, sir. By the Court: Q. You didn’t make all these tests yourself? A. I was with the party, making the tests. Q. Were you a party to every test that was made ? A. W ell no, I don’t think that any one of the commissioners was present at all of them. We probably missed a few hours several times on some of the tests. There were five of us keeping notes on the line, and part of our notes we filled in afterwards from the others. There were at least three present at all times of the commissioners, and our notes agreed on the subject. By the Court: I do not think it is a proper method of proving a failure to perform the contract, especially in the face of the fact that inspectors were there who were to pass upon the matters at the time the pipe was laid. We will have to sustain the objection, and seal a bill for the defendant.” [3]</p>

These persons subsequently made their report, the precise result of which does not appear in the paper-books. But the president of the company, W. L. Mellon, being examined, testified that, in addition to the $2,447.58, the company owed O’Donnell “ about $395,” on the basis of the report of the referees, or if a certain sum of $125.85 was allowed as extra work the amount still owing would be $521.52. Now the attachment in execution in this case had been issued and served in January, 1893, and the president, Mr. Mellon, testified that he knew of the attachment at the time of its service, and that the money, $2,447.58, was paid after the attachment was served and while it was pending. In addition to that when the company paid that money they took a bond of indemnity from O’Donnell indemnify<a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>ing them against this very attachment. So that it appears of record that, after the attachment was served, and with a full knowledge of it, the company, having in its hands -$2,447.58 for the account of O’Donnell for work done under his contract unless it was forfeited, but which claim of forfeiture they released, paid him that money, accepting his agreement to pay it out in a certain way, and a bond of indemnity against this particular writ of attachment in consequence of their payment to him of this money. As to these fundamental facts there was no dispute. The offers of testimony which were rejected could not possibly have mitigated the force or the legal effect of these facts. If the company made a wrong payment, or an overpayment, to O’Donnell, they can resort to their bond of indemnity but they cannot defeat the effect of the attachment by paying out money accruing under their contract with him, after the service of the writ. Nor can they engage this plaintiff in a contest over the whole merits of their controversy with O’Donnell, in view of the undisputed fact that they paid to O’Donnell much more money than the whole amount claimed in the attachment, after the writ was issued and served. Whether they chose to regard it as a gift is a matter of no moment. It was money in their hands on account of their contract with O’Donnell, held only under a claim of forfeiture which they released, and as such it was unquestionably subject to the attachment of his creditor.
