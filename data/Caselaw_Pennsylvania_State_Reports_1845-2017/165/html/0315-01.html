Such is very far from being the case, and we propose here now to give, as briefly as possible but clearly, the reasons which induced our action.</p>

This conclusion was not reached hastily or arbitrarily, but after hearings had upon the petitions and remonstrances, and upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances, and due regard had for the prevailing sentiment of the community and for the public good. This judgment'was popularly approved, and any changes in circumstances and conditions and public sentiment since have been, it is believed, largely -in its favor. When the act- of May 24, 1887, placed the licensing of distillers and brewers in the hands of the court, a grave responsibility was imposed by reason of the amount of money invested in such manufactories, and the consequent large property interests involved. We were then, and still are, of the opinion that so far as any necessity for the accommodation of the public is concerned there is no practical difference between wholesale and manufacturers’ licenses, the privileges being so nearly the same, and, consequently, that both should be refused as unnecessary. But we were unwilling to be made the instrument of injuring pri<a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>vate property to the extent which that ruling would require, since it would have almost destroyed the distilleries and breweries then in existence in the county. So, when the owner of this distillery made application in 1888 for a license for a place in Uniontown, we granted the license, notwithstanding it was remonstrated against as unnecessary for the accommodation of the public, and such was our judgment and opinion. And we did likewise in similar cases. But we soon found that practice to be productive of public evil and very objectionable, and we sought diligently for some solution of the problem. After study of the question and of all interests involved, we found that the existing manufactories were so located and distributed over the county as to probably occasion the least public injury, and yet be able to carry on business, if their licenses were asked and granted for places only in the immediate locality of the respective manufacturing establishments. This would largely conserve such manufacturing interests, and yet would prevent the multiplying of licensed places in those localities where decidedly the greatest injury to the welfare of the general public would follow. We, therefore, determined to enforce our judgment as to the lack of any necessity for such licensed places for the accommodation of the public, except in those cases where the licenses were asked for places in the immediate neighborhood of the distilleries or breweries, and in those cases alone to make a concession and grant the licenses. And in the spring of 1889, while still following the course pursued the previous year, we announced this conclusion as our practice for the future, so that all would be advised of it, and could act accordingly. We thought this was fully understood by every one interested, either as attorney or applicant, and have ever since maintained that position, with the single exception presently stated. It will thus be seen that our discretion has been exercised in favor of the manufacturers, instead of against them; but such action has never been intended as any encouragement to new enterprises of that character. And since the passage of the act of June 20, 1893, permitting distillers to sell liquors of their own manufacture in original packages of not less than forty gallons without obtaining a license therefor, it is very probable that we will hereafter refuse to grant them license, the reason for our doing so in the past hav<a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>ing thus ceased to exist. It will be noted that this late act makes the only practical distinction between wholesalers and distillers that has existed in the laws, outside of Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, at least since the passage of the act of May 24, 1887, and is evidence of the correctness of our position in classing them together. It also shows approval of our course in using our discretion in the interests of the distillers, for it must have been about the same view of their rights which we entertain that occasioned the enactment of this law.</p>

After obtaining the license he habitually violated his promise, and when we learned that fact we took advantage at the first opportunity to announce that, by reason of said violation, no license would in future be granted that distillery; and subsequent applications were refused. The present applicant is well informed on all such matters, and must have known all this before he and Thompson purchased the distillery and entire premises of five acres, as shown by the deed, in March of last year, for $500.</p>

Where, as here, the question is one of public necessity, and the circumstances and conditions remain practically unchanged, it would be useless to require remonstrances each year, and we have so announced.

Prior to May, 1887, both wholesale and retail licenses in this county were regulated by the acts of 1856, 1858, 1859 and 1867, and those acts remained in force as to wholesale and manufacturers’ licenses under the act of May 24,1887, by virtue of the provision therein that such licenses should be granted as is provided by existing laws. The retail act of May 13, 1887, embraces substantially the same provisions as to the power, duty and discretion of the court as the earlier acts mentioned. And the act of June 9, 1891, supplying that of May 24,1887, is identical in the title and in the section prescribing the powers and duty and discretion of the court in acting upon license applications, with the title and the similar section of said retail act, saving only that in the title it applies to wholesale (recognizing brewers and distillers as such) instead of retail dealers, and that it omits, in § 6 the words ‘ and the entertainment <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>of strangers or travelers,’ and allows the petitioners for and against from the county at large instead of limiting them to ‘ residents of the borough or township.’ Nor is it merely a revenue act, for it is entitled: ‘An act to restrain and regulate the sale of vinous, spiritous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixtures thereof, by wholesale.’ It seemed, therefore, that every power, duty and discretion which the court possessed in regard to the disposition of applications for retail license was also possessed with reference to all wholesale applications, unless the provision of § 6, of said act of June 9, 1891, about the necessity for the license, 'were held inapplicable in cases of brewers and distillers by reason of the proviso in the 5th clause of the 4th section. But we are advised that this very question was raised by the appellant in this case, and yet the Supreme Court say that ‘it <em>is </em>true that the act of 1891 does give the court power to consider the question of the necessity of the license for the accommodation of the public,’ etc.</p>

Relying upon the other cases cited, we believed that, as in Conway’s Petition, supra, where the record disclosed no reason, the presumption would be in favor of the proper exercise of discretion by the court, and that upon appeal it would be the duty of the appellant to show the contrary. We are sorry if this is not the law. The whole license business is most troublesome and disagreeable, and it only makes it more so if, in every case where a license is refused, the reasons must be stated; for cases must and do occur where the applicants are deemed unfit to be trusted with license, and it is not pleasant in any case to be obliged to formally declare and record that fact.”</p>

No remonstrance was presented to the court against the license, and no evidence was offered in opposition to it, but when it was reached it was refused. The petitioner then applied to this Court for relief alleging in substance that his application had been arbitrarily refused without a hearing. The order refusing the license was set aside for this reason and a procedendo awarded. Thereupon the court below took up the case again on the third day of October, 1893, and again refused the application, placing the reasons therefor on the record. An examination of these reasons shows that the distillery of the applicant is not located in a city or town but in the township of Wharton in Fayette county; that its former occupants have violated the liquor laws, and this after repeated promises made to the court whenever a license has been granted for the place; that in the judgment of the court it is not necessary, does not do a legitimate business, and has not been properly conducted. These reasons are amply sufficient to justify the order made. The petitioner, after this action by the court of quarter sessions, comes again into this Court with the petition now before us and asks us to issue a writ of mandamus “ commanding him, the said Nathaniel Ewing, judge of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Fayette county, Pennsylvania, to grant said license or show cause why he should not do so.”</p>

It is a command to some official or other officer to proceed to the discharge of some official duty. When that duty is deliberative or depends upon the exercise of official discretion the purpose of the writ is to quicken the action of the officer and require him to proceed to hear, to deliberate, to exercise his discretion. It does not lie to revise the decision of any person clothed with judicial, deliberative, or discretionary powers : Dechert v. Com., <a href="/pa/113/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="113 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="457620" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0229-01">113 Pa. 229</a>; Raudenbusch’s Petition, <a href="/pa/120/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="120 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="559860" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0328-01">120 Pa. 328</a>. If a judge declines to hear, or delays a <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>hearing unreasonably, a mandamus is the appropriate remedy. It commands him to proceed to a hearing and decision, but it is not a substitute for an appeal and it does not bring up for review the soundness of the discretion used or the correctness of the conclusion reached: Newlin v. The County, 23 W. N. 153; Petition of Michael Collarn, <a href="/pa/134/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="134 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="814892" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0551-01">134 Pa. 551</a>; Wolff’s Petition, <a href="/pa/138/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="138 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="11251711" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0316-01">138 Pa. 316</a> ; Goldman’s Petition, <a href="/pa/138/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="138 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="11251777" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0321-01">138 Pa. 321</a>. This rule is applicable to petitions for licenses to sell at wholesale as well as to those for licenses to sell at retail: McNulty’s Petition, <a href="/pa/142/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="142 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="976621" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0475-01">142 Pa. 475</a>; Ostertag’s Petition, <a href="/pa/144/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="144 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="823804" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0426-01">144 Pa. 426</a>. The general rule that courts will not undertake a supervisory control over the exercise of discretionary powers upon mandamus was restated and applied during the last year in Com. ex rel. Sherry v. Jenks, <a href="/pa/154/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="154 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="842379" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0368-01">154 Pa. 368</a>, and is too well settled to require discussion. In a clear case of an abuse of discretion a certiorari to bring up the record'for review might enable us to reach the difficulty ; and possibly it might be reached in some cases on a petition for a writ of mandamus, but the general rule is as stated in the cases cited above.</p>
    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[149,1357,1165,347]]]'>It is just to the writer of this opinion to state that this case was decided before the close of the October Term of last year, and an opinion written which seems never to have reached the files. Our attention having been called to the state of the record during the present term, we now put the- decision formally upon the files, and with it this brief statement of the rule by which our action is controlled.</p>
