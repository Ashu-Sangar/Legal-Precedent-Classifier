All the rest of her estate, real, personal or mixed, she devised to her son John; that her husband refused to take under said will, and the children, Charles, Elizabeth, Carrie, Lena, Mary, Anna, Ida, contested the will, and a jury trial was certified at No. 214 March Term, 1891, and was still undetermined; that on Dec. 5, 1890, the interest of John J. Fisher, Jr., in said property was sold by the sheriff to S. H. McKee, and S. H. McKee holds the same for himself and Galen C. Hartman in equal proportions; that immediately after the purchase by McKee he and Hartman purchased two mortgages on said lots from one Louis Celia, Jr., each for $475, both of which were given by Mary Fisher and John Fisher, Sr., in the lifetime of Mary Fisher; that the said Hartman and McKee, by their purchase of the interest of'John J.

Thejr admitted Mary Fisher, deceased, left five lots as alleged, but denied that the value was $10,000, alleging it was worth $8,000. They admitted that a will was filed, as alleged, leaving three lots to John and Elizabeth, and two to her husband and $5 to her other children,’and that the husband refused to take under the will; also, that the childrezr contested the will, but they denied that the same z'emained undetermined, and alleged that the will of Mary Fisher, deceased, was sustained April 26,1892. They adznitted the purchase by S. H. McKee of the' interest of John J. Fisher, Jr., at sheriff's sale, and denied that it was made for S. H. McKee and Galen C. Hartman in equal proportions, and alleged that the purchase by McKee was made without the knowledge of Galen C. Hartman, and that afterwaz'ds on Dec. 6, 1891, Hartman and McKee entered into an agreement to divide the expenses and ■ profits of the purchase of John J. Fisher’s interest by McKee and the purchase of the mortgages by Hartman, keeping the two interests separate. They admitted the purchase of the mortgages by Galen C.

They denied, that any of complainants had any interest in the property except John J. Fisher, Sr., and Elizabeth, who was now of full legal age. They admitted that a tender of the amount of the mortgages was made to Hartman with a request to assign the same, and alleged that Hartman refused to transfer them because he believed the assignee wished to get control of the writs and mortgages for the purpose of depriving said S.
