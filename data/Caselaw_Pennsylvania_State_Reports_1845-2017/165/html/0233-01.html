Many of the electors procured at other places printed slips or tickets of the form shown in the second specification of the petition, including a list of township officers to be voted for, with directions to mark names of candidates for the respective offices, prepared with adhesive paste on the reverse side, and of the size and form the same as should have appeared on the official ballot, if the persons named had been duly nominated for the respective offices. They'affixed said slip-tickets upon the right band column of the official ballot which was devoted to blank spaces, and, when so affixed, the titles of the offices, directions for insertion of names and the spaces indicated and defined by lines, provided in the official ballot for township officers, were covered and obliterated, and the titles of officers, directions for marking, spaces and names provided therein on the prepared slip-ticket, substituted therefor. Cross marks were also made in the squares opposite certain names, to the right of the names. The election officers counted, as votes for the respective persons, the names on said slips having the cross marked opposite their names. Seventy-six (76) ballots so cast were counted for Albert McCowin, and seventy-five (75) ballots so cast were counted for R. J. Miller. The return of the election officers then showed that for the office of school director, A. G. Mc-Ginnis had fifty-four (54) votes; John M. Scott twenty-five (25) votes; M. L. Andrews thirteen (13) votes; W. A. Kenney sixty-two (62) votes ; Albert McCowin ninety (90) votes; R. J. Miller eighty (80) votes; J. Q. Adams one (1) vote.”</p>

The ordinary rule, as has been stated by recognized authority, is that where power has been given to do a thing in a particular way, then affirmative words, marking out the way, by necessary implication prohibit all other ways. To hold, as we are virtually asked to do by appellants, that by virtue of the authority given the voter to insert, in the blank spaces provided therefor, names not already on the official ballot, he may so use a previously prepared slip-ticket, given to him by an outside party, as to entirely cover the right hand column of the official ballot, and thus effectually obliterate or conceal everything printed thereon. <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>would not be construction, but judicial legislation of the worst type.

In addition to the requisite number of blank spaces for the insertion of names not already on the ballot, the respective titles of the different offices to be filled and instructions as to the number of names that may be inserted underneath said titles respectively, are intended as guides not only for the voter but also for the election officers. To permit the voter to procure, from outside parties, a slip-ticket or sticker, corresponding in size with said column, and paste the same over the printed matter, as well as the blank spaces thereon, would be contrary to the letter as well as the spirit of the act. But, it is enough for us to know that no authority can be found in the act for doing any such thing.</p>
