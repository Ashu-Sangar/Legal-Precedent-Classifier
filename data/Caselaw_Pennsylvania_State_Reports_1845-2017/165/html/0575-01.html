His father lived in Washington, Pa., and, a few dajrs before the date of the policy, sent an agent named Hughes to Oakdale with a view of having him place insurance on plaintiff’s property and that of his sister. Plaintiff simply pointed out the property to Hughes. Hughes returned to Washington and either because he was an agent for life insurance only, or because his company did not insure property in the oil district (both reasons seem to be given by him), he turned the matter over to defendant company, describing the property orally as a dwelling house, and this is the description given in the policy. It was, in fact, a feed store. It was not claimed by defendant that there was fraud or deceit in representing the property as a dwelling house. It was simply a mistake on the part of Hughes, probably arising from the fact that the adjoining property, belonging to plaintiff’s sister and upon which insurance was effected at the same time, was occupied as a dwelling.</p>

      <em>tion as signed by the </em>applicant,” etc. There can be no “ correct copy as signed ” of an oral application, nor can a “ copy ” even of a written application be “ attached ” to an oral contract. It is settled and unquestionable that the whole contract of insurance may be oral, and we cannot reasonably suppose that the legislature meant either thus indirectly to change the established law in this respect, or to require a subordinate part of a contract to be in writing while the main part is oral. The legislature would not do indirectly for a part what it has clearly not intended to do for the whole. It is well known that the evil aimed at in this legislation was the custom of insurance companies to put in their blank forms of application long and intricate questions or statements to be answered or made by the applicant, printed usually in very small type, and the relevancy or materiality not always apparent to the inexperienced, and therefore liable to become traps to catch even the innocent unwary. The general intent was to keep these statements before the eyes of the insured, so that he might know his contract, and if it contained errors, have them rectified before it became too late. Both this general intent and the language of the act require its application to be limited to contracts in writing. To extend it to others would be more than liberal, it would be loose construction. The evidence as to the representations made by plaintiff’s agent Hughes in the application should have been admitted.</p>
