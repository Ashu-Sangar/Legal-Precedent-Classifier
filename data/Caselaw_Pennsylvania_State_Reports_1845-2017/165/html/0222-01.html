The act of assembly making illicit intercourse a crime sets forth in distinct terms what shall constitute fornication. And the same act in another section sets forth in like distinct terms what shall constitute the crime of adultery. The defendant being a married man, should, in order to be convicted and sentenced, have been indicted for adultery and bastardy and incestuous adultery, and the motion should prevail.

The causes assigned constitute no valid reason for interference by the court, and the reasons stated in the opinion throw little light upon the subject, and are wholly untenable. That it <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>appeared at the trial that the defendant had been guilty of three offences, and had not been indicted for the greatest of them, did not prevent his conviction of the two covered by the counts.</p>
    <p id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[262,579,1161,602]]]'>The case presents the anomaly of an arrest of judgment not for defects appearing upon the record, but for causes entirely foreign to it. The indictment was in proper form, nor is it suggested that its averments were not fully sustained by the testimony, and unless tlie defendant was to go free there was no alternative but to enter judgment on the verdict. In any subsequent attempt to convict tbe defendant of adultery the prosecution would be met with the difficulty that the substantial offence was the same in each charge, and that the evidence necessary to support the second indictment was sufficient to convict, on the first. See Com. v. Arner, <a href="/pa/149/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="149 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="832527" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0085-01">149 Pa. 85</a>.
