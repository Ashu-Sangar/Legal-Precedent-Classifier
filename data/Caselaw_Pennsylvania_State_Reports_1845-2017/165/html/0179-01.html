Shortly afterwards the house was totally destroyed by fire, and thereupon the plaintiff issued an attachment execution on the judgment and caused the same to be served on Frederick Theis, the designated state agent of the insurance company, at his office in the city of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The attachment was served personally on said agent by the sheriff of Luzerne county who, for that purpose, was specially deputized by the sheriff of Westmoreland county to whom the same was directed. The writ, in usual form, after reciting the judgment of $400, etc., contains a clause of summons commanding said insurance company, garnishee, to be and appear etc. on the first Monday of May then next to show cause, if any it has, why the judgment aforesaid should not be levied of the effects of said defendant in its hands, agreeably to the acts of assembly, etc. Neither the insurance company nor its said agent appeared in person or by attorney, and on August 26th the court, being advised of the company’s default, gave judgment against it in the form approved by this court in Lyman v. Beam, <a href="/whart/6/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="6 Whart. 181" data-case-ids="1836985" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0181-01">6 Whart. 181</a>, and Jones v.

Subsequently the defendant garnishee moved the court to strike off the last mentioned judgment, set aside the service of the attachment, etc., because; <em>(a) </em>“ The court has no jurisdiction over the said garnishee ; ” (b) “ There is no act of assembly authorizing the issuing and serving of such writ, or requiring the insurance company to come into this court and make answer; ” <em>(e) </em>“ The state agent of said insurance company does not reside within the county of Westmoreland; ” <em>(d") </em>“ A person or corporation not a resident can only be attached in the county where it can be properly served ; ” and <em>(e) </em>“ The said service is illegal and void.” The court, recognizing the reasons, thus assigned by the defendant garnishee, as sufficient, struck off the judgment entered against it in default of appearance, and set aside the service of the attachment execution.

    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[268,1960,1166,502]],["BL_207.1",207,[159,383,1162,188]]]'>While this act is somewhat involved and not as clearly expressed as it might have been, we think it was intended to authorize service of an attachment execution on the state agent of a foreign insurance company, garnishee, whether the agent has his office in the county whence the writ issued or not. In other words, we are of opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, the service of the writ, on the garnishee company’s state agent, was made according to the provisions of the act, and its legal effect is the same as if it had been served personally on his principal, within this state. For the purpose of being served <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>with any “ writ, rule, order, notice or decree, ” authorized by the act, the state agent is pro hac the company itself, and is to be constructively regarded as a resident of each and every county in the state.</p>
    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[160,589,1165,1419]]]'>The act is not obnoxious to the objection that it is special legislation and therefore unconstitutional. Foreign insurance companies, licensed to transact business in this state, have always been considered and are in fact essentially a distinct class of corporations, justifying and requiring legislation appropriate to the class itself. If such companies, owing their existence to some authority outside and not having their principal offices within the state, are permitted to transact business here, it must necessarily be upon such terms and conditions as will enable the insurance department of the commonwealth to supervise their business operations, etc., and place them within easy and convenient reach of process at the suit of the commonwealth or any of its citizens. Hence the provision requiring them to appoint a state agent on whom “ any and every writ, rule, order, notice or .decree,” etc., may be served with the “ same effect as if served personally on the company within this state.” The specified forms of process are very comprehensive. “ Any and every writ” clearly comprehends an attachment execution, which is of a twofold nature. As to the defendant in the judgment on which it issues, it is a species of execution process,' but as to the garnishee who becomes a party defendant therein, it is an original process—a summons commanding him to appear and show cause, if any he has, why judgment in favor of the plaintiff should not be levied of the goods and effects of the defendant in his hands. In form as well as in effect, the summons clause of an attachment execution, required to be served on the garnishee, is in every proper sense-of the term a “ writ,” and therefore within the provisions of the act.</p>
