It indicates a man with accurate knowledge of the business he wishes to transact. We are well satisfied that it was written, signed and sent by him. The letter of instructions is as follows: . . . . ‘ I made deeds to my sons for their shares of my property.; I ivant you to make a deed from Richard Knowlson and Harriet F.

Had the direction of the letter been literally complied with, the deed would have been absolute on its face, and Mrs. Fleming would have executed an agreement as to the conditions. The attorney, intending to carry out the instructions, embodied the conditions in the deed instead of in a separate paper, and prepared a will as to the personalty.</p>

Scott is that, regardless of the form of an instrument, ‘ a disposition of property to take effect after the death of the grantor, if it vests no present interest, but only directs whát is to be done after the death of the maker, is a will and not a deed. A disposition to take effect after death is a will.’ With this rule we have no contention. Although Turner v. Scott has been cited as a leading case ever since the decision was made, my impression is that the case itself,—not the principle—was never entirely satisfactory, even to the Supreme Court or to the profession. Agnew, J., dissented. The dissatisfaction was and is with the interpretation of the meaning of the paper. Its interpretation was put by Judge Woodward at the time, principally, and in succeeding cases it has been put wholly, on the potency of the words contained in the grant, after reserving a life estate. ‘And this conveyance in no way to take effect until after the decease of the said John Scott, the grantor,’ and in the haben<a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>dum ‘ to have and to hold the premises after the decease of the said John Scott.’ See Eckman v.

In the court below these words were construed in connection with the whole instrument; in the Supreme Court as though they stood alone. In numerous subsequent cases in which all the other parts of the instrument are substantially identical with that in Turner v. Scott, except the words above quoted, the instrument has been decided to be a deed. The master is of the opinion that the present case is stronger than Turner v. Scott on the same side. We do not so consider it.</p>

The habendum has no qualification of the absolute grant contained in the body of the deed. The deed is a conveyance in fee simple, absolute on its face and taking immediate effect, were it not for this condition or reservation, to wit: ‘ But it is expressly understood that the above described conveyances are made subject to the following terms, conditions and reservations, to wit: First. The aforesaid Richard Knowlson reserves to his own use and enjoyment the full interest and estate in the above described properties, the rents, issues and profits thereof for and during the term of his natural life. Second. Should Harriet Foster Knowlson, wife of Richard Knowlson aforesaid, one of the parties of the first part thereto, survive the said Richard Knowlson, then at his death she shall have for her own use the full right, title and estate in the undivided one half of the whole of the above described properties or one half of the rents, issues and profits thereof for and during her natural life.’</p>

But is it a declaration that the interest granted to the daughter is not to vest until the death of the grantor ? We think it is not, but that it is a present grant of .the estate —a vested interest in the grantee. The words ‘ the full interest and estate in the above described properties ’ seem to us to be merely intended to be, and are in fact and law the same as ‘ the rents, issues and profits thereof,’ and each is for the life of the grantor—each or both together mean but a life estate. This is further evident from the clause, reserving a life estate for <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>his wife—where ‘ right, title, interest and estate, ’ is made the equivalent of ‘rents, issues and profits thereof.’ The intention to presently vest a fee in the grantee, subject to the rights for life of the grantor, seems to us very evident from the words of the deed.</p>

Woodward, J.

We may say here that in Pennsjdvania a recorded de,ed will be construed as having the effect of a feoffment with livery of seizin, or as a deed under the statute of uses, as- will best accomplish the intention and design of the parties: Act of May 28, 1715, sect. 5, 1 Smith’s L. 95.’</p>
