This defence is unavailing because the affidavit alleges no facts or circumstances whatever upon which to found a belief, and the mere averment of a belief, without stating the facts upon which it is founded, gives no information to the court upon which it can determine their efficiency; and if there are no facts and circumstances known to the affiants there is nothing upon which to ground any belief.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[270,835,1163,1302]]]'>But independently of this consideration the affidavit of defence alleges only, in its second clause, that the plaintiff took the note under such circumstances and with such knowledge of the fraud as were sufficient to put it upon inquiry and that inquiry would have led to a discovery of the fraud, and it nowhere alleges actual knowledge of the fraud when the note was taken. The learned court below considered that this averment was sufficient to prevent judgment. But this court decided as long ago as 1870 in a well considered case, and in an exhaustive and elaborate opinion by Mr. Justice Rj3ad, in the case of Phelan v. Moss, <a href="/pa/67/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="67 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1022516" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0059-01">67 Pa. 59</a>, that such a defence when proved by testimony was no defence at all in an action on a negotiable note. We there held that a holder of a negotiable note bona fide for value without notice can recover it, notwithstanding he took it under circumstances which ought to excite the suspicion of a prudent man. Justice Read reviewed the authorities in England and this country, and showed with conclusive force, that, even in England, where for a short time the opposite doctrine obtained a lodgment, starting with the case of Gill v. Cubitt, 3 B. &amp; C. 466, it had been altogether abandoned and overruled. This was accomplished through a series of decisions, when, in the last of them, Goodman v. Harvey, 4 Ad. &amp; Ellis, 870, Lord Denman said, “We have shaken off the last remnant of the contrary doctrine. Where the bill has passed to the plaintiff without any proof of bad faith in him, there is no objection to his title.”</p>

Blackstock, <a href="/watts/3/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="3 Watts 20" data-case-ids="1841320" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0020-01">3 Watts, 20</a>, in which Judge Sergeant expressed a concurrence, though unnecessarily, in the doctrine of Gill v. Cubitt. And he also showed that this court <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>had never followed Beltzhoover v. Blackstock in this regard but had followed the opposite rule. He concludes by assuming that the note was obtained by fraud on the maker, and, reviewing the circumstances of suspicion, among which was the fact that the plaintiff bought the note, which was for $250 against a solvent drawer, for $100, he adds, “ Neither one nor all these facts, if found by the jury, proved mala tides on the part of the holder, or brought home to him knowledge of the fraud; but on the contrary it was clear that he was a bona fide holder for value without notice, and of course entitled to recover.” This case has been many times recognized and followed by this court and never departed from to this date. In McSparran v. Neeley, <a href="/pa/91/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="91 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="488847" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0017-01">91 Pa. 17</a>, Mr. Justice Woodward said, “Phelan v. Moss has been uniformly followed, since it was decided,” and in that ease also we decided that the indorsee of a negotiable note who took it before maturity, bona fide for value without notice, is entitled to recover from the maker, though a fraud was practiced on the maker in obtaining his signature to the note ; the fact that a negotiable note which was obtained by fraud was taken by the holder under circumstances which ought to have excited suspicion will not defeat a recovery; it must be shown that it was taken mala fide.</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[182,1510,1166,350]]]'>Most extended references both to decided cases and text writers could be added to the foregoing, but it would be a waste of time and space. We conclude therefore that the averment upon this subject in the second clause of the affidavit of defence in this case is of no consequence whatever, and could not suffice to put the plaintiff to any proof on the trial. The burden of proving actual bad faith would still rest on the defendants.</p>

No actual circumstance of suspicion is stated, and no fact impeaching the bona fides of the holder, or as affording a ground of belief to that effect appears anywhere in the affidavit. If, on the trial, the defendants should prove exactly what they have alleged in the second clause of the affidavit, to wit, that they <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>believe and expect to be able to prove that the plaintiff was not a bona fide holder for value, and that he took the note under circumstances of suspicion, they would have accomplished nothing. Instead of proving belief they would be obliged to prove the fact of mala tides, and although they proved actual circumstances of suspicion, it would avail them nothing.</p>

It avers that the plaintiff, being a national bank, took usury in discounting the note at twenty-five per cent or upwards of its value. It is impossible to understand how any allegation of usury can be made as to such a note as this, or how these defendants can have any interest in the usury in any event. The note was not given for a loan of monejr but for the price of a horse sold to them. They agreed to pay t|833.33 for the horse and not for a loan of a sum of money twenty-five per cent less than that amount. In the case of Barnet v. National Bank, <a href="/us/98/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="98 U.S. 555" data-case-ids="11302" data-case-paths="/us/98/0555-01">98 U. S. 555</a>, the Supreme Court of the United States construing the act of Congress of June B, 1864, sec. 30, on the subject of taking usury by national banks, said, that the act defined two categories of such cases, which they then stated. This case cannot possibly come within the first category of the act, to wit, “ Where illegal interest has been knowingly stipulated for but not paid, then only the sum lent without interest can be recovered,” because no sum of <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>money was lent, and no illegal interest was stipulated for, the rate mentioned in the note itself being six per cent, which is a lawful rate.</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[157,524,1165,1268]]]'>The second category is in these words, to wit: “ Where such illegal interest has been paid, that twice the amount so paid can be recovered in a penal action of debt, or suit in the nature of such action, against the offending bank, brought by the persons paying the same or their legal representatives.” There are at least three fatal reasons why the defendants can take no benefit from this provision. (1) It has been decided several times by the Supreme Court of the United States that this defence cannot be made even by the maker of the note in an action against him on the note (Barnet v. National Bank, <a href="/us/98/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="98 U.S. 555" data-case-ids="11302" data-case-paths="/us/98/0555-01">98 U. S. 555</a>), nor by the surety (Stephens v. Monongahela National Bank, <a href="/us/111/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="111 U.S. 197" data-case-ids="3506536" data-case-paths="/us/111/0197-01">111 U. S. 197</a>), because the only remedy given by the act of Congress is by a penal action to be brought for the recovery of double the amount of the illegal interest charged, and it therefore cannot be set off in an action on the note. (2) Because no persons but those who paid the illegal interest or their legal representatives, can recover it. (3) Because no illegal interest was charged or paid upon a “ sum lent,” and therefore none can be recovered. The defendants, if they owe anything on this note to the plaintiff, owe the whole amount of $833.33, with six per cent interest, less any payments that were made on account. They do not owe it for money lent but for the price of a horse. So far as these defendants are concerned it is a matter of no consequence whether the plaintiff paid for the note its whole amount or any sum less than that.</p>
