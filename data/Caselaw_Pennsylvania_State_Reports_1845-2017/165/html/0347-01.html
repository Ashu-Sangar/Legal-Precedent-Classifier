By doing this plaintiff unnecessarily kept the car longer on the road than it should have been, thereby materially causing the cabbage to decay while in transit; ’on the contrary, had plaintiff selected either of said other lines suggested above the car could have reached its destination and been delivered a good deal earlier and thereby assisted in the preservation of the merchandise while in transit (as aforestated).</p>

Had plaintiff taken the necessary precautions in ventilation which it was his duty to do under the circumstances stated aforesaid, this process of sweating would not have been encountered; defendants state this act of plaintiff itself greatly damaged the cabbage in interior of car; taken in connection with the inferior and unmerchantable grade of cabbage placed in car, stated aforesaid, spoiled the entire interior; defendants state that if plaintiff had done his dutjr as aforesaid stated all this decay and spoiled cabbage could not possibly have occurred; they therefore state that the spoiled and decayed cabbage in said alleged car is attributable entirely to the acts of the plaintiff stated as aforesaid and at plaintiff’s loss ; defendants further allege that they never ordered from plaintiff the car of cabbage which he actually shipped to defendants at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and they further say that they are not indebted in manner and form as charged in plaintiff’s statement herein.”</p>

The purchaser might rely upon the goods being merchantable at the time of shipment, and upon their being packed in the manner and with the care usual to prevent their deterioration and decay while in transit. If the goods were unmerchantable at the time of shipment, or if they became so before arrival because of the unusual and negligent manner in which they were packed by the vendor, it was the right of the vendee to refuse them.
