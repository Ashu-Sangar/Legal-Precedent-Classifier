But under the act of assembly incorporating the company, with the rules of the company included in the deed and made conditions of the conveyance, the use of the lot was limited solely for burial purposes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b55-3" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[151,623,1169,557]]]'>“ That the lot was purchased as a family burial lot for the Lewis families is manifest from the deed, and the subsequent arrangement by the brothers. A monument was erected, at the joint expense, in the center of the lot, the four sides facing the four corners, and each side inscribed with the name of one of the brothers. The corner space opposite the name was set apart as a burial place for that family. The father and mother were buried at the two opposite corners of the monument, thus placing them partly in each of the four divisions, and clearly indicating the family character of the entire lot. The3r were parental ties binding together the four families.</p>

It did not affect the title or the uses for which the lot was purchased and dedicated. The title still remained in the four brothers as the joint owners of the entire lot. It was still the family burial lot.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.6",55,[153,1445,1173,450]]]'>“ The owner of a burial lot may doubtless permit the interment of any relative, or even a stranger, in his lot. No rule or regulation of the company has been referred to which prohibits that. But in the case of two or more joint owners, no one has that right; it would require the consent of all. Neither George Lewis therefore, nor his widow, had any right to authorize the interment in their portion of the common lot of any person not a member of the Lewis family, without the consent of the other joint owners.</p>

It does not appear that any objection was made to their interments at the time, or at any time until after the widow and children conveyed their interest in the common lot in 1890! On these facts it is fairly to be inferred that the other joint owners consented to their interments, or at least had no objections to them. After the lapse of these years, it is too late to raise that objection;</p>

Doubtless, she took the legal title to the undivided one fourth. But she took a legal title, subject to all the trusts and conditions attached to the lot. It was a burial lot of the Lewis families. She had no right to bury any person there, not of the Lewis family, without the consent of the other joint owners. She did not bury any person there after the date of the deed. But she died in July, 1893, after the original bill in this case was served upon her, and her executors, W. W. Lewis and Thomas Garothers, buried her there, and subsequently put up the tombstones. And this was done after express notice to them not to do so ; for which the supplemental bill was filed.</p>

We do not think this finding is sustained by the evidence. Miss Walker, in her answer, expressly denies it. W. W. Lewis, in his testimony, said that he did it, and that Miss Walker had nothing to do with it. The only evidence to the contrary is the testimony of W. A. Lewis and C. L. Lewis, who said they visited the premises in October, 1891, when they did not see any defacement, and believe nothing o£ the kftid had tlien taken place. This was after the date when W. W. Lewis said he did it. The master thinks W. W. Lewis must be mistaken as to the date, and it was done after W. A. and C. L. Lewis had inspected it. This we do not consider sufficient evidence to overcome the responsive answer of Miss Walker, and the positive testimony of W. W. Lewis.</p>

But iu any event Miss Walker is not responsible for it. W. W. Lewis is responsible for it. Whether he did right or wrong in doing it, this is not maintained in this case. It was done by him personally, and not as executor, and before he was a party to this proceeding. If he did so wrongfully, it was a trespass for which he is answerable.</p>
