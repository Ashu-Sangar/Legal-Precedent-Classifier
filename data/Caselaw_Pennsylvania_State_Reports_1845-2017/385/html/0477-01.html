Approximately a quarter of a 'mile to the north of the plaintiff’s cemetery the de-. fendant contractor was required, in accordance with its contract and related plans prepared and supplied by the 'State Highway Department, to construct a fill some 35 feet high and extending 1,000 to 1,500 feet in length. The fill necessarily crossed, at right angles, a narrow <em>(2f </em>wide) stream, which fed the plaintiff’s ponds and which was conducted through the made embankment by a steel pipe culvert. The plaintiff’s ponds were some 1,200 feet distant from the right-of-way of the Expressway, and the stream in its intervening meandering passed under two other highways. By the time the defendant had completed its contract, dirt and silt, washed by the natural effects of erosion from the slope of the fill, had been carried by the stream <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>into the plaintiff’s ponds and eventually filled them. The plaintiff had the ponds dredged and built a desilting basin to prevent their being filled again in such a manner. The cost of that work was the quantum of the damages which the plaintiff sought to recover in the instant suit.</p>
    <p id="b501-3" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[159,685,1148,1101]]]'>The plaintiff, in its amended complaint, alleged that the damage to its ponds and the deposit of dirt and silt therein were the result of the defendant’s negligent construction of the highway fill in disregard of the possible effects of erosion and that, in thus filling the ponds with dirt and silt, the defendant was guilty of trespass <em>guare clausum fregit. </em>The defendant in its answer denied that it had constructed the fill negligently or carelessly but, on the contrary, averred that it had performed the work in a careful, lawful and prudent manner in accordance with its contract with the State Highway and Bridge Authority and the accompanying plans and specifications. The defendant joined the Authority as an additional defendant, but the latter’s preliminary objections were sustained on the ground that the Authority was an instrumentality of the Commonwealth and, therefore, immune from suit in the absence of specific statutory provision. No appeal was taken from the order eliminating the Authority as an additional defendant.</p>

That issue was accordingly withdrawn from the jury by the learned trial judge with the consent of counsel and is no longer in the case. The defendant had affirmatively proved that all of its work had been done in strict accordance, with the contract and the plans specifications. The trial judge submitted the case to the jury for two special findings, — “1. Do you find from the evidence that this embankment <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>■washed, down on the plaintiff’s property?” and <em>“2. </em>What was the damage to the plaintiff in attempting to <em>correct </em>the result of the wash-down of that earth? How many dollars?” The jury answered “yes” to the first question and, in answer to the second, fixed the amount of the damage to the plaintiff in dollars. The question of law as to whether the plaintiff had a right to recover against the defendant in the premises was reserved by the court which, thereafter, answered the question in the affirmative and entered a judgment for the plaintiff in the amount fixed by the jury’s special verdict. On exceptions, the judgment was confirmed by the court en banc, and the defendant appealed.</p>

The slide, in turn, produced large fissures and cracks in a public highway, higher up on the hillside, which was open to travel while the new construction work was going on below. The damage thus done to the existing public highway necessitated that it be closed. The closure entailed great loss and expense to the plaintiffs who were the operators of a bus line with a certificated route over the closed highway. The plaintiffs’ <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>buses were compelled to mate detours of considerable additional mileage with resultant loss of passenger revenues and at increased expense of operation. It was to recoup such losses that the plaintiffs sued the defendant company for damages on the theory that the defendant was guilty of maintaining a nuisance in unnecessarily delaying the repair of the public highway and, consequently, in not getting it open for travel within a reasonable period of time. The defendant, in performing its construction contract with the Commonwealth according to the plans and specifications, had been compelled to excavate at the foot of the steep hillside, just as it had done; and the plaintiffs conceded that the slide was not caused by any negligence on the part of the defendant. We affirmed the judgment of nonsuit entered below because of the contractor’s non-liability.</p>

But, there is a very crucial legal difference between the two cases. <em>E wall’s suit was not against the contractor, </em>who had built the adjacent portion of the turnpike, <em>but ivas against the Turnpike Commission itself. </em>We held that the Commission was liable for the proven consequential damages because the Western Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension Act of 1941, P.L. 101, under which that section of the turnpike was constructed, expressly charged the Commission with the payment of compensation for property damaged or destroyed by the construction, operation and maintenance of the turnpike. Whether the State Highway and Bridge Commission would be liable for the damage to the plaintiff’s ponds is not involved in this case. The <em>Ewalt </em>case is therefore not in point.</p>
