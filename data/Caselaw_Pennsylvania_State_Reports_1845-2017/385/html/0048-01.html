A secondary question then followed as to whether the evidence adduced at the hearing before the Civil Service Commission was sufficient to warrant the employee’s dismissal.

Addison, a patrolman of the City of Philadelphia, was dismissed by the Commissioner of Police for conduct unbecoming an officer in that he had accepted a mortgage loan of $2500 from one Leo “Clee” Coleman, a well-known “numbers banker”. At the hearing before the Civil Service Commission on Addison’s appeal of his dismissal, it was established beyond question that the $2500 loan was the full purchase price of a residence property bought by Addison at sheriff’s sale; that the money so loaned was wholly supplied by Coleman; and that the mortgage which Addison and his wife executed to secure the loan named Leo Coleman as mortgagee and was for a ten-year term with interest at four per cent. At the time of this occurrence and for upwards of four years prior thereto, Addison’s area of police duty embraced 1632 North 13th Street which was the location of “Clee” Coleman’s “headquarters”. Addison denied that he knew Leo Coleman personally at the time of the mortgage transaction but admitted that he had known of “Clee” Coleman, “the numbers banker”, for many years. He claimed not to have thought of Leo Coleman, the mortgagee and lender of the purchase money, as being “Clee” Coleman. Addison further testified that the loan had been arranged for by one Abe Johnson, a real estate agent of the neighborhood, whose services Addison had enlisted before he bid in the property at sheriff’s sale. Johnson was not only well acquainted with Addison but also with “Clee” Coleman with whom he <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>had had considerable business dealings. When Addison and his wife signed the mortgage, he read and noted that Leo Coleman was the mortgagee. He said that it was more than eighteen months after the mortgage had been placed that he first knew that the loan had come from “Glee” Coleman — a discovery which he did not communicate to anyone. About that time the mortgage was assigned to another lender. On the testimony so adduced at the hearing, the Civil Service Commission found Addison guilty of gross stupidity, if not culpable impropriety, in accepting a full purchase price mortgage loan on generous terms from one engaged in a “business” such as Coleman’s, operating within Addison’s bailiwick. The Commission accordingly concluded that Addison’s dismissal by the Police Commissioner was for just cause.</p>

The principal reasons assigned for the conclusions arrived at in the <em>Connolly </em>case, and the only ones raised on this appeal, are (1) that Philadelphia’s Home Rule Charter was incapable of restricting the jurisdiction and power of the court of common pleas in respect of appeals thereto since the court is not a municipal instrumentality and (2) that the Act of September 29, 1951, P.

It is argued that because plaintiffs perform their respective functions and duties in pursuance of general laws which impose similar or identical duties upon officers holding corresponding positions throughout the Commonwealth, the city is thereby shorn of all power to interfere with them or their employes. Nothing could be further from the truth, it being abundantly clear that the limitations of power referred to in section 18 concern only laws in relation to substantive matters of State-wide concern, such as the health, safety, security and general welfare of all the inhabitants of the State, and not to matters affecting merely the <em>personnel </em>and <em>administration </em>of the offices local to Philadelphia and which are of no concern to citizens elsewhere.

The administration of Philadelphia’s civil service with reference to the removal or discharge of City employees is obviously not a matter of substantial State-wide interest but is one of purely local concern. It is beyond reasonable dispute that the subject does not affect the general welfare of the inhabitants of the State outside of Philadelphia. Consequently, the Charter provision prevails in the premises and not the general statute.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.6",78,[250,2134,1154,209]],["BL_79.1",79,[174,351,1152,2003]],["BL_80.1",80,[266,357,1152,97]]]'>That brings us to the other of the two main grounds relied upon by the court below, namely, that the limitation upon the scope of court review of a decision by the Philadelphia Civil Service Commission is unconstitu<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>tional. The error in that conclusion is transparent. It stems from the fact that the court mistakenly conceived of the Home Buie Charter as being something less, in force and effect, than a statute. Thus, the court opined that whatever else the Home Rule Charter is it is not a law enacted by the legislature. Of course, it was not enacted by the legislature. But, it emanated from the relevant provision of the State Constitution, implemented for appropriate execution by the enabling Act of 1949, and was duly adopted (i.e., enacted) by the affirmative vote of the electors of the City as the organic law of the corporate municipal body. That the Charter constituted legislation no less than does a statute of the legislature to like end is too plain for even cavil. Whether a municipal charter comes into being by direct statutory grant of the legislature or by adoption by the constituent electorate in the exercise of power constitutionally reposed, it is as much legislative in the one instance as in the other and has equal legal force and standing in both. Indeed, a constitutionally permissible adoption of a municipal charter by the electorate is not one whit less in dignity than a statute of the legislature granting a charter. Where it is adopted by a constitutionally empowered electorate, it affords an example of pure democracy — the sovereign people legislating directly and not by representatives in respect of the organization and administration of their local government. Specifically, therefore, Philadelphia’s Home Rule Charter constitutes legislation (i.e., the adoption or enactment of a law by a competent body) just as much as did the City’s Charter of 1919 which the legislature itself enacted. Wherefore, upon its due adoption, Philadelphia’s Home Rule Charter took on the force and status of a legislative enactment. There is no special virtue in the word “legislative” merely because it stems from the same root <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>as “legislature”. It derives its qualifying meaning from the character of the thing done.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[259,467,1159,1554]]]'>It follows that the limitation on court review of decisions of Philadelphia’s Civil Service Commission, as provided for in Section 7-201 of the Charter, was competently and effectively enacted and was not an exertion of the City’s power to legislate concerning municipal affairs, as the learned court below erroneously assumed. In fact, the opinion for the lower court expressly conceded, as indeed it had to, that the legislature could have limited the scope of appellate review to the extent provided by Section 7-201 of the Charter and consonantly cited <em>Kaufman Construction Co. v. Holcomb, </em><a href="/pa/357/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="357 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="472102" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0514-01">357 Pa. 514</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20534" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="55 A.2d 534">55 A. 2d 534</a>. In that case our present Chief Justice, speaking with respect to the difference in court review where a statute or arbitration agreement makes no mention of any right of appeal and where it is provided that the order or decision of the adjudicating agency shall be final and no appeal allowed, aptly said, — “The distinction thus made has been reiterated and reinforced in a multitude of subsequent cases holding that where a statute expressly provides that there shall be no appeal the scope of appellate review is limited to the question of jurisdiction and the regularity of the proceedings; the merits of the controversy cannot be considered even though the interpretation given to the facts or the law by the governmental agency or the court below may have been erroneous.” See the many cases cited in footnote 2 at p. 518 of the <em>Holcomb </em>case, supra.</p>

    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.7",82,[277,615,1155,325]]]'>The First Class City Home Rule Act of April 21, 1949, P. L. 665, authorizes cities to frame and adopt or amend their own charters and exercise all powers and authority of local self-government “subject to the limitations hereinafter prescribed”. The limitations hereinafter prescribed are, inter alia:</p>
    <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.8",82,[277,953,1157,427]]]'>“Section 18. . . . Notwithstanding the grant of powers contained in this act, no city shall exercise powers <em>contrary to</em>

      </a>
      <em> </em>or in limitation or enlargement of, <em>powers granted by acts </em>of the General Assembly which are — (a) Applicable to a class or classes of cities on the following subjects: (9) ... (b) Applicable in every part of the Commonwealth, (c) Applicable to all the cities of the Commonwealth.”</p>
    <p id="b82-7" data-blocks='[["BL_82.9",82,[278,1401,1154,212]]]'>It is crystal clear that that Act is directly applicable to and controls the instant case, and invalidates that part of the Charter which is in conflict with the Act of September 29, 1951, P. L. 1654, 53 PS §304.</p>
    <p id="b82-8" data-blocks='[["BL_82.10",82,[278,1626,1155,489]]]'>The Act of September 29, 1951, supra, provides “all decisions of the Civil Service Board or Commission <em>in any city </em>shall be subject to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas. . . . The appeal may be taken by any employe aggrieved thereby, . . . .” Could any language be clearer? That Act, by the clear language contained in its title and in its provisions, applies not to some cities, or to all cities except cities of the first class, or except to chartered cities — it applies to all cities.</p>
    <p id="b82-9" data-blocks='[["BL_82.11",82,[278,2130,1152,98]],["BL_83.1",83,[156,344,1152,771]]]'>That Act of the Legislature is by its clear terms and intent of State-wide application to <em>all </em>cities. It <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>grants unquestionably to discharged civil service employes <em>a right of appeal </em>to the Courts. This right of appeal is not a mere matter of procedure or local concern — it is a matter of substance, a matter of Statewide concern, which the Legislature wisely said in the Act of 1951 applies to <em>all </em>cities. A right of appeal <em>to a Court </em>given to a policeman or other Civil Service employe who is discharged from his job for “just cause”, by a civil service commission, is such a fundamental, substantive, American right that it is of Statewide concern, not only to the Legislature but to all of the people of Pennsylvania! As such, it is paramount to and invalidates any City Ordinance or City Charter which, as here, conflicts therewith.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a>

    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[148,1129,1156,1051]]]'>The decision of the majority flies directly in the teeth of the clear language of the Act of 1949! The majority relies upon <em>Lennox v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/372/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="372 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1238062" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0355-01">372 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.2d%20834" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="93 A.2d 834">93 A. 2d 834</a>. That case was factually entirely different from the instant case, and as such is clearly distinguishable. If, however, we assume that the language of that opinion is applicable to the instant case, i.e., that subparagraphs (b) and (c) of the Act of 1949 limited the City of Philadelphia to <em>substantive </em>matters of State-wide concern, it does not support the majority opinion but strengthens and confirms this opinion. Moreover, the majority opinion is contrary to and in conflict with <em>Kelly v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/382/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="382 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1259968" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0459-01">382 Pa. 459</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20238" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="115 A.2d 238">115 A. 2d 238</a>. The Federal and out of state decisions cited in the majority opinion are not only not binding but also they are clearly distinguishable — in those cases there was no statutory or constitutional limitation of the rights of a city to local self-government such as exists in Pennsylvania.</p>
