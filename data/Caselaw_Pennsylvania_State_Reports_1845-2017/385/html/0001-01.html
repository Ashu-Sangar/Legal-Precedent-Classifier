This finding was based not upon direct testimony but upon an inference from the testimony produced by the employes. This finding was vigorously contested by the <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>employer, whose officers vehemently denied the charge and testified that Dean, Walker and Edwards “quit” and that Cimino was discharged for misconduct and neglect of duty, motor vehicle violations, unsatisfactory work, insubordination and improper conduct as an employe. Much of the testimony by or on behalf of the employes was in direct conflict with the strong testimony on behalf of the employer. The employer contends that the evidence was inadequate to establish that the employes were discharged for their union activities. This is the first question involved in the case.</p>
    <p id="b25-4" data-blocks='[["BL_25.5",25,[192,953,1146,156]]]'>We adopt the following excerpts from the able opinion of Judge Kaufman speaking for the Allegheny County Court:</p>
    <blockquote id="b25-5" data-blocks='[["BL_25.6",25,[191,1122,1149,1050]]]'>“. . . Charles Dean, Frank Cimino, William T. Walker and Charles Edwards were regular employes of the employer on and prior to September 27, 1954. The employer had no union or other labor organization connected with its business and had no labor contract with anyone. Shortly before September 27, 1954, the four employes named above had signed membership applications and had joined the union. On September 27, 1954, the officers of employer received information to the effect that the said employes had joined the union, and one of the officers, James P. Crivelli, approached Dean and Cimino and inquired of them whether it was true that they had joined the union. They replied that it was true, and that Walker and Edwards had also joined the union. James Crivelli then attempted to persuade them to withdraw their membership from the union, and he told them that the company was opposed to a union and would not hire union men, . . .</blockquote>

James Crivelli suggested that a secret informal vote be taken among the four employes to determine who wanted a union, and he prepared four ballots for this purpose. All the employes refused to vote or sign the ballots, each of which stated ‘I am willing to work for Crivelli Bros, as a non-union man.’ Cimino asked James Crivelli if he would be discharged for joining the union, and when he received no answer he repeated the question. James Crivelli then told Cimino that he was ‘fired’ and told Nick Crivelli, a company clerk, to prepare and give Cimino his pay check in full. James Crivelli then assigned as the reason for discharge Cimino’s tardiness in reporting for work, although at the later Board hearing additional reasons were given. However, the Board found that the discharge of Cimino was a direct result of his having joined the union and his engaging in union organization activities.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b26-4" data-blocks='[["BL_26.5",26,[253,1396,1158,593]]]'>“The Board further found that the other three employes walked out of the office with Cimino at this time, held a short conference among themselves, and then returned and advised the officers of the employer that they had decided to remain with the union and ‘stick with Cimino’. James Crivelli then told them that they too were discharged and directed that their paychecks be prepared and delivered to them. The Board found that their discharge was also because they had joined the union and engaged in union organization activities.</blockquote>

From any payments of back wages to be made to these discharged employes there must be deducted not only all amounts earned by them since their discharge but also any that could have been earned had they reasonably sought other employment. As stated by Mr. Justice Paekee in the latter of those cases (p. 227, A. P. 901) : ‘it was not the intention of the legislature that one who is deprived unlawfully of his employment should be maintained in idleness when he has had an opportunity to do work for which he is fitted. The employee is bound <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>to use reasonable efforts to find work and keep employed. This is the same rule that is applied to a discharged employee who sues for a breach of contract.’ Moreover, if the business of the Mar-Lo Company has since diminished and the number of its employes has been reduced because a larger force was not required to meet its needs, such circumstances should be taken into account in determining the period during which these employes would normally have been employed had they not been discharged in violation of the Labor Relations Act.”</blockquote>

Crivelli further testified that the corporation had intended for several months prior to said date to discontinue deliveries by truck because they were economically burdensome and to change its mode of business operation in this respect, and that the only reason the trucks had not been sold previously was because Crivelli Bros, could not get the current market price.</p>

On October 5, 1954 William Leap purchased from Crivelli Bros. Sales and Service, Inc., a subsidiary of Crivelli Bros., one of Crivelli Bros.’ trucks. Leap thereafter hauled and delivered merchandise on a contract basis for Crivelli Bros, but for no other person. He did not have a license from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. On or before October 5, 1954 Fiorino Martin, an employe of Crivelli Bros. Sales and Service, Inc., purchased from Crivelli Bros, one of the trucks of Crivelli Bros. On October <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>19, 1954, the date of the hearing, Martin was driving the truck he purchased and doing part time work for Crivelli Bros. At the time of the hearing Crivelli Bros, had put up for sale, but had not been able to sell, two additional trucks. The other three trucks owned by Crivelli Bros, prior to September 27, 1954 were being driven by Angelo Crivelli, Nicholas Crivelli and, inferentially, by George Crivelli, all of whom prior to said date had been driving trucks for Crivelli Bros. There is no explanation of why the three Crivelli brothers continued to drive Crivelli trucks. This is in substance all the evidence pertinent to the second issue in this case.</p>

However, the Board and the Court did conclude “. . . that the subsequent disposal of equipment and reduction in number of employes <em>was </em>precipitated<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> by the union picketing which followed the discharge ...
