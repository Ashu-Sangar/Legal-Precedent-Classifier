An answer was filed by the defendants, to which the plaintiffs have filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. In moving the Court for judgment, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants lack the legal power to restrict or prohibit the expansion of a nonconforming use.</blockquote>

Existing improvements on the ground consist of a combination store and dwelling immediately adjacent to the intersecting roads and a two level barn with attached garage on the easterly portion of the lot along Middletown Road, the frontage on the Middletown Road being approximately two hundred twelve (212') feet. The entire premises is zoned R-2 residential; however, the store exists as a non-conforming use. The plaintiffs intend to expand the existing store operation to a ‘farmers market’ operation in the barn.</blockquote>

Although a report denying the exceptions was rendered on September 23, 1954, the plaintiffs, on October 22, 1954, informed the Board of Adjustment that the ‘application for exception was withdrawn.’</blockquote>

This application stated that the building is to be used as ‘extension and enlargement of present market’. On April 25, 1955, the building inspector refused the permit. Thereafter, the plaintiffs appealed to the supervisors of Middle-town Township and a hearing on the appeal was held <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>on June 13,1955. On July 3,1955 the supervisors made a report and order refusing the permit ‘for the erection of an overhang over the door of the barn building which the applicant proposes to use for business purposes, . . .
