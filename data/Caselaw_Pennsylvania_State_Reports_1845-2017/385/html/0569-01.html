In the time intervening since his death, the aggregate value of the combined estates had increased considerably. And, so, Mrs. Hitchcock, in apparent belief that the increase in the value of the combined estates over what it had been at the date of her husband’s death was her own to do with by will as she chose, concluded that the participating interest of Mr. Hitchcock’s relatives under the joint will was but one-half of the value of the combined estates at the date of his death. On December 15, 1942, Mrs. Hitchcock executed another codicil amending the codicil of the day before in certain particulars.

L. 521, as amended, 72 PS §2302. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that the amount paid to the relatives of Halbert Hitchcock in discharge of their claims as devisees and legatees under the joint will of Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock is an inheritance and not a debt of the deceased wife and consequently not an allowable deduction from the gross estate in ascertaining the clear value subject to tax.</p>

      <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>The Commonwealth concedes that the contract between Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock providing for their joint will was entered into bona fide, that the agreement was a binding and enforceable contract and that a donee beneficiary may enforce a contract made for his benefit.

    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[164,862,1149,425]]]'>The question is whether the amounts paid by the executor of Mrs. Hitchcock’s estate to the members of Mr. Hitchcock’s family in settlement of their claims under the joint will of the Hitchcocks were contracted for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth. The plain and obvious answer is that they were not; they were testamentary benefactions and not debts.</p>
    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.6",597,[162,1310,1150,942]]]'>The only consideration passing between Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock for the agreement to make a joint will was their reciprocal promises, each to the other, as to the testamentary disposition to be made of what remained of their combined estates upon the death of the survivor. While such promises were sufficient to support the agreement and to constitute it a binding and enforceable contract, they were not an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth. The appellant, however, contends that the payments were deductible debts (and induced the auditing judge into so believing) on the strength of an ingenious argument ostensibly founded on our decisions in the <em>Heller </em>and <em>Mills </em>cases, cit. supra. The defect in the contention is that it entirely misses the point of those cases, which depended upon a controlling circumstance wholly wanting here.</p>

    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[267,682,1157,1280]]]'>That such was the <em>ratio decendendi </em>in the <em>Neller </em>case (which the <em>Mills </em>case later followed in principle) is not open <em>to </em>cavil. The effect of <em>the </em>separation agreement was very earnestly mooted in this court as a reading of the majority and dissenting opinions in the <em>Neller </em>case will readily reveal. Under the Federal Estate Tax Act, the relinquishment of a marital right was not a consideration in money or money’s worth for the creation of a debt deductible in ascertaining the clear value of the estate subject to tax. And, the requirement in the Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance Tax Act in such regard was <em>ipsissimis verbis </em>with the cognate Federal provision. Nevertheless, this court held in <em>Neller Estate, </em>in a four to three decision, that the adjustment and relinquishment of marital property rights by the husband and wife in their bona fide separation agreement constituted consideration in money or money’s worth. The determinative element was that the contract creating the debt wás a separation agreement between the husband and wife settling for good their material affairs and not an amicable arrangement between them while they would continue to live together in amity.</p>
    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.6",598,[267,1974,1154,380]],["BL_599.1",599,[173,356,1152,1109]]]'>The rationale of the <em>Neller </em>case is patent. Mr. Chief Justice Maxey, speaking for the court in that case, declared that “when this husband and wife <em>decided to separate and the husband promised his wife in writing </em>that he would support her by paying the sums stipulated, this promise gave rise to a debt. The amount of support due at his death was as much a debt as would <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>have been any arrearages in the weekly sums he had agreed to pay her for her support” (Emphasis supplied). And, in <em>Mills Estate, </em>supra, Mr. Justice Stearns, who there spoke for a unanimous court, after quoting the foregoing from the <em>Weller </em>case, said that “Since the decision in <em>Weller Estate, </em>supra, it is no longer an open question in Pennsylvania that a <em>bona fide </em>separation agreement between a husband and wife providing for a payment at the husband’s death, constitutes a <em>debt </em>and is consideration in money or money’s worth.” Elsewhere, the opinion in <em>Mills Estate </em>confirmed the statement of Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Steen in <em>Stadtfeld Estate, </em><a href="/pa/359/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="359 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="473088" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0147-01">359 Pa. 147</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20478" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="58 A.2d 478">58 A. 2d 478</a>, that “Neller Estate . . . held that the share of a decedent’s estate due to his widow <em>under a separation agreement </em>is not subject to the Pennsylvania transfer inheritance tax since the payment made to the widow out of the estate is not in the nature of a legacy but is merely the liquidation of a debt” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

For that reason, <em>Mills Estate </em>was remanded for findings appropriate to the question of the adequacy and fullness of the consideration after “a more searching inquiry ... in the court below concerning the ages of the parties, the extent of their respective property, the prospects of financial advancement and the earning capacity of the husband and an analysis of that which the wife relinquished and what she was to receive.” Such inquiry had nothing to do, however, with whether the consideration was in money or money’s <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>worth. Where, as in the instant case, the consideration for the agreement is <em>not </em>in money or money’s worth, it is unnecessary to consider the further requirement of adequacy and fullness.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[262,589,1155,766]]]'>The meaning of <em>Neller Estate </em>is plain and now firmly fixed; and we have no intention of departing from it. But, at the same time, we are not disposed to see its true intendment stretched into authority for a proposition that has neither reason nor merit to justify it. If what the appellant here contends for were to receive judicial sanction, the intended impact of the Pennsylvania transfer inheritance tax could be successfully avoided by any husband and wife by the simple expedient of a contract to make a joint will disposing of their combined property on the death of the survivor to persons to whom they wished it to go, coupled with the execution of a joint will in pursuance of their agreement.</p>

So much may readily be conceded. But, a taxable’s motive in minimizing his liability is irrelevant so long as his tax return does not exceed the law’s relevant allowances. In <em>Superior Oil Company v. State of Mississippi, </em><a href="/us/280/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="280 U.S. 390" data-case-ids="3911053" data-case-paths="/us/280/0390-01">280 U.S. 390</a>, 395-396, Mr. Justice Holmes succinctly expressed the law’s attitude to tax avoidance when he said, — “The only purpose of the vendor here was to escape taxation. . . . The fact that it desired to evade the law, as it is called, is immaterial, because the very meaning of a line in the law is that you intentionally may go as close to it as you can if you do not pass it.” See, also, <em>Bullen v.

This is so because ‘nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands: taxes are enforced exactions, not voluntary contributions.’ ” In <em>City Stores Co. v.

Mrs. Hitchcock was incapable of breaching her agreement with her husband, containing the joint will, so long as a court of competent jurisdiction was sitting to adjudicate disputes arising out of wills or agreements relating thereto. The joint will agreement was not an ambulatory document. It was executed in triplicate, and proof of its existence was at all times certain. By its express terms, it was “not only a will, but a binding contract between the parties.” It is indeed anomalous to have the appellant argue, in one breath, the binding and enforceable effect <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>of the agreement and then, in the next, have it assert that Mrs. Hitchcock’s alleged breach of the agreement had rendered it unenforceable.</p>
    <p id="b602-3" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[267,536,1156,1381]]]'>The joint will agreement was not susceptible of being breached by Mrs. Hitchcock’s sole action. If her separate codicil was in accord with the intent of the joint will, then what she provided by the codicil was but superfluous confirmation of what the husband’s relatives were entitled to receive by virtue of the will. If, on the other hand, the codicil violated the intent of the joint will, the husband’s relatives would still take according to the provisions of the will. The above quoted Thirteenth Section of the agreement expressly provided that the will could not “be changed by either party without the consent of the other, except as to the distribution of that half of the joint estate, if any, which ultimately will go to the devisees of the last survivor . . . .” It is plain enough, therefore, that, while Mrs. Hitchcock, as the survivor, could change the distribution of the half of the joint estate going to her devisees, she was powerless to change the distribution of the half that was to go to the husband’s beneficiaries. Nor could she change what, according to the will, constituted the quantum of half of the estate for distribution to the testamentary beneficiaries. Whatever the husband’s relatives were entitled to receive of the estate remaining after Mrs. Hitchcock’s death they took under and by virtue of the joint will and not otherwise.</p>
