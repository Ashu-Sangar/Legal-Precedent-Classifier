    <p id="b451-7" data-blocks='[["BL_451.9",451,[165,1187,1151,825]]]'>Plaintiff is president of the food chain, a highly successful enterprise which had its origin in a neighborhood store owned by him. Through his efforts, and those of his wife and son, the business prospered and grew into the present chain of stores. In the course of its growth, defendant-son was given stock in the corporation, and became the active manager thereof. Throughout there appears to have been considerable conflict between plaintiff and his son, but not of a nature to create legal difficulties until the events leading to the execution of the instrument in question; even though over a period of some 14 years the son had sought to have plaintiff relinquish control of the corporation with the avowed purpose of keeping it in the family.</p>
    <p id="b451-8" data-blocks='[["BL_451.10",451,[167,2026,1146,155]],["BL_452.1",452,[264,342,1159,706]]]'>Plaintiff’s first wife, and mother of defendant-son, died on May 2, 1951. Plaintiff apparently became lonely and began paying attention to the former wife of <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>Ms nephew, whom he subsequently married. In the first week of July, 1951, the son learned that plaintiff contemplated immediate marriage and expressed his. displeasure. Through Arthur Dennis, Esq., the attorney for the corporation (who also represented the son), it was arranged that a meeting be had in plaintiff’s home on July 10, 1951, at which the intended wife would be present, and at which time the plaintiff would execute an instrument or instruments to assure the wishes of his son as to the stock in the company. The attorney prepared an agreement placing the stock in trust for the son’s children, and retaining control in himself until his death. This was never executed.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[258,1070,1158,934]]]'>The attorney arrived early for the meeting, and having shown the trust agreement to plaintiff, was ordered to leave because of plaintiff’s dissatisfaction with what had been provided. 'Shortly thereafter the son and his family arrived with the vice-president of the company. Learning of the treatment given the attorney, they engaged in argument with plaintiff and then departed. On the same evemng plaintiff called defendant-son, who agreed to resume negotiations. Plaintiff also requested the attorney to prepare an agreement to assure the son’s wishes and to keep peace and harmony in the family. Thereupon, they returned to plaintiff’s home where after considerable discussion the attorney dictated and plaintiff’s intended wife typed the instrument in question. Also prepared, and signed by the present Mrs. Rose, was a pre-nuptial agreement disclaming any rights in the stock.</p>
    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[255,2017,1152,322]],["BL_453.1",453,[197,340,1149,883]]]'>There was no valuable consideration passing to the plaintiff; and he alleged, as the court below found, that the inducement therefor was the false representations of defendant-son that by doing so peace and harmony witMn the family would be restored. This is based on assertions by the attorney, made in the son’s <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>presence during the discussion in which he and the others engaged, such as: “If that is going to satisfy them, if that is going to make happiness in the family for Heaven’s sake do it”; “Stop worrying about it. Just put your name down, and everything will be all right, everybody will be peaceful.” According to plaintiff, after the instrument was signed, “everybody seemed to be happy. <em>Everybody promised each other </em>good will and happiness to be, and stated it was going to be all right.” (Italics .supplied). Further, in the course of discussion, it was made clear that one of the considerations for execution of the instrument was the son’s acceptance of the father’s intended wife as a member of the family. His .subsequent conduct established that he had no intention to so accept her. The findings of the court are fully supported by the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[200,1235,1147,435]]]'>Plaintiff was married the following day and left for a honeymoon trip of a month’s duration. In the meantime, the son .succeeded in having the stock of the corporation exchanged and sold, so that he thereby obtained full control. This gave rise, upon plaintiff’s return from his honeymoon, to an acton whereby plaintiff succeeded on November 29, 1951, in having the parties restored to their prior positions.</p>
    <p id="b453-6" data-blocks='[["BL_453.6",453,[199,1683,1147,482]]]'>The parties continued to- have considerable controversy, with the son being guilty of most reprehensible conduct towards plaintiff, both in public and in private. Finally, the son claimed that the plaintiff had no power to effectuate an intended exchange of plaintiff’s stock for that of another large chain of stores. This assertion of the son prevented such exchange, and plaintiff thereupon instituted this action on June 22, 1953.</p>

    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[235,680,1158,767]]]'>The trial judge first found for defendants; but after argument on exceptions filed by plaintiff, the court en bane entered judgment for plaintiff, making a finding that defendant-son had taken unfair advantage of plaintiff in that he never intended, at the time of the agreement, to keep harmony in the family. It arrived at this conclusion by reviewing the number of requests and attempts in prior years by the son to obtain control of the corporation; finding that the son, and the attorney in the son’s presence, had declared that execution of the instrument would restore family peace and harmony, and that by his subsequent actions the son had established that he never intended to bring about such harmony.</p>

    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[165,510,1148,1218]]]'>A consideration of the testimony leaves no question or doubt that plaintiff was induced to execute this instrument by the son’s <em>promise </em>that peace and harmony would thus be restored. That is, that he would thereafter so conduct himself that they would not be in continual controversy. It is the only natural meaning to be derived from the words expressed to plaintiff. He sought out the plaintiff, arranged for the meeting, was present at all times during the conversation, and accepted the instrument on the basis of the assurance to the plaintiff that they would have no more difficulties. If the defendant-son himself had uttered the words ascribed to the attorney, no one could doubt that he made the promise attributed to him. Defendant-son acknowledges to his presence during the meeting and discussions, and even though he believed in his assertions that he “remained mute,” still it must be held that he ratified, or adopted, the attorney’s acts as his own. It was his duty to repudiate them immediately if the attorney had exceeded his authority. Cf. <em>Yarnall v.

His conduct was atrocious.

Harmony failed solely because of the son’s actions. As we said in <em>DeBernard v. DeBernard, </em>supra, at page 197, so here: “It was solely in reliance upon the truth of all of this [his promises] that plaintiff made the [instrument] . . . This was not merely a breach of an oral promise or agreement . . . but a deliberate fraud practiced upon [plaintiff] ... It is a fair inference from the facts and circumstances surrounding the [execution of the instruments] . . . and his isubsequnt conduct that he never intended to do what he stated he would. This was fraud.” If the conclusion that at the time of execution of the instrument defendant-son had no intention to carry out his promise is a finding of fact by the court below, it is sustained by the testimony; and if solely an inference from the testimony, such inference is adopted by this Court.</p>
