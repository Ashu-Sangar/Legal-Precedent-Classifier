In 1866, 28 then existing local Camps united to form a State Camp. A constitution was adopted and the State Camp was incorporated under a special Act of February 27, 1867, P. L. 285, which provided that the persons therein named and their associates were created a body corporate by the name, style and title of the “State Camp of the Patriotic Order of Junior Sons of America of the state of Pennsylvania,” with the power generally to “do all and singular the matters and things which may be lawful and necessary for the well being and due management of the affairs thereof.” The Act further provided that the corporation should “consist of such persons as are now members, or shall be hereafter admitted as such, agreeably to the by-laws of said camp.” By the Act of March 18, 1869, P. L. 896, the title was changed to the “State Camp of the Patriotic Order, Sons of America.”</p>

The charter recited that in accordance with the constitution, laws and rules of the National and the State Camp there was granted to the members of the local Camp full power to receive and initiate proper persons and instruct them in the workings of the Order on such rules and terms as the laws of the Order required, and to perform all the rights, duties and privileges of a camp of the Order, while they conformed to all the laws and rules thereof.</p>

Thereupon the State Cam]) made demand on it to surrender its property and assets. It complied with the request as far as its charter, books, accessories and paraphernalia were concerned but it refused to give up its real estate, which consisted of a building or lodge hall it had owned since the year 1905; instead, it turned over possession of this property to the defendant George Bankin, one of its members, who is still collecting the rents therefrom and has refused to account for them to the State Camp. Accordingly, the latter instituted the present proceedings in equity praying that Bankin and all former members of Camp No. 135 be restrained from using the name of a Washington Camp, Patriotic Order Sons of America, that it be ordered to deed the real estate to the State Camp, and that Bankin be directed to account for moneys received by him as income from the property.

However, Pennsylvania State Camp, Patriotic Order Sons of America, was not incorporated under the Act of 1874 but under the special Act of 1867. When incorporated it had already been in existence as a patriotic fraternity for a period of 20 years, there were also subordinate Camps then in existence (indeed the very incorporators of the State Camp were members of these local Camps), and the legislature presumably recognized this situation for it provided that the corporation should consist of the then present members as well as those thereafter admitted. The organization and workings of a fraternal order of this nature were undoubtedly well understood and it must be assumed that the State Camp was impliedly given by its charter of incorporation the power and authority to appoint agents and to license subordinate Camps to carry out the purposes of the Order; it could scarcely have been conceived that a State Camp would exist without local subordinate Camps. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. v. Heilman, </em><a href="/pa/241/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="241 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="976076" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0374-01">241 Pa. 374</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20666" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="88 A. 666">88 A. 666</a>, it was held that, where National, State and subordinate Councils of a fraternal Order formed a harmonious, orderly system for the transaction of the business of the Order and the promotion of the principles for which it was organized, the incorporation of the State Council did not create a new society but simply gave the existing body a corporate form. In <em>Schriner v. Sachs, </em><a href="/pa/253/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="253 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="1024028" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0611-01">253 Pa. 611</a>, 616, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20724" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="98 A. 724">98 A. 724</a>, 725, it was similarly declared that the incorporation of a lodge, there known as a “Circle,” did not affect the relation between the Supreme Circle and the subordinate bodies <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>which had previously existed prior to the incorporation of the parent body. Both of these cases were cited with approval and followed in <em>Nokomis Tribe No. 307, Improved Order of Red Men of Pennsylvania Dissolution Case, </em><a href="/pa/331/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="331 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1184285" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0053-01">331 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%2023" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="200 A. 23">200 A. 23</a>, which, in turn, was approved as to this principle in <em>Grand Lodge of Knights of Pythias v.

By the same token, the incorporation of Camp No. 135 in 1904 did not in any way change its previous status as a subordinate lodge of the State Camp. Moreover, it is highly doubtful whether, in any event, it lies in the mouth of Camp No. 135 to challenge the power of the State Camp to have issued to it the charter under which it operated for more than 60 years and the benefits of which it enjoyed during that entire period. Prom the time of receiving its charter from the State Camp, it continuously initiated new members into the Order according to its ritual, sent delegates to the sessions of the State Camp, made annual reports of its financial condition, and continued to use the rituals of the Order in operating as a Camp of the Order, thus clearly acknowledging its subordination to the constitution and laws of the parent body; moreover each and every member at the time of his initiation took a solemn oath to support and obey the constitution and by-laws of the organization.</p>

Article II of the General Laws of the Order provided that the State Camp should have the power to annul the charter of a local Camp for any of certain specified causes. Article XVII of the Constitution of the State Camp provided that in case of the forfeiture of the charter of a subordinate Camp the members there<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>of should surrender all its property and effects of every description. Article XXVII of the General Laws declared that all property, moneys and effects of subordinate Camps were held in trust for the purposes of the Order, and any division, distribution or appropriation of such property, moneys and effects among the members of such Camp was strictly forbidden, the parent body having the right to proceed in law and equity to recover from the person or persons who may have received such property, moneys or effects. All these provisions entered into the contract established by Article XXXIII, Section 34, of the General Laws, which provided that the Certificate, the Charter, the Constitution and Laws of the National, State and subordinate Camps, and the application for membership in the Order signed by the applicant, should constitute the contract between the Order and the members.
