Although a formal contract is to be thereafter executed, if the terms have been agreed upon legal obligations may arise: <em>Morganstern Electric Company v.

In the latter the Court held, at page 76: “But here the contract was already in writing, and it was none the less obligatory upon both parties because they intended that it should be put into another form, especially when their intention is <em>made impossible by the act of one </em>

    <p id="b65-5" data-blocks='[["BL_65.5",65,[176,699,1148,376]]]'>In this case, as pleaded, the terms were full and complete and were mutually understood and agreed upon. The minds of the parties had met, and there was a valid and binding contract. The later instrument, rendered impossible of execution because of defendant’s own act, was not a prerequisite to right of action by plaintiffs.</p>

Plaintiffs having fully performed under the contract, and defendant having accepted the benefits of their performance, it cannot by its own act defeat plaintiffs’ rights. In addition, the temporary impossibility to perform was in contemplation and recognized by the parties. Defendant was excused from performance during that time, but once it acquired title its duty to perform became absolute: Restatement, Contracts, §462. When defendant had acquired title it gave no notice thereof to plaintiffs. Immediately upon learning that defendant had acquired title, plaintiffs <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>requested performance, which was already beyond defendant’s power since the screenings had been almost totally removed. At this point, however, plaintiffs were entitled to the same period of time to remove the screenings as had been given under the contract.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[256,638,1154,490]]]'>Defendant cannot avoid its obligation by the mere expediency of delay in obtaining title — a matter over which the plaintiffs had no control — there being no increased or undue burden cast upon defendant thereby. See <em>Acchione v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/347/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="347 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1217404" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0562-01">347 Pa. 562</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20764" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="32 A.2d 764">32 A. 2d 764</a>. Every circumstance was foreseen and provided for by the parties, and defendant must be put to its proof to establish any right to avoid performance under the agreement.</p>
