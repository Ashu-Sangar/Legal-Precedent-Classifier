As to tbe first transaction it is our opinion that no gift was effected because donative intent was wholly lacking. It is obvious that decedent, who bad fallen into large arrearages on tbe order for bis wife’s support and was being brought to book in tbe matter by ber counsel, took tbe precaution before entering upon negotiations with him to denude himself of all his cash resources wbicb would naturally have been tbe immediate target of bis wife’s attack, a purpose which was emphasized by bis cautionary request to Miss Laier to keep tbe transaction a secret. But apart from tbe well-nigh obvious inference that tbe delivery of tbe $55,000 to Miss Laier was designed merely to put that sum beyond tbe reach of an attachment and not to make her the owner thereof, ber own account of what was said by decedent in delivering ber the check clearly shows that she was receiving it merely as a custodian and with a definite obligation to return it or any part of it on bis demand. Sbe testified that be wanted ber to take it and put it in her bank account and <em>whatever was left </em>— not the $55,000 but <em>whatever was </em>left— after returning any amount he might ask for was to be a gift from him; sbe recognized and accepted an obligation to make such return even to the extent of tbe entire amount. After sbe did return him $20,000 then, and only then, did decedent express an intention to make ber an absolute gift of tbe remaining $35,000; sbe <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>testified that she “didn’t want to take it”; and by thus demurring to its acceptance she conclusively shows that until that time no gift had been made and that decedent had not relinquished dominion and control over the $55,000 or any specified portion thereof.</p>

On this occasion decedent in effect told Miss Laier, according to her testimony, that she was no longer to be obligated to return the remaining $35,000 but that she was to keep it as a gift from him. The question arises: What does the law require to effectuate the gift of such a chose in action — the forgiveness or release of an obligation — as distinguished from the gift of a chattel or tangible object? To constitute a valid gift inter vivos there must be not only a donative intent but also an active or constructive delivery of the thing to be given. In the case of an obligation represented by physical evidence, such as a bond or a note, the delivery thereof, being the best and only delivery that can be made, is sufficient for the purpose. But, as stated in Brown on Personal Property, p. 199, §61: “When the chose in action is not embodied in a bond, bill of exchange, promissory note, or other instrument which ... is in a particular sense the tangible representative of the obligation, the difficulty of discovering in a gift thereof something analogous to the delivery of tangible chattels is immeasurably increased.” Accordingly, in the case of the gift of a debt or obligation not so evidenced, the law requires either the delivery of a receipt acknowledging payment in full <em>(Lewis’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/139/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="139 Pa. 640" data-case-ids="11252564" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0640-01">139 Pa. 640</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.%20635" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="22 A. 635">22 A. 635</a>; <em>Fassett’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/167/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="167 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="866807" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0448-01">167 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.%20686" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="31 A. 686">31 A. 686</a>; <em>Schwarz v.

Decedent on November 10, .1952 <em>gave </em>Miss Laier (to whom he stood in loco parentis) a check for §55,000. as a gift to be divided equally between herself and her brother who was a minor. He told her “he might possibly ask for some of the money <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>back”. She deposited the check not in his bank account or in a joint bank account but <em>in her own bank account. </em>That was a valid delivery and constituted a valid gift subject to revocation by the donor. The motive of the donor is, at least as far as this case is concerned, immaterial. It is an indisputable fact (a) that there was a valid delivery to Miss Laier and (b) that she always retained this money in her sole and exclusive possession. The point overlooked by the majority is that <em>this was not a debt. </em>It was money which, we repeat, Miss Laier had in her own exclusive possession, in her own bank account.</p>

This was not a debt, or a release of a debt owing by the donee to the donor; it was not, as implied by the majority, a gift of a mere chose in action as that designation is used by the cases — it was an absolute unconditional gift of $35,000 dollars, all of which was in the possession of the donee. As the majority opinion says: “.Delivery in this as in every other case must be according to the nature of a thing. It must be an actual delivery, so far as the subject is capable of delivery ... If the thing be not capable of actual delivery, there must be some act equivalent to it.” The majority opinion admits that the decedent had a donative intent on July 4, 1953; and the facts clearly demonstrate, we <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>repeat, that there was an actual delivery to donee and actual and exclusive possession by donee of the $35,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> in controversy.</p>
