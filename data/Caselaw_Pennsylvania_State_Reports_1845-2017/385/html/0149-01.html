The accident happened as the result of the derailment and overturning of the caboose at a point where the defendant coal company’s private road crossed the railroad track upon which the caboose was being backed by a shifting locomotive at the time of the derailment.</p>

Subsequently the plaintiff instituted the instant action against the coal company to recover damages for his injury on the ground that negligence on the part of the coal company in causing the private crossing to become slag-littered was the proximate cause of the derailment and the plaintiff’s consequent injury.</p>

However, in order that a release of one person from liability may bar an action against another for the same injury, the two must have been jointly liable. Accordingly, a release of one who is not legally liable for an injury to another does not operate to release the culpable tortfeasor. In <em>Koller v.

The case was tried and submitted to the jury with the controlling effect of the above stated legal principles clearly in mind. Not only did the learned trial judge fully and correctly instruct the jury on the applicable law but defendant’s counsel submitted direct and pertinent cognate points for instruction which the trial judge affirmed and read to the jury, expressly pronouncing them to be correct statements of the law. The only one of the defendant’s points which the trial judge refused was the one for a directed verdict. Nor did defendant’s counsel take any exception to the court’s charge save for one presently immaterial matter. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $10,000. The defendant filed motions for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial, both of which the court en bane refused; and the judgment from which the defendant took this appeal was entered on the verdict. The appellant assigns for error the lower court’s refusal of the motions for judgment n.o.v. and new trial.</p>

And, to be liable, the railroad would have had to be negligent. Such is the requirement of the Federal Employers Liability Act, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Stat.%2065" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="35 Stat. 65">35 Stat. 65</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A751" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="45 U.S.C. §51">45 U.S.C.A. §51</a>.

The basis of his liability is his negligence, not the fact that injuries occur. And that negligence must be ‘in whole or in part’ the cause of the injury.” As observed in <em>Wilkerson v. McCarthy et al., Trustees, </em><a href="/us/336/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="336 U.S. 53" data-case-ids="3938748" data-case-paths="/us/336/0053-01">336 U.S. 53</a>, 61, “the issue of negligence is one for juries to determine according to their finding of whether an employer’s conduct measures up to what a reasonable and prudent person would have done under the same circumstances. And a jury should hold a master ‘liable for injuries attributable to conditions under his control when they are not such as a reasonable man ought to maintain in the circumstances,’ bearing in mind that ‘the standard of care must be <em>commensurate to </em>the dangers of the business.’ Tiller v. Atlantic C. L. R. Co., <a href="/us/318/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="318 U.S. 54" data-case-ids="364279" data-case-paths="/us/318/0054-01">318 U.S. 54</a>, 67.”</p>

The inference is not an unreasonable one that the wheels of the caboose were forced up and over the rails by the slag. It is equally clear that the negligent condition created by the slag on the crossing was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. No other cause which could account for the derailment was advanced by either side. In <em>Foley v. The Pittsburgh-Des Moines Company, </em><a href="/pa/363/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="363 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1221661" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0001-01">363 Pa. 1</a>, 25, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20A.2d%20517" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="68 A.2d 517">68 A. 2d 517</a>, we said that “Proofs to a degree of absolute certainty are rarely attainable; it is sufficient if they are such as to satisfy a reasonable mind; the law does not require the elimination of every <em>possible </em>cause of the accident other than that on which the plaintiff relies, but only such other causes, if any, <em>as fairly arise from the evidence: </em>[citing cases]. The testimony need not exclude everything which the ingenuity of counsel may suggest as having <em>possibly </em>caused or contributed to the injury: [citing cases]. All that a plaintiff is required to do is to prove, to the satisfaction of the court and jury, that the act or neglect of the defendant was the proximate cause of the injury; if he does this he can recover, even though the evidence to sustain his burden of proof does not absolutely exclude every possibility other than the one sought to be established: <em>King v. Equitable Gas Co., </em><a href="/pa/307/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="307 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1138170" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0287-01">307 Pa. 287</a>, 294, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%2065" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="161 A. 65">161 A. 65</a>, 66.”</p>

However that may be, the evidence plainly shows that the defendant assumed dominion over the crossing by first improving it substantially about two years before the accident with a surfacing of “red dog” and by placing slag on the private highway including the crossing of the railroad track shortly before the accident. While the de<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>fendant may not have had any obligation originally in respect of the crossing, when it undertook to improve it for its own convenience it thereby incurred the duty of exercising the care of a reasonably prudent person which, in turn, required that the defendant not foul the railroad tracks and thus expose persons rightly using it to the risk of bodily harm. In <em>Hudson v. Grace, </em><a href="/pa/348/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="348 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1220273" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0175-01">348 Pa. 175</a>, 177, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20A.2d%20498" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="34 A.2d 498">34 A. 2d 498</a>, it was said that “the principle which determines the imposition of liability is simple and constant, being based on the proposition that one who, by sub-standard conduct, causes injury to another is legally responsible therefor if the harmful consequences of such conduct could reasonably have been foreseen. When that principle is applied to the present facts, however unusual they may be, there can be no doubt of the liability of the [defendant] to plaintiffs in this action.”</p>
