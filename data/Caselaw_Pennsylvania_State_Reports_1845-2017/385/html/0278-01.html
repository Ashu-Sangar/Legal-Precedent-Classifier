The plaintiff was elected Treasurer of the First Class Township of Upper Moreland in November of 1945 for the term of four years from the first Monday of January 1946. By virtue of his office of Treasurer he was also the Tax Collector for the Township and the School District of the Township which is a third class school district. Plaintiff was again elected in 1949 for a four year term and once more elected in 1953 for a like term. <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>From 1946, up to and including 1953, tlxe plaintiff paid the premium on tlxe bond be was required by law to furnish to cover the collection of school taxes. The plaintiff wag a candidate for the nomination of Treasurer at the May primary of 1953, and as required by law, the officers of the School District, by resolution fixed, the compensation of the tax collector and sent him, on March 16, 1953, a notice stating what the compensation of the tax collector would be. This notice was received by the plaintiff more than ten days before the last day for withdrawing his name as a candidate. The plaintiff was nominated at the May primary and subsequently elected at the Novexnber election. He entered into his new term of office on the first Monday of January 1954. By the Act of July 13th, 1953, P. L. 411 section 1, the premium on the bonds of tax collectors in school districts of the third class situated in Townships of the first class are required to be paid by the school district. The Act by its tei-ras was not to become effective until after the 31st day of December, 1953. [<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>]</p>

The school district contends that in fixing the rate of compensation for its tax collector it took into consideration that he had to pay the premium on his bond and that, therefore, in effect the school district is paying the premium. There is nothing in the records of the school board to sustain this contention and it is without merit. The school district further contends that the Act of 1953, supra is unconstitutional when applied to the 1954. premium of the tax collector’s bond. We are of the opinion that there is merit in this contention.</p>
