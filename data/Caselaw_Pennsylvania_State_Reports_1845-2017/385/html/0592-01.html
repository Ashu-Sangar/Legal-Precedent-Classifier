The selection of a site for a large housing project necessarily involves many considerations; it is largely a question of practical judgment, common sense and sound discretion. By a host of authorities in our own and other jurisdictions it has been established as an elementary principle of law that courts will not review the actions of governmental bodies or administrative tribunals involving acts, of discretion, <em>in the absence of bad faith, fraud, capricious action or abuse of </em>power; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> they will not inquire into the wisdom of such actions or into the details of the manner adopted to carry them into execution. It is true that the mere possession of discretionary power by an administrative body does not make it wholly immune from judicial review, but the scope of that review is limited to the determination of <em>whether there has been a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion </em>or a purely arbitrary execution of the agency’s duties or functions. That the court might have a different opinion or judgment in regard to the action of the agency is not a sufficient <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>ground for interference; judicial discretion may not be substituted for administrative discretion. Accordingly, all jurisdictions which have had occasion to consider the question agree that a court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of a Housing Authority as to the proper site for a housing project. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[255,678,1157,654]]]'>The lower Court gave several -reasons for enjoining the Authority — first, the Authority abused its discretion when it eliminated Site D and -selected Site F in its primary program. Site D was eliminated by the Authority because “It was not a particularly desirable lot because of its location, because of -its dimensions, and third it was eliminated on the advice of counsel because within the confines of the lot there were certain areas that there was some question as to our ability to acquire promptly.
