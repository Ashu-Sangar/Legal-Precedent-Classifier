    <p id="b299-11" data-blocks='[["BL_299.19",299,[187,1498,1150,604]]]'>The sole question in this case is whether an additional provision in a written contract for the sale and purchase of a coal-washing machine (which was constructed, accepted and paid for) constituted an option or a definite undertaking on the part of the buyer to purchase two additional machines within a specified period. The learned court below, in an opinion to which we can add nothing, construed the provision to be an option, which the buyer never exercised. The judgment will therefore be affirmed on the opinion of President Judge Pentz reported in 5 D. &amp; C. 2d 314.</p>
