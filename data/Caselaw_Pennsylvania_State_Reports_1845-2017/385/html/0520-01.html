It is a picturesque stream which winds and curves with varying widths, sometimes attaining a maximum expansion of two miles. About one mile south of Millersburg, Pennsylvania, it is a half-mile wide and passes between two high hills collectively known as Berry Mountain. The broad passage between these hills is named the Berry Mountain Gap.</p>

The towers, which are 40 feet high, are constructed of I-Beams and are planted, respectively, atop the eastern hill which is 680 feet high, and on the western hill which is 657 feet high. The line, formed of three copper cables, measures 5,515 feet in length. Since the air distance between the two towers is only 5,366 feet, an inevitable sag brings the line to a low point of 125 feet above the river level.</p>

Section 58 of The Pennsylvania Civil Aeronautics Regulations (promulgated by authority of The Aeronautical Code of Pennsylvania, Act of May 25, 1933, P. L. 1001, as amended) provides that: “Exclusive <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>of taking-off or landing on a licensed airport or other property designated for that purpose by the owner, aircraft shall not be flown: Section 58.

However, the General Flight Rules of the Civil Air Regulations promulgated by the Federal Civil Aeronautics Board permit flying below the 500-foot level under certain conditions. Regulation 60.17 of the Federal rules declares:</p>

However, aside from the superiority of the Federal regulations, the facts in the case specifically adapt themselves to the Federal regulations since the pilot at the time of the fatal mishap was flying over “open water,” the situation described under Subsection (c) of Regulation 60.17.</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[267,796,1160,1497]]]'>The learned Court below was of the view that at the time the pilot fell he was not flying over open water. In this respect the Court said that within a stretch of 12% miles three transmission lines cross the river, that two islands and numerous islets occupy the stream, that the borough of Liverpool is “a short distance” (3% miles) north of the transmission line, and that there is one dwelling within 400 feet (the record says 400 yards) of the line on the Perry County side. But these geographical observations do not decide whether the river itself at the point of the accident was open water. The term “open water”, as used in the regulation, must be interpreted in the light of its land equivalent, “sparsely populated area.” The witness Clarence W. Hunter testified on this subject as follows: “Q. On May 11, 1950, that was the date of the accident which you have previously described, will you tell us whether there are any homes in the area underneath the electric transmission line on the Dauphin County side? A. No, sir. Q. Will you tell us please whether there were any homes on May 11, 1950, under the electric transmission line on the Perry County side? A. No, sir.” He testified also that 300 or 400 yards north on the Perry County side there were two homes and a hotel. Three human habitations some 1200 feet from the locus in quo on only one side of the river could not mate the area anything other than “sparsely populated.”</p>

Not a boat, swimmer, or fisherman disturbed the tranquil stream. Such an expanse of dead water would certainly fall under the designation of “open water.” The fact that a half-mile to the north a single small steamboat was heading toward shore could not change the locus in quo to something other than “open water.”</p>

But the <em>Rodgers </em>case can have no possible relevancy to the question as to whether there can be open water on the Susquehanna. The <em>Rodgers </em>case decided the question as to whether the term “high seas” in a Federal statute applies “to the open, unenclosed waters of the Great Lakes.” The opinion in the <em>Rodgers </em>case did not accept the term “open”, (as did the Dauphin County Court), as being equivalent to “unenclosed.” Many times in the opinion it used the two words, “open, unenclosed”, as describing the high seas. Justice Field, who wrote the Rodgers opinion, in referring to an opinion written by Justice Story in the case of <em>United States v. </em>Grush, 5 Mason 290, said: “It was the open, unenclosed waters of the ocean, or the open, unenclosed <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>waters of the sea, which constituted the ‘high seas’ in his judgment. There was no distinction made by him between the ocean and the sea, and there was no occasion for any such distinction.”</p>

This is what the <em>Rodgers </em>case said in that quotation at page 263: “It does not seem reasonable to suppose that Congress intended to confine its legislation to the high seas of the ocean, and to its navigable rivers, havens, creeks, basins, and bays, without the jurisdiction of any State, and to make no provision for offences on those vast bodies of inland waters of the United States.”</p>

It is true that there is evidence in the record that Levitz did pass within 175 feet of a steamboat but he did not do it under the circumstances visualized by the Dauphin County Court which said: “The deceased flew his plane within 175 feet of a steamboat in operation and crashed into the transmission line.” The picture painted by these words portrays Levitz precipitately descending <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>over the steamboat directly into the transmission line. The facts, however, wash away this image as entirely unrealistic. When Levitz was a half-mile away from the transmission line his airplane flew within 175 feet of the steamboat which was travelling in the opposite direction. The proximity to the steamboat and the collision with the transmission line were wholly unrelated incidents. Levitz was flying at the speed of 75 to 80 miles per hour so that the steamboat had been left far behind when the transmission line intervened its serpentine length. It took the steamboat ten minutes to get to the scene of the accident after the plane had passed it.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[168,1069,1148,1223]],["BL_552.1",552,[264,335,1152,99]]]'>Because, for an evanescent moment, Levitz’s course of flight took him within 175 feet of the passing steamboat, the Dauphin County Court held that he violated the Federal regulation in such a manner as to justify the compulsory nonsuit entered against the plaintiff. But the plane’s proximity to the steamboat had nothing to do with the wire collision and therefore should have played no part in the Court’s consideration of the motion for a nonsuit. In <em>Salvitti v. Throppe, </em><a href="/pa/343/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="343 Pa. 642" data-case-ids="1208320" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0642-01">343 Pa. 642</a>, 644, we held that: “A plaintiff who has violated a legislative enactment designed to prevent a certain type of dangerous situation is barred from recovery for a harm caused by a violation of the statute if, <em>but only if, the harm was sustained by reason of a situation of that type.” </em>This Court said further in that case, as we can say here, that: “Since, however, the accident was not a result of the hazard contemplated by the statute, the violation of the latter was an irrelevant factor.” A traveller is not burdened with an accumulation of all the untoward incidents which have happened to him on his journey. A motorist who passes a red light in Camden is not prevented, because of that fact, from re<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>covering against a truck driver who crosses a line and smashes his car to smithereens in Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[256,456,1160,1108]]]'>In further attempted support of its reasoning on the point of law just mentioned, the lower Court said: “Where there is no controversy concerning the manner in which an accident has happened, the proximate cause thereof may be judicially declared.” This observation presupposes what is not established. There <em>is </em>controversy in this case concerning the manner in which the accident happened — considerable controversy. The plaintiff contends that Levitz was killed because the defendant had strung its wires across the river in such a manner as to make them invisible to airmen. The defendant denies that this is true. The plaintiff further contends that the towers supporting the wires were hidden behind the topography and vegetation of the land and thus were not perceptible to pilots approaching the transmission line. This is also denied by the defendant. These two elements of factual controversy alone, aside from others in the case, render it impossible for a trial court to decide, as a matter of law, the proximate cause of the collision here involved.</p>

It said that the deceased pilot came to grief because he flew too low. If he had flown higher the accident would never have occurred, the Court below argues: “Altitude gives the flyer room and freedom to maneuver, enables him to view conditions on the ground in a broad field of vision and gives the flyer time to prepare for those conditions. These observations are clearly supported by the testimony in this case. Should there be an engine failure, there is nothing a flyer is so thankful for as altitude.” This is an observation which does not answer all the questions which logic could propound. It <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>can happen, of course, that with altitude a pilot may have an opportunity to select a place on which to land, if he can land- — softly. But in most instances where the engine fails, the higher the altitude the greater distance the pilot plunges. Moreover, the pilot who is flying entirely by observation must be reasonably close to the surface in order to distinguish the peculiarities of that part of the earth on which he is to land. The one possible advantage accruing to a pilot if his engine fails when he is at a great altitude is the realization that the greater the altitude the more time he will have in which to pray!</p>
    <p id="b553-3" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[165,1008,1151,1338]]]'>The lower Court said further: “The decedent chose to sacrifice the safety of altitude. He chose to fly below the top level of the mountain instead of over it. Flying along the river at this low altitude will only admit of one of two inferences, neither of which can help the plaintiff’s case. Either the deceased knew or he did not know of the existence of the wires. If he knew of the transmission line, he should not have come down. And if he did not know of the existence of the line, clearly he should not have flown in that area at that height without knowing the terrain.” Herein lies one of the major fallacies in the learned lower Court’s decision and opinion. It frequently speaks of <em>terrain, </em>thus applying to this case rules which might apply to overland flights, but not to overwater aeronautics. Thus, the Court says: “At low altitudes there is always danger of coming in contact with objects on the ground, and this danger must be known to every pilot. A pilot flying at an altitude of 125 feet is bound to know there is danger of encountering obstacles on the <em>ground. </em>One of the dangerous consequences to be reasonably apprehended in low flying, as revealed in this evidence, is coming In contact with structures on the <em>ground</em>

This, thus, would mean either a ship with a mast 185 feet high (scarcely to be expected on the Susquehanna) or a bridge at that elevation (also not to be expected on the Susquehanna). What the pilot struck in this case was not a ship or a bridge but wires which, according to the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, were invisible to the pilot.</p>

There was no testimony as to his destination or the nature of his mission. Nor does the evidence exclude that he could have been making an emergency landing. The fact that witnesses heard no unusual sounds from the plane’s engine does not prove that the pilot may not have found himself confronted with some other situation which required him to descend to the river’s surface.</p>

A plan in evidence showed that at that point the wire hangs at a 185-foot level. Since, in reviewing a record, the evidence, where a nonsuit is involved, must be read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the 185-foot level, for the purpose of considering the motion to remove the nonsuit, must be accepted as the level at which the collision occurred.</p>
