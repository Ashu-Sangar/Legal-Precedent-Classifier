Since the application was made under the <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>provisions of Section 1401 as amended, it would certainly appear that the only thing the Board of Adjustment had before them was the additional height of twenty feet.</blockquote>

The proposed apartment house will have the same number of units as one previously approved by the Board of Adjustment. The increased height will augment the parking area, and the lot area per family will not be reduced.

The land is situated in a B-Residence Zone in which multiple dwellings are permitted when allowed by a special exception granted by the Board of Adjustment. In 1950 the then owners of the tract applied to the Board for a special exception permitting them to build an apartment house containing 230 units. The Board granted the special exception. A number of the neighbors appealed to this court which affirmed the Board. (See <em>Appeal of Borden et al., </em>April Term, 1950, No. 14.) An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, which in a unanimous decision affirmed the judgment of this Court. (See <em>Borden Appeal, 3</em>69 Pa. Supreme Ct. 517 (1952).) The Supreme Court decision was handed down in March 1952 and between then and June 1955 when the application was made for the present desired exception, nothing of an official nature was done in reference to building on the tract in question. The appellants contend that this delay constituted an abandonment of the special exception granted in 1950 and that this present application <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>must be treated as a new application for a special exception to build an apartment house. . . .</blockquote>

For instance, there was a condition that the land on the site, not used for the proposed buildings, should remain open and unbuilt upon for thirty years. The record before us discloses no such condition. The buildings contemplated in the two applications are similar in size and contain the same number of units, namely, 230. The size of the site is nearly the same, 13% acres in the former application, 14 in this one. The entrances and exits in both schemes of development are substantially the same.</blockquote>
