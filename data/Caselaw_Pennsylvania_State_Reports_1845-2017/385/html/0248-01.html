    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[159,672,1152,484]]]'>It is to be noted that the deposit was made as a part of the lease before the contracts in question were entered into by these parties; and the deductions provided in the contracts applied to the <em>“sums received </em>from sales . . . less . . . cost of . . . operating the same . . These deductions specifically were not to include costs of drilling; nor were any costs or outlays required by the leasehold referred to in any way. In fact, it was declared that defendant then <em>owned </em>the oil and gas.</p>

The “cost of operation” here could mean only those charges or items of expense inseparably connected with the productive end of the business. With the defendant asserting unequivocally that it “owned” the oil and gas, no reasonably intelligent person could be deemed to understand that this deposit required in the obtaining of the lease was a part of the expense in operating the wells or selling the gas or oil. He could consider it to include only items of a productive nature attached to the operation of a well in being and in production.</p>

With completion of and compliance with the terms of its lease with the Commonwealth, defendant will obtain the money for its own use and disposition. It cannot charge the deposit to operating cost, any more than it could charge payments of interest on loans secured to obtain the lease or to purchase labor and materials for the drilling of the well. None of these items entered into the cost of operation. Cf. <em>Lytle, Campbell &amp; Co. v.
