Section 3 of the Law provides, inter alia, “That for the purpose of this act, an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated,. . . Fourth. If it be mixed, colored or changed in color . . . whereby damage or inferiority is concealed, or so as to deceive or mislead the purchaser; or if by any means, it is made to appear better or of greater value than it is.”. Section 8 charges the Department of Agriculture with the duty to enforce the Act and to “. . . make rules and regulations for the proper enforcement thereof . . .”, including rules and regulations setting up definitions and standards of articles of food. Pursuant to Section 8, the Department of Agriculture has promulgated certain regulations. Section 604 of these regulations defines <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>bakery products as including pies; Section 1003 provides that “Bakery products of all varieties, except cheese crackers and cheese wafers, shall be free from added color, either of synthetic (coal tar) or natural origin.

    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[269,802,1157,1503]]]'>Section 1003 of the regulations clearly exceeds the authority granted by the Legislature to the Department of Agriculture by Section 8 of the General Food Law in so far as it absolutely prohibits the use of added color in pies regardless of whether or not there is or may be deception of the general public. Under Section 8 of the General Food Law, the Department of Agriculture has authority to make rules and regulations for the <em>proper enforcement </em>of the law itself, and to set up definitions and standards of articles of food. Since Section 3, Fourth, of the General Food Law prohibits the use of added color only in those cases where damage or inferiority is concealed, or where the purchaser is misled, or where the product is made to appear better or of greater value than it is, regulation 1003 is invalid to the extent that it goes further and enjoins the use of added color under all circumstances in the manufacture of bakery products.

Although there are no cases interpreting Section 3, Fourth, of the General Food Law now being considered, in the recent case of <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Woodside, Attorney General v.

We held that in the absence of proof of customer confusion between Malt-A-Plenty base, an admittedly healthful product, and ice cream, and of any sales of Malt-APlenty base as ice cream, its sale could not constitutionally be restrained. We pointed out that the basis of every exercise of the police power must be to promote the health, safety or general welfare of the public. We also stated that the Legislature, under the police power, may regulate or prohibit the sale of an article even though it is not harmful for public consumption if there is danger of fraud or deception of the public in substituting an imitation article for the genuine.</p>

We are of the opinion that the Commonwealth has failed to prove that the pies in question were adulterated within the meaning of the General Food Law. It is undisputed that appellants’ pies were free from impurities, contained sound food value, and that none of the ingredients were in any way deleterious to health. The test of adulteration within the meaning of this section of the Law is not whether the article is fit for human consumption, but whether it has been mixed or colored to conceal damage or inferiority, or in such a <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>manner that the public will be confused or deceived, or whether there is simulation in any manner by which an inferior product is made to resemble a superior one. Therefore the burden was on the Commonwealth to prove that appellants’ pies contained damaged, inferior or less nutritious ingredients than some established standard for a lemon pie, and that the use,of color concealed these defects, or that by some means an inferior pie was made to appear better than it was or to have a greater nutritional value than it actually had.</p>

The food, Bireley’s Orange Beverage, was alleged to be adulterated in that it contained certain substances, including yellow coal tar dyes, so as to make it appear better or of greater value than it is. The Court said at page 972: “. . . Without a finding that a marketable inferior product is likely to be confused with a specified superior counterpart, we think there can be no appearing ‘better than it is’ within the scope of disapproval of a section patently concerned only with confusion. Thus, in the case before us, proof of violation of the statute requires first description and definition of the superior counterpart, and second, proof that the consumer is likely to mistake the inferior for the superior.”. The Court held that the United States could succeed only by showing that the <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>ordinary consumer would confuse Bireley’s with pure orange juice.</p>

Bred Spred, which bore some resemblance to jam, contained substantially less fruit than ordinary commercial jam. The Court held that the product was not adulterated, saying at page 90: “It is apparent that two things were required to be proven in the case at bar, as respects adulteration: First, that Bred Spred was a damaged or an inferior food product, because one or more of its constituents was damaged, or inferior; second, that it was mixed in a manner whereby the inferiority was concealed. There was no proof of either of these matters. There was no proof that Bred Spred contained any damaged or any harmful or deleterious substance. The word ‘inferiority’ in the statute raises the question, What is the other member of the comparison? Or, in other words, the question, Inferior to what? The use of the word ‘damage’ in connection with the word ‘inferiority’ is significant. The word ‘damage’ in this connection means that an ingredient has suffered a loss of strength or quality; the word ‘inferiority’ means that an ingredient is, in the first instance, of low grade or quality. Nothing of this kind is shown by the evidence as to the elements going to make up Bred Spred . . . The mere fact that the product contained fewer strawberries than some other product, e.g., jam, does not show that Bred Spred was inferior to jam; nor does it show that a comparison with jam was called for by the statute unless Bred Spred was being palmed off on the public as jam. No showing of this kind was made.”. The <em>Bred Spred </em>
      <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>case illustrates the necessity of proving possible confusion by the public between the allegedly adulterated product and some familiar and defined standard which it resembles.

In this case mineral oil for popping corn had been colored and flavored to make it look like butter or vegetable oil. No standard of identity had been set up by the Federal Administrator for the food in question but the Court took judicial notice that for use as food melted butter was superior to mineral oil, and therefore found the mineral oil to be adulterated by having its inferiority to butter concealed.</p>

In the absence of such a defined standard, it was necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that appellants’ pie was made to appear to be some well recognized, superior article. No attempt was made to show the existence of a standard for lemon pie which had been so established by commercial bakers or customer expectation as to be definable.

The addition of color is not prohibited unless it serves to hide deficiencies in the finished product. How were appellants’ pies damaged or inferior? Even granting that all lemon pies must contain certain essential ingredients, there was no evidence presented to indicate that appellants’ pie lacked any such necessary ingredient or that the U. S. Certified Color was used as a substitute therefor. Certain evidence was presented at the trial tending to show that another commercially sold pie, a Hanscom pie, was of approximately the same deep yellow color as those of appellants, and this was obtained without the use of artificial color. However, the Commonwealth did not attempt to prove, nor did the lower court find, that the Hanscom pie contained more egg yolks or other ingredients than appellants’. The evidence indicated <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>that both pies contained approximately the same quantity of egg yolks and indeed, the court en banc expressly found that there was no difference in the food value of the naturally and artificially colored pies.

However, these factual assumptions made by the Superior Court are in conflict with the findings of fact which are amply supported by the evidence. The hearing judge found: “That egg yolks, in whatever quantity used, do not give a lemon pie the color of the outside of a lemon, which is the color the pie made from Jell-0 Pie Filling’ had”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The court en banc found “There was no difference in the food value of the naturally and artificially colored pies.”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In short, the findings of fact do not support <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>any conclusion that appellants’ pies were deficient in egg yolks or any other nutritional elements. And, as above stated, there is no evidence that any member of the public was deceived into believing that appellants’ pie contained more egg yolks or lemons, or any other nutritional element than it actually did, or that appellants’ pie was confused by the public with any defined or established superior product.

The U. S. Certified Color imparted to appellants’ pie the yellow appearance that the public desires in a lemon pie. While it is true that the use of artificial color thereby makes the pie more salable and hence in that sense more valuable, this is not what is forbidden by the statute. It is the use of color whereby an article of food is made to appear better than it actually is that is forbidden, not the use of color whereby the food is made more attractive or appealing to the eye.

In reversing the decision of the District Court the Court stated at page 623: “. . . while patent flour obtains a higher price in the market than straight flour, this is not due to any superiority in patent flour from a nutritious standpoint, but is due to the fact that bread baked from it is whiter in appearance, <em>and hence more pleasing to the eye. </em>This aesthetic result can be obtained by a certain process of conditioning the wheat and milling the flour. Was it the intention of the statute that this process should have a monopoly? Whiteness in flour is a desirable end in and of itself. Its connection with flour of any particular grade is purely incidental. We are not persuaded that by the bleaching process flour is so colored as to conceal inferiority, or that by it flour is adulterated within the intent of subdivision four of section 7 of this act.”. (Emphasis supplied). There can be no concealment of damage or inferiority, or appearing better or more valuable than it is, unless the food, as offered for sale, is defective, damaged, inferior, or of less nutritional value than it appears to be. Where the treatment of the particular article of food brings about a product which is in all respects exactly what it purports to be, as is true in the instant case, there is no violation of the law. We do not believe the Legislature intended to ban harmless coloring of products which cannot reasonably be confused with superior foods.</p>
