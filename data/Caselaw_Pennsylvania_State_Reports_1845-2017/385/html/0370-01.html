By agreement of counsel all of the material and relevant facts were submitted to the court in a written stipulation from which it appeared: On March 7, 1944 appellee filed its corporate net income tax report for 1943 upon which it computed and paid a tax thereon in the amount of $100.70; on March 13, 1946 appellee filed a report of change and paid an additional tax of $4.65 as a result of changes made in its net income by the Federal Government; notice of settlement was mailed to appellee on August 2,1951 [more than 7 years after the filing of the taxpayer’s report] when it was informed that on <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>July 5, 1951 the Department of Revenue had settled and on July 18,1951 the Auditor General had approved an account for the tax in the amount of $770.55; on January <em>2, </em>1952 the Departments of Revenue and of the Auditor General refused appellee’s petition for a resettlement; on January 21, 1952 the Department of Revenue made a resettlement increasing the amount of the tax to $840.83 as a result of the report of change. This resettlement was approved by the Auditor General on January 23, 1952. On May 15, 1952 the Board of Finance and Revenue refused appellee’s petition to review, and on July 7, 1952 appellee paid the balance of the $840.83 found due under the resettlement. In addition to the foregoing it was also expressly stipulated that there was no evidence for the court’s consideration that it was not possible for the Department of Revenue to settle and for the Auditor General to audit and approve such settlement so that notice thereof would reach appellee before the end of a year after the tax report was required to be made.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>The decree is affirmed on the following excerpts from the opinions of the learned court below: “The object of all interpretation and construction of laws is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature. To give effect to that intention, after first ascertaining what it is, is the task given to the courts. Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, sec. 51 (46 P.S. 551) ; <em>Kearcher v. Mt. Oliver Borough Council, </em><a href="/pa/363/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="363 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1221657" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0148-01">363 Pa. 148</a>, 151 (1949); <em>Panik v. </em>Didra, <a href="/pa/370/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="370 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1234554" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0488-01">370 Pa. 488</a>, 493 (1952). For the purpose of ascertaining legislative intent the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Sec. 52 (46 P.S. 552) provides in part: ‘In ascertaining the intention of the Legislature in the enactment of a law, the courts may be guided by the following presumptions among others: (1) That the Legislature does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable; (2) That the Legislature intends the entire statute to be effective and certain;’ Section 8(a) of the Corporate Net Income Tax Law, Act of April 8, 1937, P. L. 227, as amended (72 P.S. 3420h et scq.), provides, ‘so far as possible’, a one (1) year limitation after the date on which the tax report must be filed within which notice of the settlement of the tax shall be given to the taxpayer. Section 8(c) provides that a resettlement of the taxpayer’s account may be made within two (2) years after a settlement has been made, and thereafter only under certain enumerated conditions not here applicable. Section 10 provides that each corporate taxpayer must keep its records for a period of three (3) years after any report is filed under the statute, and, further, penalties are provided for non-compliance with this section. Reading these provisions in their entirety the statute provides (a) a certain act (settlement) to be carried out with [in] a one year period, (b) another act (resettlement) to be accomplished within a two year period <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>immediately following the act done within the one year period and (e) a three year period is. prescribed during which taxpayers must retain their business records relating to corporate net income tax under penalty of law. We feel that the time limitations, as set forth in the statute, are strong evidence of the intention of the Legislature when the statute was enacted. Should the time within which a settlement or a resettlement might be validly effected be left to the uncontrolled discretion of state officials, Section 10, relating to the three year period for retaining business records, would be rendered useless as a practical matter. Section 10 was inserted in the statute to aid the Department of Revenue and to promote and preserve efficiency in the computation and reeomputation of the tax. When Section 10 is read in conjunction with the preceding sections 8(a) and 8(c), relating to settlement and resettlement, its further purpose appears to be to protect the taxpayer and relieve him of the unnecessary expense and effort of maintaining business records over a long period of years. To hold that the Legislature intended that the one year limitation set forth in Section 8(a) can be wilfully ignored would not only be contrary to the clear and express language of the statute, but would also lead to unreasonable results and, as stated, would not be giving effect to the entire statute. Furthermore, under Section 8(a) the notification required to be sent to the corporate taxpayer concerns the settlement of its tax, the original amount of which is self-computed by the taxpayer. The Department of Revenue may either accept, decrease, or increase the amount of the tax, as its computations determine, when making the settlement. The taxpayer, until he is notified, does not know what action has been taken. Whether accepted, decreased, or increased, the tax is imposed and assessable against the taxpayer by the proper state authorities <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>when the settlement is effected. The one year limitation in Section 8(a) also must be given effect because Section 58 of the Statutory Construction Act, supra, (46 P.S. 558) provides: ‘All provisions of a law of the classes hereafter enumerated shall be strictly construed: (3) Provisions imposing taxes;’</p>

In <em>Eichenhofer v. Phila., </em><a href="/pa/248/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="248 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1011531" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0365-01">248 Pa. 365</a>, 372 (1915), the word ‘possible’ was held to be coupled with and modified by the words ‘reasonable’ and ‘natural, probably, or likely.’ Section 33 of the Statutory Construction Act, May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019 (46 P.S. 533), provides that words and phrases which have not acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning or definition ‘. . . shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage. . .’ Black’s Law Dictionary (4th Ed.) defines the word ‘possible’ as: ‘Capable of existing, happening, being, becoming, or coming to pass; feasible, not contrary to the nature of things; neither necessitated nor precluded; free to happen or not, contrasted with necessary and impossible.’ Applying this definition to the phrase ‘so far as possible’ we find it capable of the following construction: so far as capable of happening, so far as capable of coming to pass, so far as feasible, contrasted with necessary and impossible. From this analysis it is apparent -that the <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>term as used in the Act would carry with it the notion of "reasonableness’ or "within reason’. This relative use of the term suggests that there are conditions under which it would be unreasonable to require the Department of Revenue to act within the required time, i.e., circumstances wherein the department would be unable to act, or where, even thoug'h able to act, it was under some disability whereby the required acts could not be accomplished efficiently and properly. The inclusion of the phrase "so far as possible’ indicates an intent on the part of the Legislature that the provision is not mandatory upon the Department of Revenue. It recognizes that the duty placed on the department to act within one year is not absolute and immutable, saying, in effect, there may be circumstances present which, if proven, would allow a settlement of the taxpayer’s account to be made after the one (1) year period has elapsed. What would constitute sufficient cause to allow a settlement to be made after the one (1) year period has expired is a question that would have to be determined in each case upon its own particular facts. No test or criterion is set forth in Section 8(a) to guide the courts in the determination of that question. Nor do we have to entertain that difficult problem in the instant appeal because Stipulation of Fact No. 9 provides: "9. There is no evidence before this Court of any fact indicating that it was not possible for the Department of Revenue to settle an account for corporate net income tax for said year and for the Department of the Auditor General to audit and approve such settlement so that notice thereof may reach the taxpayer before the end of a year after the tax report was required to be made.’ Since the one year period in which a settlement might have been made has expired and there is no evidence of any circumstances which prevented a settlement from <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>being made within that time, the Department of Revenue cannot make a settlement at this late date. It must be deemed to have accepted as correct the amount of tax set forth in the annual tax report and consequently can no longer readjust or settle the taxpayer’s account.</p>

With that contention we cannot agree. In construing a statute the courts must keep in mind that the Legislature is not presumed to have intended an absurd or unreasonable result: <em>Altieri v.

It would place on him the task of investigating and inquiring into the administrative departments of the state government in an effort to disclose or unearth facts which would show that the settlement could have been effected within one year. This would cause unnecessary expense and effort to which the taxpayer should not be subjected. Further, it could conceivably result in utter confusion, with many taxpayers checking state agencies and records in an attempt to prove that settlements could have been made within one <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>year. iSection 8(a) is written in affirmative language imposing a duty on the Department of Revenue to perform a certain act within one (1) year ‘so far as possible’. Should the act not be accomplished within that time the burden should fall upon the persons who were to do the act in question to prove extenuating circumstances which might allow them to perform the act after the time limit expired. To put such a burden on the taxpayer is unreasonable.</p>

We are aware of this presumption; however, since the settlement was not made within one (1) year, from the stipulated facts it is apparent that the duty placed on the Department of Revenue was not performed regularly or properly. It is difficult to see how the Commonwealth could attempt to make a reasonable explanation of its delay until the year 1951 in the making of a settlement of a tax report for the year 1943 or the taxpayer’s Report of Change filed in 1946, and the Commonwealth has not and does not now attempt to do so. Therefore, the presumption relied upon by the Commonwealth is rebutted.</p>

The time designated in the act for the report to be filed was one of the essentials of the proceeding as it affected property owners. It was also part of an orderly procedure designated by the legislature to establish the legality of the lien. Its nonperformance had a grave tendency to imperil the rights of those affected, for after the time thus limited the act gave to such persons another limited period, thirty days, in which to appeal to the courts. If the provision relative to the time wherein the report was to be filed was directory, <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>then as the Act of 1919 amended the Act of 1913 in this particular only, the later act was useless. If appellee’s contention is correct, there is no limit to the time within which the report must be filed, and all that is necessary is to have viewers appointed within six years and after a hearing their report may be withheld indefinitely. It will be seen a property owner would be put to the hazard of having his land subjected to a secret or at least an uncertain lien (Western Penna. Ry. Co. v. Allegheny, <a href="/pa/92/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="92 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="491057" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0100-01">92 Pa. 100</a>, 103; Scranton Sewer, <a href="/pa/213/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="213 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="943403" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0004-01">213 Pa. 4</a>, 8) ; or of being placed in the unusually vigilant position of ascertaining, in the years following the viewers’ hearing, the date the report might be filed. It is utterly illogical to suppose ithat the legislature intended such a result. It may as well be urged that the 30-day time within which an appeal can be taken to the courts was directory, and an appeal could be taken at any time. The same reasoning might then be applied to appeals to this court.’</p>
