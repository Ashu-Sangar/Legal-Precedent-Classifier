Prior to January 4, 1955, much of the land in question had been zoned B business. The petition asked for a variance and other relief. The building inspector refused to grant the petition on the ground that the application was for a business purpose in a residential zone. The Board of Adjustment denied the appeal. The Court of Common Pleas took testimony, sustained the appeal and concluded that the zoning ordinance was, as to this tract of land, arbitrary, discriminatory, confiscatory and therefore unconstitutional.</p>
