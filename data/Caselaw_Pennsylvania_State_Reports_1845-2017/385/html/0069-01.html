Thereafter, as above stated, she placed it in the corporate safe deposit box to which she and her father each had access. On or about April 15, 1953, Brightbill telephoned his daughter from Florida and requested her to deliver to the Lebanon County Trust Company her certificate for 670 shares of stock as collateral for a loan of |60,000, which he wished to personally make. His daughter, as most daughters would, went to the safe deposit box, removed the stock and took it to the Treasurer of the said Trust Company, offering it as collateral for her father’s loan. The Trust Company refused to accept the certificate as collateral because it had been assigned and delivered by Brightbill to his daughter. Thereupon Brightbill, instead of demanding and obtaining the stock from his daughter as he would have done if it was still his property, gave the Trust Company other collateral for his loan. Instead of aiding plaintiff, this strengthens and confirms the claim of the daughter that the stock had been given to her by her father and <em>was her own property.</em>

It is true that where the intention to make a gift is not clearly manifested subsequent acts may aid in clarifying that intention (Packer v. Clemson, supra), but where, as here, the intention is unambiguous we must confine our inquiry to what occurred at the time of the transaction. In the case of Reese v. Philadelphia Trust, etc. Co., supra, where testimony of a similar nature was produced at the trial, the court said (page 157) : ‘It is never permitted a donor to impeach his gift; therefore what was said or done by Mrs. Pomeroy, unassociated with her donee and unassented to by him, is wholly irrelevant to the issue and cannot be considered.’ ”</p>
