Mrs. Logan, on or about July 14, 1951 wrote a letter to the Association and enclosed her pass book. The letter stated, inter alia, “Kindly have <em>this </em>account<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> made out to Ida Pearl Logan or Kathryn Logan DeQuinze. In the event of my death this stock will go to her. . . .

    <p id="b183-4" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[159,462,1150,991]]]'>Subsequently, Mrs. Logan entered the Suburban Hospital for treatment and shortly after she returned from the Hospital, she wrote another letter postmarked August 27, 1951 to Treasurer McKelvey which stated: “Kindly change the enclosed book to read: Ida Pearl Logan or Mary E. Bell, sister, instead of Kathryn Logan De Quinze.” By letter dated December 1, 1951, Mrs. Logan requested that the passbook be returned to her and stated: “. . . Hope you had this transferred to the names of Ida Pearl Logan or Mary E. Bell and not in the name of Kathryn Logan De Quinze.” Later in this same month, Mrs, Logan was badly burned and was returned to the Hospital for treatment. Under date of January 7, 1952, Mrs. Bell on behalf of her sister again requested the passbook, and by a return letter dated January 12, 1952, Mr. Walter Heim, Savings and Loan Secretary, advised that the passbook could not be located.</p>

    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.7",183,[161,1774,1148,378]]]'>In March, 1952, both plaintiff Bell and defendant De Quinze made demands on the Savings and Loan for the funds on deposit there. The Savings and Loan, although ready and willing to pay the person properly entitled, declined to make any payment until the controversy was determined. At the time of the trial the account, including accrued dividends, was $3,584.83.</p>

The application for stock, which Mrs. Logan and Kathryn De Quinze executed and sent to the Association was absolutely blank and there is no evidence that any stock was issued to them as a result of the application.</p>
    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[272,1086,1155,884]]]'>Under the above recited facts the savings account is analogous to a bank account rather than to shares of stock and is to be governed by familiar principles which are applicable to bank accounts. It is unnecessary to analyze and review the many cases dealing with an (alleged) gift of a bank account, nor the essentials of an inter vivos gift, which have been reiterated in the very recent case of <em>Brightbill v. Boeshore, </em><a href="/pa/385/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="385 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="1267096" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0069-01">385 Pa. 69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%2038" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 A.2d 38">122 A. 2d 38</a>. Suffice it to say that this case is ruled by <em>Mader v. Stemler, </em><a href="/pa/319/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="319 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1162306" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0374-01">319 Pa. 374</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.%20719" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="179 A. 719">179 A. 719</a>; under that authority it is crystal clear that the facts hereinabove recited did not constitute a valid inter vivos gift to Kathryn De Quinze. It follows that Mrs. Logan had an absolute right to give the savings account in her lifetime or by her will to her sister, Mary E. Bell, or to anyone she desired.</p>
