Norton Company, a Massachusetts corporation, operated a branch office and a warehouse in Chicago, from which it made local sales at retail. The Chicago place of business carried a large inventory and consummated therefrom direct sales to people in Illinois. It also acted to reduce freight costs to local consumers and took orders for merchandise which it did not have in the local store. The local office likewise performed services helpful in Norton’s competition for Illinois trade. The Court sustained the tax as applied to sales of goods shipped from a foreign State to taxpayer’s retail store in Chicago and there sold to Illinois customers, but held it unconstitutional as to shipments made <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>direct to customers by mail or common carrier. The Court said (page 537) : “Where a corporation chooses to stay at home in all respects except to send abroad advertising or drummers to solicit orders which are sent directly to the home office for acceptance, filling, and delivery back to the buyer, it is obvious that the State of the buyer has no local grip on the seller. Unless some local incident occurs sufficient to bring the transaction within its taxing power, the vendor is not taxable. McLeod v. Dilworth Co., <a href="/us/322/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="322 U.S. 327" data-case-ids="6143167" data-case-paths="/us/322/0327-01">322 U.S. 327</a> [sales tax].

Virginia, </em>347 U.S., supra, the Court declared unconstitutional a Virginia statute attempting to impose a gross receipts tax upon express companies engaged in interstate commerce. The Court said, inter alia: “This appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia presents another variation in the seemingly endless problems raised by efforts of the several states to tax commerce as it moves among them. . . . Virginia provides by statute a separate and detailed system of taxation for express companies. It allocates to state taxation, free of all local levies, two kinds of property, viz., tangible personal property and money. It sets off real estate and tangible personal property for local levies at the same rates as other similar properties. These, taxable at different rates, are all included in the statute under the rubric ‘Taxes on property of express companies.’ Then follows a section headed ‘Annual license tax’ providing that ‘for the privilege of doing business in this State’ express companies shall pay ‘in addition to . . . the property tax as herein provided’ an ‘annual license tax’ upon gross receipts <em>earned in the </em>State<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">*</a> ‘on business passing through, into or out of the state.’</p>
