        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Musmanno,\nWhat degree of care does a store owner owe the patrons of his establishment? This question was definitively answered with ample authority in the case of Vetter v. Great A. & P. Co., 322 Pa. 449, 454, where we said: \u201cMr. Justice Simpson, in Nettis v. Gen. Tire Co., 317 Pa. 204, 209, said: \u2018All the authorities agree that it is incumbent upon the owner of premises upon which persons come by invitation, express or implied, to maintain such premises in a reasonably safe condition for the contemplated uses thereof and the purposes for which the invitation was extended . . .\u2019 (citing cases). To the same effect we recently held in Kulka v. Nemirovsky, 314 Pa. 134, 139: \u2018Defendant owed to the plaintiff the affirmative duty of keeping his premises reasonably safe for business visitors, such as plaintiff, and of giving warning of any failure to maintain them in that condition . . .\u2019 (citing cases).\u201d\nIn the case before us for consideration, Mrs. Florence E. Strout entered a grocery market of the American Stores Company in Norristown and proceeded through a turnstile to a counter where she purchased a ten-pound bag of potatoes. When she had taken only four steps away from the counter, her feet flew from under her and she fell to the floor to the accompaniment of injuries which one doctor described as: \u201ctransverse fracture of the distal sacral segment with the fragments approximated and some dorsal angulation at the fracture site.\u201d In an attempt to transmute these medical terms into lay language the doctor employed a phraseology which could almost seem to describe a boulevard. He said: \u201cThe sacrum comes around here in a curve, normally, and it comes to almost a dead end here at the fracture site and then goes off in another direction, the portion of the bone beyond the fracture.\u201d For these injuries Mrs. Strout recovered a verdict of $5,000 (with her husband receiving an additional $800) which the lower Court reduced to $3,000. An appeal followed to this Court when the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment n.o.v. and new trial were refused.\nThe area of the floor which marked the scene of Mrs. Strout\u2019s mishap revealed an oily and gummy patch in which Mrs. Strout\u2019s heel left an indentation some 12 to 14 inches in length and about % inch in depth. The floor had been waxed 2% hours prior to the accident. The plaintiff\u2019s daughter testified: \u201cQ. Did you notice the condition of the floor at the spot where your mother fell? A. Yes. The area didn\u2019t look dry. It looked gooey. You could see the indentation of her heel mark in the wax. I would say the indentation was anywhere from an eighth to a quarter of an inch thick, where she went down. Q. You mean indentation of the wax was a quarter of an inch thick? A. That is what I mean, yes. Q. You said it looked gooey. What did you mean by \u2018gooey\u2019? A. Oily, gummy. Q. Oily and gummy? A. Yes. I don\u2019t know how else you can describe wet floor wax.\u201d\nThe defendant contends that since it was not established that the wax had been improperly applied, the plaintiffs (wife and husband) failed to make out a case of negligence, citing Bowser v. Penney Co., 354 Pa. 1, in support of that contention. It is true that we did say there that \u201cit is not negligence per se on the part of an owner to wax or oil his floors\u201d, but we also said: \u201cthat the real question was whether such alleged improper application created a condition so obviously dangerous to amount to evidence from which an inference of negligence could arise.\u201d\nIt needs little argumentation to convince the impartial mind that a one-fourth inch thickness of wax on a smooth surface can precipitate a pedestrian\u2019s fall as effectively as thrusting a loose roller skate under his striding feet.\nThe defendant cites Spickernagle v. Woolworth, 236 Pa. 496, in attempted further substantiation of its position, but there \u201cthe plaintiff failed to show how long before the accident the floor had been oiled,\u201d or \u201cthat it was in any other or different condition than would result from proper oiling.\u201d The plaintiffs here, to the contrary, showed that the floor had been oiled 2% hours prior to the accident, and it was demonstrated also that at the time of the accident the floor was in a condition other than that which \u201cwould result from proper oiling.\u201d\nWhere potatoes are on sale the more potatoes the merchant sells the greater is the success of the day for Mm. Thus, where the commodities which are sold are of such size and shape that to carry them away the encompassing package limits the purchaser\u2019s view of his immediate path ahead, nothing could be more necessary to the safety of the store patron than that the flooring beneath his feet be maintained in a firm and safe condition. The goods and wares in most stores are so displayed on shelves, and the advertisements which proclaim the virtues of those goods and wares are so hung on the walls, that the floor is about the last place to which the customer\u2019s attention is directed. Hence the need for particular care in keeping the walking area free of obstruction and uncoated with unctuous, greasy and oleaginous concoctions.\nIn the case of Ralston v. Merritt, 117 Pa. Superior Ct. 487, the plaintiff was injured when, carrying a shopping bag 2 feet long and 18 inches wide, she slipped on a greasy and waxy floor in a drug store. In affirming the jury\u2019s verdict in her favor the Superior Court said: \u201cIt was not her duty to anticipate that it was necessary that she exercise greater care on account of the negligent treatment of the floor, of which she was ignorant.\u201d\nIn Markman v. Bell Stores Co., 285 Pa. 378, the proprietor of a grocery store knowingly permitted fat meat and vegetables to remain on the steps of his store. A customer about to leave the store slipped on the refuse and was injured. A judgment against the proprietor for the injuries was sustained.\nIn Klein v. Woolworth Co., 309 Pa. 320, the alleged negligence was the washing and oiling of the floor without \u201cpowdering\u201d the oiled space to render it reasonably safe, and the court held that the question of negligence was for the jury.\nThe defendant leans on the cases of Diver v. Singer Mfg. Co., 205 Pa. 170, and Reay v. Montgomery-Ward, 154 Pa. Superior Ct. 119, in its appeal, but so far as lending support to its contention is concerned, those cases stand on as slippery a foundation as the Bowser case \u2014 because their facts are different from those presented here. In the Diver case the floor on which the plaintiff came to grief had been oiled on a Saturday afternoon and it was then rubbed down carefully. When the store opened on the following Monday the floor was \u2022carefully examined and found to be hard and dry. In the Reay case there was no evidence as to the source of the greasy substance on which the plaintiff slipped, and the defendant had no actual or constructive knowledge of the oil and grease in the aisle. In the case at bar, on the contrary, as already specified, the floor had been oiled 2y2 hours prior to the accident and the floor was wet with oil and wax at the point and at the time Mrs. Strout fell.\nTlie defendant urges that, should it fail in its appeal for judgment n.o.v., this Court must order a new tidal because of alleged trial errors. In cross-examining a defendant\u2019s witness, Stanley Tarr, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked him his occupation and the witness replied that he was employed by the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. The defendant moved for the withdrawal of a juror which the Court refused. We see no error in the Court\u2019s ruling. Considering the obvious magnitude of the defendant\u2019s operations it would make but little difference to the jury as to whether the defendant was protected against liability by insurance or whether it would have to pay directly the modest verdict which the jury awarded. At any rate, under the circumstances we do not find that plaintiff\u2019s counsel abused regularity of procedure in asking the witness his occupational background.\nThe defendant also complains that the judge should have withdrawn a juror when plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cThat is an unabashed fabrication of why lawyers are in Court.\u201d The defendant does not challenge the accuracy of the statement of plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his brief: \u201cThe remark in question was made by counsel after defendant\u2019s attorney in his own speech had told the jury that if plaintiff\u2019s claim were valid, he, personally, would not have defended the case.\u201d If defendant\u2019s counsel did make the remark attributed to him by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and it is not denied, he was well repaid for his own brash observation. What was said in the case of Freeman v. Wilkes-Barre & Wyoming Valley Traction Co., 36 Pa. Superior Ct. 166, could well apply here: \u201cInjecting the personal experience of counsel as a standard of measurement of the conduct of the agent certainly was not allowable.\u201d\nNor do we find any error in the three excerpts from the Court\u2019s charge quoted by defendant\u2019s counsel in their brief. The factual issue in the case was properly submitted to the jury and we see no reason to disturb the resulting verdict, reduced as it was by the Trial Court.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Bell dissents.",
