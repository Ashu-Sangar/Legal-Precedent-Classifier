D. Bartlett, agent. A declaration was filed, and on January 6th 1879, judgment was entered for plaintiff for want of an appearance. The court subsequently, on motion of defendant, made absolute a rule to show cause why judgment should not be stricken off, and service of summons set aside. An alias summons <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>was thereupon issued and was returned served on Walter <em>G. </em>Tracy, agent of the Lycoming Insurance Company ; also on the Lycoming Fire Insurance Company, by personally making known the contents of said writ to Edward P. J. Painter, president of the said company. The defendant took a rule to show cause why service of the alias summons should not be set aside. The affidavit of Painter in support of the rule set forth that the writ was served on him at the principal office of the company at Muncy, Lycoming county, by the sheriff of Bradford county ; that since the original writ of summons had been set aside by the court, and before the service of the alias writ on him, the plaintiff, Storrs, assignee, &amp;c., of Means, had, by order of the Common Pleas of Bradford county, reconveyed unto said Means all the assigned estate, by reason whereof Storrs had no longer any right to or control over the claims sued for. Tracy also filed an affidavit setting forth that he was merely a local agent of the company 'defendant, having limited powers in Towanda and its vicinity.</p>

J., held that Tracy clearly was such an agent who may be served under the 6th section of the Act of April 8th 1851; and that this service being good, it was unnecessary to decide the question whether the service on Painter was good. The court further held, that the setting aside of the former service on Bartlett did not end the suit, and that having been rightly brought in the name of Storrs, assignee, his subsequent assignment to Means did not operate as an abatement. The court therefore entered an order discharging the rule to show cause why the service of the alias should not bo set aside.</p>

At <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>
      <em>this </em>point, <em>the </em>defendant was <em>not in </em>court unless the writ had been properly served. It had then but one of two courses to pursue; the one was to come in and defend the suit; the other was to stay out and take the risk of the service. It attempted to do both, and as might have been anticipated, did not succeed. The plaintiff took out a rule of reference. The defendant appeared before the arbitrators, agreed to a continuance, and also agreed to a substitution of another arbitrator in place of one first chosen; contested the cause before the arbitrators, and then appealed from their award. The defendant’s appearance before the arbitrators and its subsequent appeal were equal to service (Evans <em>v. </em>Duncan, <a href="/watts/4/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 24" data-case-ids="1842745" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0024-01">4 Watts 24</a>), and its <em>agreement </em>to continue and to substitute an arbitrator, was a waiver of the protests previously filed.

    <p id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[271,984,1179,1296]]]'>- 2. The second assignment is sustained. The defendant’s second point should have been affirmed. The facts were not disputed that John E. Means, the assured, received notice of the assessment more than thirty days prior to the fire which destroyed the property insured, and that the said Means did not pay his assessment, No. 35, as required by his policy and the notice served upon him to do so. The learned judge, while admitting the facts as above stated, declined the point for the reason that the case was being tried in the name of Storrs, assignee of Means, against the defendant. This was error. Storrs was a voluntary assignee for creditors. The company had nothing to do with him. He held no policy, nor had he any contract relation with the company.. Means still had the beneficial interest in the policy; if paid, the proceeds would go to him or to the payment of his debts, which is the same thing. Hence it is entirely immaterial whether the agent Bartlett made the agreement referred to in the sixth assignment or not. Granted that it was made and by competent authority, and that the company failed to give notice to the assignee of the assessment, what does it matter ? Can the assignee complain ? Certainly not; he was not insured and had no interest. Can Means complain ? His mouth is closed because he had notice and did not pay the assessment. Nor does it help him that he supposed his assessment had been paid to the company by Bartlett the agent. He had not paid Bartlett, and any agreement between them that Bartlett should credit the premium on a debt he owed Means on a land contract, would not avail as against the company. Bartlett had no right to take the company’s money to pay his private debt to Means, and this the latter knew or ought to have known. The 2d, 3d, 4th, 6th, 7th and 8th assignments are substantially covered by the foregoing remarks and are sustained.</p>

Smith 108, where it was held that it was error to admit the policy in evidence without the application, where the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>latter forms a part of it. In that case the defect was cured by the defendant putting in evidence the application. Such was not the case here. The defendant produced the application in court and tendered it to the plaintiff, who refused to offer it. The court admitted the policy without the application, which was error.</p>

The deed from Storrs, assignee, to Means, reconveying the assigned property, was competent evidence to show that Means was the real party in interest. This already appeared; the evidence was cumulative and not very important. Yet I see no good reason why it should not have been recei ved.</p>
