Whether its refusal was error must be determined from the count itself, without reference to the evidence subsequently given. It may be noted that there is neither exception nor assignment of error to the receiving of testimony offered to establish the said count, nor to the instructions of the court in submitting the evidence relating thereto, and, therefore, there can be no review of the rulings or instructions respecting such evidence. The count charges the defendant with the stealing of goods, the property of Elizabeth Evans; of other goods, the property of Mary N. West; and of other goods, the property of Sarah flannum, at a certain time and place. It closely follows the form of an indictment at common law, for stealing the property of different persons: 2 Chit. Cr. L. *960; Whart. Pr. of Indict. 416.</p>

Duplicity in a declaration consists in joining in one count, different grounds of action, of different natures, or of the same nature, to enforce a single demand. Similar to this is duplicity in an indictment, it is the joinder of two or more distinct offences in one count. The criminal law never permits this. But one offence may be committed at the same time and place to the injury of two or more persons, and the. offender may be indicted therefor. A man may be indicted for the battery of two or more persons in the same count; or for a libel upon two or more persons, when the publication is one single act, without rendering the count bad for duplicity. In felonies also, the indictment may charge the defendant in the same count with felonious acts with respect to several persons, if it was all one transaction: 1 Bish. on Crim. Pro., (1st ed.) sects. 189, 192. In Reg. <em>v. </em>Giddins and Others, 1 Car. &amp; Mar. 634, the indictment, consisting of only one count, charged the prisoners with assaixlting G. P. and H. P., and stealing from G. P. two shillings, and from H. P. one shilling and a hat. The defendants contended the felonies were distinct, and moved that the prosecution be put to election which he would go upon; but it was ruled that the assaulting and robbing G. P. and H. P. at the same time constituted one transaction; the evidence was received and the defendants convicted. If a person shoot at two persons, intending to kill one, or regardless which he might kill, he may be <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>convicted on an indictment charging a joint assault on both: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McLaughlin, <a href="/mass/66/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="12 Cush. 615" data-case-ids="1972252" data-case-paths="/mass/66/0615-01">12 Cush. 615</a>.</p>

Before and since the Crimes’ Act of 1860, it has been common in this state in indictments for larceny to add a count charging the crime of knowingly receiving stolen goods, and to try the offender so charged in the Quarter Sessions. The offences of stealing and knowingly receiving stolen goods belong to the same class of crimes, and may well be united in the indictment, and often must be if justice is to bo administered; for the proof may not sustain the charge of larceny, but would that of knowingly receiving stolen goods, and, therefore, it is the common practice to charge both offences in the indictment: 2 Archb. Cr. Prac. &amp; Pl. (8th ed.) 1164 n. It is contended that the eighth paragraph of the thirty-first section of the Act of 1860, Pamph. L. 438, gives exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of Oyer and Terminer to try a person charged with receiving stolen goods. The paragraph is as follows : <em>“ </em>All persons charged with the second or any subsequent offence of receiving, harboring or concealing any robber, burglar, felon or thief, or with the crime of receiving or buying any goods or chattels, which shall have been feloniously taken or stolen, knowing the same to be so taken or stolen.” This is part of the section enumerating the crimes of which the Court of Oyer and Terminer shall have exclusive jurisdiction; and the whole paragraph might well be construed as relating to second or subsequent offences. However, there is no occasion now for its construction. The entire section is a re-enactment of sections 14 and 15 of the <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>Act of 1836, Pamph. L. 784. Prior to said re-enactment, it was decided that exclusive jurisdiction was not vested in the Court of Oyer and Terminer to try a person charged with receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen, by section 15 of the Act of 1836, and that the Quarter Sessions had jurisdiction to try said crime: Holmes <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Casey 221. It is a settled rule of interpretion that “ words and phrases, the meaning of which in a statute has been ascertained, when used in a subsequent statute, are to be understood in the same sense.” How much stronger the reason for holding that where the meaning of a statute has been judicially determined, its subsequent enactment in a revision of the statutes, is in the sense of the adjudication. To rule otherwise could he nothing less than setting aside its intendment by judicial repeal.</p>
