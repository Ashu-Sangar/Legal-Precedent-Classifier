David Wesner, at the request of the plaintiff, called the same day at Greenawalt’s house, when five months’ interest was paid to him by Mrs. Greenawalt in the presence of her husband, <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>who, however, was suffering from paralysis.

Its terms must be unequivocal and determinate. This is the law, and unless the jury can find that such a promise has been made by Greenawalt himself, there can be no recovery against him in this suit. What is the evidence upon which it is relied .that, there was a promise made'? Without the promise there is no liability. * * * The taking of the judgment alone, if there was nothing else in it than the simple taking of the judgment' alone, would be considered as having been taken to secure himself against any contingent liability that may be had against him by the Wesners. If nothing more was said than that, the simple taking of it, at this meeting of the creditors, from Stein, would not amount to a promise to pay that note and to take it out of the Statute of Limitations.- What authority, first of all, had Amos S. Greenawalt when he went there ? Had he authority to bind his father to any new promise to pay this note ? Is there any evidence in the cause that he had authority to bind his father to the payment of this note? From all the facts and circumstances in this case can'the jury find that he had authority to bind his father to the payment of this note ? * * * If there was no authority, and the <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>jury can find no authority from all the facts and circumstances of this case, which authorized the party to make a promise to pay this note, which was barred by the Statute of Limitations, there can be no recovery. On the other hand, if the jury should find that there was authority to do that thing, was it done ? is the next inquiry. Was there such a promise made by Amos Greenawalt to bind his father to the payment of this note ? * * * First of all, you will inquire whether there was any authority upon the part of Amos S. Greenawalt, the son, to make any obligation of his father to pay this note; whether he was authorized to hind his father to the payment of this note. If he was not, that is the end of this suit. If he was, then what took place there before the Squire at his office ? Did he obligate himself? Did he expressly say, when ho took that judgment, that he would pay those notes ? that his father would pay them ? that ho would give another note for those notes ? This is for the jury to find. The evidence is, so far as my recollection goes, and so far as I have read the testimony, that the judgment was taken before anything was said about it. Does all this amount to a promise to pay ? If it does, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict; but if it does not, there is no case for the plaintiff.”</p>

The note in suit was on its face joint and several, but in fact, as between the signers thereof, the defendant was surety. He had also signed one other note with Stein in like manner to Jonas Wesner; Stein, the principal debtor, became embarrassed. A meeting was appointed for him and certain of his creditors, to be held at the office of a justice, for the purpose of giving some 'security to his creditors. The defendant was ill and unable to attend. His son, Amos S., had a claim against Stein, and was going to the meeting to look after it. The defendant testified, “I told my son that he should ask for a judgment to <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>secure me, in case I should have to pay the notes on which I was bail.” The son testified his father said to him “that I should take a judgment for him.” Again, “my father said the Wesners won’t take a judgment, and you would (had) better take a judgment for the bail also.” lie further testified that he attended the meeting in company with several other creditors; that he took for his father of Stein a judgment of $1511.10, which was made up by the claim of his father, and the two claims on which his father was bail. Afterwards, on the same day, he informed his father that he had “taken a judgment, and — the bail; and his father said yes, or that it was all right.” This and other judgment obligations given at the same time were left with the justice, at whose office they were executed, under an agreement that they should all bo entered at the same time, and they were so entered of record.</p>

It was paid at the house of the defendant and in his presence, to the agent of the plaintiif, who had the note with him, and presented it. The defendant was afflicted with paralysis, and his wife handed the money to the agent. The latter swears, at the request of either the defendant or his wife, he there endorsed the payment. The contention in regard to this payment is, whether it was made by the defendant, or whether it was with money left by Stein with the wife and she merely handed it over for him. If it was paid by the husband’s directions, it was evidence for the jury whether it was sufficient recognition of an existing indebtedness of his to create the presumption of a promise to pay. It was therefore error in the court to say to the jury, as in the tenth assignment, that if the son was not authorized to bind the father to the payment of the note “ that is the end of this suit.”</p>
