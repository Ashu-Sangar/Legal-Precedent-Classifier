Hall &amp; Richardson wont into possession under this lease, and have remained in possession ever since. The lease contained a clause prohibiting subletting by Hall &amp; Richardson, in violation of which, they sublet a part of the premises in 1868 to the plaintiff Reifsneider, at the rent of $1000 a year. On April 1st 1878, Hall &amp; Richardson wore in arrear for rent of said premises, $675, and on the 20th April, Powers &amp; Weightman gave a warrant to their bailiff', James K. Jimison, to collect the same, by virtue of which he made a distress upon all the goods and chattels found upon the demised premises. Jimison testified that ho knew nothing about the ownership of the goods levied on. Reifsneider testified that the levy covered about $5000 worth of Hall &amp; Richai'dson’s goods, and about $3000 worth of his own; that he requested the bailiff, and Mr. Weightman personally, to proceed, in the first instance, under their distraint to make their rent out of the goods of Hall &amp; Richardson, and that, if these should prove not sufficient, they could then sell his goods. This they declined to do. Reifsneider thereupon entered security in the sum of $4000, and issued his replevin, under which his goods were replevied and delivered to him. The landlords, relying upon the security of the replevin-bond entered by Reifsneider, thereupon instructed the bailiff to stop proceedings against Hall &amp; Richardson, and the latter resumed possession of their goods.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b138-8" data-blocks='[["BL_138.8",138,[279,931,1178,1199]]]'>“ The question presented by the record is, can a stranger to the lease, whose property had been taken under a distress made for the rent, require that the constable shall not offer his goods for sale until the tenant’s goods have been sold and found insufficient to pay the debt ? I state this as the question, because an under-tenant owes nothing to the landlord, and can -claim no more from him than a stranger whose goods are accidentally on the premises at the time of the levy. The legal right of the landlord is absolute, and the point to be determined is, whether he should so exercise it as not to sacrifice the stranger’s property unless such a course is requisite for his own protection. It is well settled under the authorities that a creditor should not be delayed or hindered in the use of any remedy for the satisfaction of the debt, even when the effect of refusing the injunction will be to throw the burden on one who, like a surety, is not p'rimiarily or ultimately liable, and thus give rise to a circuity of action, but it not less clear that when the fund or property in question is within the grasp of the law, and the question is merely as to the order in which it should be sold or appropriated, a chancellor may well direct that the principal debtor’s goods shall be the first brought to the hammer, and the execution stayed if they produce enough to satisfy the claim. If such be the rule, it applies emphatically in the present instance, where the plaintiff’s modest demand was not for the delay or omission of any step requisite to make the distress effectual, but that the landlord should, out of the whole mass of goods levied on, select those which belonged to the tenant, and dispose of them before proceeding to sell the plaintiff’s goods for a debt which he did not owe.</p>

And if a landlord, having in his hands the means of satisfaction of his debt, by a prior levy on the tenant’s goods, releases or abandons such levy, his surety is discharged: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Miller, 8 S. &amp; R. 452; Cathcart’s Appeal, 1 <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>Harris 416; Quinn <em>v. </em>Wallace, <a href="/whart/6/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Whart. 452" data-case-ids="1836947" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0452-01">6 Whart. 452</a>; Karns <em>v. </em>McKinney, 24 P.

He also requested the bailiff to proceed first against their goods.

It was exercised by making one distress on property found on the premises, a portion of which belonged to the under-tenant. One complaint now is, a refusal within two days after distress made, to release and discharge his goods from the distraint, or at least to agree to sell first the goods of Hall &amp; Richardson; the other is that the said last goods were released and discharged from the levy. The evidence sustains the fact averred in the first complaint. No authority was cited showing such release to be demandablo of right. None that it was error to refuse. The uncontradicted evidence is, that the bailiff made but one distress, and did not at that time know anything about the ownership of the goods distrained. There is no evidence that any of the goods of Hall <em>k </em>Richardson were released and discharged from the levy before the writ of replevin was executed. After its execution, the landlords told their bailiff to stop proceedings. Thereupon he did nothing further, but let them have them, and, as we have shown, the sheriff delivered the others to the defendant in error. This action was <em>not for </em>detaining the goods of the defendant in error after they were replevied, but for refusing to release them before they were replevied. There was really no evidence in support of the third plea to submit to the jury. But having been found they were insufficient, in law, to support the judgment, it was assumed by the learned judge that the defendant in error had paid his rent to Hall &amp; Richardson. A careful examination fails to find any such averment in the pleadings, or in the evidence on the trial; nor is it found in the verdict as set forth in the paper-book. If, however, such was the fact, it in no wise changed the right of Powers &amp; Weightman to distrain his goods. He was not their immediate tenant; they had not recognised his tenancy. He had not paid them, nor by their authority paid to any other person : Quinn <em>v. </em>Wallace, <a href="/whart/6/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Whart. 452" data-case-ids="1836947" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0452-01">6 Whart. 452</a>. When his writ of replevin was executed, he gave security which was satisfactory to Powers <em>k </em>Weightman. The goods of the plaintiff in the writ were taken out of their hands. They had a right to rely on that security. They were precluded from then proceeding further <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>against the goods thus replevied, and had an undoubted right to stay-proceedings against the other goods distrained. In so doing, after the writ of replevin was executed, they did not in the least render invalid any act of theirs prior to its execution, which was valid when performed.</p>
