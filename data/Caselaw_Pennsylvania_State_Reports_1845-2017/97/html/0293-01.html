They arise for the first time under the Constitution of 1874. One relates to our power to issue the writ of quo warranto against the defendants; the other to their right to the office.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b295-7" data-blocks='[["BL_295.7",295,[217,921,1178,425]]]'>We will first consider the question of jurisdiction. Art. V., sect. 8, declares the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall extend over the state, and the judges thereof shall have original jurisdiction * * * “of quo warranto as to all officers of the Commonwealth whose jurisdiction extends over the state.” Thus the original jurisdiction of this court in cases of quo warranto is limited to the class of officers named. It will be observed the language does not declare that those over whom jurisdiction is given shall be “state officers,” but those “whose jurisdiction extends over the state.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b295-8" data-blocks='[["BL_295.8",295,[216,1355,1179,1085]],["BL_296.1",296,[251,408,1180,781]]]'>Although judges are elected within a county or a district, that fact does not make them county officers. They receive their compensation from the state. They are subject to impeachment by the legislature, or on the address of two-thirds of each house, may be removed by the governor. Where the court is composed of a president judge and two associate judges, any two of them.constitute a quorum. These two may be the associate judges in every case except when they compose a court of Oyer and Terminer, then the president must be one. In the exercise of the general jurisdiction given to the court, the president and his associates, as a general rule, are put on a footing of equality as to their powers and duties, whenever two of them act together. While thus sitting they are on the same constitutional footing, and when acting individually their powers are eo-extensive within the limits of their jurisdiction: Leib <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/watts/9/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 200" data-case-ids="1849949" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0200-01">9 Watts 200</a>. It was therefore expressly held in this case, that the Court of Common Pleas of each county is a state court, and the office of an associate judge is a state office. It is true that case was decided under the Constitution of 1838, yet there is nothing in the present Constitution changing the legal status of an associate judge not learned in the law; still further, although elected in and for a county or district, the judges constitute a court which, for many purposes, has jurisdiction “ over the state.” Thus they may issue subpoenas for witnesses in any part of the state, and attachments to compel the attendance thereof. So under section 3 of the Act <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>of 13th June 1836, Pamph. L. 572, and its supplement of the Act of 4th March 1862, sec. 1, Pamph. L. 79, they may send their process into any county of the state, and the sheriff of their county to execute it in any action for the recovery of damages, for a trespass or nuisance committed on real estate by a non-resident of the county wherein such real estate is situated. Under section 1 of the Act of 24th April 1857, Pamph. L. 318, in certain cases against an insurance company, the court of the county in which the property insured shall be located, may direct its process to the sheriff of any county in the Commonwealth, and it is made his duty to execute it. It follows that each judge of a Court of Common Pleas is an officer of the Commonwealth whose jurisdiction extends over the state. Neither the Constitution nor any Act of Assembly authorizes a Court of Common Pleas to inquire, by writ of quo warranto, into the title of an associate judge. As we have shown, this power is expressly given by the Constitution to the Supreme Court. We therefore committed no error in overruling the plea to our jurisdiction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[250,1189,1181,998]]]'>The remaining question is, the validity of the defendant’s title to the office. Although Art. V., sect. 5 of the Constitution declares “ whenever a county shall contain forty thousand inhabitants, it shall constitute a separate judicial district.” Yet that provision does not execute itself so as to establish a separate district whenever a county attains that number; but merely declares the basis on which, at a proper time and in a proper manner, judicial districts may be created by the legislature : Commonwealth ex rel. Chase <em>v. </em>Harding et al., 6 Norris 343. To hold otherwise would work irreparable mischief and confusion, and be substantially impracticable to carry into effect. The same section declares the office of associate judges not learned in the law, “is abolished in counties forming separate districts.” Giving due effect to each part of the section, and making them harmonize, it is manifest that associate judges not learned in the law are abolished in those counties only which the legislature has constituted separate districts. This brings us to a consideration of the question whether, under the Act of 9th April 18.74, the county of Eayette does form a separate district, or whether the counties of Eayette and Greene together form a district ? The answer to this depends on the effect to be given to the language that the Fourteenth Judicial District shall be composed “ of the county of Eayette, to which the county of Greene is hereby attached.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b296-7" data-blocks='[["BL_296.7",296,[252,2182,1181,266]],["BL_297.1",297,[214,402,1163,256]]]'>The Constitution is not to receive a technical construction, like a common-law instrument, nor like an act of the legislature. It must be so interpreted as to give effect to the great principles of government which it is intended to secure: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 127" data-case-ids="481758" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0127-01">7 W. &amp; S. 127</a>.

It gives to the legislature power to make one county a separate judicial district, and to put any number of counties not exceeding four into one district. The question, therefore, is not whether the legislature had power to constitute Fayette county a separate district; but whether that power has been so exercised?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-6" data-blocks='[["BL_297.6",297,[218,660,1161,418]]]'>It should never be assumed that any act of the legislature was intended to be in conflict with the Constitution, or that it would be violative of any of its provisions. If a statute is alleged to be unconstitutional, the burden of establishing the truth of the allegation is on him who alleges it. While in considering the validity of a legislative act we may not look beyond the Constitution (Sharpless <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 9 Harris 147), yet in arriving at the intention of the legislature we may consider the mischief that would arise from giving too literal effect to the language of the act.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-7" data-blocks='[["BL_297.7",297,[218,1090,1164,1020]]]'>Let us, then, briefly consider the condition of the people of Greene county. That county is either within or without the fourteenth district. If without, what is its position ? It is not a part of any other district. The Constitution gives to the people a right to vote in the election of their judges. Have the people of Greene county such right? If so, is it to vote for a judge in a district of which their county forms a part, or is it to vote for a judge in another district ? If the view of the plaintiff be correct, the latter is the only course open to a citizen of the county of Greene. Again, for whom must the elector vote ? Must he he a resident of Fayette, or may he be a resident of Greene? If a resident of the latter, must he take up his residence in Fayette to comply with the requirements of the Constitution? Suppose, in case of several candidates, the vote cast in Greene should elect the president judge, is that vote competent and valid to elect him, yet its soil legally disqualified from giving him a residence ? These and other objections which might be stated show the difficulties in adopting the view of the plaintiff. The whole spirit of the Constitution and of the Acts of Assembly is that the people of each county shall be permitted to vote for a president judge, and that they shall vote in the election of one for their district only. The doctrine that a county can be made a kind of territorial appendage to a judicial district, and the people therein shorn of their rights, finds no warrant in the Constitution.</p>

At an election held in the thirty-ninth district, consisting “ of the county of Franklin to <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>which Fulton is attached,” the vote in Franklin county was, curiously enough, a tie, and the inhabitants of Fulton elected their candidate as president judge, who was obliged to remove his residence to Franklin county. Greene county may be considered attached to Fayette <em>for judicial purposes </em>only, and for all other purposes may remain apart — in the same manner as lands in one township maybe attached to another township “for educational purposes ” only, under the Acts of April 8th and 13th 1867, which acts have been declared constitutional and so construed by this court in Colvin <em>v. </em>Beaver, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%20396" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 396">9 W. N. C. 396</a>. But even if it be held that Greene county has no voice in the election of a president judge, the hardship is no greater than has frequently been suffered when, upon the erection of new' judicial districts by the legislature, or by transferring a county from one district to another, the courts of that county have been presided over for years by a judge not voted for by its electors.</p>

If this position be sound, there would be no remedy in such cases, as neither the Constitution nor any Act of Assembly confers such jurisdiction upon the Courts of Common Pleas, and a person who had intruded himself into the office of president or associate judge of such court could hold the office so usurped indefinitely. We are not driven to this unfortunate position, as we regard the question of our jurisdiction as free from difficulty.

In many instances, original process may issue from such courts to other counties throughout the state. The 3d section of the Act of 13th June 1836, Pamph. L. 572, the Act of 4th March 1862, Id. 79, and the Act of 24th April 1857, Id. 318, are cited as illustrations. Many similar acts might be referred to were it necessary. We need not pursue this branch of the case further. It is too plain for argument. We are of opinion that a judge of the Court of Common Pleas is an officer whose jurisdiction extends over the state, within the meaning of the 3d section of the 5th article of the Constitution. It follows, that this court has jurisdiction to inquire, upon quo warranto, by what right the defendants hold the offices which they respectively claim.</p>

It was probably intended to be so. It would have been very easy for the framers of the Constitution to have provided in that instrument that such a county should be a part of the judicial district to which it should be attached. But they carefully refrained from doing so, and, we must presume, for sufficient reasons. Its position, at most, is temporary. It may become a separate district by increase of population, or may be made a part of a single district; and I have no doubt this guarded language was used in the Constitution to prevent what has just occurred here, viz., an attempt on the part of associate judges to hold their offices in separate districts where, by reason of there being a resident law judge, they are not needed. It is impossible to read the Constitution, or the debates of the convention which framed it, without coming to the conclusion it was intended to abolish the office of associate judge in all counties where a president judge is obliged to reside — that is, in all “ counties forming separate districtsand in attaching a county to a separate district the separate character of the district is presumed, <em>so far as it concerns the office of associate judges not learned in the law. </em>Further than this it is not necessary for us to go. It may be that in some sense and for some purposes Greene county may be a portion of the Fourteenth District. It is certainly a portion of the territory over which the judge of Fayette is required to preside, and in this sense the words “ district” and “ territory” may perhaps be considered as convertible terms. But it cannot be regarded as a part of the district in the sense of taking from Fayette county any of its rights as a separate district; it is <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>not so written in the Constitution, nor do we see any good reason why we should give that instrument such a construction.</p>

The 15th section of the 5th article provides, “All judges learned in the law, except the judges of the Supreme Court, shall bo elected by the qualified electors of the respective districts over which they are <em>to preside. </em>Speaking for myself, it may possibly be that, in favor of the right of suffrage and for election purposes, the word “ districts” in this section may be construed to mean territory, so that in the case of an election for president judge of the Fourteenth District, the voters of the entire territory over which he is to preside may vote at such election. This, however, is a mere suggestion, not even an opinion of my own. No such question is before us, nor can it be decided in this proceeding.
