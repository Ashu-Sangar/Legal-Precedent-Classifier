Judgments had been entered on some of the claims, <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>and a levy had been made for the taxes of 1878.

The question arising on a bill for specific performance of a contract of sale of real estate is never as to the <em>value </em>of the title, but as to its <em>goodness </em>and <em>marlcetalility. </em>A court of equity will not appraise the pecuniary value of real estate sold, as an element of the right of a party, to enforce specific performance, because the right would then depend, not upon the question of title, but upon the margin of value, which is speculative. If the land here had been worth $5000, instead of $3300, the defendant’s position would have been <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>absurd, yet bis legal contention would have been equally forcible. Even in this case, the assessed value of the land ($3300) exceeded the amount of the encumbrances and the purchase-money ($1684.79-j-$1600=$3284.79). The question of security must, therefore, have entered into the consideration of the price bid. The small margin is the sole ground of objection. There are no encumbrances against the ground-rent. If there had been, the purchaser might have been compensated by deduction from the purchase-money. Suppose there were liens <em>about </em>to be filed, and actually filed after the purchase, would that he a defence ? Or suppose the land depreciates in value between the date of sale and the delivery of the deed, would that relieve the purchaser ? If the vendee can refuse to pay because the property is worth less than he thinks a safe margin, the vendor should have the right to rescind if the security proves more than safe.</p>

The vendor guaranteed the title to the rent, which relieved the purchaser from the duty of taking out searches against <em>the rent </em>prior to the sale, but we did not guarantee that the title to the land was unencumbered. We tendered the purchaser a valid deed, conveying what he bought, and he should be compelled to accept the deed and pay the purchase-money. Moreover, if the land is insufficient, the owner of the ground-rent has his remedy against the covenantor.</p>

The corporeal must exist, or the incorporeal cannot issue out of it. Thus, when land, subject to a ground-rent, is taken for public use under the right of eminent domain, as for a highway, a court of equity will apportion the rent in relief of the tenant, compensating the ground landlord out of the damages awarded for the land taken: <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>Voegtly <em>v. </em>P. &amp; F.

However ingenious may be the argument based on the theory that the ground-rent is a distinct estate, it is fallacious as applied to this case. If the title to the land is worthless by reason of liens which, although within the vendor’s knowledge, were not disclosed by him, it would be illusory and against conscience to compel a purchaser of the rent to pay the full market value for it because the title to the rent, as distinguished from that to the land, is theoretically good.</p>

It needs but this brief statement of the nature of a ground-rent to show that the title thereto is indissolubly connected with the title of the land itself.

See Act of March 11th 1846, Pamph. L. 114. It is manifest, therefore, that this ground-rent is worthless, or its value greatly impaired by reason of the liens upon the land out of which it issues.
