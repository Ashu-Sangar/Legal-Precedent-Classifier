The minor’s aunt, resident and domiciled at Philadelphia, went to him to nurse him, and within a month of her arrival filed a petition in the Probate Court of Michigan, setting forth her intention to remain with the minor permanently in that state, whereupon she was duly appointed guardian of his person and estate. Subsequently she filed a petition in the Orphans’ Court of Pennsylvania, setting forth the above facts, showing that she had entered security in Michigan in double the amount of the minor’s estate, and praying that under the provisions of the Act of April 21st 1856, Pamph. L. 495 (there being an act of similar purport in the state of Michigan), the guardians of the minor already appointed in Pennsylvania should be discharged. Held, that both the minor and his guardian petitioning were “ non-residents” within the meaning of the said act, and that a decree should be made in accordance with the prayers of the petition.</p>

Early in that month they left Philadelphia to emigrate to Kansas, with the intention of remaining there. Upon October 10th, while travelling on the Michigan Central Railroad, an accident happened near Jackson City, by which both the minor’s parents were instantly killed, and the minor himself seriously injured. In December 1879, whilst the child was still detained in Jackson by his injuries, Mary C. Rogers, his maternal aunt, a resident of Philadelphia, went to Jackson to take care 'of him. On December 23d she filed a petition in the Probate Court of Jackson county, Michigan, setting forth her intention to remain permanently in Michigan with the child, whereupon the said court appointed her guardian of the person and estate of the said minor.</p>

In this case, neither the guardian nor ward were non-residents within the meaning of the act. They were both domiciled and lived in Philadelphia until, by the chances of a railroad accident, the boy was left in Michigan before his parents had acquired a new domicile, and the said Mary C. Rogers followed him, to look after him, wherever he might be. A minor’s residence or domicile is that of his father, or, if he has no father, that of his birth, and he cannot acquire another until he becomes <em>sui juris. </em>There was no intention by the father to change his domicile from this state <em>to the state of Michigan. </em>A man cannot be without a domicile. A domicile once acquired remains until a new one is acquired actually <em>facto et animo; </em>the fact and intention must concur’. There is one recognised exception to this rule, which is, that the domicile of birth easily reverts, and therefore, if a man has acquired a new domicile, different from that of his birth, and he removes from it with an intention to resume his native domicile, the latter is re-acquired, even while he is on his way, <em>in itinere; </em>for the native domicile reverts the moment the acquired domicile is given up with the intention of resuming the former.

Rodgers, who is <em>sui juris, </em>and has acquired both a domicile and residence in Michigan. We contend, that the minor is also a “non-resident” within the meaning of the Act of 1856. The appointment of Mary O. Rogers was prior to the appointment of Mrs. Taney. The former having the control of the orphan minor, had the right and exercised it, of changing his <em>residence </em>to Michigan, even if at the time of the accident his legal residence was here: School Directors <em>v. </em>James, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20572" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 572">2 W. &amp; S. 572</a>. The authorities are conflicting whether a guardian may change a ward’s <em>domicile, </em>but the weight of authority is that he may, except, possibly, for purposes of succession: Potinger <em>v. </em>Wightman, 3 Meriv. 67; Lyons <em>v. </em>Andrews, 12 Louisiana Ann. 685; Wells on Jurisdiction of the Courts 288; Holyoke <em>v. </em>Haskins, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Pick.%2026" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Pick. 26">5 Pick. 26</a>; Cutts <em>v. </em>Haskins, <a href="/mass/9/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="9 Mass. 543" data-case-ids="2029672" data-case-paths="/mass/9/0474-01">9 Mass. 543</a>.</p>
    <p id="b77-6" data-blocks='[["BL_77.9",77,[208,1103,1166,992]]]'>But we contend that the father was a “non-resident” of Pennsylvania at the time of his death, and therefore the child was also, and so remains. The vice of the appellant’s argument is in confusing the terms <em>domicile </em>and <em>residence, </em>and treating them as synonymous. A man may be a resident of one place while he is domiciled in another; and a man whose domicile is Pennsylvania may be a non-resident of that state, even though he has not acquired a residence elsewhere. A man may become a wanderer, when there will be an end of his residence in his former dwelling place as effectually as if ho were to gain a residence in another place: Exeter <em>v. </em>Brighton, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Me.%2060" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="15 Me. 60">15 Maine 60</a>; Inhabitants of Jefferson <em>v. </em>Inhabitants of Washington, 19 Id. 302; North Yarmouth <em>v. </em>West Gardiner, 58 Id. 211; Pfoutz <em>v. </em>Comford, 12 Casey 422; Hicks <em>v. </em>Skinner, 72 N.

The distinction between domicile and residence is a clear one, and if adhered to will harmonize many apparently conflicting authorities. Residence, as distinguished from domicile, has been defined to be “ a personal presence, without any present intention to depart:” Warren <em>v. </em>Thomaston, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Me.%20418" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="43 Me. 418">43 Maine 418</a>; North Yarmouth <em>v. </em>West Gardiner, 58 Id. 210-11; Bruce <em>v. </em>Bruce, 6 Brown’s Par.
