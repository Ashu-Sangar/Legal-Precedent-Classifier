It is true that Moodie’s suit against the bank was pending when Dovey purchased, and that the decree in that suit was entered subsequently to his purchase. But the final decree in that case was that the bill be dismissed. The operation of the decree was in no way affected by the transfer of Moodie’s title to Dovey. It decided nothing but that Moodie was not entitled to the relief he asked; in fact, it really decided that Moodie had no title to pass the stock conveyed to him, even to° the extent he had paid for it. No one supposes that this was meant; but to find the meaning you must look to the <em>opinion </em>— i. <em>e., </em>out of the record. Dovey’s title does not depend on title or absence of title in his vendor, but in the fact that he was the purchaser from one having the <em>indicia </em>of ownership. The court below held, virtually, that a decree refusing, to recognise a plaintiff’s title is as effectual as a decree directing a conveyance. If it had directed a delivery, we admit that the decree must have been complied with. But no authority warrants the position that a purchaser of a legal title can be affected as to the real ownership by a decree in equity, when nothing is directed to be done, or can be done, under the decree pronounced, or on the case made by the pleadings. If the decree establishes an- equity merely, a purchaser of the legal title is not bound. All the authorities hold that a purchaser <em>after </em>the decree is not bound, because the plaintiff then has power to execute it; and if he delays he is in the same position as any other holder of an equity. He is neither better nor worse because of the decree. That does not create a right; it is and can be nothing but an authoritative ascertainment of a right. The theory of the <em>Us pendens </em>doctrine in equity is precisely what it is at law — to prevent the defendant in a suit, or the party against whom relief is asked, by transferring the subject of the litigation pending the suit, disabling the court to give the relief asked, because the plaintiff cannot otherwise protect himself should the decree be in his favor.</p>

Practically, the rule only applies to a plaintiff, because there are but two instances in which a defendant can ever have affirmative relief without a cross-bill, and in neither can this rule operate. It is not a rule which makes a pending suit, or any question of fact or law incidentally decided therein, notice to or conclusive on a purchaser of a legal title. It is simply a rule that the decree must be complied with. It has nothing to do with notice or the effect on title. Whatever may be the <em>dicta </em>scattered through the books, it will be found that all the decisions har<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>monize with this statement of the rule, that <em>in enforcing the </em>decree, <em>a purchaser pendente lite is disregarded. </em>Nothing can better prove this to the practical mind than that this doctrine is not even known in common-law courts, while it is certainly true there as elsewhere; but there is not a form of proceeding left in which it can be applied, except it bo in partition, because in no common-law action is judgment ever given for any <em>res.</em>

That suit was abortive. How then can it be said that there was a <em>Us pendens </em>by virtue of which the court can enforce by this bill the defendant’s right against a purchaser from the plaintiff in the former suit ?

(on the authority of the overruled New York case of Root <em>v. </em>French, <a href="/wend/13/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="13 Wend. 570" data-case-ids="2015729" data-case-paths="/wend/13/0570-01">13 Wend. 570</a>), that we were only entitled as purchasers to the extent of the cash consideration, and, because we claimed the whole, dismissed our bill. That decree settled only Moodie’s right to a transfer by the bank. Where the defendant, in a former bill, files a <em>new </em>bill against the former plaintiff, the cause is opened on its merits: Neafie <em>v. </em>Neafie, <a href="/johns-ch/7/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Johns.

This case illustrates the wisdom of the doctrine of <em>lis pendens, </em>whether based on the principle of notice, or upon the rule of public policy, that pending litigation, neither party shall, by parting with the thing in dispute, affect the other party’s rights.- The facts are arguments. Stock of Morris was fraudulently sold to Moodie, who sued the bank for refusal to transfer, and made Morris co-defendant; Moodie, fearing a decree in Morris’s favor, or the filing of a cross-bill, sold or pledged, and forfeited it to Dovey, <em>pending his own suit, </em>and Dovey collected the proceeds by a judgment at law. If Dovey had inquired of the bank, he would have .learned that, its transfer had been prohibited. It is not inequitable, therefore, to hold him affected with notice; but we rely on the broad principle, that where a party to a suit holds property which is the subject of the litigation, he cannot convey to a stranger a better title than he has himself": Ballamy <em>v. </em>Sabine, 1 De G. &amp; J. 580.

Moodie, -Gross &amp; Co., having purchased from a fraudulent holder, were only entitled to receive back the consideration actually paid by them. If the $8700 be refunded with interest to them, or to Dovey, their assignee, they are in no worse position than they-were when they received the stock, and the true owner is at least entitled to redeem it by repaying that amount. The check was worthless, and the receipted bill was not conclusive. Moreover, these appellants have no standing here. The same questions were raised on their former appeal, on their own bill; which was non-prossed. There is no decree against them in this case, and the appeal should be quashed.</p>

In the earlier cdses, both in England and this country, it was held- that <em>Us pendens </em>was notice to all the world, with the same effect as the registration of a deed under the recording acts as to constructive notice of the conveyance. More recent cases, however, place the doctrine upon another, and, we think, a sounder basis. In the leading case of Bellamy <em>v. </em>Sabine, 1 DeG. &amp; J. 580, it was said-by Lord Chancellor Cranworth: “ It is scarcely correct to speak of <em>lis pendens </em>as affecting a purchaser through the doctrine of notice, though undoubtedly the language of the courts often so describes its operation. It affects him not because it amounts to notice, but because the law does not allow litigant parties to give to others, pending the litigation, rights to the property in dispute, so as to prejudice .the opposite party. <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>The doctrine of <em>lis pendens, </em>says Mr. Adams, in his work on Equity, “ has been recently considered and decided not to stand on the ground of notice, express or implied, but to follow from the general rule that, pending litigation, neither party can be permitted to alienate the contested property, so as to affect the rights of the other.” This is a rule of public policy, and the object of it is to prevent the parties from making a conveyance <em>pendente lite </em>of the property or thing which is the subject-matter of the controversy, and thus to defeat the execution of the decree of the court. The effect of it is to imjlfi'se a disability to convey from the time of the service of the subpoena upon the defendant. The court, in the execution of its decree, pays no regard even to a bona fide purchaser. In other words, no change of ownership during a suit will prevent the execution of a decree, as it could and would have been executed had there been no change.</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[168,1049,1171,164]]]'>So far, we are in entire accord with the views of the law as expressed by the learned and able judge of the court below. It is in the application of the law to the. facts of this particular case that we think he has erred.</p>
    <p id="b161-7" data-blocks='[["BL_161.7",161,[166,1223,1172,639]]]'>It is conceded that Moodie pledged the shares of stock in question to Dovey in June 1876, and that the present bill was filed on May 6th 1877. To this state of facts the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>certainly cannot apply. It was urged, however, and the court below adopted this view, that as the bill filed by Moodie on October 14th 1875, to. compel a transfer by the bank, was pending and undetermined when he pledged the stock to Dovey, that the said bill was a <em>lis pendens, </em>and avoided the pledge. But that bill came to nothing; it was dismissed, and that is the only decree in the cause. It could not affect this case unless we hold the dangerous, if not absurd, doctrine that <em>Us pendens </em>is to apply to every suit, even where the cause of action is purely imaginary. The consequence of such a rule would be that any man’s property could be tied up, and alienation prevented by the filing of a bill setting forth a claim which had no foundation whatever.</p>
    <p id="b161-8" data-blocks='[["BL_161.8",161,[163,1872,1174,433]]]'>The decree upon Moodie’s bill decided nothing but that he W'as not entitled to the relief he asked. Had there been a cross-bill filed by the assignee of Henry G. Morris, and a decree that the plaintiff in Moodie’s bill had -not the title to the stock, but that it belonged to the assigned estate of Henry G. Morris, subject to the plaintiff’s lien for the cash actually advanced, and therefore the relief prayed for by the plaintiffs was denied, and their bill dismissed, we would have had a different question before us. But we are unable to see how that abortive proceeding can be tacked to the present bill so as to produce a <em>Us pendens.</em>

But under the modern doctrine of <em>lis pendens, </em>constructive notice amounts to <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>nothing, and we are of opinion that a <em>Us </em>to affect the party and destroy his power of alienation must be a <em>Us </em>in which a decree could be entered against him as to the property which is the subject-matter of the contention. He may not convey <em>pendente </em>lite, for the reason that such transfer would defeat the execution of the decree. But if the proceeding is such that no decree can be entered, why may he not convey ? The true rule would seem to be that a purchaser is affected by the decision upon any claim to the property purchased, if there be a litigation pending in which that question is decided: Newman <em>v. </em>Chapman, 2 Randolph 93.</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[300,831,1175,303]]]'>It was said in Murray <em>v. </em>Lylburn, <a href="/johns-ch/2/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Johns.

Under the principles indicated in Dovey’s Appeal, his executors are entitled to payment in full of the sum borrowed, and for which the stock was pledged. The balance, if any, would belong to Moodie, Gross &amp; Co., provided their title is good. It was conceded in the court below, and here, that they had title to the extent of the $3700 paid in cash for the stock. But it was contended, and so held by the court below, that as to the $2500 check, and the -coal bill of $250.83, the said Moodie, Gross &amp; Co., were not holders for value, for the reason that both the latter sums represented antecedent debts. It is true the taking of a security as collateral for an antecedent debt; does not make the creditor a holder for value, so as to give him the rights of a bona fide purchaser, but the rule is otherwise where it is taken in payment or extinguishment of the debt. In such case the contract is executed and the debtor released. Not so, where the creditor has taken something as collateral. In such case the contract is executory; the creditor has parted with nothing, and <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>still holds his grip upon his debtor. Here Moodie paid Erwin §3700 in cash; surrendered to him bis (Erwin’s) cheek for $2500, and receipted Erwin’s coal bill for §250.83.
