True, she brought to the notice of the auditor, that the question whether the mortgage was discharged by the sale was being litigated in another court i-n a suit on the mortgage itself, and requested the auditor to postpone the distribution until that question should be determined, for the reason that <em>if </em>it should be determined that the mortgage was discharged, she would <em>then </em>claim on the fund. But the auditor went on, and the plaintiff here paid no further attention to the proceedings. The auditor undoubtedly erred in awarding the fund to the legatee, as it cannot be doubted that the legacy was discharged by the prior sheriff’s sale under .Rosa Anna Coyne’s mortgage to Edward White, which was before the date of the plaintiff’s mortgage; but the plaintiff' filed no exceptions to the report, because having no claim on the fund, the mode of its distribution was immaterial to her.

The question whether the plaintiff’s mortgage had been discharged from the land and cast on the fund was such an issue. The plaintiff could not, after Common Pleas No. 4, had acquired jurisdiction of this question, select another tribunal in which to raise the same question, arid require the auditor, in No. 4, to delay distribution until it should be decided in No. 1. If this rule would hold, every lien-créditor could go into separate courts, and delay distribution indefinitely. The record further showed that the plaintiff’s counsel did appear before the auditor, and <em>“ </em>claimed, in case it shall be decided that said mortgage had been discharged, that the fund before the auditor for distribution should be awarded to his client.” The auditor did decide that the mortgage was discharged, by reason of the legacy being a prior lien, and the contingency having occurred, the plaintiff’s language became absolute that he did claim the fund, and our plea is thus verified by the record. If the plaintiff omitted to press her claim before the auditor, and to file exceptions to the report, that was her own fault.

Of this Strauss’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20353" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="13 Wright 353">13 Wright 353</a>, is conclusive. The auditor, who was appointed to distribute the money made by the sale of the same property under the judgment of Shallcross against Edward White, came to a different conclusion. He seemed to think that the sale by the devisee .on his own mortgage was a fraud <em>per se </em>upon the legatee, and as a consequence did not discharge the lien of his legacy. But this is a conclusion that cannot be sustained. It is true that Edward White was the executor of his father’s will, and as such required to act in good faith towards his father’s creditors arid legatees, but he was also devisee, and since, as such, he had the undoubted right to sell the land devised to him, so he had the right to secure himself, as to the purchase-money, by judgment or mortgage.</p>

But it is urged that the submission of this mortgage, to the consideration of the auditor, gave that officer jurisdiction over it, and that by reason thereof his decision was final and conclusive.</p>
    <p id="b227-7" data-blocks='[["BL_227.7",227,[201,801,1177,477]]]'>This question was raised in the court below by the defendant’s plea of <em>puis darrein continuance </em>— a plea which is always pleaded by way of substitution, no proceedings being afterwards had on the previous pleadings. It may be either in bar or abatement, and, like other pleas, is followed by replication, &amp;c., until an issue is regularly formed: Steph. Plead. (Tyler’s ed.) 98; 2 Chit. Plead. 453. In the case in hand, the issue was formed under the replication of <em>nul tiel record. </em>What wc have to do, therefore, is to examine the auditor’s report, in the case of Shallcross <em>v. </em>White, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the question now presented was settled in that proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b227-8" data-blocks='[["BL_227.8",227,[201,1279,1176,820]]]'>Whether this was so determined must, we think, depend upon the fact of the voluntary submission of the mortgage now in controversy to the judgment of the auditor, for we cannot for a moment entertain the idea that the lien of a first mortgage could bo discharged by the unauthorized act of an auditor. Prima facie the auditor had nothing to do with it. He was making distribution of moneys raised under a subsequent judgment, and as to this fund tho Woods mortgage had no standing and ought not to have been considered. It may bo, indeed, if it were presented by the mortgagee as a lien on the fund, and was passed upon by the auditor, and by him postponed to what he considered a prior lien, his judgment unappealed from would be conclusive. It is indeed a fact that he did. so pass upon this mortgage, and that, in his judgment, its lien was preceded by the Powell legacy, and was therefore divested by the sheriff’s sale. Under these circumstances, it becomes important to know by what authority the auditor acted, whether or not the mortgagee submitted her mortgage for his judgment. The following is all that is exhibited by the auditor’s report on this subject.</p>

In short, he informed the auditor that, at that time, he had no standing before him, but might have, should the decision of the court, in the case then pending, be averse to his position, and asked <em>ex gratia </em>for a continuance.</p>
