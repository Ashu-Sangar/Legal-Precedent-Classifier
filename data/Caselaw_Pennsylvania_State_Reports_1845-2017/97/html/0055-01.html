The car stopped, but owing to its crowded condition he was unable to get on the rear platform. He went to the front platform, which was also crowded, and took his position on the step, by squeezing in between two men, holding on by one hand to the dasher and by the other to the iron bar under the front window. In passing from Girard avenue into Poplar street — which streets form an angle of about 135 degrees — a curve is formed in the track and the grade descends beyond the curve. In rounding the curve, several passengers were pushed against Walling, either by the jar of turning, or by a tinsmith who was trying to get off, with his box, or by both, breaking his right hand hold, and swinging him round in front of the dasher, in which position he was carried a short distance, when he fell in front of the wheel, which passed over his chest and killed him. Several other passengers fell off' at the time of the accident. Before the car reached the curve, the driver and several passengers called out to hold on. The evidence as to the speed of the car in turning the curve was conflicting. There was some conflicting evidence also as to the condition of the track at the curve, but it was not disputed that it had been relaid a short time previously.</p>

On the other hand, it is the duty of the passenger to go into the proper, usual and safe place, if it is possible to do so.

If, however, as I have said, he could not get in the body of rhe car, or could not get upon the rear platform, and he was permitted to go upon the front platform, then he had a right to take that as an assurance that the company would take all reasonable and proper precautions to avoid injury to him even in that place.</p>

    <p id="b60-10" data-blocks='[["BL_60.11",60,[262,1569,1182,765]]]'>In fact, the second question is not raised in the record. As a general rule, where specific instructions were not requested by a proper point, and no exception to such as were given, there is no error for correction. Complaint is not now made of the charge respecting damages; the only errors alleged are the refusal of the defendant’s points, and they were upon another branch of the case. Surely if the decedent.’s death, without fault in him, was caused by the defendant’s default, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. In a charge of marked accuracy and fairness the questions of defendant’s negligence and of the decedent’s concurrent negligence were submitted.to the jury. It is not pretended that the court could have refused to submit to ■ them to decide whether the defendant was negligent, and it is conceded that fact is settled by the verdict. If it was the duty of the court to determine there was contributory negligence by the decedent, all the defendant’s points should have been affirmed. This is the sole question now for consideration — the one first stated by defendant.</p>

In addition, the car stopped and received him as a passenger. The driver testifies he knew the car was so full a man could not go through to the back platform. Crowded as it was, the conductor says there was room for more, both inside and on the rear platform. But Walling first tried to get on the rear platform, and failing went to the front.</p>
    <p id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.6",61,[210,879,1163,691]]]'>Conductor, driver and passengers acted as if there was room, so long as a man could find a rest for his feet and a place to hold on with his hands. Nor was that action exceptional. Notoriously, it was very common in 1876, and, perhaps, is not infrequent at this day. The companies do not consider such practice dangerous, for they knowingly suffer it, and are parties to it. Their cars stop for passengers when none but experienced conductors could see a footing inside or out. The risk in travelling at the rate of six miles an hour is not that when the rate is sixty, or oven thirty. An act which would strike all minds as gross carelessness in a passenger on a train drawn by steam-power, might be prudent if done on a horse-car. Rules prescribed for observance of passengers on steam railroads, which run their trains at great speed, are very different from those on street railways. In absence of express rules, every passenger knows that what might bo consistent with safety on one would be extremely hazardous on the other.</p>

The court said: “ It is well known that the highest speed of a horse railroad car is very moderate, and the driver easily controls it, and stops the car by means of his voice, his reins, and his brake. In turning round an angle, from one street to another, passengers are not required to expect that he will drive at a rapid rate, but, on the contrary, might reasonably expect a careful driver to slacken his speed. The seats inside are not the only places where the managers expect passengers to remain; but it is notorious that they stop habitually to receive passengers to stand inside, till the car is full, and then to stand on the platforms till they are full, and continue to stop and receive them, even after there is no place to stand except on the steps of the platforms. Neither the officers of these corporations, nor the managers of the cai-s, nor the travelling public seem to <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>regard this practice as hazardous; nor does experience, thus far, seem to require that it should be restrained on account of its danger. There is, therefore, no basis upon which the court can decide, upon the evidence reported, that the plaintiff did not use ordinary care. It was a proper case to be submitted to the jury upon the special circumstances which appeared in evidence.” These remarks are quite applicable to the case in hand.</p>

A street railway company has the right to carry passengers on the platforms, and, if a passenger be injured while standing there without objection by the company’s agent, whether the injury was with his contributory negligence is for the jury to decide, under all the facts and circumstances detailed in evidence: Burns <em>v. </em>Bellefontaine Railway Co. of St. Louis, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Mo.%20139" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="60 Mo. 139">60 Mo. 139</a>.</p>
    <p id="b62-7" data-blocks='[["BL_62.7",62,[293,1138,1169,130]]]'>It also has been decided in other states, that, if a passenger be injured while standing on the platform of a street or horse-car, the question of his contributory negligence is one of fact for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b62-8" data-blocks='[["BL_62.8",62,[292,1267,1169,599]]]'>So little danger exists in riding on the platforms, accidents to passengers while thus riding are so- rare, that this is the first time the question raised has been presented in Pennsylvania, We think the decisions in other states above referred to are sound. They accord with well-settled principles. What is and what is not negligence, in a particular case, is generally a question for the jury, and not for the court. It is a-lways a question for the jury when the measure of duty is ordinary and reasonable care. When the standard shifts with the circumstances of the case, it is, in its very nature, incapable of being determined as a matter of law. When both the duty and the measure of its performance are to be ascertained as facts, a jury alone can determine what is negligence, and whether it has been proven: West Chester &amp; Philadelphia Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>McElwee, 17 P. F. Smith 311.</p>
    <p id="b62-9" data-blocks='[["BL_62.9",62,[293,1869,1184,259]]]'>It is the duty of courts, in cases of clear negligence arising' from an obvious disregard of duty and safety, to determine it as a question of law. This principle was applied in the numerous cases cited by defendant. It should always be when the admitted facts, or the proofs adduced by a party, conclusively show his negligence.</p>
    <p id="b62-10" data-blocks='[["BL_62.10",62,[294,2126,1168,173]]]'>The undisputed facts in this case show, that the measure of duty on the part of the deceased was ordinary and reasonable care, and what that was, and whether he complied with it, could only be determined by the jury.</p>
    <p id="b62-11" data-blocks='[["BL_62.11",62,[1083,2297,334,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
