J., the following facts appeared : On February 10th 1870, the Lycoming County Mutual Insurance Company issued to the plaintiff a policy of fire insurance on the mutual plan, insuring a tannery and contents, situate in Nicholson township, for $1266. In consideration thereof, the plaintiff gave his premium note for $316.50, which amount he thereby promised to pay “ in such proportion and at such time or times as the directors of said corporation may, agreeably to their act of incorporation, require.” He made a cash payment of $15.82 on the date of the note, and paid two assessments, Nos. 27 and 28, levied in September 1870, and in September 1871, respectively. The property was destroyed by fire on March 1st 1872. The company resisted payment on the ground that the plaintiff was in default, and his policy suspended, by reason of non-payment within thirty days after notice and demand of an additional assessment known as No. 29, made by the directors October 19th 1871. The plaintiff contended that this assessment was not lawfully made. The minute-book of the company showed, that at a meeting of the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>directors on the 19th October 1871, the following resolution was adopted:—</p>

This would be a good defence if both facts alleged were established by the evidence — the demand for the payment of an assessment and neglect to pay it, was jjroven. But the fact of the assessment is not sufficiently established. The burden is upon the company of proving the assessment; it is an official act of the officers of the company, and the proof should be olear and satisfactory.

[While perhaps the form of this record is immaterial, yet it cannot he an assessment if it does not set forth the name of the maker of the note and the amount assessed upon it. There is no evidence that such an assessment was made on the premium note of the plaintiff in this case, nor does the notice of an agent that such an assessment had been made supply the defect.

    <p id="b418-8" data-blocks='[["BL_418.13",418,[315,1248,1183,991]]]'>The main contention here is, whether the alleged assessment was actually made on the 19th of October 1871. It is known as assessment No. 29. The minute-book of the company duly proved, show's that a meeting of all the directors was held on that day, and the following preamble and resolution were adopted: “ Whereas the losses by fire in Pennsylvania have been very heavy within the last few months, and recently an extraordinary fire has occurred in the city of Chicago, involving a large amount of loss to the company, therefore Resolved, that an assessment of twelve and a half per cent, be made on all premium notes held by the company, and in force on the tenth day of October 1871.” The secretary of the company .testified that, in pursuance of that resolution, an assessment was made on all the premium notes, as directed by the board of directors. Among the others, an assessment.was made on the premium note of the defendant in error. H. A. Smith testified that he, as agent of the company, sent a notice of this assessment, No. 29, to the defendant in error about the first of December 1871. The learned judge thought there could be no assessment that did not set forth the name of the maker of the note, and the amount assessed upon it, and therefore charged there was no evidence that such assessment was made on the premium note of the defendant in error, nor did the notice of an agent, that such an assessment had been made, supply the defect.</p>
    <p id="b418-9" data-blocks='[["BL_418.14",418,[322,2241,1179,217]],["BL_419.1",419,[164,419,1174,697]]]'>In holding that an assessment could not be valid unless the resolution levying it set forth the name of the defendant in error, and the sum assessed on his note, there was error. We believe a reference to the maker of each note by name is unusual and wholly unnecessary. The resolution covered all notes in force at the date <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>specified. It imposed a specific percentage on each. That is certain which may be made certain. It was very easy to ascertain the sum imposed on each note. The work was merely clerical, and could be readily performed by any person who understood the multiplication table. The precise sum he was required to pay was ascertained and stated in the notice sent to him. lie was therein required to pay the specific sum within thirty days, and also reminded of the by-law which declared the policy to be null and void unless so paid. It is true a notice of an assessment, when, in fact, none had been made, would not supply the defect. But that is not this case. The notice showed him the precise sum the percentage produced, and relieved him from making the calculation. Levying a specific percentage-on a note of a certain and fixed amount, is wholly unlike fixing a rate of taxation on land on which the valuation is not yet ascertained. Until the valuation of the land is determined, no computation can show the sum to be paid.</p>

There is, however, an assignment to meet each view of the case. If the part to which we have referred was rejected, it was error. If it was admitted, then it was error to charge there was no evidence of an assessment.</p>

The amount of it was distinctly stated on the foot of the policy which tho defendant had already given in evidence.

In so far as the objections covered by the assignments are in conflict with this opinion they are sustained.</p>
