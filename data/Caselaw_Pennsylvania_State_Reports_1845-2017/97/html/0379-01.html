      <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>It was admitted that the taxes were paid upon the Tybout tract by the defendants and their predecessors in title, from the organization of Bradford county to the beginning of this suit. Much evidence was given on both sides on the question whether the George Moore tract was actually surveyed and marked on the ground in 1792, or whether it was a chamber survey. Thp evidence showed that the Tybout tract was actually surveyed on the ground in 1794. It did not appear that any caveat had been filed against the location of the George Moore tract, or that the question of its location, or of its interference with the Tybout tract, had been raised by any legal proceedings prior to the bringing of this suit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.6",381,[162,921,1170,130]]]'>The court submitted to the jury, as the principal question of title, the question whether the George Moore survey was a chamber survey, and charged, inter alia, as follow’s:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-7" data-blocks='[["BL_381.7",381,[162,1050,1169,949]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>If there was a survey under the Moore warrant before the 24th March 1794, the time the Tybout was surveyed, the title under the Moore patent dates back to the date of the warrant, but if it was not surveyed until after the Tybout was surveyed, then the title to the land was in the defendant. I mean by survey, actual survey on the ground. It was the duty of the deputy surveyor to go upon the ground, run and mark the lines, and establish the corners. In many instances, he neglected his duty and omitted to do this, and made a draft in his office of a pretended survey, and returned it into the land office. These surveys, so returned, but never actually made on the ground, are commonly called ‘ chamber surveys.’ It is claimed on the part of the defendant, that the survey of the Moore warrant was a chamber survey. This allegation presents the principal question as to title; for I think the undisputed evidence shows that the Tybout was located by actual survey in the year 1794. Had the Moore been surveyed before that time ? To determine this question you must consider al'l the evidence bearing upon it. I think there is no dispute but that the line for a long distance, both north and south of the hqmlock corner, was run upon the ground in the year 1792. It is not enough that he was there to survey other warrants that adjoin it. Was he there, and did he survey the Moore warrant ? * * *</p>

Both were warranted in 1793, and surveyed July 4th 1793. This fact may bear upon questions as to the date of the survey of the line south from the hemlock, and of the marks found upon that corner; for it may be difficult to say where a line was surveyed July 4th 1793 — whether it was surveyed in 1792 or 1793. The official copy of the Moore calls for the Betz on its east. This may be the mistake of the draughtsman at the land office; but is it his mistake ? Has it not a tendency to show a chamber survey— one made after the Betz had been surveyed and returned to the <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>land office ? <em>It (George </em>Moore) calls for vacant land on the north. The Gobett tract is there, but it was not warranted until 1794. The call, therefore, is correct, and ought it not to have called for vacant land on the east if it had been actually surveyed November 21st 1792? It was vacant land on its east November 21st 1792. The Betz warrants had not then been issued, and unless the draughtsman at the land office made a mistake, they could not have been put on as calls, because they did not then exist.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b382-6" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[305,765,1184,820]]]'>“Again, it is proper for the jury to take in consideration the course of the streams as indicated by the official draft, to determine whether the Moore was surveyed in 1792. (The attention of the jury was called to the water-courses as indicated on the different maps, and also where the Schrader creek crossed the west line of the Moore.) To determine whether the Moore tract was actually surveyed in 1792, the original marks on the ground, if any, are the strongest and best evidence. If it is doubtful whether the marks were made in at that time, then the jury should consider the calls watercourses. If the official drafts show a correct location of the watercourses, it is evidence to show actual survey. If they are not so laid down, it is evidence which may have a tendency to show that there was no actual survey. If, after examining this evidence, there is still doubt, it is proper to consider the old maps in evidence — Broadhead’s map of 1799, and Elower’s map of 1828. It is proper to consider these maps as parts of the evidence. They show where the Tybout was located then, to wit, 1799 and 1828. The Moore tract is not indicated on either map, except as south of the Tybout.</p>

In submitting to the jury the question whether or not the Moore survey was a chamber survey; 2. In saying to the jury that it was not enough that the surveyor was on the ground to survey adjoining warrants if he was not there to survey the Moore warrant. This, of course, meant that he could not adopt the lines of older or contemporaneous surveys as the .lines of the Moore tract. But in Parshall <em>v. </em>Jones, 5 P. F. Smith 153, it was said, following McRhea <em>v. </em>Plummer, <a href="/binn/1/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Binn. 227" data-case-ids="1787924" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0227-01">1 Binn. 227</a>, and Caul <em>v. </em>Spring, <a href="/watts/2/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts 390" data-case-ids="1840140" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0390-01">2 Watts 390</a>, that the lines of older surveys may be adopted for a later warrant, without re-running or re-marking them, and that such a survey is not a chamber survey. To us, indeed, it seems strange that a proposition so obvious and reasonable should ever have been doubted; for as it is admittedly improper to re-mark old lines when adopted for a new survey, why should they be re-run ? Certainly, for the purposes of location, this would be an unnecessary labor, and to us no reason occurs for the enforcement of such a work, except to compel the deputy surveyor to earn his fees.</p>

In other words, this presumption is one that no fact, however obvious, can rebut. In the case just cited the court below, whilst holding that, after the period mentioned, the survey, returned by the proper officer, was by law presumed to have been run upon the ground, nevertheless instructed the jury that this presumption might be rebutted by positive proof. This was held to be error; that such was not the nature of the presumption attending a survey returned without objection for more than twenty-one years; that the presumption was absolute in its character — a legal conclusion. A like result was arrived at in the cases of Lambourn <em>v. </em>Hartswick and Mock <em>v. </em>Astley, 13 S. &amp; R. 113; 382. Justice Duncan, who delivered the opinions in both these cases, in substance said that, prima facie, a survey was made as <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>returned, and that it was the business of the adverse party to disprove it; but that, where time, analogous to the Statute of Limitations, had run, where the owner had continued to pay the public taxes, and where there had been no caveat, a presumption of law ought to arise in favor of the regularity of the survey.</p>

The Moore warrant purported to have been surveyed on the 21st of November 1792, and was duly returned, accepted and patented; this final act of the land office occurring on the 24th of February 1795. Then, for twenty-one years after the date of this survey, the prima- facie presumption was in favor of its correctness. Nevertheless, within that time, this presumption was prima facie only, and might have been rebutted by those interested in the interfering Tybout survey, by a caveat or in an action of ejectment. Neglecting this, allowing the survey to remain unquestioned for the period above mentioned, the presumption became absolute and was no longer open to attack.</p>
