The engine, boiler and the fire under it were placed at a distance of about thirty-two feet from and outside of the barn, and the machinery threshing the crops was within the barn, driven by a strap or belt communicating with the steam-engine outside. The engineer lighted the fire about six o’clock in the morning, and went to breakfast. In about fifteen minutes afterwards the explosion 'occurred, and in a few minutes the barn and its contents were on fire. The plaintiff testified: “We were sitting at the table at breakfast; the engineer ate but little, and he went out before it exploded, but he did not reach it, I suppose. The engine was on a small wagon, and it tore loose and broke the barn doors in ; the doors were all shut in the evening and everything was in the inside; there was nothing outside.

That under the uncontradicted evidence in this ease, no proof <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>of loss was furnished to the company by Moyer till the 7th day of December 1875, and as by the terms of the policy the insurance was not payable till three months after such proof was furnished, and the suit in this case was instituted on 26th day of February 1876, the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant, the suit having been brought prematurely. The court answered this point substantially as follows: The policy of course is the contract between the parties, and they are bound by its terms and conditions. The construction we put upon the clause which provides that the loss is “ to be paid within three months after due, and proof made thereof by the insured in conformity to the charter and by-laws,” is that the evidence of the loss must be furnished three months before the suit is brought, unless the company did something to waive it. The point made on the part of the plaintiff is, that as the barn was a total loss, and the company had notice of the total loss more than three months before the suit was brought, the barn itself cannot be involved in this point. It has been held when the contents have been destroyed, to 'simply say that the barn was destroyed “and its contents,” is not sufficient, but notice must be given of the contents in detail which were in the barn at the time of the fire. It would seem that this was not complied with until in December, by the notice prepared by Mr. Hughes, in which the contents were specified. This would be less than three months before the bringing of this suit, and would prevent a recovery so far as the contents of the barn are concerned, unless the company did something to waive the production of notice at an earlier date, or the production of any notice whatsoever. We think there is a question for your consideration at this point. The board of directors met on the 27th of November, and took into consideration a notice which they had received, as it would appear from their minutes, in reference to the loss sustained by Moyer of this property, under the policy of insurance which the company had issued to him. It would appear from Moyer’s testimony that he was present.</p>

Beatty <em>v. </em>Lycoming Ins. Co., 2 P. F. Smith 456; Mitchell <em>v. </em>Lycoming Ins. Co., 1 P. F. Smith 402. The contract is to be construed with reference to its object and spirit, the intention of the parties, the circumstances under which it was made, and by calling in aid <em>the </em>construction the parties themselves put upon it before the alleged breach: Coxe <em>v. </em>Freedley, 9 Cas. 124; Miners Appeal 11 P.

Can any reasonable man doubt that the introduction of a steam boiler and engine within 32 feet of the barn connected by a belt with the threshing -machinery within the barn, was a violation of the spirit and meaning of the contract that “ under no circumstance” could any building be insured situate within 50 yards of any railroad, as mills, factories, or machineries driven by steam-power. Or that it infringed the provision that “ if the owner of an insured building should convert it to some other purpose * * * the policy of such insured building shall not be considered valid or binding upon the company for such length of time as it shall be appropriated to such purposes.” These provisions are not drawn with the utmost verbal skill, but the farmers who were the members of this company could understand their import. This intent was to prohibit the insuring of any building in or near which steam was used, and to prevent any change in the use of the building which might tend to increase the risk, particularly the proximity to steam factories or machinery, and if such change was <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>made by the assured, to suspend the policy for the time being. Such is the law independent of the by-laws: Diehl <em>v. </em>Adams Co. Mut. Ins. Co., 8 P. F. Smith 443; Franklin Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Brock, 7 Id. 74; Flanders on Fire Ins. 335, 515, and note. But the act of Moyer was a violation of his express covenant, and an infraction of by-laws 26 and 34. What is the difference between locating a building within fifty yards of machinery driven by steam-power, and locating machinery driven by steam-power within fifty yards of a building. The barn was formerly used for the purpose of threshing by hand or horse power; it was converted by the assured to the “other purpose” of threshing by steam. Moyer knew well that this was in violation of by-law 34, as proved by the fact that he had previously insisted that Mr. Mantz had violated the same provision by introducing steam into his tannery, and Mantz’s policy was therefore cancelled and the premium returned to him. This fire can in no sense be called an <em>accident </em>within the protection of the policy-; it was the direct and natural result of an appropriate cause, viz: a dangerous steam-engine run by an incompetent or careless engineer.</p>

The suit was prematurely brought, within less three months after due proof of loss made by the assured. -The proofs were not served until December 7th 1875, and the writ issued February 26th 1876. It is true that informal <em>notice of the fire </em>was received by the secretary November 23d 1875, but there is a marked distinction between <em>notice of fire </em>and <em>proof of loss. </em>The former is to enable the company to inspect the premises and inquire into the circumstances ; the latter is a sworn statement, in detail, and is a condition precedent to recovery. It is also true that the directors, at a meeting held November 27th 1875, passed a resolution that the loss should not be paid “ except compelled by law.” It is claimed that this action of the directors was a waiver of the proof of loss. But “a waiver never occurs unless intended or where the act relied on ought in equity to estop the party from denying it:” Diehl <em>v. </em>Adams County Mut. Ins. Co., 8 P. F. Smith 443. It will hardly be contended that the company, in passing a resolution not to pay the loss voluntarily or “ except compelled by law,” <em>intended </em>to vraive a valid defence. But, even if it were a waiver of the proofs of loss, such waiver occurred on November 27 th 1875, and the suit was still prematurely brought, February 26th 1876, less than three months from the alleged waiver.</p>

The use of'the portable engine by the plaintiff certainly did not infringe the letter of any provision in the charter, by-laws or policy, and, we contend, did not violate their spirit. The building was insured as a barn, and as a bam was being used at the time of the fire. It was not converted to any other purpose, for the <em>purpose </em>is the same whether grain bo threshed by flail, horse-power, wind-power or steam-power. The temporary use of a steam-engine outside the barn did not convert it for the time being into a steam-factory or mill within the provisions of by-laws 26 and 34. If the construction of the contract be doubtful, the doubt is to be resolved in favor of the assured, and against the company: Franklin Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Brock, 7 P. F. Smith 74.

Neither the charter nor the by-laws expressly require any proof of loss in the case of a <em>building, </em>but only in the case of personal property destroyed. The barn was a total loss, and the amount for which it was insured was far less than its actual value. The loss became fixed and due immediately after the fire. Sufficient notice of the total loss was given to the company within three days thereafter — more than three months before suit was brought. The company claimed that the true meaning of the policy was that the loss was not payable until three months after proof of loss made, and the court below sustained that view, but left it to the jury to determine -whether the company had waived proof of loss. In this we think the court erred in favor of the company. This error did not hurt us, because the jury found the question of waiver in our favor. They wore fully justified in so finding, because the resolution of the directors was equivalent to saying to Mr. Moyer, “We have had all the proof of loss we -want. We will not pay you unless compelled to do so by law.” This was final action upon a distinct ground, and was in law and in fact a waiver of all other grounds: Lycoming Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Schreffler, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20188" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Wright 188">6 Wright 188</a>; Franklin Fire Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Updegraff, 7 Id. 350; Lycoming Mutual Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Schollenberger, 8 Id. 259; Buckley <em>v. </em>Garrett, 11 Id. 205; Farmers’ Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Taylor, 23 P.

The building was insured in the sum of $1500 and its contents in the sum of $1000. On the 20th of November 1875, it and all it contained were destroyed by fire. The fire which produced this destruction seems from the evidence to have originated from the explosion of the boiler of a portable steam-engine, which had that morning, or the evening before, been stationed within some thirty-two feet of the barn, for the temporary purpose of threshing grain on the barn floor, a strap being used to connect the engine with the threshing machinery.

They are as follows: 1. “ That as under the uncontradicted evidence in this case, no proof of loss was furnished to the company by Moyer till the 7th of December 1875, and as by the terms of the policy, the insurance was not payable till three months after such proof was furnished, and the suit in this case was instituted on February 26th 1876, the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant, the suit having been brought prematurely.” 2. “ That the true construction of the charter, policy and by-laws in evidence, prohibits the insurance of any building or barn which is located within fifty yards of any steam-engine, or within which any cceamengine is used.”</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[291,1394,1180,433]]]'>As to the first of these points, if indeed the uncontradicted evidence supported it, there would have been an end to the case; the plaintiff could not have recovered. But unfortunately for the defendant, such was not the case. I-n the first place, there was the preliminary notice of the total loss of the barn and its contents — that this was in time was admitted — and in the second place, there was the question of waiver, which the couvt submitted to the jury. .As to the first of these, the learned judge held that the preliminary notice, so far as the barn itself was concerned, the loss being total, was sufficient without the more formal proofs.</p>
    <p id="b448-7" data-blocks='[["BL_448.7",448,[290,1824,1186,607]],["BL_449.1",449,[208,415,1169,130]]]'>In this he was undoubtedly correct, if the case of the Lycoming County Mutual Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Schollenberger, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20260" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Wright 260">8 Wright 260</a>, is law, for it is exactly in point. The counsel for the plaintiff in error attempts a distinction, which it seems the court below was unable to comprehend, and we must confess to a similar want of intelligence. He insists that while the policy in the case cited was a valued one, that in the case in hand it is not a valued one. Of course, this distinction, if it exists at all, must be found in some substantial difference of the wording of the two policies. Let us compare them. Schollenberger’s policy covered a coal breaker, including a steam-engine, schute, screens, machinery and trestle-work, in a sum not exceeding $2500, for the term of five years. Moyer’s insurance is, inter alia, upon “'one bank barn of frame, 70 feet by 36 feet, for $1500,” and for the term of ten years. Now as the word “for” in the quota<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>tion means “in a sum not exceeding,” <em>“ </em>to the amount of,” it is impossible for us to discover the difference between the two policies, or that if the one is a valued policy, why the other should not be.</p>

    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.8",449,[204,1105,1170,302]]]'>This was a correct ruling. Insurers undoubtedly have the power to waive the performance of a condition introduced into a policy for their own benefit, and it is not necessary that such waiver be express; it may be inferred from their acts, and among others of such acts is a denial of the obligation exclusively for some other reason than that of a breach of the condition: Inland Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Stauffer, 9 Casey 397; State Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Todd, 2 Norris 272.</p>

It was held that the plaintiff could not recover if the use of the engine increased the risk ; in other words, the jury were left at liberty to find a forfeiture) m the ground stated, but neither in the policy, by-laws nor constitution of the company was the temporary use of a portable engine for grain threshing or other economic use prohibited.</p>
    <p id="b449-9" data-blocks='[["BL_449.10",449,[203,1838,1166,301]]]'>The 26th article of the by-laws prohibits the insuring of any building “ situated within fifty yards of a railroad on which steam-power is employed, or of any forges, foundries, furnaces, rolling-mills, powder-mills, paper and oil mills, cotton-mills, or, in general, any mills, factories or machineries driven by steam-power.” But the property in the case in hand is embraced by neither the letter nor spirit of this prohibition.</p>
