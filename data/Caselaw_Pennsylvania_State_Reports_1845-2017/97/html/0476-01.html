In some of the cases certain property was declared exempt from, and other property subject to, taxation, although both were purchased with the capital stock. The principle seems to have been, that property, necessary for the enjoyment of the franchise, was declared not taxable, and that not necessary but simply convenient, taxable.

We are of the opinion that thereby all property, not specifically enumerated as exempt, and from which any income or revenue is derived, is made taxable for county purposes and embraced within the operations of the tax laws. It required no additional legislation to make it so. If not taxable, therefore, the act removed the barrier, and placed it in the same category as other property, and taxable under the general laws in operation.

This lot and the improvements are used only for the manufacturing' and supplying of gas according to the corporate powers of the company, and they are necessary and indispensable therefor.

Is the object of that act to provide a mode of taxing, or to declare it shall not be exempt from taxation ? We think the latter was its purpose. As we have already shown, this lot constitutes a part of the stock of the corporation, which already pays a tax thereon to the Commonwealth, and the owners of the stock pay taxes thereon to the county. We fail to discover anything in the act indicating an intention to impose double taxation on this lot. It is indispensably necessary to enable the corporation to execute the object or fulfil the purpose for which it was chartered. It was held, in Lehigh Coal &amp; Nav.

There, the corporation was not a stock company, and paid no taxes in any form to the state under the general corporation tax laws of the Commonwealth. It was an attempt to escape all taxation. As the specific property was not of the class which the Constitution or the statute exempted from all taxation it was properly held liable. It is true, some remarks of the judge who delivered the opinion would indicate additional reasons for the judgment, yet the fact of exemption from all other taxes is made prominent. It is there said, “ surely it was never intended that such a corporation should be exempt from all taxation, while others are compelled to bear their share of the public burden.”</p>
    <p id="b482-10" data-blocks='[["BL_482.7",482,[345,1198,1174,173]]]'>In the present case, the corporation does bear such a share of the public burdens as the legislature has imposed on the class of corporations to which it belongs. We think the learned judge erred in entering judgment in favor of the defendant in error.</p>
    <p id="b482-11" data-blocks='[["BL_482.8",482,[516,1370,1003,120]]]'>Judgment reversed, and judgment in favor of the plaintiff in error with full costs according to the case stated.</p>
