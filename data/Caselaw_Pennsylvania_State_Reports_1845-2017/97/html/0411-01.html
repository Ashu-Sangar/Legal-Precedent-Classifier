The plaintiff called as a witness the defendant Benjamin H. Guldin and proposed to prove by him, inter alia, that William C. Guldin on the day before his death acknowledged to him that he owed his mother a certain indebtedness of $1600. The defendant’s counsel objected, on the ground, inter alia, that the witness is incompetent, because of interest; that he is entitled under the intestate law to <em>one-third </em>of Hannah Guldin’s estate, while he is entitled under the intestate law' only <em>to one-fourth oí </em>William C. Guldin’s estate. His interest therefore predominates in favor of the plaintiff. Objection overruled ; exception. The witness then testified to the acknowledgment by William O. Guldin of his indebtedness of $1600 to Hannah Guldin, as stated in the offer. There was no other testimony in support of the plaintiff’s claim, except that one witness testified that he was present at the time of the acknowledgment of the indebtedness by William O. to Benjamin H. Guldin, that the latter “ asked him whether he had some of his mother’s money, and he said he had. He did not mention the amount.” The only other person present was a physician who was dead at the time of the trial.</p>

But here the preponderance was mathematically demonstrated. It is argued that he was admissible <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>under the Act of March 27th 1885, permitting a party to compel any adverse party to testify. But that was only intended tó apply to an <em>adverse </em>party in <em>fact </em>as well as in name. Without his evidence the plaintiff had no case, and with it the defendant was swearing money into his own pocket, and he was therefore incompetent: Robinson <em>v. </em>Eldridge, 10 S. &amp; R. 140; Ward <em>v. </em>Tyler, 2 P.

Guldin was a competent witness for the plaintiff, by virtue of the Act of March 27th 1865. As an “adverse party to the record,” he was within the very terms of the act. If the plea of interest were to exclude testimony offered under this act, then the act would be defeated in every case, because adverse parties are always interested in the subject of the suit. But it is settled that one who is interested in either event of a trial is a competent witness, and in "such case the court will not determine on which side is <em>the </em>preponderance of interest, but that will merely 'go to his credibility, and not to his competency: Brindle <em>v. </em>McIlvaine, 10 S. &amp; R. 282; Potter <em>v. </em>Burd, <a href="/watts/4/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 15" data-case-ids="1842767" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0015-01">4 Watts 15</a>; Finney’s Appeal, 9 P.

One was entitled “An act relating to the admission of parties to judicial proceedings as witnesses in certain cases,” and provided that in all trials and judicial proceedings an administrator or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, although a party to the proceeding, not having an interest in the subject-matter of the controversy, may be examined as a witness. Hence, in suits by or against administrators, when they are not interested otherwise than their right to compensation out of the estate for their services, they are as competent witnesses as strangers to the record and subject of controversy. The other is entitled “An act amending the law of evidence in Pennsylvania,” and enables any party to compel any adverse party or person for whose immediate and adverse benefit the action <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>is prosecuted or defended to testify in his behalf. Obviously this applies'to a real party, and not to one who sues or is sued as the representative merely. These acts are to be construed together. Their titles are to be considered being a part thereof under the constitutional amendment of 1864. One applies to a party who is a representative, the other to a party in interest. Under the law of evidence, a necessary party to the record, because of his trust relation, could not be a witness in behalf of the beneficiary or trust estate, and the statute makes him competent. Any person not a party, although interested, could be called to testify against his interest, and the statute puts a party on the same footing. The intendment of these statutes is to enable one party to call the opposite party to testify against his interest, and to make any uninterested fiduciary party a competent witness in the cause. They make no interested person or party competent to testify in his own behalf</p>

A. sues B., and C-, being interested in A.’s recovery, is incompetent as a witness for A. Pending the suit B. dies, and O. takes out letters of administration and is substituted as party defendant. Nothing but: perversion of the statutes will enable A. to call O. to testify. And if the suit were not commenced until after B.’s death and O.’s appointment as administrator, he, continuing to be interested against the estate, would be as clearly incompetent for the plaintiff.</p>
