Notarios are invested by the state authority with high privileges, and should be held to correlative duties. A notarial certificate, by law and general usage, is entitled to faith and credit, and it is the notary’s duty to use care corresponding to the import of his certificate. For this service he receives compensation, and if by his gross negligence or absence of due care he certifies to a falsehood, any one relying on it and suffering damage may be indemnified out of the bond. The defendant’s negligence in this case is admitted by his own testimony. It is true he swears that “ ho knows he must have been satisfied at the time that it was all right.” But the question is whether he <em>ought </em>to have been satisfied; and he alleges no fact showing diligence, but admits that he does not remember having taken any precaution to identify the party. A notary is not bound to warrant absolute truth, but where his certificate is shown to be false, he ought to show reasonable skill and diligence. It is not enough to show absence of fraud or guilty knowledge: Whart. on Negligence, 2d ed., sect. 284; Shearman and Redfield on Negligence, ed. 1874, sects. 163-168. There was evidence of negligence, and the case should, therefore, have been submitted to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[200,1324,1170,422]]]'>It is said the act of the notary in taking the acknowledgment is a “judicial act.” But where the grantor does not appear before him, he acts without jurisdiction, and like all inferior tribunals acting without jurisdiction, he is not protected- The mere giving of a certificate, without taking testimony, is a ministerial act, and even a judicial officer, in the exorcise of ministerial functions, is not protected by judicial privilege: Shearman and Redfield on Negligence, sect. 161. The notarial bond, unlike the bonds of magistrates or judges, is conditioned for the faithful performance of official duties.</p>

Theoretically the acknowledgment of deeds before judges, magistrates, commissioners or notaries public is, or was intended to be, a formal judicial act, as a pre-requisite to recording. In its nature the act is judicial in a high degree, to take, certify and attest under an official seal an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding. The recorder was intended to be a judicial officer to decide whether an instrument was properly recordable to become notice. And a certified copy of the record is made evidence equal to the original. In practice, notaries have been known to certify to acknowledgments of parties who are strangers to them, and the recorder will record anything. <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>Yet, practically, as well as theoretically, the legislature has authorized the copy of a copy to be equal to the original, and the party offering it cannot be called on to substantiate the genuineness of the original, even when the whole question is one of forgery.</p>

Why not ? He <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>is a public officer commissioned by the governor. He is acting under oath, like other officials in the performance of judicial duties, to “ well and faithfully perform the duties of his office.” The second section of the Act of 10th August 1864, Purd. Dig. 1097, expressly gives power to “ each notary public of this Commonwealth,” inter alia, “ to take and receive the acknowledgment or proof of all deeds, conveyances, mortgages, or other instruments of writing, touching or concerning any lands, tenements or hereditaments situate, lying and being in any part of this state, * * * as fully, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, as any judge of the Supreme Court, or president or associate judge of any of the Courts of Common Pleas, or any alderman or justice of the peace within this Commonwealth.” As, then, a notary is authorized to take the acknowledgment as fully, to all intents and purposes, as a magistrate can do, it follows the same effect should be given to his certificate of acknowledgment. It was so held in Hornbook <em>v. </em>Building Assoc., 7 Norris 64. Whatever officer is authorized to take the acknowledgment, to him is given a judicial duty, and when ho performs it it becomes a judicial act, and has the effect of a record.</p>

Ho added, “ the paper was undoubtedly signed before me. I don’t remember that I did or did not take any precaution to identify the person making the acknowledgment, but I know I must have been satisfied at tbe time.” The substance of his evidence therefore is that while he does not recollect what inquiries or statements were made, yet he knows he must have been satisfied as to the identity of the person, and that it was all right at the time the acknowledgment was taken. No evidence was given conflicting with or impairing this evidence of the defendant. The legal presumption is he acted on reasonable information, and did his full duty. His absence of memory as to the details of what occurred does not destroy that presumption. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove a clear and intentional dereliction of duty. This is neither proved nor averred. A mere mistaken conclusion imposes no legal liability on the defendant. The learned judge was clearly right in ordering a compulsory non-suit and in refusing to take it off. Judgment affirmed.</p>
