Smith 145, and Russell’s Appeal, 25 Id. 269. The doctrine is clearly recognised in these caseh, that where a trust is still subsisting, although all its purposes may not have been accomplished, if all who are or may be interested are in existence, are <em>sui juris, </em>and consent, courts of equity may decree a determination of the trust, on the principle that a trust continues in equity no longer than the thing to be secured by it demands.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-8" data-blocks='[["BL_38.8",38,[303,1333,1180,1080]],["BL_39.1",39,[180,405,1170,86]]]'>“ The distinction between each of these cases and the present application is, that the parties beneficially interested, and intended to be protected by the trust, were <em>sui juris. </em>In such case the court holds that, unless a deliberate intent of a party to tie up his hands should clearly appear, the omission of a power of revocation, accompanied by proof of a failure of counsel to advise it, are circumstances, <em>with others, </em>to show that it was not done with deliberate intent. But in Russell’s Appeal, <em>supra, </em>it is just as clearly held, that a trust which contains no power of revocation, if not in prejudice of creditors, and created with intention and knowledge of the act, is irrevocable in law and in equity; nor is the mere omission of counsel to advise the insertion in the deed of a power of revocation of itself ground to set aside a voluntary conveyance. It was upon the recognition of this principle that Koenig’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 352, was decided. The trust was for the separate use of a married woman, and the court held that it ceased on the death of the husband. In Russell’s Appeal, the master puts the decision on the ground that it was apparent that the intention was that the trust should be operative only during the life of the intended husband. This view of the case was adopted by the court on final hearing of the cause. Chief Justice Agnew says, that where the facts show that the instrument was executed without advice or reflection, and without an intention to bind the party after the reasons and motives for executing it have passed away, and the party is again <em>sui juris, </em>a court of equity will and ought <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>to relieve against volunteers, claiming without consideration, or a reasonable motive for continuing the donor’s disability.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.6",39,[184,491,1170,564]]]'>“ Mrs. Monges, formerly Mrs. Twining, is still under the disability of coverture. She is therefore to be protected even against her own solicitation to set aside this trust in part or in whole, and it mátters not that her husband consents to the application. The reason for the creation of the trust is at this time in as full force as it was at its inception, and the principle which is recognised by courts of equity, as justifying the setting aside of a trust, does not exist in her case. To this we add, that it is apparent that the intention was to carry the trust beyond the death of her present husband, should he die before his wife. By its terms it is to continue for the remainder of her life, whether she marry again or remains sole, and only in the event of her death can the principal fund be paid over to the plaintiff.</p>

The life-estate and the remainder constituting the entire corpus, it is difficult to see why a conveyance signed by the only parties in interest would not pass the title. The trust for the sole and separate use of Mrs. Monges was to protect the property from her husband or his creditors. No part of the fund now sought to be withdrawn from the trust estate would go to him or his creditors. Nor would it be an anticipation of the payment of interest to Mrs. Monges. It is an extinguishment by her of that much of the corpus, and only anticipates its vesting in the remainderman.</p>

F. Smith 145; Perry on Trusts, §§ 274, 386, 920. Whatever may be the nominal duration of a trust, it continues in equity no longer than the thing sought to be secured by the trust demands. Equity will not enforce a purely voluntary deed of trust against the grantor or his representatives: Smith <em>v. </em>Harrington, <a href="/mass/86/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Allen 566" data-case-ids="2100628" data-case-paths="/mass/86/0566-01">4 Allen 566</a>; Bowditch <em>v. </em>Andrew, 8 Id. 339. The mere omission of a power of revocation will not prevent the operation of this principle. Such omission is primá facie evidence of <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>mistake: Russell’s Appeal, 25 P. F.

The deed gives Mrs. Monges the right to change the securities, with the assent of the trustee, and if she is willing to take her son’s bond for $4000, the trustee, being secured against loss by the signatures of all the parties in interest, cannot object.</p>

The trust is a lawful one for the sole and separate use of a married woman. To grant the prayer of the bill would be, in effect, a revocation pro tanto, which, if lawful, might be repeated so as to-exhaust the whole trust estate. The deed plainly forbids what is now attempted to be done, and it cannot be legalized by the assent of the cestui que trust, who has no power except that given or reserved to her in the deed. Hot being' <em>sui juris, </em>she would not be bound by such consent, and it would be no answer to her demand hereafter for income for the trustee to say that it had disappeared with the principal at her request. The object of the trust was to prevent her anticipating or assigning the income, with or without the persuasion of her husband, and to ask a court of equity to overturn this prudent provision -while the object of the trust still exists, would be to ask it to sanction a breach of trust: Hill on Trustees, *421, 422; Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, <a href="/rawle/1/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Rawle 231" data-case-ids="1819262" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0231-01">1 Rawle 231</a>.</p>
    <p id="b40-7" data-blocks='[["BL_40.9",40,[292,1559,1176,736]]]'>In Culbertson’s Appeal, 26 P. F. Smith 145, relied on by the appellant, the trust was not under any instrument, but was a widow’s dower interest in partition in the Orphans’ Court. The court had jurisdiction of the fund, having themselves impressed it with a quasi trust. The case is, therefore, inapplicable. Moreover, the general statement quoted in the opinion by Merccjr, J., from Perry on Trusts, § 386, was modified and restricted by Mr. Perry in the later editions of his work, by the supplementary section, 386 <em>a, </em>where he says, referring to a trust lawfully created for a specific purpose: “ Any conveyance, whether by operation of law, or by the act of any of the parties, which disappoints the purposes of the settlor by divesting the property or the income from the purposes named, would be a breach of trust. Therefore, it may be said that the power to create a trust for a specified purpose does, in some sort, impair the power to alienate property.” This accords with the current of all the later Pennsylvania decisions on the subject of trusts.</p>

This principle is not set aside by the Act of 1848, relative to married women ; for the separate estate thereby created is a legal one, totally distinct from an equitable separate estate created by agreement or devise: Penna. Co. for Ins. on Lives <em>v. </em>Foster, 11 Casey 134. Prior to that act, a married woman could dispose of her personal estate to her husband, by gift or otherwise, and, with his consent, to a stranger; the act took from her no right which she had previously possessed in regard to- the disposal of her personal estate: Brown’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%20329" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 329">9 W.

These were secure before, and it was not intended to take away from the wife any of that protection of her separate property against her husband which she had previously enjoyed. “ All experience proves that the highest protection of the wife against the husband is in her disability, in her want of power to yield to his solicitations, or give way to her sympathies:” Wright <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20224" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Wright 224">8 Wright 224</a>.</p>
