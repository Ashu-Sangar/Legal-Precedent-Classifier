These tickets each contained the name of Adolph W. Schalck for district attorney, and doubtless also the names of the other candidates upon the same county ticket (Democratic). To have the records of the election correspond with the false tickets so introduced into the ballot box, McHale caused John J. Kelly, one of the clerks of election, to add a number of names to the “list of voters” kept by the two clerks during the election. To still further cover his fraud he caused himself to be called in by Martin Feeney, the election judge, to count the ballots, upon pretence that the officers were “ green ” and he an old hand at such matters. . Instead of counting each ballot, however, he lumped them and counted as he pleased to make the result tally with his false tickets, and, as was alleged by the contestants, to correspond with some ulterior purpose, <em>i. e., </em>the object of the alleged conspiracy.</p>

Giving, therefore, the Act of 1860 full sweep, where it declares that all misdemeanors may bo prosecuted within two years, can we say that this applies to an offence which the statute does not call a misdemeanor, and which is to be proceeded against ‘ within one year?’ It seems to be a peculiarity of the Election Code of 1839, that it provides for the indictment and punishment not only of election officers, but of ‘ any person’ offending against it, without classifying the crime as a felony or misdemeanor, except in one or two instances not involved in those prosecutions. This could not have been merely accidental, and has some weight in our examination of this matter. (See as to the exceptions, sects. Ill, 113, Act 1839, as given in Dunlop’s Dig. 780). As having a bearing on the effect to which the Act of 1839 is entitled since the adoption of the new Constitution and the passage of the Act of May 19th 1874 (Contested Elections, Pampli. L. 208), we may refer to In re Contested Election of Barber, 5 Norris 392; (see particularly p. 400).</p>

These indictments are clearly for offences provided for by the Act of 1839, and are barred by the limitation of one year contained in that act. Offences against the election laws are unknown to the common law. They are purely of statutory origin, and such statutes must receive strict construction. Even were the offence charged a common-law offence, the Act of 1806 has superseded common-law remedies wherever a statutory remedy is given, and that act cannot be evaded by calling the offence a <em>conspiracy </em>at common law, to do what is prohibited by the Act of 1839.</p>

This lacks two days of the limitation of two years prescribed for the prosecution for misdemeanors by the 77th section of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1860. The court below held, however, that the latter act did not apply, for the reason that the prosecutions were under the Act of 2d July 1839, Pamph. L. 519, entitled, “An act relating to the elections of this Commonwealth,” the 128th section of which provides that all prosecutions under said act shall be instituted “within one year next after the cause thereof shall accrue, unless otherwise herein provided.” We need not discuss the question whether the limitation contained in this section is repealed by the subsequent Act of 1860, before referred to.

The indictments charge them with a conspiracy to do the things, or at least some of the things prohibited by said act. The object of the conspiracy, as set forth in the first count of the indictment, was “ to procure a false, fraudulent and untrue count and return of the votes so cast by the said electors,” &amp;c. The count then sets forth divers overt acts, some of which, if committed by the parties, would render them amenable to the penalties of the Act of 1839. The second and third counts charge a conspiracy of a like object and similar character, followed by other overt acts committed in furtherance of said conspiracies. The fourth and fifth counts set out the conspiracy but omit the overt acts, being what is known in criminal pleading as the common counts.</p>

This does not follow. The error into which the learned judge fell was in losing sight of the precise nature of the offence charged, and in supposing the indictment was under the Act of 1839. The indictments were for a conspiracy — a common-law offence — and with which the Act of 1839 has nothing whatever to do. The gisn of this offence is the combination — the unlawful agreement to do the particular thing. And the offence is complete, as all the authorities agree, the moment the combination is formed. The overt acts are no- part of the crime charged; they are merely the evidence of it; the iheans by which the Commonwealth is enabled to prove the conspiracy itself. The object of <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>setting them forth in the indictment is to furnish notice to the defendants of the particular acts the Commonwealth relies upon as evidence of their having acted in concert. In this respect they supply the place of a bill of particulars. The fact of the combination is almost always inferred by the jury from the acts, the overt acts of the parties, as direct evidence in the shape of declarations can seldom be shown. When established, a conspiracy has always been regarded as a serious offence. It is the combination that makes it so. There are many things that one man may do that two or more may not combine to do. In the recent case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Bartilson, 4 Norris 487, we had occasion to review this branch of the law of conspiracy with some care, and need <em>not </em>repeat what was there said.</p>

They were signed by <em>Guy </em>E. Earquhar, Esq., who was specially appointed by the court to try these cases, under the Act of 12th March 1866, Pamph. L. 85. The appointment appears to have been regularly made in accordance with the provisions of said act, and was eminently proper, as the district attorney was a candidate at the general election at which the alleged frauds were committed, and which frauds, it is stated, increased his vote. It would therefore have been a breach of professional and official propriety for him to have acted as district attorney in these cases. But it is said the appointment was illegal because the Constitution adopted since the act of 1866 was passed, makes the district attorney a constitutional officer, and as such he cannot be stripped of his powers by the legislature. There is little force in this suggestion. While the legislature may not abolish the office, it can control the officer. They can regulate the performance of his duties, and punish him for misconduct, as in the case of other officers. And where he neglects or refuses to act, or where, from the circumstances of a given case, it is improper and indelicate for him to act, it is competent for the legislature to afford a remedy. This is all that the Act of 1866 does, and we think its provisions are not obnoxious to any constitutional provision.</p>

In chap. 13, of vol. 4, of Sharswood’s edition, it is thus defined : <em>“ </em>The last speciesjjjóf offences which especially affect the Commonwealth are those against the public police or economy. By the public police and economy I mean the due regulation and domestic order of the kingdom, whereby the individuals of the state, like members of a well-governed family, are bound to conform their general behavior to the rules of propriety, good neighborhood and good manners, and to be decent, industrious and inoffensive in their respective stations. This head of offences must therefore be very miscellaneous, as it <em>comprises all such crimes as especially affect public </em>society, and are not comprehended under any of the four preceding series. These amount some of them to felony, and others to mis-<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>demeanors only.” Th.e learned author then proceeds to define certain offences of both classes which aro among the crimes against the public police or economy. The felonies I will omit. The misdemeanors aro: 1. Common or public nuisances, of which a large variety are given, commencing with obstructions to public highways and ending with common scolds. 2. Idleness. 3. Sumptuary laws. 4. Gaming. 5. Destroying game. These, as the text shows, are but illustrations. A large number of these and other common-law offences are now, and have for many years been regulated by statute in England. But in most instances the statute is merely declaratory of the common law, the object being to define the crime with greater accuracy or to increase the punishment.</p>

Bishop in his work on Criminal Law, vol. i., sects. 358 and 368 (1st ed.) says : ‘ The government requires its subjects to do more than simply abstain from attempting its overthrow. It requires them to give, when called upon, their active assistance to it. and at ail times to refrain from casting obstructions in the way of its several departments and functions. Therefore every violation of these duties, being sufficient in magnitude for the law to regard, is criminal. * * * We see it to be of the highest importance that persons be elected to carry on the government in its various departments, and that in every case a suitable choice he made. Therefore any act tending to defeat these objects, as forcibly or unlawfully preventing an election being held, bribing or corruptly .influencing an elector, casting more than onevote, is punishable under the criminal common law.” Mr. Wharton in his work on Criminal Law, vol. i. sect. 6 (6th ed), places the giving of more than one vote at an election as among the misdemeanors at common law. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in two cases has recognised the same doctrine. The first was Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Silsbee, <a href="/mass/9/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Mass. 417" data-case-ids="2029762" data-case-paths="/mass/9/0369-01">9 Mass. 417</a>, which was an indictment charging that the defendant did “wilfully, fraudulently, knowingly and designedly give in more than one vote for the choice of selectmen of the said town of Salem at one time of balloting, &amp;c.” After conviction the defendant moved in arrest of judgment that there was no statute covering the offence. It was said by the court: 44 There cannot be a doubt that the offence described in the indictment is a misdemeanor at common law. It is a general principle that where a statute gives a privilege, and one wilfully violates such privilege, the common law will punish such violation. In town meetings every qualified voter has equal rights, and is entitled to give one vote for every officer to bo elected. The person who gives more infringes and violates the rights)of other voters, and for this offence the common law gives the indictment.” The other ease is Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Hoxey, <a href="/mass/16/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 Mass. 385" data-case-ids="2035159" data-case-paths="/mass/16/0318-01">16 Mass. 385</a>. The defendant was charged with disturbing a town meeting assembled to make choice of town <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>officers for the political year then ensuing, and that the said defendant, “ intending as much as in him lay to prevent the choice of said selectmen according to the will of the electors and to interrupt the freedom of election, unlawfully and disorderly did openly declare that the old selectmen should not be chosen, and attempted repeatedly to take from the box, which contained the ballots of the electors, the votes of the electors,” &amp;c. The defendant pleaded guilty to the indictment, and moved in arrest of judgment; “ because the said indictment purports to be founded upon a statute law of the Commonwealth; whereas there is no such statute in the state making the facts set forth in the indictment an offence against the Commonwealth; and because the facts set forth in the indictment do not amount to an offence at common law.” The court, after admitting there was no statute to meet the case, proceeded to say: “ The remaining question is, do the facts charged amount to an offence at common law ? On this question we entertain no' doubts. Here was .a violent and rude disturbance of the citizens, lawfully assembled in town meeting, and in the actual exercise of their municipal rights and duties. The tendency of the defendant’s conduct was to a breach of the peace, and to the prevention of elections necessary to the orderly government of the town, and due management of its concerns for the year. It is true that the common law knows nothing perfectly agreeing with our municipal assemblies. But other meetings are well known and often held in England, the disturbance of which is punishable at common law as a misdemeanor. In this Commonwealth town meetings are recognised in our Constitution and laws; and the elections made and business transacted by the citizens at those meetings lie at the foundation of our whole civil polity. If then there were no statute prohibiting disorderly conduct at such meetings, an indictment for such conduct might be supported.” While the court put this case partly upon the ground that the defendant’s conduct tended to a breach of the peace, it is evident the principal reason was the interference with the rights of the electors, which as the learned judge truly said “lie at the foundation of our civil polity,” and it may be safely asserted that every fraud upon the ballot tends directly to a breach of the public peace if not to revolution and civil war.</p>
