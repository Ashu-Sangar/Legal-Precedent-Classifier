The burthen falls first upon the last purchase, and it is only after the fund arising from this source has been consumed, that resort can be had to that which is antecedent, and so on in regular order, until the land of the first purchaser is reached, which is the last to be called on for contribution, and then only to the amount of what remains of the original charge after the lands post-dating it in title have been exhausted. And this, it is said in Mevey’s Appeal, 4 Barr 80, because it cannot be in the power of the debtor, by the act of selling or assigning his remaining land, to throw the burthen of the payment or a ratable part of it back on the first purchaser.

Then, on the 10th of November 1853, Mary Farrington, as administratrix of Alonzo Farrington’s estate, released the lien of the above-mentioned mortgage from lots No. 837 (Bitmeyer) and 841 (Foust), attempting, without the consent of Charter, to reserve the lien on 839, which was, of course, nugatory. Finally, on the 17th of November following, she assigned the mortgage to William Spink, who afterwards transferred it to Edward D. Martin, now deceased, the estate of whom is represented by the appellant. Now, as we have before us no question of notice or of the entire sufficiency of the Bitmeyer lot, No. 837, to have paid the mortgage in full, the application for an issue not having raised either of these questions, and the master having found that <em>the </em>value of said lot was ample lor that purpose, it is very clear that the release of 837, the subsequent purchase, released also 839, the prior purchase.
