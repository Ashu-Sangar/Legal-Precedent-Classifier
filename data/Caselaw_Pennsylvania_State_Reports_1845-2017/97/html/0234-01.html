On May 29th 1876, Heilbron, a partner in the firm of Tobias &amp; Heilbron, which firm was then in fair financial credit, came to his counting-house and said to him, that he, Heilbron, had $3500 which he did <em>not </em>want <em>to use, </em>and that he would like to loan it to him. Stedman replied that he was not in want of money and never borrowed. Heilbron then said that he had no use for the money, and had hoped that Stedman would borrow it, but as he would not do this, he would like him to. deposit it in his account for a few days. Stedman at first declined, but on Heilbron stating that it would be an accommodation to him, Stedman said if that was so, he would take it and deposit it for him. Heilbron thereupon handed Stedman the check of his firm, Tobias &amp; Heilbron, to his, Heilbron’s order, for $3500, dated May 29th' 1876, and walked away, but came back in a few moments and said it might be as well, in case of death, that he should hold Stedman’s check for the amount, so that he could draw the money, but that the check should be without date, as he would not want to use it for some days. Stedman, having no suspicion of fraud, gave him his check for the amount without date. Heilbron then asked Stedman when he would make his deposit, stating that he expected to receive $1500 more that day, which he wished to give him also, if he got it in time. Mr. Stedman replied that he made his deposit a little before three o’clock; and having learned this fact, Heilbron went away.</p>

Carstairs &amp; McCall did not part with any new or valuable consideration. Heilbron’s cheek, which they gave up to him, was not such a consideration, for it was itself fraudulent and worthless. Its surrender and destruction would be no bar to a suit against Heilbron. Moreover, Heilbron’s fraud amounted to larceny or a public misdemeanor. The checks which he obtained from Stedman and from Carstairs &amp; McCall, in exchange for his own worthless checks, were but the key of the owners’ money-box, which Heilbron used to enable him to steal the money. His check was the evidence of the larceny, and the surrender of it by Carstairs &amp; McCall to the wrongdoer in consideration of restitution was equivalent to condonation of a crime. If Heilbron’s acts amounted to larceny, we are entitled to follow our property, and recover it or its proceeds from the defendants.</p>

    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.6",237,[188,490,1183,909]]]'>A statement of the facts and the order of events is necessary to” a clear understanding of the case. On the 27th of May 1876, one Heilbron, of the firm of Tobias &amp; Ileilbron, gave to the defendants the check of his firm for $3500, and at the same time the defendants gave to Heilbron their check for the same sum. Two days thereafter, Heilbron also gave to the plaintiff the check of his firm for $3500, and the plaintiff gave his check to Heilbron for the like sum. At the time these checks of Tobias &amp; Heilbron were drawn and transferred the firm was in good credit, but did not have the money in bank to meet either of them. Each transaction was an exchange of checks. The check given to the defendants was returned to them protested. On Heilbron being notified of this fact, he alleged he had been disappointed in getting the money from a person who owed him, but he expected to get it, and would pay them. After that he brought and gave to the defendants the check of the plaintiff for the $3500. He asked for his own check, and the defendants gave it up to him. The defendants then drew the money on the check drawn by plaintiff thus given to them. The check of Tobias &amp; Heilbron, given to the plaintiff, went to protest, and he seeks to recover from the defendants the money they obtained on the check he gave to Heilbron.</p>
    <p id="b237-7" data-blocks='[["BL_237.7",237,[189,1394,1176,428]]]'>The first assignment is to the affirmance of the first point submitted by the 'defendant. It is in these words: “If you believe that defendants, on the 29th of May 1876, were the owners of a check of Tobias &amp; Heilbron; that said firm was at that time in fair financial standing; that defendants were ignorant that any fraud had been perpetrated upon plaintiff; that in good faith they surrendered the said check of Tobias &amp; Heilbron, and accepted in lieu and payment thereof the check of the plaintiff, then, although the latter was defrauded by Heilbron, he cannot recover from the defendants.”</p>
    <p id="b237-8" data-blocks='[["BL_237.8",237,[190,1834,1173,604]]]'>We discover no error in the affirmance of this point. The numerous authorities cited, applicable to the acquisition of commercial paper in bad faith, or when it is taken merely as collateral for a pre-existing debt have no application to the facts stated in this point. The jury has found the defendants were guilty of no fraud, but acted in entire good faith ; they took the check of the plaintiff, not as collateral, but in payment of the check of Tobias &amp; Heilbron. The latter were in fair financial standing. The defendants gave up their check, and released them from all obligation. They thus gave a valuable consideration for the check of the plaintiff. This, under numerous authorities, constituted the defendants holders for value. They therefore took the plaintiff’s check discharged of equities between them and Ileilbron, of which they had no notice.</p>

If such was the fact, the point was correctly affirmed. The right of the plaintiff to recover cannot be sustained, unless the defendants received his money. On the argument it was said there was no evidence on which to submit that point, yet that it was submitted without evidence is not assigned for error. The assignment is only to alleged error in stating the law. There is no assignment that it was submitted without evidence.</p>
