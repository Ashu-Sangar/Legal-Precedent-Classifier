But the defendants’ promise was not to pay the debt of another, but was to pay the purchase-money, due by them, to third parties, viz., the creditors of the old firm, of whom the plaintiff was one. It was thus their own debt which the defendants agreed to pay to parties nominated by their vendors. The vendors and vendees agreed to substitute one payee for another.

F. Shar-p &amp; Co..at the time the property was transferred to the defendants, on the 20th of February 1873. The defendants reported to him that they took the assets' of F. F. Sharp &amp; Co., and assumed their liabilities to the extent of j 80 per cent. He further testified that, after the transfer to the defendants, Wood promised to pay him the amount due if he would make out the amount and give it to him; that he made it out and gave it to him. Wood said to him he ought not to take 80 per cent., but was entitled to all of it; that he would pay it. Haines had previously urged him to make out the account and send it to Wood; that he had promised to pay it if plaintiff would make it <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>out; that Sharp, while a member of the firm, told him that Wood had the account, and promised to pay him.

As already shown, the defendants made no payment at the time they took possession of the property valued at $114,000. The evidence of F. F. Sharp leaves it uncertain precisely what sum the defendants should pay, and whether that sum was not to be guaged by, and paid out of, the sum realized out of the property taken by them. Their own written averment is that they were not to pay F. F. Sharp &amp; Co. anything until the creditors were satisfied, if the purchase-money was sufficient for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b221-7" data-blocks='[["BL_221.7",221,[226,1027,1171,814]]]'>If the contract of the defendants was one of purchase, their agreement was not to pay the debt of another, but to pay their own debt incurred in the purchase of the property ; and perhaps a jury might find that the extent of their obligation to pay was to be limited to the application of the proceeds of the property of which they took possession. The evidence shows the defendants carried on the business for a short time. They collected the accounts assigned to them, so far as they were collectable, and applied some of the proceeds to their own use. They also paid most of the creditors of their predecessors. Still further, they paid $12,000 to Sharp, who was a member of both firms, and $5000 to Sharpless, the other member of the firm of F. F. Sharp &amp; Co. As they were not to be paid anything until the creditors were satisfied, this fact might create some presumption that the defendants had previously realized out of the assets a sttm sufficient to pay all the creditors. This might have an important bearing in arriving at the true character of the transaction. We think the evidence is amply sufficient to have been submitted to the jury under proper instructions.</p>
