B. acted as A/s nurse, lived with her, had free access to the box, was in the habit from time to time of cutting off the coupons and collecting them, paid A.’s bills, and otherwise attended to A.’s business affairs. Some short time before A.’s death, B. exhibited the box to a servant, telling her <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>there were but §1700 dollars worth of bonds in it, hut without mentioning other valuables belonging to A. deposited therein. B. assigned as her reason for this conduct the fact that she was sick and fearing that she might die wished a third person to know where the box and the bonds were. Subsequently, upon A.’s death, B. filed her account as executrix, wherein she charged herself with only §1700 worth of the bonds; she accounted satisfactorily for the disposition of §800 worth of them during testatrix’s lifetime, but did not attempt to explain the disappearance of the residue. In settling up the estate she misconducted herself in various ways as to other portions of testatrix’s property. <em>Held </em>(reversing the decree of the court below), that the circumstances did not warrant the finding as a matter of fact that the accountant had taken the missing bonds, and that she should not be surcharged with the value of them.</p>

For many years- before her death, Mrs. Dawes was more or less incapacitated by physical infirmity from attending to household or business matters; she was paralyzed in her feet and practically helpless, although not mentally imbecile. Sarah Milligan lived with the testatrix from 1865 to her death, nursed her carefully with constant attention, and attended to her business matters, such as the collection of rents, payment of bills, &amp;c., at her direction. They boarded together with a brother-in-law of Miss Milligan, in a house which the latter had purchased from Mrs. Dawes in 1866, for $3500, and which Miss Milligan’s brother-in-law7 rented from Miss Milligan in consideration of their board. In February 1869, proceedings in lunacy were commenced at the instance of Mrs. Dawes’ brother, who feared that Miss Milligan was mismanaging her estate. Pending these proceedings, in 1869, Miss Milligan exhibited to Henry Green, Esq., counsel for Mrs. Dawes, at his office, Mrs. Dawes’s tin box, containing her securities, of which Mr. Green made a list. Among the securities in the box at that <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>time were $4000 in United States 5-20 bonds. A proposition was made and accepted by the counsel in the lunacy proceedings that the box and securities should be placed in the possession of Mr. John Stewart, president of the First National Bank of Easton, and the lunacy proceedings were discontinued. Mr. Stewart subsequently declined to take charge of the box, which was then taken from the bank and given back to Mrs. Dawes. The evidence showed that she kept it under her bed, and that Miss Milligan would occasionally, at her request, hand it to her in bed, when she would cut off coupons, &amp;c. This she was in the habit of doing until about two years before her death, when she became too feeble. During this period, and after Mrs. Dawes’s death, Miss Milligan had free access to the box and its contents.</p>

The accountant further testified that she was to receive from Mrs. Dawes, for her board and rent, $500 a year, and that Mrs. Dawes told her she should make her charges for taking care of her, and should be well paid for it; that Mrs. Dawes paid no rent, but gave her a $500 bond for her services from 1865 to 1869.</p>

It is proven by an abundance of testimony, that during the last two years of the testatrix’s life, and some time prior to that, Mrs. Dawes was physically and also mentally incompetent to transact any business, and that the accountant did attend to and transact her business, such as cutting off the coupons, collecting the interest, rents, paid bills and exercised general supervision over Mrs. Dawes’s affairs. Government bonds such as these, payable to bearer, are like any species of money ; they pass by mere delivery. No written transfer is necessary. No acknowledgment before some public officer is required, nor does the name of any holder appear upon them in any way. They are payable to bearer, and the facilities for acquiring them are therefore equal to the facilities in disposing of them in the same manner as the acquirement of money or notes, and hence the same inference from circumstances arise with respect to them that would arise as to money or notes.</p>

And from <em>that </em>time until Mrs. Dawes’ death, the box containing the securities was in the care and under the surveillance of the accountant. She opened the box at her pleasure, cut the coupons off whenever they fell due, and the only recollection she has of the removal of any were the three $100 bonds, the proceeds of which were given to the Episcopal Church, and one $500 bond appropriated by herself for services rendered to Mrs. Dawes from 1865 to 1869 with Mrs. Dawes’s assent.</p>

But her cross-examination shows that the accountant was not sick, was not confined to her bed. or her room, had no doctor in attendance, and showed no symptoms of dangerous disease then or afterwards. Therefore, it can be inferred that the reason given was a false one, and it might be further inferred that the accountant was trying to manufacture evidence for herself, to be used after Mrs. Dawes’s death. If her reason given to Mary R. Dodd for wanting some one to know about the box and the bonds was true, and a genuine one, why did she not count the bonds ? or let the witness count them ? Only in that way could the witness have knowledge. Or why did she not take the witness in the next room, where Mrs. Dawes was, and in her presence produce the bonds, and let the witness ascertain by personal inspection what amount was there, if the reason given by the accountant was the real and genuine reason ? Nor does the accountant say anything to the witness about the other securities in the box, which were of greater value than the $1700 in government bonds. The circumstances strongly indicate that the accountant was only seeking to guard against any subsequent allegation that there were $4000 instead of $1700 in United States government bonds.</p>

These bonds were shown to have belonged to, and to have been in the possession of the testatrix prior to her death. The auditor, upon what he regarded sufficient evidence, surcharged the accountant with' said bonds, as will appear by the following extract from his report: “ Upon the whole testimony in the case, the conduct of the accountant, and the circumstantial proof adduced before the auditor, it is a moral certainty that the accountant either has these bonds or their proceeds, and under all the facts in this case, your auditor is clearly of that opinion, and accordingly so finds.” The learned judge of the Orphans’ Court sustained this ruling, yet it is evident he felt the strain of this branch of the case when he said, “ While we are of opinion that the finding of the <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>auditor is fairly sustained by the evidence, we are free to say that, the circumstances are not very strong, and are of such a character as might fail to produce conviction in other minds.”</p>

She had no such possession of the bonds as agent as would render her liable for their non-production. As a matter of fact and as a matter of law, the bonds were in the possession of the testatrix down to the time of her death. Nor was the accountant her agent in the sense of involving liability. She was the servant and nurse of the testatrix, and did what she was directed to do. Sometimes it was to collect a coupon, at others to nurse her mistress and attend to household duties.</p>
    <p id="b532-8" data-blocks='[["BL_532.8",532,[326,1229,1179,432]]]'>The only ground upon which this surcharge can be sustained is that the accountant embezzled or stole the bonds. This is a serious charge. It ought not to be made lightly, nor without clear evidence to sustain it. When a person is charged with crime it matters little what the form of the charge may be or on which side of the court. It is true the result is different, but the difference is only in degree. It may be more agreeable to be branded as a thief in the Orphans’ Court or Common Pleas than in the Quarter Sessions.

At that time they were exhibited by <em>the </em>accountant to counsel, under circumstances not material to narrate. We have no trace of them subsequently until some time in 1872, when Mary R. Dodd testifies that the accountant showed them to her at the house of the testatrix, and informed her that there were $1700 of them. The witness saw the bonds, but did not examine them, and had no <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>knowledge of the amount beyond what the accountant told her. The testatrix died during that year, and after her death the accountant, who was her executrix, produced $1700 of the bonds as all that there were remaining. When asked what had become of the residue, she accounted for $300 as having been used to pay a subscription to a church. This was shown to have been correct, and was allowed. She further claimed the testatrix had given her a $500 bond for her services as nurse, which the evidence shows were faithful, laborious and of long continuance. This was allowed. The whereabouts of the balance of the bonds she did not attempt to explain. There was still a deficiency of $1500, and with this the auditor surcharged her.</p>

It would be dangerous to infer guilt from the mere opportunity to commit a crime.</p>
    <p id="b533-7" data-blocks='[["BL_533.7",533,[241,1145,1094,43]]]'>The first, second and third assignments of error are sustained.</p>
    <p id="b533-8" data-blocks='[["BL_533.8",533,[194,1189,1173,599]]]'>We are unable to see any serious error in the remaining assignments. The principal one is to the refusal of the court to allow the accountant commissions. After reflection, we have concluded not to disturb this ruling. While we have relieved the accountant from the surcharge of the bonds, there is yet much in her conduct in the management of this estate that does not meet our approval. The ruling of the court below upon this point was not based exclusively upon the bonds. There were other matters, such as the conversion of the "'bank stocks to her own use, the attempt to buy a portion of the real estate at her own sale, and the admitted use of the trust-funds. These matters, coupled with her general conduct in her dealings with the estate, are sufficient to prevent our disturbing the ruling of the court below upon the question of commissions.</p>
