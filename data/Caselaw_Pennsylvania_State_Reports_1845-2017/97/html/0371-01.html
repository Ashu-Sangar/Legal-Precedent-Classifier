A daughter of a decedent intestate, who was entitled to a distributive share of his estate, gave to the surviving members of a firm in which he had been a partner, a receipt for certain money, which she acknowledged to be in full for all claims by her against her father’s estate real and personal, except such amount as was to be paid to her after the death of his widow, and whereby she further released to said firm and decedent’s administrators all claims by her against them, except as aforesaid. The administrators filed an account, including, inter alia, the proceeds of certain real estate of decedent sold by them, to which account the daughter filed exceptions. <em>Held, </em>that by the terms of said receipt, the said daughter still retained an interest in her father’s real estate, which entitled her to a standing in court to dispute the correctness of the account filed by his administratoi’s.</p>

Pomeroy died in April 1872, intestate, leaving to survive him a widow and two children, of whom the appellant, Fanny P. Dampf, is one. Plis brother, Eleazar Pomeroy, and his father-in-law, Dummer Lilly, were appointed administrators of his estate. They filed their account May 16th 1879, to which Mrs. Dampf and her husband filed exceptions, and asked for the appointment of an auditor. After argument, the court refused to appoint an auditor. Upon the hearing of a rule to show cause why the exceptions should not be dismissed and the account finally confirmed, the following facts appeared: Daniel F. Pomeroy, at the time of his death, was a member of two firms, the one doing business at Troy, Bradford county, under the name of <em>Pomeroy </em>Brothers, and the other at Blossburg, Tioga county, under the name of Pomeroy Brothers &amp; Smith. The surviving partners of the firm of Pomeroy Brothers are Horace Pomeroy and Samuel W. Pomeroy, and the same, with one Frederick E. Smith, are the surviving partners of the firm of Pomeroy Brothers &amp; Smith. The business of both firms was banking; and in addition thereto, Pomeroy Brothers dealt largely in real estate, and were the owners of a considerable amount thereof at the time of his death.</p>

This was error on several grounds. Mrs. Dampf’s interest in that portion of the estate to be distributed at the death of the widow was expressly reserved in the release, and this left in her sufficient interest to except to the account. The receipt was given to the surviving partners of the firm of Pomeroy Brothers, who were trustees for Mrs. Dampf as to the partnership assets, and is not conclusive evidence of a settlement between them and their cestui que trust, a married woman. The release to the administrators, included in the receipt to the partners, expresses no consideration moving from the administrators. The paper is executed by a husband acting as attorney in fact for his wife, under a power of attorney from her, executed in New York, and not acknowledged according to the laws of Pennsylvania. A direct conveyance by her, so acknowledged, would be insufficient to pass her interest in real estate inherited from her father: Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P.

A married woman may appoint her husband her agent. The Act of 1848 applies to sales and encumbrances, and not to the receipt of money by a husband as his wife’s agent for <em>her </em>use. The Act of April 11th 1856 expressly authorizes a married woman who is entitled to a distributive share of personalty or proceeds of realty of a decedent to sign, seal and deliver, either in person or by attorney, a refunding bond, and to execute all other acts which may lawfully be required by an administrator on payment of such share, with the same effect, for the purpose of binding her separate estate, as if she were sole and unmarried: Hinney <em>v. </em>Phillips, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20382" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Wright 382">14 Wright 382</a>; Fryer <em>v. </em>Rishell, 3 Norris 521.

    <p id="AGz" data-blocks='[["BL_376.10",376,[266,1777,1178,518]]]'>We will first consider the effect of the language of the receipt, assuming it to have been executed by authority of the appellant. The administrators were not a party to it. There is no averment that the money came from them or from the estate. It does purport to except out of the settlement made with Pomeroy Bros, so much of the estate as is to be paid to her on the death of Mrs. Pomeroy, the widow of her father. With the exception stated, it acknowledges the money paid to be in full of her claims against the estate of her father, and it releases and discharges the said Pomeroy Bros, from all claim against them as surviving partners.

If a sale of the real estate should be made made by the administrators the appellant would be interested in that sale. The measure of her claim would bo affected by it. The account filed shows a sale of real estate was made, and the sum received therefor is one of the items. This exception in the receipt of itself shows a continuing interest of the appellant in the estate, and gives her a standing in court. Her right to be heard being thus established she may file all proper exceptions to meet the justice and equity of her case. The court thought the affidavit rather equivocal in averring her interest. It may be admitted that it is not drawn with commendable precision; yet we think there is a substantial averment of interest. In fact that she was a daughter and heir of the decedent was not questioned.</p>

She was a married woman. Her husband assumed to execute it under a power of attorney from her. The certificate of acknowledgment of that power is not made in the form required by the Act of Assembly to pass the real estate of a married woman. It merely certifies to her identity, and that “she acknowledged the execution thereof to be her free act and deed.” It does not declare that she was examined separate and apart from her husband; nor that she executed it without any coercion or compulsion from him; nor that it was either read to her, or that the contents thereof were made known to her. These facts should be substantially stated when the wife unites with her husband in conveying her lands to another. With stronger reason should they be required when the husband attempts to convey his wife’s land under a power of attorney to himself. A married -woman lacks capacity to convey her real estate otherwise than in the manner prescribed by the statute: Rumfelt <em>v. </em>Clemens, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20455" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wright 455">10 Wright 455</a>; Dunham <em>v. </em>Wright, 3 P. F. Smith 167; Brown <em>v. </em>Bennett, 25 Id. 420; Innes <em>v. </em>Templeton, Pitts. Leg. Jour., of October 20th 1880, p. 73. It is true this rule does not apply to a sale or transfer of a wife’s personal estate; nor to her receipt of money. The 4th section of the Act of 11th April 1856, Purd. Dig. 1009, declares, when a married woman shall be entitled to a legacy or to a distributive share of the personal estate, or of the proceeds of the real estate of a deceased person, it shall be competent for her, either in person or by attorney, to sign, seal and deliver a refunding bond, in pursuance of the Act of Assembly in such ca,se made and provided ; and also to execute all such other instruments, and to perform all such other acts as may by law be necessary to be done, or may be lawfully required by the executor or administrator upon the payment to her of the moneys to be distributed as aforesaid, with the same effect in binding her separate estate as if she was a feme sole. The object of this act is not to give a married woman <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>general powers, nor the power to transact business generally, but to bind herself by such acts and instruments as may be necessary, or be lawfully required by the executors or administrators “upon the payment to her, of the money to be distributed.” It is to protect them and give them a legal voucher for what they have actually paid to her. This receipt was not given to the administrators. It does not recite the payment of any money by them. No account had been settled showing her distributive share. It shows no authority for Pomeroy Bros. to act for the administrators. In fact it was not treated as a voucher for money ’paid by them; but it appears to have been treated by them and by the court as an assignment to Pomeroy Bros, of her portion of the estate. This, as is held in Buchanan et al. <em>v. </em>Buchanan, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20186" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Wright 186">10 Wright 186</a>, is the assumption of a power not intended to be given by the Act of 1856, cited. It does not appear in the case that any of the money mentioned in the receipt actually reached the hands of the appellant.</p>

The exceptions raise questions of fact to be ascertained by evidence to be taken. Whenever exceptions to the account of an administrator are filed by one interested it is made the duty of the court, by the Act of 14th April 1835, Purd. Dig. 445, to decide whether the matters contested call for a reference to an auditor, and if they do, to appoint one or more. The court did not decide that the contested matters averred in the exceptions did not call for a reference, and it is very clear they did ; but that the appellant had no such standing in the case as to permit her to make the inquiry. In 'this the learned judge erred.</p>
