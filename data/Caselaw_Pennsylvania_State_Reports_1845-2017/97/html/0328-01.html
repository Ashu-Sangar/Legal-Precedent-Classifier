Keppelman was elected clerk of select council of the city of Reading, and the oath of office was administered to and subscribed by him. By an ordinance of the select and common councils of the city of Reading, approved December 24th 1875, it is ordained that “the clerk of the select council shall" be ex officio city clerk, and secretary of the joint standing and special committees of councilsand by an Act of Assembly, approved March 21st 1865, it is enacted that the clerk of the select council of the city o.f Reading shall be ex officio secretary of the board of commissioners of water. When Keppelman attempted to enter upon his duties, and to hold and exercise the said offices, he was obstructed and prevented by one Edward A. Howell, the former incumbent, upon the ground that Keppelman’s bond and sureties had not been approved by councils. Keppelman, thereupon, instituted proceedings by quo .warranto against Howell in the Common Pleas of Berks county, and on <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>June 18th 1879, the said court entered judgment of ouster against Howell, and Keppelman was thereupon installed in his said offices, and has since continued to perform the duties thereof. Howell sued out a writ of error to remove the proceedings in said quo warranto suit to the Supreme Court, to July Term 1879, No. 65 (see <em>post, </em>p. 328), which writ was pending and undetermined at the lime of these proceedings in the court below. Howell had exercised the duties of the offices until he w-as ousted on June 18th 1879, and the salary for the month of April 1879, had been paid to him. Keppelman presented to the city controller warrants for his salary as city clerk, and secretary of the water board, for the months of April and May 1879, which the controller refused to countersign upon the following grounds : 1. Because Howell, and not Runkle, had performed the duties of the said offices during the said months. 2. Because the salary for the month of April had been paid to Howell as city clerk, and secretary of the water board, upon warrants countersigned by the controller, whereby the appropriation for said salary for April 1879, was exhausted; and it was provided by Act of Assembly of May 23d 1874, sect. 85, that “no money shall be drawn from the treasury of the city unless the same shall have been previously appropriated by councils to the .purpose for which it is drawn.” 3. Because he was advised that the salary of the said offices follows the legal title to the same, and that so long as the title is in dispute, pending the determination of the writ of error to the quo warranto, the city of Reading is not indebted to Keppelman. 4. Because the .controller is, by the Act of Assembly creating his office, an officer elected by the people, invested with discretionary and judicial powers, which discretion he has exercised in regard to the relator’s claim by refusing to countersign the warrants. 5. Because mandamus is not the proper remedy in this case.</p>

All the requisites for invoking the high writ of mandamus existed — Keppelman had been duly elected to the office and sworn in; his legal title had been settled by a judgment of the court on quo warranto; the writ of error to that proceeding was not a supersedeas, as no recognisance was filed; and th-e councils had duly appropriated the money to pay the salary.

      <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>The court below seems to have regarded the controller of the city of Reading as a merely ministerial officer, otherwise it would not have sustained this writ of mandamus. There is no doubt but that the orders drawn by the relator in his own favor on the city treasurer were properly drawn and countersigned, so far as mere form went; but it by no means follows that he was thereby entitled to the money. Before he was so entitled, the controller must pass upon and approve them, and this, <em>not </em>as a mere ministerial officer, but as one having deliberative and discretionary powers, as the guardian and protector of the city treasury. The Act of 23d of May 1874, clothes him with judicial powers; he must not only countersign warrants drawn on the city treasury, but he is also required to pass upon their rectitude, and for this purpose he may not only make personal inquiry, hut may require the production of evidence. In other words, he must be fully satisfied : 1st. That the warrant is proper and right; that the city has received consideration therefor; and 2d. That a proper appropriation has been made to meet it. Moreover, he has authority “to administer oaths or affirmations, in verification for the demands made for his signature.”</p>

    <p id="b331-7" data-blocks='[["BL_331.7",331,[215,1446,1173,434]]]'>But the powers of county auditors are as full and complete, within their jurisdiction, as are the powers of courts. They may issue subpoenas for parties and witnesses; they may compel the production of books and papers, administer oaths, compel the attendance of witnesses, and punish contempts by attachment. With all this judicial and deliberative power, the controller of the city of Reading is clothed, and of necessity he must be left free to exercise his own judgment. But how can he exercise these important functions if he is to be controlled in his judgment by the Court of Common Pleas, or by any other court ?</p>

Had the controller refused to act in the matter at all, the court by its mandamus might have compelled him to act, but this was all it could do, but after ho had acted, and had refused to sanction the warrants, it was a mere piece of usurpation on the part of the court to attempt to compel him to revise his decision, and adopt its judgment in preference to his own.</p>

    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[270,711,1175,130]]]'>But the court was wrong, not only in treating the controller as a mere ministerial officer, but also in treating his act in rejecting the warrants as unsound and improper.</p>

The judgment is reversed.</p>
