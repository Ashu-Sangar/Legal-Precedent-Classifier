The court below conceded that the promise was obligatory while he lived, subject only to the condition of his ability to pay. All the circumstances attending the founding of the department, considered in connection with Dr. Wood’s language in his will, indicate that his agreement with the trustees was intended by him, and understood by them to be for a permanent endowment. He was sixty-eight years of age when he created this auxiliary department, and he intended to endow it with the permanent life of the university itself, not tó let it die or beg other support at his death. The only condition was, that if, during his lifetime, his own income, in the uncertainty of aifairs, should be so reduced as to prevent his making the annual appropriation “ without material personal inconvenience,” he should be relieved from the “pledge.” This contingency never happened. The trustees,, of whom Dr. Wood was one, advertised in the annual catalogue that the degrees would be conferred on those qualified “who shall have attended two full courses of lectures in the auxiliary department of medicine.” The faculty .was to be perpetual, though the. professors were to be elected annually. Dr. Wood in the 27th item of his will recited that the faculty had been <em>established </em>at his request, and his desire that it should be <em>permanently </em>established. In the 30th item he recites his engagement, his fulfilment of it during life, and directs his executors to <em>continue </em>the annual payment until the capital sum bequeathed should yield an equal income. That he recognised that the university would contract the same obligations after his death, and that his payment of them was obligatory, is shown by the order that the annual payment should not fail of being furnished, whether it came from income or principal of his estate, until the. payment over of the capital fund. In the 16th item of the first codicil, he defers distribution of his estate for a time, except payment of small legacies, “ and except also the payments necessary to <em>continue </em>those annual payments which I have for some years made <em>by agreement </em>with certain institutions,” &amp;c. He gave the endowment fund of $50,000 in order to finally fulfil his obligation and to relieve the rest of his estate from the annual payments. It is not necessary that there should have been a contract right, legally enforceable, or for breach of which damages might be recovered. The law is well settled that where funds are bequeathed, in pursuance of any legal or moral obligation on the part of the testator, or where they are impressed with a trust recognising equitable rights in others, such bequests will be supported without abatement as superior to the claims of the legatees or volunteers: Burridge <em>v. </em>Bradyl, 1 P.

In the words of gift in the first clause of section 39, no substitutionary words are used. A legacy given to one, his executory, administrators, and assigns, is not saved from lapse, because that is expressing no more than the law infers, viz., that if the legacy becomes vested by the survival of the legatee who dies before payment, it must be paid to the executors. “Representatives,” or “legal representatives,” are the equivalent of executors or administrators. To create an alternative or substitutionary gift to another party as legatee, in place of a first-named legatee, the intent must clearly appear from the words of the will: Ralston <em>v. </em>Waln, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20279" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 279">8 Wright 279</a>, 287; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Purvis, 8 S. &amp; R. 71; Patterson <em>v. </em>Hawthorne, 12 S. &amp; R. 112; 2 Williams on Executors 1084, 1085-6; Gibbons <em>v. </em>Fairlamb, 2 Casey 217. The expression “to her or her representatives,” at the close of the second clause of the 39th section, relates only to the handing over of the notes of Mrs. Chamberlin’s son, held by the testator, which Mrs. Chamberlin, or — in case she survived him but died before payment — her representatives should bo obliged to take in part settlement. To hold that Mrs. Chamberlin’s “ representatives ” take the $7500 as substitutionary legatees, by direct gift from the testator, not claiming in a representative capacity through Mrs. Chamberlin, is to re-write that clause of the will.

Ho could, without legal liability, have given notice of withdrawal any year. But there is, in any view, no evidence of any contract to extend beyond his death. No intent can be gathered from the will that the university is to be preferred to the other beneficiaries. A substantially similar provision was made by section 26, in favor of the College of Physicians, and another by section 2 of the second codicil, to his cousin, Mrs. Bacon. If the bequest to the university do not abate, neither can the latter. The testator, however, directed what the law would have implied, that in case of deficiency, all his pecuniary bequests should abate. The <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>annuities given temporarily, until payment of the principal legacy, are mere added legacies, subject, like the principal ones, to pro rata abatement.

Did he contract for such payments to be made after his death? He proposed to appropriate out of his income the annual sum of $2500, to be applied by the trustees to the support of an auxiliary faculty of professors in the medical department, stating he did so with some diffidence, as he had no right to suppose that the board could “have so much confidence in his disinterestedness or stability of purpose, as to justify them in commencing an enterprise, any misdirection or failure of which might in some measure compromise the dignity of the board,” that he made “ the appropriation conditional on his future ability to maintain it without material personal inconvenience and pledged himself, should they accept, that no trifling cause should interfere with its due fulfilment on his part. The trustees gratefully accepted, organized the faculty, and provided that the professors be appointed for one year, and reappointed annually during satisfactory service, so long as the plan for the establishment of the auxiliary faculty of medicine now adopted shall continue in operation.” They elected other professors for an indefinite period, but for this auxiliary faculty for one year. They understood that he intended himself to judge of his future ability to make the annual payments without inconvenience. His purpose was to make such payments. The trustees believed he would; and he did during his life. Both parties acted in accord with the promise contained in the proposition; but not a word in the proposition or resolutions tend to establish an agreement that he would provide for the payment of that sum, or any other, annually after his decease.</p>

If nude or for good consideration, on its face, he was under no moral or legal obligations to provide an annuity or an endowment fund. Probably he contemploted making the university a chief beneficiary of his estate; he did not promise this, and held out no reason for the trustees to expect it, other than continuous acts of generosity. His declarations in the will are evidence of <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>his own understanding of the -writings. In sect. 27, after reciting that the trustees established the faculty at his request, which he had aided by an annual payment, and that it is his “ desire that said faculty and professorships shall be permanently established,” he says: “ Therefore, for that purpose 1 give and bequeath unto the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania $50,000.” This reveals that the testator deemed the “establishing” and “ founding” of the faculty and professorships temporary, and that he desired they should bo permanent. To that end he made the bequest. Here is his first expression for a permanent endowment, not in performance of an obligation, but to accomplish a desire. In sect. 16, of a codicil of same date as the will, he enjoined his executors to pay no legacies except those less than $5000, and except also the payments necessary to continue those annual payments which he had for some years m.ade by agreement with certain institutions, in the interval before getting the principal of their legacies, until the accomplishment of his directions for putting a tract of land under cranberry culture. He says, in sect. 80 of the will, “ having heretofore engaged to pay and paid to the trustees” $2500 a year, I direct my executors to continue such payments until said legacy shall be paid, which will be without deduction from the legacy. The words “ agreement” and “ engaged to pay and paid,” following sect. 27, would fairly apply to the proposition for the temporary establishment of the faculty, and the direction to continue the yearly payments, until the legacy of $50,000 shall be paid, is a bounty in furtherance of the permanent establishment he desired. It seems very clear that the testator was not bound by a contract for such payments to be continued after his decease.</p>

A general legacy to a volunteer will not bo entitled to any exemption from abatement, on the ground of its being applied to any particular object or purpose, as where the bequest is to a wife or child, or to a charity. But if there be any valuable consideration for the testamentary gift, or the relinquishment of any right or interest, such legacy will be entitled to <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>preference of payment over other general legacies which are mere bounties. An annuity charged on the personal estate is a general legacy, and in cases of deficiency all annuities and legacies abate ratably, for since they cannot <em>^ </em>all be paid in full, they shall all abate ratably, on the principle of the maxim, “equality is equity” or “ equity delighteth in equality.” This rule is subject to exceptions, for there are cases, where some annuities and legacies are to be paid in priority to others; but the onus lies on the party seeking priority to make out that such priority was intended by clear and conclusive proof. In absence of such proof, the testator must be deemed to have considered that his estate would be sufficient, and, consequently, not to have thought it necessary to provide against a deficiency by giving priority to some of the objects of his bounty. If the chances of deficiency are anticipated and provided for by the terms of the will then the directions of the testator will govern. It is always a question of intention, and when the intent of the testator is manifest to give one general legatee priority over others that intention shall prevail. As between legacies which are in their nature mere bounties, the presumption of intended equality exists and governs, unless overcome by unequivocal evidence to the contrary. Ho priority will be allowed where the expressions of the will are ambiguous: Towle <em>v. </em>Swasey, <a href="/mass/106/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="106 Mass. 100" data-case-ids="715949" data-case-paths="/mass/106/0100-01">106 Mass. 100</a>; Miller v.

It seems plain that no conclusive proof can be furnished from the language of the will of intent to give these legacies priority over others; if there be expressions which tend to favor priority they are much too ambiguous to be relied on in support of a preference. Indeed, the intention as to all pecuniary legacies is that they shall stand on. equal footing. The testator anticipated the possibility of a deficiency, and made this provision: “ Should my estate prove'deficient to pay all the legacies, then the pecuniary legacies will abate ratably” — precisely what the law would have declared had he given no such direction. He made numerous bequests to near relatives and friends, as well as to charities, and as he expressed no particular intent as to any one of the pecuniary legacies or annuities, and all are to volunteers, they must abate proportionably in accord with the general intent.

When he intended to give the interest of a sum to one for life, and at the death of the legatee the principal to his legal representatives, he said so, as in the bequest to John Garrison. If he meant a legacy should not lapse, in case of the decease of the legatee before himself, he so directed, as when he added to the bequest to John Quin, “ if he deceased to go to his children.” Evidently, he was mindful of collateral inheritance taxes, and gave certain legacies clear of taxes. He closed the codicil of even date with his will, thus: “And should any provision of my will fail by lapse or otherwise, it is my will that all dispositions so failing shall fall into and become part of the residue of my estate, and as such to vest in the residuary legatee, under the residuary clause of my will.” Surely, he contemplated the probability of lapse of some of the numerous legacies.</p>

The clause directs that her son’s indebtedness, whatsoever it may be, shall be so much paid on account of said legacy, and the notes handed to her or her representatives.</p>

Is it the general and particular accuracy of language in every other part ? A testator may prevent a legacy from lapsing; but to effect this object he must declare, either expressly or in terms from which it can be collected with sufficient clearness, what person or persons he intended to substitute for the legatee dying in his lifetime: 2 Williams on Ex’rs 1210. This legacy is to Mrs. Chamberlin, not to her son, or her representatives. An advancement on account of the legacy, made in her lifetime, will not prevent a lapse. We are of opinion that the terms of this will, instead of showing the testator’s intention to prevent a lapse of the legacy to Mrs. Chamberlin, in case of her death before his, show that in such event he intended said legacy, or so much <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>of it as had not been advanced, should fall into and become a part of the residue of his estate.</p>
