    <p id="b440-8" data-blocks='[["BL_440.10",440,[273,1176,1178,904]]]'>The equitable demand of the plaintiff in the judgment is unquestioned. The defence which it is now alleged the wife might have successfully made rested on her personal privilege, which she did not interpose. She suffered judgment to be entered against herself and her husband jointly. They were satisfied to let it stand. They voluntarily gave security to obtain the benefit of a stay of execution. The bail voluntarily assumed the liability whereby he delayed the plaintiff for nine months in collecting the judgment. At the expiration of that time his liability became fixed. . The terms of his recognizance bound him to pay it. The legal requirements of the statute commanded him to pay it. It has not been reversed or vacated. The naked averment in the affidavit that the judgment is absolutely void, is the expression of an opinion which is wholly insufficient to prevent judgment being entered in this case. No fact is stated showing its invalidity as against the husband. Suppose it should be proved to be void as against the wife by reason of her personal disability, it nevertheless remains in full force against her husband: Unangst <em>v. </em>Fitler, 3 Norris 135; Hope <em>v. </em>Building Association, not yet reported; Leonard <em>v. </em>Duffin, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%20155" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 155">9 W.
