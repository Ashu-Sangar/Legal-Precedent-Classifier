There was no agreement that B. should not make actual delivery of the stock he was instructed to sell. B. sold accordingly, and afterwards the price rose. B. then borrowed from a fellow broker the necessary certificates to make delivery, and did deliver them and receive payment therefor through his clearing-house sheet. The price still rising, B. subsequently bought on A.’s order five hundred like shares to make good his loan, receiving them and paying for them also through his clearing-house sheet. He paid also to the lender the amount of an intermediate dividend on the stock. In an action by B. against A. to recover the amount expended for A.’s use in those transactions: <em>Held, </em>that the facts disclosed stamped the transaction as a mere gambling contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, which was contrary to the policy of the law, and that therefore the former was not entitled to recover.</p>

He testified that he was a member of the Philadelphia Board of Brokers, and a personal friend of the defendant Dickson; that on June 17th 1874, he received from defendant, in the reading room of the Philadelphia Club, a verbal order to sell short on his account five hundred shares of stock in the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. That he did accordingly, in pursuance of this order, sell, at the Board of Brokers the next day, June 18th 1874, four hundred shares of the stock at $48|, and one hundred shares at $49, seller’s option, fifteen days. That at the expiration of fifteen days he delivered the stock and received the money for it; that in order to effect this delivery he had borrowed the certificates from another party. That the price rising, he had, on November 6th 1874, in order to make good the borrowed shares bought at the board on defendant’s order five hundred shares of the stock at $52-f. That in addition to the difference between the amount paid for these and the amount received from the sale of the former shares to which extent he was out of pocket, he had been obliged to pay to the lender of the shares delivered $1250, being the amount of a dividend declared in the meantime upon them; and further, that while this transaction was running he had had frequent conversations with defendant, asking him sometimes for margins, which defendant, however, failed to deposit. On cross-examination plaintiff explained that he had not given and received checks for the shares of stock bought and sold by him, but that he had paid and received the purchase-money through his clearinghouse sheet.

If, however, you pass that point by believing that a contract was entered into, then you will inquire whether the contract was a wager, or one of a gambling nature, and if you do find that it was such, then you will render a verdict for the defendant, for the law does not open the doors of its tribunals to aid gamblers. Whatever form, whatever guise, the transaction may assume is of no consequence. If it is a gambling transaction, then the parties must settle all such transactions outside of the tribunals of justice, because those transactions are opposed to the law of the land, and we do not open these tribunals to hear litigation, or give attention to parties whose contentions and disputations are based on illegalities.

      <em>“ </em>This is the law of this case. There was a distinction supposed by my brother, Judge Thayer, the president of this court, that where the party was simply the agent or broker, and even if he knew that the transaction was one of a gambling character or nature, yet, if he advanced the money for the principal, he might, notwithstanding, recover. [That was his view at the time; and I am not sure that, after all, it will not be declared to be the law, for the case that went to the Supreme Court was very obscure.] It was the thought of the profession up to that time; and it is still the law of England from which we draw the purest law that is administered in this country. They study the analogies, and they study the propositions of law; and they are so learned, and so able, that we do honor to ourselves by taking their precedents, because they are so well considered that it would create a wonderful vacuum if we would reject the adjudication of tribunals as high and as learned as those. When we refer to them as the English law, we refer simply to the source from which we can safely draw our precedents. They take our own, and they have taken, in one respect, the entire Pennsylvania code; and they have done us that honor with regard to the reforms that have been established with reference to equity proceedings.</p>

And, gentlemen, we are always bound to take the decisions of the Supreme Court. I take its decision personally and judicially, and swallow it without a grimace or question. I do not pretend to say that that tribunal is wrong, as some judges seem to think. I believe they are not wrong; and I have no fault to find with them. There must be a point where all contentions and controversies shall be settled and determined, for public peace and public policy demand it; and that is the place for such determination. However, I take their decisions whether right or wrong, although the pre<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>sumption is that they are right; and in this ease to which I have referred, and which they decided while a motion for a new trial was pending in this particular issue, they laid down this doctrine: that where, perhaps, one man loans money to another to go into a gambling operation, if he hands the money over to the receiver or operator, and does nothing more, he may recover the money back, because he is not an agent in the transaction ; but where the man becomes an active party in executing the illegal transaction, as, for instance, if ho advances the money, and plays with it for the account of the lender, and loses it, there he becomes so identified and mixed up with the transaction that he cannot then call upon the party to pay, because he executes the gambling contract. Now, the analogies between that aspect of that case and this are, that Mr. Thomas must have known that this was a gambling venture, because, first, he not only lost his money, but, second, he was the very party to carry into effect this transaction, and he himself was the very party who executed it. Therefore, according to this very decision of the Supreme Court, you must, if you believe this a gambling transaction, find a verdict for the defendant, because Mr. Thomas is directly within its range, and principle, and decision, because he was the man that absolutely executed the alleged gambling transaction, or contract, or venture.”</p>

Nevertheless, he says, when he sold these five hundred shares, he delivered them. This anomalous kind of testimony he explains by saying that this delivery was made on the clearing-house sheet, which means a mere settlement of differences.
