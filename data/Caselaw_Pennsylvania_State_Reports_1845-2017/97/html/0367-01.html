Judgment was thereupon entered against the garnishee for said shares. Subsequently the court, on the petition of B.’s assignee in bankruptcy under proceedings instituted subsequent to the attachment, opened the judgment, on the ground that plaintiff had not filed an affidavit and recognisance, as required by the terms of the Act of June 16th 1836, sect. 32, Pamph.

      <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 Harris 148; Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Evans, 3 P. F. Smith 250. The attachment bound the 180 shares owned by the defendant, as 'well as the two shares standing in his name. The bond required by the Act of 1836, in the case of stock “ held in another name,” is for the indemnity of the real owner, if it appear that the stock does not really belong to the defendant. When Lewis S. Russell delivered the certificates to Chauncey S. Russell, with a blank transfer or power of attorney to transfer endorsed, the former ceased to hold the stock in his own name. If a bond had been given, he could have maintained no action upon it. In his answer he denied that he held any stock, in trust or otherwise, for Chauncey S. Russell. A transfer on the books of the company would have been merely a formal act, for the information or protection of the company, and wmuld not have affected the ownership, which was already vested in Chauncey S. Russell. Stock in a corporation is a chose in action, the title to which is transferred by endoi-sement and delivery of the certificate; as between vendor and vendee, transfer on the books of the company is unnecessary: German Union Assoc. <em>v. </em>Sendmeyer, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Wright 67">14 Wright 67</a>; Finney’s Appeal, 9 P.

Russell, on the 5th of May 1879, upon the following special plea: “And the said Towanda Gas and Water Company, one of the defendant garnishees aforesaid, by II. Streeter, its president, says that since the filing of the company’s answers to the interrogatories exhibited to the said company in this case, the said defendant, Chauncey S. Russell, has acknowledged and stated to said company that he was the owner of one hundred and eighty (180) shares of the capital stock of said company, standing on the books of said company in the name of Lewis S.

And, therefore, the said company pleads <em>nulla </em>bona, except as to the aforesaid one hundred and eighty-two shares of said stock, so owned and held as aforesaid, by the said defendant, Ohauncey S. Russell.”</p>
    <p id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.6",370,[297,804,1186,1209]]]'>All this seems to be very plain and straightforward; and though one hundred and eighty shares of this stock stood in the name of Lewis S. Russell, yet, as the certificates had been duly assigned by him to Ohauncey, Ohauncey was the sole owner and claimant; there was no person, natural or artificial, to dispute his right. Nevertheless, the court, on the motion of Henry Streeter, assignee in bankruptcy of C. S. Russell, on the 27th of September 1880, opened this judgment, struck out the one hundred and eighty shares which formerly -were supposed to belong to L. S. Russell, an&lt;[ re-entered judgment for tw.o shares only. To this action, the court was led, by the impression that the writ, having been issued without the affidavit and bail required by the 32d section of the Act of 1836, was void, and this for the reason that this stock stood on the books of the company in the name of Lewis S. Russell. In support of this conclusion, Eby <em>v. </em>Guest, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.N.C.%20467" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 W.N.C. 467">8 W. N. C. 467</a>, was relied on. But neither the statute, nor the case cited, will bear any such construction. An examination of the statute will show that the affidavit and recognisance are required only when the stock is held in another name than that of the real owner, and that the recognisance is intended for the protection of the person or corporation claiming adversely to the alleged ownership of the defendant. But if there be no such claimant; if there is no one to dispute the defendant’s right, then, by the 34th section of said act, the writ may issue without either affidavit or recognisance. And an examination of Eby <em>v. </em>Guest, will show that the 32d section was held to apply in that case, because the attached stock was held and claimed as collateral security by the Enterprise, Saving, Loan and Building Association of Pottstown.</p>

The garnishee admits that it has no claim, and it is agreed by the parties that at the time the writ was served Lewis S. Russell had assigned the certificates to Ohauncey. Hence he had no claim. Indeed, it is further admitted that he never was the real owner, but held only as trustee for Ohauncey. Certainly, then, if-these stocks did not belong to the defendant — if they were not held in his name, they were held by and belonged to no one. To what purpose, then, would have been an affidavit, since no <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>one was disputing the defendant’s ownership ? and to what purpose a recognisance, seeing there was no adverse claimant ?</p>
