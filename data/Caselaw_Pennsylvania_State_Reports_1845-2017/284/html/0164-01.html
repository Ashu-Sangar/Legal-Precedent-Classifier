One paragraph of his will says: “I give and bequeath unto my niece, Sarah Booth, the sum of $2000.” Similar pecuniary gifts, in varying amounts, are made to other relatives, and his residuary estate is directed “to be divided among the above named legatees pro rata.” Mrs. Booth died before testator, without descendants, but leaving to survive her an adopted son, the appellant here. For the purposes of this appeal, we will assume, without deciding the point, that the deed by which he was adopted, is sufficient to vest in him all the statutory rights given to adopted children. On the settle<a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>ment of testator’s estate, appellant claimed that the legacies to Mrs. Booth did not lapse, but were payable to him because of the acts of assembly hereinafter quoted. The court below disagreed with this contention, and rejected his claim. Our conclusion is the same.</p>

L. 403, 408-, specifies the circumstances under which legacies will be held to be effective, although the legatee has predeceased the testator. So far as concerns the present controversy, clause (b) is the only applicable provision, and it stipulates as follows: “Where any testator shall not leave any lineal descendants who would receive the benefit of any lapsed or void devise or legacy, no devise or legacy made in favor of a brother or sister, or of brothers or sisters, of such testator, or in favor of the children of a brother or sister of such testator, whether such brothers or sisters, or children of brothers or Sisters, be designated by name or as a class, shall be deemed or held to lapse or become void by reason of the decease of such devisee or legatee in the lifetime of the testator, if such devisee or legatee shall leave <em>issue </em>surviving the testator; but such devise or legacy shall be good and available in favor of such surviving <em>issue, </em>with like effect as if such devisee or legatee had survived the testator, unless the testator shall in the will direct otherwise.” Two things clearly appear from a consideration of this paragraph: (1) it does not declare an intestacy, in case a legatee predeceases the testator, and then state who shall take, but only substitutes the issue of the named legatee, as the one entitled to take <em>under the will, </em>“unless the testator shall in the will direct otherwise”; and (2), considering this statute by itself, appellant is not helped, for it does not even suggest that, for purposes of distribution, he shall be treated as other than what he in fact is, — an “issue” of his <em>natural </em>parents only. Recognizing this, he alleges that his claim is sustained by the Act of May 28, 1915, <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>P.

    <p id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[129,1005,1154,1411]],["BL_192.1",192,[288,341,1151,697]]]'>Nor is section 16(b) of the Intestate Act of 1917, which specifies as follows: “The person adopted shall, for all purposes of inheritance and taking by devolution, be a member of the family of the adopting parent or parents. The adoptive relatives of the person adopted shall be entitled to inherit and take from and through such person, to the exclusion of his or her natural parents, grandparents, and collateral relatives; but the surviving spouse of such adopted person, and the children and descendants of such adopted person, shall have all his, her, and their respective rights under this act. Adopted persons shall not be entitled to inherit or take from or through their natural parents, grandparents, or collateral relatives, but each adopted person shall have all his or her rights under this act in the estates of his or her spouse, children and descendants.” Aside from all other considerations, if we were to sustain appellant’s contention as to the meaning af the paragraph, we would be compelled also to hold that this construction makes it unconstitutional, and hence he could not recover under it. The title of the statute is: “An Act relating to the descent and distribution of the real and personal property of persons dying intestate; and to provide for the recording and registering of the decrees of the orphans’ court in connection therewith, and the fees therefor.” Appellant’s claim is that, because of <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>the portion of the statute quoted, he may take part in the “distribution of the real and personal property of [one not] dying intestate.” To so construe the provision would result in a violation of article III, section 3, of the Constitution of the State, since that subject is not “clearly [or indeed at all] expressed in its title”: Spangler’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="281 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1087046" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0118-01">281 Pa. 118</a>. Our duty is, therefore, to so interpret it, if possible, as to make it constitutional (Fluke v. Lang, <a href="/pa/283/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="283 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1090548" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0054-01">283 Pa. 54</a>) and this we may do, by holding that it has no relation to property disposed of by will, but only to that passing under the intestate laws.

In Com. v. Powel, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20W.N.C.%20297" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="16 W.N.C. 297">16 W. N.

In Burnett’s Est., <a href="/pa/219/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="219 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1002781" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0599-01">219 Pa. 599</a>, it was held that an adopted child could not inherit from the collateral kindred of adopting parents; a state of the law altered by the Act of May 28, 1915, P.

Hammell, <a href="/pa/236/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="236 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="986728" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0305-01">236 Pa. 305</a>, it was held that the adoption of a child after making a will did not avoid the will as to such child.
