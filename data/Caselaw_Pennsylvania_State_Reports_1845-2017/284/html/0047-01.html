Faust against the defendant in these cases, he agreed with them that, if they would discontinue the suit, he would, inter alia, pay an outstanding indebtedness of $36,000,i — which plaintiffs owed to certain financial institutions, and which was secured by a second mortgage, of doubtful value, on certain property of the Kriner Realty Company, — in one of three ways, (a) “he would endeavor to place a mortgage upon the lands of the Kriner Realty Company of sufficient amount to pay and discharge said notes; or, if <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>that could not be done, (b) he would endeavor to sell the lands of the Kriner Realty Company......for a price satisfactory to the company, and out of the money realized from the sale would pay the notes; or (c) he would himself purchase the said lands of the Kriner Realty Company at a price satisfactory to the company and pay the notes.” In accordance with this agreement Walter and Faust discontinued their New York suit (which was for a much larger amount than the liability assumed by defendant), but he only partially complied with his promise. For some time after the settlement was made, he tried ineffectually to mortgage or sell the property referred to; on his ultimate failure to do so, the parties, liable on each note, brought a separate suit in their own names, claiming that the agreement of compromise had been made for their benefit.</p>
    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[306,1189,1153,859]]]'>There were six such suits. One was by Emanuel Tasin, W. W. Robertson, L. S. Walter, J. H. Reed, K. I. Hopwood, B. W. Kriner, and J. H. Bird against defendant, was tried before a jury, verdict and judgment were entered in favor of plaintiffs, and the judgment was affirmed by this court: Tasin v. Bastress, <a href="/pa/268/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="268 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1061539" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0085-01">268 Pa. 85</a>. As between the parties to it, the judgment therein conclusively determined that the agreement above referred to was made for the benefit of those liable on the $36,000 of notes, that the suit was on one of these notes, and that defendant breached his agreement. These conclusions of fact thus became res adjudicata in all other actions between the same parties, growing out of the same subject-matter. The present suits are upon the rest of the obligations which defendant promised to pay in consideration of the compromise of the New York suit.</p>
    <p id="b74-7" data-blocks='[["BL_74.6",74,[306,2059,1149,317]],["BL_75.1",75,[130,342,1155,1084]]]'>In three of them, all the plaintiffs therein were, with others, also plaintiffs in the suit which was affirmed by this court. Under such circumstances, no reason exists why res adjudicata should not conclusively determine the rights of the litigants in these three suits, if, as is admittedly the case, the obligations sued on were also <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>part of the $36,000. It is not necessary that exactly the same parties shall appear in both cases; it is sufficient if all those in the later case were parties in the former one. In 15 E. C. L. 1012, where the applicable rule of law is tersely stated, it is said: “While in order that a judgment may operate as res judicata there must be identity of parties in the two proceedings, yet it is not generally deemed essential that all the parties to. both proceedings be identical, and a judgment is conclusive of the issue involved in a controversy as between the parties and those standing in privity with them, although in the action in which it is pleaded some only of the parties are litigants.” Among the cases, cited as supporting this conclusion, are Thompson v. Eoberts, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Howard%20233" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="24 Howard 233">24 Howard 233</a>, 241, and Green v.

S. 478</a>, in the first of which it is well said that “A contrary doctrine would sacrifice a wholesome principle of law to a mere technical rule having no foundation in reason: making a distinction where there is no difference.” To the same effect is Follansbee v. Walker, <a href="/pa/74/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="74 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1034703" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0306-01">74 Pa. 306</a>.</p>

A great diversity of opinion exists, as to what extent, if at all, res adjudicata applies in that class of cases. In 34 C. J. 996, the conclusion reached, as the result of a consideration of the numerous cases cited in the foot notes, is stated as follows: “Where both the party offering a judgment as an estoppel and the party against whom it is so offered were parties to the action in which the judgment was rendered, it is no objection that the action included some additional parties who are not joined in the present suit, or that there are additional parties in the present action. But this does not make the judgment admissible as evidence either for or against parties to the pending action, who were not parties to the action in which it was rendered. And the estoppel arising from a judgment does not apply in a subsequent suit where a new plaintiff comes in, <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>seeking to litigate matters not determined in the former suit, although otherwise the parties are the same.”</p>
    <p id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[290,450,1153,1077]]]'>If the qualifying clause, — “seeking to litigate matters not determined in the former suit,” — were omitted, as, on principle we think it should have been, we would have the exact situation appearing here. If the new plaintiff is a mere nominal party, not personally interested in the litigation, res adjudicata applies, for the benefit of the real parties, whether the matters adjudicated were or were not contested in the former suit, if they could have been there litigated and would, in that event, have controlled the result. In the particular appeal now under consideration, plaintiffs’ action is a joint one; all must recover on it, or it must wholly fail. The statement of claim alleges a liability of defendant to all the plaintiffs. Under these circumstances, no evidence is admissible which does not tend to prove the joint liability, and the record in the prior suit does not do this. It follows that as to this fourth case, now under consideration, and as to the fifth, where the sole plaintiff was not a party to the original suit, res adjudicata does not apply, and the question of liability is at large.</p>

Indeed, in the absence of fraud, which was neither averred nor proved, no evidence should have been admitted on this point, since the purpose of compromising a doubtful or unliquidated claim, is to avoid a litigation of the issue raised in the suit which was compromised, and hence the settlement of that suit furnishes ample consideration for the new agreement (13 C. J. 349; Miller’s Est., <a href="/pa/279/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="279 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1083460" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0030-01">279 Pa. 30</a>; Tasin v.

Because of this conclusion, he entered judgment for defendant in three of the cases, where neither Walter nor Faust appeared as plaintiffs, and, in the other two, where Walter was a plaintiff but Faust was not, he added the name of the latter, struck out the names of all the other parties except Walter, and then entered judgments in those two suits in favor of Walter and Faust. This action was taken by the trial judge, of his own motion, in the absence of and without the request of any of the parties, and without giving defendant an opportunity to be heard. While a court may, and, when justice requires it, should suggest amendments of the record, it had no right where, as here, the parties are sui juris and not wards of the court, to itself make such amendments, without a request of some of the parties interested, and not even then, without giving the opposite party a hearing. The litigation belongs to the parties and not to the court; the latter may sustain or dismiss it, under the pleadings filed and proofs submitted by -them, but- beyond this he cannot properly go, without an application or consent, so long as the parties are legally competent to act for themselves. Defendant assigns as error the action of the court in making the amendments in the way it did, hnd this complaint must be sustained.</p>

True, in most of them it was assumed, or the fact was that a fund was left in the hands of the particular defendant, to enable him to pay the obligations for which he thus became liable; but this did not make the plaintiffs in <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>those cases other than strangers to both the contract and the consideration moving to the defendants. Indeed, if the conclusion of the court below is correct, it would be difficult to find cases in which the beneficiary would be allowed to sue, for he is always a stranger to the contract, and, if he furnishes the consideration moving to the promisor, then the promise may well be said to have been made to the promisee, as agent of the beneficiary, thus, in legal effect, being made to the beneficiary himself : Hubbert v. Borden, <a href="/whart/6/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="6 Whart. 79" data-case-ids="1836965" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0079-01">6 Wh. 79</a>.</p>

Quite generally, the subject-matter has been divided into two classes, (1) where the beneficiary is a donee, the promisee being under no legal liability to him; and (2) where the beneficiary is a creditor of the promisee, in which case the fulfillment of the promise would relieve the promisee of his obligation to pay the beneficiary. In some courts of last resort, different rules are applied in the two classes of cases, but there are, at the present time, only a few jurisdictions which hold that the donee beneficiary cannot sue in his own name: Corbin’s American Edition of Anson on Contracts, page 339; 1 Willis-ton on Contracts, section 368. The reason for this conclusion rests in the fact that, as the promisee would lose nothing by a breach of the contract, he could never recover more than nominal damages, and, hence, if the beneficiary could not sue, the promisor could retain the fruits of the contract without fulfilling its obligations. In view of this it necessarily follows that where, as here, the beneficiary is the only one who can be substantially benefited by such a promise, he should be allowed to recover in some form of action, (Kountz v. Holthouse, <a href="/pa/85/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="85 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="440464" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0235-01">85 Pa. 235</a>; Hostetter v.

    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[302,771,1153,1338]]]'>Turning then to the records, we find that they are barren of either averment or proof that Walter and Faust were liable to these plaintiffs for the indebtedness defendant agreed to pay. True, he asserts over and over again, in each of his elaborate affidavits of defense (which cover about 94 printed pages each), that Walter and Faust were <em>morally </em>liable to plaintiffs, but the reasonable inference from these statements is that he could not properly assert that there was a <em>legal </em>liability. It is true, also, that Walter is one of the beneficiaries in several of the cases, but he cannot, as an individual, be a creditor of himself as an individual, and there is no pretence that he was acting in any other capacity. Moreover, he was not a creditor of himself and Faust jointly, —which defendant avers, and the court below finds, was the only capacity in which the two acted, and would have been the sole basis of recovery if, as promisees, they had sued on the agreement. Blymire v. Boistle, <a href="/watts/6/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="6 Watts 182" data-case-ids="1846089" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0182-01">supra,</a> and the other authorities relied on by the court below, were creditor beneficiary cases, in which the promisee, by the fulfillment of the promise made to him, would be relieved from his obligation to the beneficiaries, and, therefore, had a real financial interest to enforce against the promisor, if the agreement to pay the beneficiaries was breached.</p>

In this State, we <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>have usually adopted the other view, but a movement in accordance with the general opinion would seem to be at least foreshadowed by Brill v. Brill, <a href="/pa/282/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="282 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1088340" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0276-01">282 Pa. 276</a>. In that case, the mother of a boy and its alleged father (this relation being somewhat “cautiously” questioned by the latter, with the result that “the element of consideration in the supposed love and affection of a father for his.child is eliminated from the case”) entered into an agreement by which the latter was, at intervals, to pay to the former, stipulated sums of money, a specific part of which was to be for the mother’s benefit, and another specific part for the education and support of the boy. Subsequently, the mother, for a valuable consideration, paid to her by the alleged father, executed and delivered to him a release from all liability, as well to the boy as to herself. Later, the boy, by his next friend, sued on the agreement, and was permitted to recover because it thereby appeared that, so far as concerned the sums to be paid for the boy, they were <em>primarily </em>for his benefit, and hence it was proper to bring the suit in his own name, though the contract, made by the mother, was in relief of her duty to educate and support her illegitimate son, and hence she had a direct personal interest in it. The fear suggested in the argument of that case, and in the opinions in other creditor beneficiary cases, that to hold the latter entitled to sue in his own name, might unjustly subject the promisor to two suits, since the promisee has a personal interest in the payment to be made, and hence ought to be entitled to enforce it, is more imaginary than real. If the rule of Brill v. Brill, <a href="/pa/282/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="282 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1088340" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0276-01">supra,</a> is applied, the courts will always decide, from the agreement and the attending circumstances, who was <em>primarily </em>intended to be benefited by it, and, as they so determine, will sustain or defeat the claim, no matter which of the parties brings the suit: 6 R. C. L. 886, 887. Of course, in this class of cases, presumptively the agreement is made for the benefit of the promisee, but if it clearly appears that the beneficiary <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>was the one primarily to be benefited, there is no substantial reason why it should not be so adjudged. It is usually conceded, — though possibly not universally,— that if a promise expressly says the payment is to be made to the beneficiary, he can sue upon it, even though its fulfillment would also benefit the promisee. There would seem to be no valid reason why this should not be the case also, if the true construction of the agreement leads to the same end, even though it may not be so plainly expressed.</p>

Doubtless those reasons will receive due consideration, whenever, if at all, it becomes necessary to take them into account. The records, as they now exist, convince us that the vital points, upon which we have shown the decision of the cases turns, were not adequately presented to the trial judge; and it may be that defendant did not produce some of the evidence, available for his defense, because it was not then necessary to do so.
