The husband was legally liable for her support, and possessed of ample means with which to provide the same. At the suggestion of his father, an arrangement was entered into to effect this end, and certain shares of stock were deposited with a trustee, the income derived to be applied for the use of plaintiff. It was anticipated that $3,200 a year would be realized, and it was agreed that if the dividends received, after the transfer of the stock, should be in a less amount, stipulated payments would be made by the husband. Prior to the making of the agreement, now the subject of controversy, Mrs. Miller employed an attorney to apply for a divorce, and shortly thereafter a libel was filed, which was followed by the entry of a final decree some months later. Thereupon, the stock referred to was handed over to the plaintiff. No dividends were declared, and the defendant paid the monthly amount agreed upon until January, 1923, and thereafter a small sum. This suit was brought to recover instalments due from that time, as stipulated in the writing of March 12,1913.</p>

This legal position was sustained by the court below, and judgment entered for the defendant. We are now asked to review the conclusion reached, and do so, having in mind that all material facts averred in the statement shall, for present purposes, be taken as provable, and the benefit of reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom must be given the plaintiff. It is also to be remembered that any doubt existing, as to the right to summary judgment, shall be resolved in her favor: Rhodes v.

      <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>The contract in dispute sets forth the purpose of the wife to immediately apply for an absolute divorce, and that the husband recognized his legal liability to her for support and maintenance. There follows the provision for the transfer of the stock, before mentioned, to one named, “to be by him held in trust for [the husband] until such time as [his] said wife procures an absolute divorce from [him], within the next eight months, succeeding the date hereof, when and at which time he shall transfer and assign the same to [his] .wife absolutely.” It is further stipulated that if no divorce is obtained, the securities shall be returned to the settlor, and the agreement also sets forth the understanding as to the amount to be paid if the stock be given to the wife and dividends thereon remain unpaid. Plaintiff avers in the statement filed that this arrangement was made solely to obtain reasonable maintenance, and fixed a sum less than could have been secured from a court of competent jurisdiction, either in a proceeding for nonsupport, or as alimony. It is further claimed, the stipulation referring to a divorce was merely incidental, and was in no way dishonestly entered into for the purpose of facilitating the granting of a decree, or to assure that an application to the court would remain unopposed. In the opinion filed below, it is said that the writing alone must control, and since there was no suggestion of fraud, accident, or mistake in its execution, parol evidence to explain the Understanding of the parties was inadmissible. The plaintiff asserts there was no collusion to secure a divorce, and that the facts averred disclose the intention of the parties, negativing the existence of any such purpose, and therefore the contract cannot be properly construed to be one having for its end the performance of an act opposed to public policy, and, as a result, unenforceable.</p>

Eshleman, <a href="/pa/46/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="46 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="420589" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0420-01">46 Pa. 420</a>), and to establish that the arrangement entered into was legally permissible: Overton v. Tracy, 14 S. &amp; R. 311, 330; M’Kean v. Wagenblast, <a href="/grant/2/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="2 Grant 462" data-case-ids="227682,227749" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0462-01,/grant/2/0462-02">2 Grant 462</a>. As was said in Kuhn v. Buhl, <a href="/pa/251/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="251 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1019785" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0348-01">supra, p. 373</a> (quoting from 21 A. &amp; E. Ene. (2d ed.) 1099): “Where a written instrument is attacked upon the ground that the contract is offensive to law and violative of public policy, the whole transaction should be inquired into.” Each case must be governed in some degree by its own circumstances: Irvin v. Irvin, <a href="/pa/169/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="169 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="870681" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0529-01">supra, p. 545</a>. The words used in a writing do not necessarily control: 13 O. J. 509. “There can be no doubt that the court may look beyond the form into which the parties have cast their contract......In determining the real character of a contract, courts will always look to its purpose” (6 R. C. L. 836), and will find this from a consideration of the written instrument in its entirety, keeping in mind the preliminary negotiations leading to its execution: 6 R. O. L. 837, 839; 13 C. J. 542. In considering the writing, where two interpretations are possible, or the words used may be deemed either as evidence of a valid ór legal purpose, or the contrary, the former construction will be accepted: 13 C. J. 539. The mere fact that the evidence offered is in writing does not necessarily justify the court in conclusively determining its meaning. If unaffected by parol evidence, it is within the province of the court to interpret it, but where the question is not on the interpretation of the writing, but <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>on its effect as evidence of a collateral fact, it is to be submitted to the jury: Reynolds v. Richards, <a href="/pa/14/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="14 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="405927" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0205-01">14 Pa. 205</a>.</p>

If this can be satisfactorily done, a recovery may be had, otherwise the defendant must prevail in his contention.</p>
