During the period of occupancy, the company, by agreement, made annual payments to the county for the use of the bridge. In 1922, the latter determined to replace the old bridge by a wholly new one of concrete, which was intended and designed for street railway, pedestrian and vehicular use. On its completion, plaintiff company proceeded to use the new bridge, and filed the present bill,,to restrain the county from interfering with the laying of its tracks and the operation of its cars thereon; and, under authority of Reading City Passenger Ry.
