In 1919, it desired to increase the plant, and entered into negotiations with a corporation at Norristown for the purchase of additional equipment. No satisfactory arrangements could be made as to payment, and a salesman, Schmidt, the present plaintiff, agreed to buy what was needed, with the verbal understanding that he should retain title. The purchase price was paid by him, and the fifteen knitting machines were then ordered to be consigned directly to the company, and were received by it. At the time, part were marked with permanent tags, showing the name of the “owner and lessor,” and, later, the remaining ones were so identified. The actual delivery was on June 5th of the year mentioned, but no formal lease was drawn up until July 30th following, and it seems not to have been executed by the company until about two weeks later. It called for certain payments every two months, and they were made on four occasions, at the rate stipulated. An additional sum was credited on the back of the written agreement, but this apparently was to cover the cost of other machinery not included in the lease now in question. After providing for a definite rental, with the right on the part of the owner to retake possession on failure to pay, it was agreed that, upon full compliance with the stipulated terms, a bill of sale would be given if the additional sum of five dollars was paid. It is true that the checks for rent in three instances had noted upon them the statement that they were given each in payment of one machine, but this fact in itself would <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>not affect the title of the lessor. There is no reason why there could not he a release of his rights in part of the property without affecting his claim to the balance, if properly held under the bailment contract.</p>
    <p id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[289,561,1153,1787]]]'>There is nothing to show any creditors were misled by the company’s possession of the machines between June 5th and July 30th, when the understanding of the parties was put in written form, and the bankruptcy which followed was not until two years later. The trustee appointed claimed title, and the lessor instituted a reclamation proceeding in the United States District Court, which was finally dismissed on appeal, without prejudice to his right to arrest title in the appropriate state tribunal. This action of replevin, brought against the purchaser at the bankrupt sale, was heard by the court below without a jury, and findings of fact were reached, as well as conclusions of law. Judgment was entered in favor of defendant, based on the theory that the transaction was a conditional sale, as shown by the consignment directly to the now insolvent company, and the delivery of the machines to the carrier in its name. This led the court to the conclusion that the title passed immediately to the manufacturing company, and that the lease, executed some weeks after, was ineffective, though in accordance with the verbal agreement of the parties, entered into when the purchase was made by Schmidt. Under the findings, there can be no doubt the plaintiff paid for the knitting machines in question, and that there was an understanding the title should be held by him, and that a bailment contract should be executed for his benefit. The record, as before noted, does not show any creditors were injured by reason of the delay in the execution of the written paper, signed later, and we cannot agree with the learned court below that the case, upon which its decision rests (In re Devon Manor Corp., <a href="/f/257/0766-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="257 F. 766" data-case-ids="6056997" data-case-paths="/f/257/0766-01">257 Fed. 766</a>), makes necessary a holding to the contrary.</p>

Co., <a href="/pa/213/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="213 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="943397" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0207-01">213 Pa. 207</a>); though, as against the vendee, the understanding entered into will be sustained. So, receivers or trustees in bankruptcy may intervene on behalf of those whom they represent: General Elec. Co. v.

In other words, although the intent of the parties, and the effect of their agreement, was to vest the title at a future day in the purchaser, he having actual possession in the meantime, yet as the intervening arrangement was upon a valid contract of bailment as between the parties, the title of the bailor was preserved until terminated by compliance with the provision for a sale, at which time that portion of the agreement became operative”: Brown Bros. v.

That a lease was intended is plainly shown by the fact that, when forwarded, part, and subsequently all, had attached thereto plates naming him as “owner and lessor,” and the contract, when signed shortly thereafter, set forth in plain terms that it was a bailment. Though the intention of the parties controls, in determining the effect of the transfer, yet the best evidence of the real understanding is the writing itself. There is no suggestion that the paper here offered, which plainly states that the property “was leased,” was entered into by reason of any fraud, accident or mistake, or induced by any contemporaneous parol agreement. The only fact which might lead to a contrary thought is the endorsement found on three of the lessee’s rental Checks, indicating that it believed the payment of each installment meant the release of one machine from the control of the bailor.</p>

It was in default, however, and the lessor and present plaintiff had the right to demand a return of the property involved in the present action of replevin. The rights of the trustee in bankruptcy were not greater than those of the creditors, and his sale passed no title to the machines held under the bailment contract. It follows that plaintiff’s claim must be sustained.</p>
