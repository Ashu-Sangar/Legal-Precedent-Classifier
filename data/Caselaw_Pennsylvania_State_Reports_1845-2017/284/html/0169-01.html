Megary, and that she has made no charge for said courtesies during said period of time.

The paper was delivered to payee; this fact alone, however, does not change its character as a testamentary writing. Although it contains the memorandum “for his labor,” this alone is insufficient to make the writing contractual in form, or to constitute an acknowledgment of an indebtedness to the amount of $4,700 or any other sum. We find nothing to indicate the beneficiary had made claim on testator for labor or that there was any contractual relation between them to pay for services performed. The testimony discloses an intention on the part of testator to substantially remember Baker and thereby show his appreciation in return for services voluntarily rendered him during his last illness. The fact that two additional gifts of $500 each were given the same beneficiary indicated deceased had a kindly feeling toward the payee and desired to benefit him by his will, and had expressly stated to a witness that the gifts already made were intended as compensation for services up to the date of the will but were not intended as compensation for anything done after that time and that he had arranged that an additional amount should be given the beneficiary, and the witness was requested, in event of contest, to appear in 'court and testify to that effect.</p>

The contention that testator was of insufficient mental capacity to make his will was also abandoned on this appeal, leaving only the question whether the record presents sufficient evidence of fraud and undue influence to require awarding an issue. The duty rests on the orphans’ court to decide whether or not oral evidence offered for this purpose is sufficient to be submitted to the jury, and to refuse to award an issue if it appears the evidence against the will is so weak that the court would not sustain a verdict against it: Phillips’s Est., <a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>, 42; Fleming’s Est., <a href="/pa/265/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="265 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1051881" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0399-01">265 Pa. 399</a>, 406; Tet-low’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="269 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1063497" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0486-01">269 Pa. 486</a>. Baker, the beneficiary, resided next door to decedent and had voluntarily and without compensation performed many services such as keeping up . fires, removing ashes and attending to deceased personally during his illness. About two years previous to his death decedent was obliged to undergo an operation for cancer and thereafter Baker not only continued to discharge the services he had formerly been in the habit of discharging, but performed many of the duties of nurse, waited upon deceased, dressed his wound, assisted him physically both day and night, and also aided him in the transaction of his business matters.

The rule is that where testator is of weak mind, though not sufficient to wholly destroy his testamentary capacity, a person by whom or under whose advice a will is written, and who receives a substantial legacy or bequest, has the burden of proving testamentary capacity and showing that testator acted with full knowledge of the value of his estate; when, however, testamentary capacity is admitted or not denied and no evidence is offered of extreme infirmity or mental incapacity, the burden is on contestant to prove undue influence even as against one occupying a confidential relation: Phillips’s Est., <a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>, 44, and cases cited.
