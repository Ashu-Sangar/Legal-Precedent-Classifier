Deceased’s negligence, if any, was in stepping between the cars while the train was in motion. The testimony before the jury was hazy as to what really happened, at least it was not free from doubt as to whether or not the deceased stepped between the cars when moving. It was therefore imperative that the jury should not only understand the rules above referred to as to contradictory statements but, more important, should clearly and distinctly understand what defendant’s supposed negligence consisted of, what acts would constitute it in the given case, and whether such acts were present, if they believed the testimony asserting it.

Tilghman, <a href="/us/237/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="237 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="631815" data-case-paths="/us/237/0499-01">237 U. S. 499</a>, 501: “It may be seen therefrom that the trial judge was obliged to submit to the jury the issues involved at bar, and his instructions in so doing were substantially correct......Where the evidence justifies a finding that both the defendant and plaintiff were guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, the jury should be carefully instructed concerning the rule of comparative negligence established by the federal statute.” And as stated in Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Tilghman, <a href="/us/237/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="237 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="631815" data-case-paths="/us/237/0499-01">supra,</a> 501: “No reference was made to the rule of proportion specified in the statute or to the occasion for contrasting the negligence of the employee with the total causal negligence as a means of ascertaining what proportion of the full damages should be excluded from the recovery.” The rule that it is the duty of the trial court to give proper instructions is not only a rule of this court (Kahn &amp; Feldman, Inc., v. Herbert, <a href="/pa/279/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="279 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1083355" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0440-01">279 Pa. 440</a>) but of the federal court as well: Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Halloway, <a href="/us/246/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="246 U.S. 525" data-case-ids="8288224" data-case-paths="/us/246/0525-01">246 U. S. 525</a>. Other questions are presented by the assignments not here dealt with, and we do not decide them. Another trial may cure all alleged irregularities.</p>
