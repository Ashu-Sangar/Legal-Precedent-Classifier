In one, it provided for submission of a change in article IX, section 4, so that the debt of the Commonwealth might be increased to the amount of one hundred million dollars for the purpose of improving and rebuilding the highways of the Commonwealth. Later, it again suggested an amendment to the same section, reducing by one-half the total of road bonds, though otherwise the wording is the same, and adding the clause, “provided further, however, that the general assembly, irrespective of any debt, may authorize the State to issue bonds to the amount of thirty-five million of dollars for the payment of compensation to certain persons •from this State who served in the army, navy, or marine corps of the United States, during the World War, between the 6th day of April, one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, and the 11th day of November, one <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>thousand nine hundred and eighteen.” It directed that this question should be submitted to the electors on the first Monday of November, 1924, so that they could approve and ratify or reject it. Both of these proposals were again passed in the same form by the legislative body in 1923 (P. L. 1118, 1121). A similar enactment, authorizing the issue of bonds to the amount of $25,000,-000 ‘Tor the purpose of acquiring land in the State for forests,” was adopted in 1923, and again in 1925, and furnishes the reason for the intervention, at argument, on behalf of appellant, which we have before referred to.</p>

In the case of number 2a, however, which had attached thereto the provision for the soldier’s bonus, a bill in equity was filed to restrain the advertisement of the proposed submission. The legal questions here involved were then discussed in an opinion filed in this court, and the injunction prayed for was granted. Repetition of the argument then made is needless. Emphasis is given to what is there set forth, by the decision in Hollinger v. King, <a href="/pa/282/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="282 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1088366" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0157-01">282 Pa. 157</a>, where it is said (p. 160), in part: “Our deliberate thoughts on the point at issue are so fully developed in Armstrong v. King, supra, that it would serve no useful purpose to restate them at this time; it is enough to say that the views there expressed are here applied, and the ruling of the court below, that the amendment adopted November 6, 1923, is an unimpeachable part of the Constitution, is sustained.

XVIII, no further changes can be made until 1928. With this proposition we agree. Some confusion seems to have arisen, — though we see no justification for it, — from the following paragraph appearing in Armstrong v. King, supra (p. 214): “The present Constitution was amended in 1901, 1909, 1911, 1913, 1915, 1918, 1920 and 1923, those of 1911, 1915, 1918 and 1920, being amendments of article I, section 8, relating to municipal indebtedness. It will be noticed that the untimely submissions were in 1911, 1913, 1918 <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>and 1923. Had injunctions been sought at an appropriate time, against their then present submission, doubtless they would have been enjoined. No such action was applied for, however, the people gave their approval to the amendments, and to this day no one has challenged the fact that they are properly a part of the Constitution.” Though, as there held, the submission of the amendment in 1923 could have been successfully objected to, yet the approval by the people was a judgment of the electorate, and changed the basic law, and it is from that date we must consider the right to make further alterations. Until five years have elapsed, no additional modifications can be permitted, provided one interested objects in due course. “Provisions of the Constitution to the effect that amendments may be submitted only at certain times, or at certain elections, are mandatory and must be complied with”: 12 C. J. 689. The fact that similar resolutions had previously been passed by the general assembly within a five-year period, and approved by the voters, does not justify a judicial approval of this course, and such action will be restrained when properly attacked: Collins v. Kephart, <a href="/pa/271/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="271 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="295654" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0428-01">271 Pa. 428</a>.</p>

There may be merit in the contention made (see 12 C. J. 690, and cf. Hollinger v. King, supra), as also, in the claim that the legislature fixed the time for the vote as November, 1924, which has now become impossible. If deemed necessary, there is ample time to secure the necessary reenactments before the .proposed amendment is submitted for consideration to the electors, and thus possible legal difficulties may be <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>avoided. However, in view of the decision reached, that no change in the Constitution is permissible, against objection, until 1928, a discussion of the two questions last mentioned is not required.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[297,543,1151,632]]]'>In reaching the present decision, we are not unmindful of the fact that the voters should be given free opportunity to modify the fundamental law as may seem to them fit, but this must be done in the way they themselves have provided, if stability, in the carrying on of government, is to be preserved. It is the duty of the courts to follow the rules fixed by the Constitution. If believed to be unwise, in the provisions expressed, it should be rewritten, or modified, but as long as plain words are used, directing what shall be permitted, it is imperative on the courts to restrain any actions which are forbidden.</p>
