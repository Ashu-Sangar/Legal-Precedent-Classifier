The property in question was sold under a fi. fa. sur judgment entered on a warrant of attorney accompanying a bond, which in turn accompanied a purchase-money mortgage given by the rubber company to Harper, the present plaintiff. The Commonwealth claimed state taxes settled against the corporation after the mortgage was recorded. The sheriff allowed this claim in full, thus giving it priority over plaintiff’s judgment for the principal debt and attorney’s collection commissions due under the terms of the before-mentioned bond and on another bond of similar kind, also held by him and accompanying a second purchase-money mortgage on the same premises; whereupon plaintiff excepted. The court below sustained the exceptions and ordered the fund, after payment of local taxes, costs, and attorney’s commissions, to be applied on account of the judgment debts due to plaintiff.

Finally, the bonds and mortgages here involved, on which plaintiff bases his claims, were given by the rubber company itself; hence they come directly within the words of the act as either “judgments, mortgages, claims or liens against such corporation.” All this being manifestly true, the question may well be asked, how, under the circumstances, did the court below sustain its position that the Commonwealth’s claim for state taxes was not entitled to preference?</p>

Superior Ct. 268</a>, is relied on as authority. There, a prior act, containing substantially the same terms as the Act of 1911, was construed and applied; but the facts were materially different from those at bar. The purchase-money mortgage, which was there given precedence over the Commonwealth’s claim for state taxes assessed against the corporation figuring in that case, was not executed by the delinquent corporation, but by one of its predecessors in title; the corporation had acquired the land subject to the mortgage. That this was a controlling fact is clearly indicated by the following passage from the opinion of President Judge Endlich, on whose opinion the Superior Court affirmed. He said (p. 271): “The liens postponed to that of the Commonwealth......are <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>such as are created by or procured <em>against the delinquent </em>corporation, [and] it is very plain that neither the mortgage, incumbered with which the Pendora Park Company bought this land, nor the judgment on the sci. fa., was a lien created or obtained <em>against the company </em>In the present case, as previously said, the bonds and mortgages were given by the rubber company; they were its direct obligations, and, as such, are clearly within the class of liens over which the act gives preference to the claims of the Commonwealth.</p>

Comet O. &amp; R. Co., <a href="/pa/284/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="284 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1092089" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0189-01">284 Pa. 189</a>, 193, we recently said, on the subject of the “priority of state......tax liens” and the right of the legislature to give them preference over other claims, that “Our first thought must always be the preservation of government [and the] enforcing of lawful means necessary to successfully carry it forward; the means should always be available for its continued security, not hindered or prevented by lesser rights which may suffer because of such enforcement. The common good is superior to individual or private rights; [the State] therefore has a <em>natural equity </em>[and is] fairly entitled to first rank in the list of claims that may be had against any or all property. The protection which individuals receive at the hands of the government is compensation for any so-called impingement of right.” This disposes of any possible question of equities between the Commonwealth and plaintiff; but, in addition, plaintiff, <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>as heretofore stated, put himself in the situation of a mortgagee with full knowledge that his mortgage, or any judgment for the debt secured thereby, was, by the express words of the Act of 1911, postponed to state taxes which might be assessed in the future against the corporation from which he took the mortgage.

Since our cases show that debts secured by mortgages are, under many circumstances, lawfully susceptible of classification as mere liens,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> and since it is a matter of common knowledge that they are generally so considered, the right of the legislature thus to treat them, for a named purpose, on a given state of facts, cannot be doubted; therefore, the legislative classification, which we have in this case, of mortgages as liens subject to the same rule of subordination which the statute lays down for “any other claim or lien,” is, in itself, enough to dispose of the argument that plaintiff’s mortgage constituted an estate in the land which could not be displaced as though it were but a claim of the lien class.</p>
