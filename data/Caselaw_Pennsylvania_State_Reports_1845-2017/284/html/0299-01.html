    <p id="b324-9" data-blocks='[["BL_324.17",324,[281,1916,1149,260]]]'>Plaintiff’s husband insured his life in defendant company, in her favor; about seven months thereafter, he died, and, in a suit on the policy, she recovered a verdict and judgment, from the latter of which defendant appeals.</p>
    <p id="b324-10" data-blocks='[["BL_324.18",324,[281,2188,1149,209]],["BL_325.1",325,[127,345,1153,261]]]'>The policy states that it is issued, “in consideration of the application......a copy of which is attached hereto and made part hereof.” In the application, the insured “further declared and agreed that the foregoing state<a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>ments and answers......are correct and wholly true, and that they shall form the basis of the contract of insurance, if one be issued,” the policy specifying, however, that all those statements “shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties.”</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[127,618,1154,583]]]'>Among the questions and answers appearing in the application are the following: “Q. Have you ever had ......convulsions? A. No. Q. Give full particulars of every illness you have had since childhood, and the name of every physician who has ever attended you or prescribed for you? A. Affection, none. Q. Have you had any other illness than as recorded above? A. No.” It is alleged by defendant that these, — and other answers we do not deem it necessary to quote, — were “false and wholly untrue,” and were material to the risk; upon this foundation it builds its defense.</p>
    <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[126,1220,1154,862]]]'>When a physician, who had attended the insured, was on the stand, he was asked: “Will you state whether or not you treated [decedent] for epilepsy or convulsions?” The court below excluded the question because the witness had “indicated to the court that the specific disease of which [insured] was suffering [was a loathsome one] of which epilepsy and convulsions were only symptoms.” This ruling was based on the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 462, which provides “that no person authorized to practice physics or surgery shall be allowed, in any civil case [with an exception not pertinent here], to disclose any information which he acquired in attending the patient in a professional capacity, and which was necessary to enable him to act in that capacity, which shall tend to blacken the character of the patient, without the consent of the patient.”</p>

Admittedly, a <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>man may have had either or both of those complaints, without this fact, if known, tending in any way to blacken his character. If appellant, having received an affirmative answer to the question propounded, had then attempted to follow it up by an inquiry which, if answered, would have shown that the convulsions and epilepsy were symptoms of a loathsome disease, the Act of 1907 would have been applicable, and, an objection to this later inquiry would have been properly sustained. That, however, was not the question asked.</p>

In Suravitz v. Prudential Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/244/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="244 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1003493" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0582-01">244 Pa. 582</a>, 586, it is said: “In our opinion the change in the covenant from a warranty to a representation was intended to broaden the scope of inquiry in such cases, so as to give relief, to parties who in good faith take out policies of insurance, from the harshness, and in many instances the injustice, of the old rule applicable to warranties. If this be the correct view, and it is certainly the just and equitable one, we can see no reason for limiting the inquiry to the single <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>question of the materiality of the answer. Whether true answers were made, and whether the answers as made were correctly written down by the agent of the insurance company, and the good faith of the party making the answers to the best of his knowledge and belief, are questions which go to the very essence of the insurance risk, and parties should not be denied the right to have such matters determined before a proper tribunal, unless they have covenanted otherwise. As to warranties, the general rule is that the insured is concluded by his am swer as it appears in the application attached to the policy, but as to representations, no Pennsylvania case has gone so far as to hold that the same drastic rule should be applied, and no case has decided that the im quiry is limited to the single instance where the mar teriality of the answer is raised by the issue.” This decision is followed in Oplinger v.
