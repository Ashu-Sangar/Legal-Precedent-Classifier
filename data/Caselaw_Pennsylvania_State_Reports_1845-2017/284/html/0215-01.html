They gathered about a manhole in the street to await the arrival of another boy. While at the manhole, John struck a match on the iron cover to light a cigarette. An explosion of gas immediately followed, the boys were thrown in different directions, and the cover of the manhole was blown in the air, falling on John, so-injuring him that he died shortly after.</p>

It followed a waterline to a pit constructed by the Scranton Gas &amp; Water Company to house a water-meter. The pit, approximately five feet square and four feet deep, was sunk into the street about ten feet from the sidewalk, and its manhole was covered with a circular iron lid. An employee of the company visited it daily to examine the 'meter. For a month or so before the accident he continually found quantities of gas collected in the hole; at times he was compelled to remove the cover to permit the gas to escape before entering to read the meter. The odor of gas from the manhole was also observed by others for some weeks prior to the accident, and from its scent it was known to be illuminating gas.

When such authority is given, inasmuch as the city knows that there will be a joint use of the streets by the traveling public and the transportation of the dangerous substance, may the municipality contend it did not know the dangerous qualities of the matter transported?

On the contrary, it has been uniformly held that those using this new and dangerous agent are bound to the very highest degree of care practicable to avoid injury to every one who may......come......in contact with [the wires]......The fact that the wires are owned or used by the city as part of its police instruments, does not alter the rule, or exempt the city from liability under it.” If illuminating gas is a highly explosive substance, there seems to be no good reason why its occupancy of the street should not be surrounded by every generally well-known safeguard to prevent injury to the users of the street.</p>

One may approach to within a certain distance from a leak with a light in safety, but, in approaching, that point is reached where tbe mixture of gas and air becomes dangerous. Tbe location of this point is difficult to determine. Gas should be confined, tbe leak large enough to create some pressure, and the mixture about perfect. We bave held that one may go into a cellar or attic with a lighted match, lamp, or lighted taper bunting along a gas line for a leak, and not be guilty of contributory negligence: Plonk v. Jessop, <a href="/pa/178/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="178 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="885499" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0071-01">supra.</a> Tbe common practice of discovering gas leaks is by tbe use of a match or candle.

The court said “the knowledge of the explosive character of gas certainly may be presumed to be general among persons who have it in their houses, and plaintiff admitted such knowledge. But how far a smell of gas indicates a leak that may safely be searched for with a match or candle, and at what point it means danger of explosion in so doing, is a question requiring judgment and some experience,” and that was for the jury. So it may be said as to this boy, assuming he knew gas was present, his knowledge of the danger point around the manhole where he struck his match, or his contributory negligence, is a question of fact for the jury.</p>
