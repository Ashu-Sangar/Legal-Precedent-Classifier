In 1920 the company purchased two leasehold interests in that city. At these two latter locations it had a service station, selling gasoline and liquid fuel. Under the Acts of May 20, 1921, P. L. 1021, and June 15, 1923, P. L. 834, the State imposed a tax on the sale of gasoline, and on account of it there was due the Commonwealth the sum of approximately $6,000 from the collecting agent, the Comet Oil Refining Co. The proceeds of $11,000 from the sale of the mortgaged property was subjected by the sheriff to the payment of this sum received by the agent in payment of the tax. No gasoline was sold on the premises for which the mortgage was given. It is obvious, if the distribution is to be sustained, the payment to the Commonwealth will be out of the mortgagee’s pocket. The mortgagee sold her property at a time when no gasoline tax was in existence, accepting for part of the purchase money the mortgage. The legislature created the tax subsequently, and the corporation failed to pay to the Commonwealth the tax it collected. The State, by vir<a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>tue of the lien, requires the mortgagee to not only replace funds held by a fiduciary, but also to pay the debt of the corporation and accept just that much less in payment of her land than the price for which it was conveyed.</p>

Our first thought must always be the preservation of the government by unhesitatingly enforcing the lawful means necessary to successfully carry it forward; the means should always be available for its continued security, not hindered or prevented by lesser rights which may suffer because of such enforcement; the common good is superior to individual or private rights. It is therefore a natural equity, fairly entitled to first rank in the list of claims that may be had against any or all property. The protection which <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>individuals receive at the hands of the government is compensation for any so-called impingement of right. The Act of 1811 is regarded as the original lien law for state taxes and public accounts, but many other statutes were enacted prior to the Constitution of 1874, making lien provisions; so that, if the liens for taxes and accounts mentioned in the Act of 1911 could not be upheld under this theory, as opposed to the constitutional inhibition of article III, section 7, prior legislation will sustain the liens for taxes and public accounts to the exclusion of other liens: Haspel v.

The same right , to classify exists as to the persons collecting (Bachman’s App., <a href="/pa/274/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="274 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="1072987" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0420-01">274 Pa. 420</a>) and the method and manner of collection.

Where the indebtedness was that of a corporation, it was the tax collector, though the tax was on the holder of the bond. Where an individual had money at interest in other securities than thus designated, the county treasurer was the collector. Under the Act of 1879, as well as subsequent acts, the corporation is required to pay the amount collected to the State or suffer a first lien on the corporate property: Lewis Power and Heat Co., <a href="/pa-super/62/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="62 Pa.

The reasons for the rule stated by the Justice who wrote the opinion may be found on pages 622 and 623, but do not exist here.

That no question was there brought to the attention of the courts under this act is quite obvious. The Commonwealth was amply protected through the treasurer, the county and the sureties. Here the individual tax gatherer has no county or surety to account to the State. While the money actually in the hands of the different collectors under the indebtedness tax and the gasoline tax may be said to stand on an equal footing, the county treasurer in this aspect is a somewhat different person from the thousand individuals who happen to operate a small garage, selling gasoline to passers-by. We said in Knisely v. Cotterel, <a href="/pa/196/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="196 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="916794" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0614-01">196 Pa. 614</a>, 633, that in classifying the collectors under the mercantile tax act the constitutional provision against local laws did not prohibit the imposition of additional duties to itself on its city officers by virtue of their office. The State may appoint its own agent to collect its own tax, even if such agent may be for other purposes a municipal officer. But such an officer is in quite a different position from the vendor of gasoline. The necessity for classification was there manifest; here it is not.</p>
