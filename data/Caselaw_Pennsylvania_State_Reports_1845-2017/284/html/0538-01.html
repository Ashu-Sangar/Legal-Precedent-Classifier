In cases where it is sought to correct the stenographer’s transcript of the evidence, and the proceedings outlined by the Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 278, were not followed, the reasons for such failure should be stated in any application for corrections which may subsequently be made to the trial court, and that tribunal should be petitioned, before the record is removed to an appellate court.</p>

If the alleged errors are not discovered until after the record is so removed, then an application to the appellate court must aver the proper reasons, and it must be accompanied by a certificate from the trial judge that the petition has been read by him, and he desires an opportunity to consider the matters averred therein, otherwise such petition will not be considered by the appellate court.</p>

    <p id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.8",563,[124,604,1153,647]]]'>This case was tried April 2, 1925; on April 7, 1925, the official stenographer lodged a transcript of his notes of testimony with the clerk of the court and sent notice of that fact to counsel for plaintiff and defendant, the notice stating that, unless objections were made thereto within fifteen days, the transcript would be certified, filed and become part of the record in the case. No objections were made, and in due time the transcript was approved by the trial judge and certified by the stenographer; it was directed to be filed as required by section 4 of the Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 279, and sections 4 and 5 of the Act of May 1,1907, P. L. 135.</p>

The date of this consultation is not given. Counsel for appellant answers that the reply to the question is correctly given in the transcript, and avers ignorance of any consultation between the official stenographer and opposing counsel.</p>
