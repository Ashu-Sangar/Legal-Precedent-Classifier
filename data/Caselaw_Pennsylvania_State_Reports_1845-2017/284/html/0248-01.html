From the judgment entered on a verdict for plaintiff, the city appeals; and, — possibly because the recovery was so much less than the money actually expended by plaintiff in restoring the property to its former condition, — only assigns as error the refusal of the court below to enter judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto. Under such circumstances, there being no writings to consider, the testimony, and all the inferences fairly deducible therefrom, if favorable to plaintiff, must be taken as true, and all unfavorable must be rejected (Fuller v. Stewart Coal Co., <a href="/pa/268/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="268 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1061594" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0328-01">268 Pa. 328</a>; Fluke v.

Since we think it should be, because of negligence in the latter respect, we need not consider that which is alleged regarding the former; but may limit our inquiry to determining whether there is any evidence, direct or inferential, from which the jury could properly have found that plaintiff suffered damages resulting from the alleged negligent failure to repair, the city claiming only, upon this point, — erroneously, as hereinafter appears, — “that there is no evidence of any failure to properly maintain.”</p>

The work was done by sinking shafts at intervals.along the street, tunnelling between them, supporting the strata of. earth, at and above the top of the tunnels, by heavy timbers, upheld by equally heavy posts at the sides of the tunnels, with braces running diagonally from the posts to the roof, — all of this part of the construction, it is admitted, being bound to rot in course of time, — and then building a circular sewer within the opening formed by the posts, the braces and the roof. By this method there necessarily remained <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>a large open space between the circular sewer and the sides and roof of the tunnel, which had to be filled in with earth, firmly tamped, if it was to remain as a permanent support for the superjacent soil. So long as the posts and roof remained in good condition the soil would be and in fact was upheld, irrespective of the character of the filling and tamping, which the city averred was done as well as the circumstances permitted.</p>
    <p id="b275-4" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[148,773,1154,1248]]]'>In 1902 plaintiff bought its property on Madison Avenue, along the line of the sewer, and in the same year commenced, and subsequently completed, the erection of its bank building, with adequate foundation walls resting on a substratum of sand and gravel, fully sufficient to sustain it, so long as the sewer construction above referred to was kept in a proper condition. In 1908 the building began to show cracks, which increased to so great an extent as to cause fear that it would fall; repeated notices thereof were given to the city authorities, but nothing being done, either to repair the injury or prevent it becoming greater, plaintiff itself made an investigation, which showed that the timbers used in shoring and roofing the tunnel had rotted away, so much so that some of it would crumble in the hand, and that the back-filling alone was not sufficient to sustain the overlying soil, which had thereupon settled, dragging down plaintiff’s property with it, and causing the injury of which complaint is made. The city was again asked to make the necessary repairs to plaintiff’s building, and to prevent further injury to it, but refused to do anything; whereupon plaintiff had the work done, and sued the city to recover the expense thus incurred.</p>

Moore, <a href="/pa/68/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="68 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1024549" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0404-01">supra,</a> we said: ‘The defect here w;as the inward rottenness of the timbers which constitute the main strength and princi<a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>pal support of the bridge. It was not outwardly visible, one of the supervisors having inspected the timbers outwardly just a short time before it fell. But the evidence shows that the bridge had been erected and stood the time it is usual that such timbers will last...... [Under such circumstances] when it may reasonably be expected that decay has set in, it is negligence to omit all proper precautions to ascertain its true condition.’ Again, in Rigony v. Schuylkill County, <a href="/pa/103/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="103 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="449099" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0382-01">103 Pa. 382</a>, another bridge case, we said: ‘Latent defects resulting from the decay of the materials used, after long use, come within a different category (from ‘latent defects for which there is no liability’) and the omission to search for and discover them is evidence of negligence properly chargeable......to those whose duty it is to repair.’ ......The rule laid down in the cases last cited is reiterated in the cases of McCormick v.

In this latter case, affirming a judgment for the plaintiff, we said: ‘The bridge that broke under the weight of the traction engine on which the plaintiff was riding was built...... in 1844, and from that time to the time of the accident in 1899, the floor timbers had not been renewed nor inspected by boring......The strength of the bridge was ample until the timbers were weakened by decay and were subjected to a severe strain by the use of the traffic engines. As there was the duty of inspection, the deterioration of the timbers should have been known to the supervisors.’ These cases support the instructions, and the assignments are overruled.”</p>
