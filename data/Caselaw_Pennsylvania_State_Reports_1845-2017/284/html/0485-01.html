      <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>The case both on oral argument and in the printed briefs has been discussed on broader lines than we think it merits, as in our view the issue was a very narrow one. It is: Did Coggins, the agent, exceed the authority conferred, either express or implied, which was given him by his principals, Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch? While there is a discussion in the briefs on the general subject of agency and how it may be shown, we think it is not necessary to meet this controversy, because as we read the record there is no question that Coggins was the agent of the firm. The critical inquiry is just what his agency amounted to and what authority and powers it carried with it.</p>

They sent Coggins to Rocky Ford as their agent to purchase for and ship to them cantaloupes. They gave him a check for $2,000, which apparently was his initial capital for the purpose of making the purchases. He . deposited this check on August 16,1921, in the First National Bank of Rocky Ford, and thereafter during that year, the year following and in 1923, when the events transpired which gave rise to this action, deposited in the account certain drafts. During 1921 and 1922, these drafts were all drawn on his principals, Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch, but in 1923, he drew drafts not alone upon them but upon other persons for whom he was purchasing cantaloupes. The account was opened “C. A. Coggins, Agent,” and continued under this designation. When the drafts were deposited by Cog-gins, the bank, instead of waiting until it had received advices that a draft had been accepted by Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch, treated the drafts as cash items and permitted Coggins to draw against them. In 1923 he drew a draft on Rice &amp; Smith, who were also produce dealers in Pittsburgh, for $6,000. This draft was honored and paid. Subsequently he drew other drafts on Rice &amp; Smith which, however, were dishonored, as were three drafts on Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch for $1,-<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>533.75. T¡he total of the dishonored drafts amounted to $8,950.30. Immediately after these drafts were deposited in the bank, Coggins, treating them as cash as had been his custom, checked their proceeds out. When they were dishonored, the bank called upon Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch to make good the amount of Cog-gins’s overdraft and, on their refusal so to do, this suit was instituted. On the trial of the case, it appeared that not only did the drafts drawn by Coggins go to make up the bank account but in addition he deposited therein other money, including checks for salary paid him by his principals, and out of the account he checked sums, not only in payment for the cantaloupes which he had purchased, but to his wife and for his own expenditures.</p>

Taken from appellee’s own counter history of the case the facts upon which reliance is placed to' sustain this position are these: That Coggins when he opened the bank account in 1921 presented a card with the name of the firm on it “Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch, Fruit and Produce, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania” and his own name thereon “C. A. Coggins, Representative,” that he carried the account “C. A. Coggins, Agt., Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch” (which we do not find substantiated by the evidence), that the course of business from the beginning of the account had been for the bank to treat the drafts deposited as cash (parenthetically it may be again observed that there is no evidence on the record that Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch knew that they were being treated as cash), that when Cog-gins returned to Pittsburgh at the close of the canta<a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>loupe season of 1921, the bank received a letter signed “Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch” thanking it for the many courtesies extended to Coggins (Coggins testified, however, that he dictated this letter, but could not say who signed it); that the same method of drawing drafts and checks against them was pursued in the years 1922 and 1923. We fail to see how these facts fix the defendant with liability for the overdrafts, particularly those resulting from the dishonoring of the drafts drawn by Coggins on Rice &amp; Smith. In no way are Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch connected with these drafts, which represented the price paid by Coggins for cantaloupes purchased by him for the account of Rice &amp; Smith. The only piece of evidence in the case bearing on Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch, so far as these drafts are concerned, is the fact that, in a telegram which Coggins sent to Rice &amp; Smith notifying them of purchases of cantaloupes which he could make for their account, he told them to show the telegram to Anderson. It is not even alleged that Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch had anything to do with these cantaloupes, that they were bought for their account or that they received any of them; furthermore, the record would seem to indicate that during the year 1923 it was understood by Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch that Coggins was not acting exclusively for them. In addition to this, Smith, one of the partners of Rice &amp; Smith, testified that in the year 1923 Coggins purchased cantaloupes for them, that they dealt with him personally in regard to the transactions, that Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch were in no way connected with the purcháses, and that they (Rice &amp; Smith) did not pay for all the cantaloupes that Coggins had bought for them because the purchases had been made on a basis which had not been authorized, that there were outstanding differences between them and Coggins which had not been adjusted at the time of trial.</p>

Our examination of the record convinces us that there was no such information conveyed to them, either directly or indirectly. Anderson testified that the extent of Coggins’s agency at any time was to purchase cantaloupes for them (that he did not have even that authority in 1923), that they did not authorize him to open a bank account in behalf of the firm, that he did not have any knowledge of the existence of the bank account, that they did not authorize Coggins to obtain credit on their behalf and that they did not authorize him to draw drafts upon Rice &amp; Smith or upon any other person. Coggins himself testified that he went to Rocky Ford as the representative of Anderson, Johnston &amp; Branch to buy cantaloupes. He did not say that they authorized him to open a bank account for them.</p>
