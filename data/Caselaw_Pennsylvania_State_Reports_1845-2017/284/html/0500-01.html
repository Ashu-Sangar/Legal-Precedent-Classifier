Lorch were partners, and conducted a mercantile business under the name of Lorch Bros. From time to time purchases were made from the American Wholesale Corporation of Baltimore, represented by an agent in the City of Pittsburgh. For the protection of the seller, a contract of guaranty was executed by the two brothers on August 23,1923, having for its purpose the insuring of the payment of all sums then due by the firm, or which might become payable to the extent of $20,000, binding the heirs, executors and administrators of the copartners, who signed as individuals. Provision was made therein for the termination of further liability, by the giving of written notice to that effect. Certain balances were owing when the contract was made, and other sales followed, not only to the date of the death of Louis, but also until the bankruptcy of the firm, more than a year thereafter, at which <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>time there was payable from it to the present claimant a sum in excess of $70,000.</p>
    <p id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[145,474,1155,1115]]]'>On October 30, 1923, Louis, one of the guarantors, died, and letters of administration on his estate were granted November 23d to the Braddock Trust Company. As required by law, due notice of appointment was given, calling upon all creditors to present their claims. Its final account was presented to the orphans’ court, confirmed, and distribution ordered January 26, 1925. The accountant first learned of the existence of the decedent’s guaranty, above referred to, on the day previous to the audit, and immediately notified by telephone the American Wholesale Corporation of the time fixed for the meeting. Claiming to have had no previous knowledge of the death, it asked that the decree of distribution be opened, and opportunity be given to substantiate the demand made against the estate. This was permitted, and hearings were had later. Prom the evidence presented, the learned court below found that all sums legally chargeable to the decedent by reason of the contract of indemnity had been fully paid and satisfied and it is from this adjudication that the present appeal is taken.</p>
    <p id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[144,1608,1153,628]]]'>The first question considered by the court below, in determining the possible liability, was the date to:which amounts charged by the claimant should be calculated. Liability for amounts due at the time of death, or for which the decedent was then personally bound, though payable thereafter (Chestnut St. Tr. Co.’s Assd. Est., <a href="/pa/217/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="217 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="953690" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0151-01">217 Pa. 151</a>), was clearly to be considered. It was further insisted that all indebtedness of the partnership to the date of bankruptcy, more than a year later, was to be included, or at least that shown to be due on March 19, 1924, when the corporation acknowledged the receipt of a formal notice of death.</p>

At that time, as we shall see later, the balance of indebtedness was practically liquidated, — it had been entirely paid to February 1st.

The knowledge of the appointment of the administrator, made, of course, only after the filing of an affidavit of death, is effective as to all parties, whether they have actual information of its contents or not. “Where constructive notice is provided for, it has the same effect as actual notice, and binds equally.

L. 342. “If the proper statutory notice has been given, the creditor’s want of actual notice is not material and will not affect the running of the non-claim statute against his demand” : 24 C. J. 344. “The notice given, agreeably to the rules of court, and more especially by direction of the acts of assembly, must have the same effect as actual notice, and bind equally”: App v.

This rule has been frequently applied where the advertisement of the filing of an account is the only information putting the creditor on inquiry: Stoever’s App., 3 W. &amp; S.

The claimant here was thus warned and bound by the information that letters had been granted. The duty devolved upon any one affected to make the necessary investigation to discover the true <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>situation: Arnold v. Carroll, <a href="/pa-super/83/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="83 Pa. Super. 308" data-case-ids="661288" data-case-paths="/pa-super/83/0308-01">83 Pa.

Super. 167" data-case-ids="853909" data-case-paths="/pa-super/26/0167-01">26 Pa. Superior Ct. 167</a>. Under the facts appearing, we are constrained to hold that the appellant had constructive notice of the death of the guarantor, given by the advertisement in 1923.</p>
    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[123,620,1157,1071]]]'>But irrespective of the time when the guaranty shall be considered revoked, there is a vital reason why no recovery should be allowed here. The guarantor’s estate was liable only for sales made on the faith of the contract until legally terminated, and, if any balance remained unpaid, it was essential that this be proven, and it was not. Lorch’s estate became liable for all sums due by the partnership on the running account to the limit fixed in his agreement, including sums which became due on contracts in force when he died, though the consideration passed thereafter. When all such claims were liquidated, the responsibility ceased. On October 30, 1923, the date of death, a balance was due, and, subsequently, bills of the firm became payable. On February 1,1924, the entire charges were $18,-669.76, with credits of $8,114.67. On the 14th of that month, seven trade acceptances were given to the amount of $10,555.09, totaling the exact sum shown to be due, and all of these were paid on the days called for by their terms.</p>
    <p id="b531-6" data-blocks='[["BL_531.6",531,[127,1708,1158,691]],["BL_532.1",532,[305,329,1153,529]]]'>It is now insisted these credits should be given as of the date the acceptances were actually satisfied, instead of when delivered. That they were treated as payments when forwarded and accepted is clearly apparent from an examination of the sworn proof of the same claim, made in subsequent bankruptcy proceedings against the firm, wherein the charges begin February 1st, and no credit is given for the amount of the obligations transferred on the 14th, and, as stated, paid later. That the settlement was in full to the date mentioned, is confirmed by the positive testimony of the bookkeeper^ This conclusion, reached by the learned court below and now approved, is not affected by a consideration of the <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>testimony of appellant’s agent, who seemed to claim the payments of February 14th were to be on account of some future orders to be given, though his evidence is lacking in clearness and definiteness. It will be noticed that the business transactions of the parties had been practically ended at the time referred to, and that there had been but few sales in the three months preceding. It was not until after the settlement, and the giving of a new guaranty by the survivor, that the business dealings were resumed to any extent.</p>
    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[299,868,1155,784]]]'>Even if there had been no settlement February 1st, this was a running account, and payments largely in excess of any liability of the decedent were later made, and the sums so given necessarily were applicable to liquidate the earliest items, in the absence of an allocation to some particular indebtedness: Pardee v. Markle, <a href="/pa/111/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="111 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="545251" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0548-01">111 Pa. 548</a>; 28 C. J. 1005. Applying this rule to the only two charges billed after February 1st, and outstanding on March 1st, amounting to $34.73, it must be held they were liquidated by a subsequent cash payment, appearing in the account filed as having been made a few days later. We are convinced that, irrespective of any legal question of the date to be considered as fixing the time of revocation of the guaranty, there can be no recovery in this case.</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.6",532,[300,1671,1147,97]]]'>The decree of the court below is affirmed at the costs of appellant.</p>
