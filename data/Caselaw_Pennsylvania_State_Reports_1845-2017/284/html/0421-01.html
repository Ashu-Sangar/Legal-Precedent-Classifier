The . next step was a writ of quo warranto issued out of the Supreme Court at the suggestion of the Attorney General, directing defendant to show by what authority he claimed to possess and exercise the office in controversy. Defendant filed an answer setting forth the facts attending his appointment and attempted removal; to this the Commonwealth demurred. Thus the matter comes on for adjudication.</p>

      <em>As </em>to the method of removal set forth in the Act of 1913 not being exclusive, the Attorney General suggests that, since the phrase used is, “The Governor by and with the consent of the Senate <em>may </em>remove any commis<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>sioner,” it is discretionary with him either to follow the course dictated in the act or to dismiss a commissioner under what the relator conceives to be an absolute right of removal conferred on the Governor by the above constitutional provisions. To this defendant replies, the Attorney General overlooks the rule that when a constitutional direction as to how a thing shall be done is relevant, as the relator claims the present one to be, it is “exclusive and prohibitory of any other mode which the legislature may deem better or more convenient”: Bowman’s Case, <a href="/pa/225/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="225 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="965287" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0364-01">225 Pa. 364</a>, 367. In addition, the Attorney General’s position is negatived by our decision in Commonwealth v. Sutherland, 3 S. &amp; R. 145,151, where, construing language practically similar to that used in the present statute, we stated, “When it is said that the Governor <em>may </em>remove at the request of the majority of the board, it is meant that he <em>shall not </em>remove without their consent.” Here, the language used by the legislature shows it meant the Governor should not remove without the consent of the senate; and, of course, this makes an exclusive method of removal, so far as the legislature had a right to deal with the matter.</p>

Pa. 506, 508, quoting Justice Stobt, we said: “Constitutions deal in general language and are <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>not intended to provide merely for the exigencies of a few years, but to endure through a long lapse of time.” Therefore, to assert that anomalous bodies like the Public Service Commission, — organized for the purpose of carrying on administrative work strictly legislative in character, acting at times in a quasi-judicial capacity, and to some extent exercising executive functions, — were not in the minds of the people when they adopted the Constitution, does not, true though it may be, help much in the solution of the question now before us; but the fact of this non-contemplation does help us to an appreciation of the difficulties presented by the unforeseen appearance of such bodies in our governmental organization. Courts, however, are constituted for the purpose of solving just such difficulties, in order that society may exist and governments continue to operate.</p>

    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[277,828,1153,1076]]]'>The words employed are not that removals may be made at the pleasure of the person or official who may have máde the appointments, in the sense of first designating the appointees, but “at the pleasure of the <em>power </em>by which they shall have been appointed.” Of course, in many instances, perhaps in most, the language first stated in the preceding sentence and that immediately thereafter quoted from the Constitution could be construed as synonymous, but not necessarily always so; for example, in this court all appointments are made by the Chief Justice, but the court is the power by which they are made; the Chief Justice acts merely as its instrument in designating the appointees. Thus we may see that the person or official who makes an appointment to office and the power by which the appointment is made may be quite different; which shows the significance for present consideration of the above-quoted words, to which we direct attention as leaving open the question of who, in the case now before us, was the appointing power.</p>

If we must hold that the Governor alone is the appointing <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>power, again the word “pleasure” in the above excerpt from the organic law has a broad significance in connection with the question of the legislature’s right to control in any degree his privilege of removal. But if, so far as the particular post here involved is concerned, the legislature itself is really the appointing power, the Governor, for practical convenience, acting as that body’s agent in nominating appointees, then it could dictate how its agent, the Governor, should express its pleasure in making removals. This, at least, the legislature attempted to do by the Act of 1913, and, if reasonably sustainable, its effort must be upheld; all constitutional authorities so rule. Hence, the question is presented, Can the general assembly itself be found, on any reasonable theory, to be the appointing power of public service commissioners under the act before us? We shall now take up this question, which will develop other subordinate ones as we proceed with our consideration.</p>

Moreover, in providing for a practical method of selecting and dismissing its own appointees, the general assembly could permit the Governor, or whatever agency it might select for the purpose, to act in removing the officials thus named, and it could dictate the exclusive manner in which the removal should be made; for, under such circumstances, the general assembly, as the appointing <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>power, would have the right to provide by statute how its “pleasure” (in the language of the Constitution) should be expressed, since there is nothing in the Constitution from which it can be even plausibly argued that, if the legislature sees fit to delegate to others its power to appoint its own deputies, it is required to give to these others an uncontrolled appointive power. On the contrary, the power of a state legislature is supreme in all matters, except in so far as it may be restricted by the Constitution; therefore, it follows that the power to designate its own officers, or deputies, and also the right to remove them, may be defined by statute in particular instances, subject, of course, to change by subsequent legislatures. But the question is, Are the services performed by the Public Service Commission such as to identify the members of that body as deputies of the legislature? We shall deal with this question first by the method of exclusion, and then by examining the substance of what remains for consideration.</p>

Also, none of the commissioners are required to be learned in the law, whereas, under the Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 648, all president judges of courts of record must be learned in the law. All of these, with many other elements which might be pointed out, show that the commission is not a court of record, though it may act judicially, in the sense that its forms of procedure are largely those used in courts of equity and at law, and, as said by the Federal Supreme Court in Spring V. W. Wks. v. Schottler, <a href="/us/110/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="110 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="3503718" data-case-paths="/us/110/0347-01">110 U.

L. 1913, p. 1405. Finally, if such a commission were a court, the Supreme Court of the United States would not have said in Ohio Valley Water Co. v.

At the same time, the general assembly dictated the manner in which the Governor might exercise the power which it conferred on him. All of this delegation of authority, however, is simply for the purpose of setting up machinery by which the appointing power may practically operate, and the legislature itself remains that power, the Governor acting only as its agent. This salient fact is the key to the situation in the present case, and, when this is kept in mind, it becomes clear that the legislation under attack is not in any sense inconsistent with the Constitution of the State; on the contrary, it presents merely a direction by the general assembly as to how delegated authority shall be exercised by a named agent.</p>

The particular office in controversy in the Lane Case belonged to a branch of government separate and distinct from the legislature itself; therefore, when the latter authorized the Governor to fill the position, he was made the appointing power, and the constitutional provision as to the right of removal at the pleasure of the appointing power immediately applied. The fact that, in designating the Governor as the appointing power, the statute for that purpose used the phrase, “by and with the advice and consent of the senate,” when viewed in connection with the office there involved, indicated no purpose on the part of the legislature to reserve, in any sense, the appointing power to itself, for the office with which the statute dealt was not one connected in any way with the work of the general assembly. In the case now before us for adjudication, however, the officer in question is a mere instrument of the legislature, whom, as before said, that body could, beyond any doubt, have appointed itself, without reference to the Governor, and the whole language of the parts of the Public Service Company Law providing for the appointment and dismissal of such officers shows the intention of the general assembly to assert its authority as the appointing power through the Governor, not to surrender such authority to him; else why should it have pursued the unusual course of reserving a right to join, through the action of the senate, in the removal of commissioners, and also of providing, by section 3 of article IV, that appointments made during recess periods of the senate, to fill unexpired terms, shall be subject to the approval of the senate when convened (the same as appointments for whole terms), instead of simply permitting the Governor to issue a commission to expire at the end of the next session of the senate, the usual way <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>(provided by the Constitution, section 8 of article IY) for offices to which the Governor may appoint?</p>

As said by Judge Hook in Western II. Tel. Co. v. Myatt, 98 Federal 335, 346, even though the legislature may denominaté a tribunal as of a certain character, its real character must be “determined rather by the ascertainment of the essential nature of the jurisdiction and powers” which the tribunal exercises than by its legislative cognomen.

L. 1396, 1401 (both quoted in the second paragraph of this opinion), it recognizes public service commissioners as instruments of the general assembly. Moreover, the Act of 1913 shows that the legislature itself, so far as the final say in such matters is concerned, desired and intended to preserve its right to appoint and discharge these instruments of legislative service; and, to this end, it dictated the manner in which its agent, the Governor, should exercise the powers delegated to him in those regards. That such was the intention of the lawmakers, and is the essence of the legislation before us, cannot be doubted; and this is the reading we give to the two above-mentioned sections of the Act of 1913.</p>

Such being the case, it is our duty to search further for a construction, and, if any other reasonable one can be found, to adopt it, thus rejecting the construction urged by the relator, which would lead to a declaration of constitutional invalidity; our duty is the same in this regard even though it be conceded that, had language similar to the words first used in the act to reserve legislative control over the appointment of commissioners (that they were to be appointed “by and with the advice and consent of the senate”) been employed in connection with an office having to do with other than legisla<a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>tive work, and there were nothing else in the statute to warrant giving such words another meaning, they would be susceptible of the rejected construction. But here the words in question were used in connection with an office having to do with legislative work, and, as previously shown in this opinion, other parts of the act indicate the purpose with which they were employed, — to reserve legislative control of appointments; hence the construction we put upon them, which renders the subsequent section of the statute, as to the legislature’s control over the removal of commissioners, constitutional.</p>
