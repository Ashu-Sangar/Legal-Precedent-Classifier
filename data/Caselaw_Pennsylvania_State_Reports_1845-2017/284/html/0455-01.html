In order to obtain a declaration, it is not required that an actual wrong should have been done, such as would give rise to an action for damages, and no wrong need be immediately threatened, such as would be a proper basis for an injunction. A present cause of action is not essential.</p>

An ordinary judgment may or may not be followed by an execution, but as it always makes the issue at stake res judicata, and consequently makes the judgment forever enforceable, it is this feature rather than the fact that execution may or may not be issued, which gives it the character of a judgment.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[280,680,1151,129]]]'>9. The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act does not involve, an unconstitutional denial of trial by jury, inasmuch as section 9 provides for such trial in appropriate cases.</p>

Where these things are present there is due process of law.</p>

In declaratory judgment practice, it is a matter of judicial discretion whether or not jurisdiction will be taken of any particular case, that a proceeding to obtain such a judgment will not be entertained where the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject-matter involved, or where another statutory remedy has been specially provided for the case in hand, and- that jurisdiction will never be assumed unless the tribunal appealed to is satisfied that an actual controversy, or the ripening seeds of one, exists between the parties, all of whom are sui juris and before the court, and that the declaration sought will be a practical help in ending the controversy.</p>

On August 23, 1902, she leased the limestone to appellant company for a term of twenty years from January 1,1903. No limestone was quarried or removed during the term, but the minimum royalty stipulated for in the lease was paid annually. The lease contained an “option to [the lessee] to take and receive a new lease of said premises.” Abigail Kariher died, a widow, in 1904, intestate, and leaving, as her only descendants and sole heirs at law, three sons, John C. P. Kariher, Hiram Kariher and Terhan H. Kariher. In 1909, Hiram and Terhan conveyed their respective undivided interests in the farm to their brother John, but each reserved his interest in the limestone, oil and gas underlying the premises. In 1912, the three sons leased twenty-five acres of the farm <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>for oil and gas purposes. Hiram died in 1922, testate, and Ms undivided one-tMrd interest in the limestone passed to Bernard F. Kariher, his only child. John still lives and retains his one-third interest in the limestone. Terhan died August 20, 1920, leaving to survive him an only child, Orie M. Kariher, the appellee. The lease now in controversy was negotiated by Orie M. Kariher, claiming to be the owner in fee of an undivided one-third of the mineral rights in question, and by his uncle John C. Kariher, claiming another third, and his cousin Bernard F. Kariher, claiming the remaining third. No question is raised as to the absolute ownership of the two last mentioned persons, but that of Orie M. Kariher is questioned, as before stated.</p>

Suffice it for present purposes to say that the procedure of declaratory judgments originated in the classical Roman law and later was adopted by and is still extensively used in many European and Spanish-American countries. Scotland has fully enjoyed this practice for four centuries; from there it was introduced into England, where it has been used in some form for seventy-five years, and in a very broad form for the past forty <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>years. The English Supreme Court of Judicature, having been given the rule-making power by the Judicature Acts, adopted rules in 1883 (Order XXV, rule 5) and 1893 (Order LIY, A) to provide for this very extensive practice, which now prevails in substantially every part of the British Empire.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[139,665,1155,1284]]]'>The distinctive characteristic of the declaratory judgment is that the declaration stands by itself; that is to say, no executory process follows as of course. Again, in order to obtain a declaration, it is not required that an actual wrong should have been done, such as would give rise to an action for damages, and no wrong need be immediately threatened, such as would be the proper basis for an injunction. In other words, a cause of action, in the sense in which that term is ordinarily used, is not essential to the assumption of jurisdiction in this form of procedure. It is upon these characteristics of the declaratory judgment that the chief constitutional attacks have been based; its opponents contending the declaration of legal rights and obligations contemplated by the act represents the exercise of a non judicial duty, which the legislature cannot place on the courts, and that, since such declarations do not necessarily include the right to execution, they are not judgments at all, but represent the mere giving of advice, rather than the adjudication of controversies; further, that an occasion for judicial action cannot properly arise until some claim is made that an actual wrong has been done or is imminent; and, finally, that the whole idea of the declaratory judgment is an unallowable innovation.</p>

Next, it may be noted that, since the numerous jurisdictions enjoying this practice all hold that a real controversy must exist, that moot cases will not be considered, and that declaratory judgments are res judicata of the points involved, such judgments cannot properly be held merely advisory; and that there can be proper occasion for judicial action before the infliction of injury or its immediate threat, is sufficiently shown, for example, by the quia timet actions, which lay before damage and without imminent danger thereof, Finally, it should be observed that an act like the pres* ent one which permits only a more general use of a device heretofore existing in our practice, cannot be held to be an unallowable innovation in Pennsylvania; for we in this State have long resorted to the declaratory judgment in many fields, though not calling it by that name.</p>

In equity proceedings to remove a cloud from the title to real estate, where no consequential relief is granted (which includes most of such cases), the court does nothing more than declare the law. In cases of bigamous marriages, the Act of April 14, 1859, P.

Under these circumstances, Chief Justice Taney, refusing to entertain the appeal, said (p. 702), inter alia, “The award of execution is a part and an essential part of every judgment passed by a court exercising judicial power; [there] is no judgment, in the legal sense of the term, without it.” This language (used, of course, in an entirely different connection) was thought by the Michigan court to show that a declaratory judgment was not one of a character which a judicial tribunal could be called on to review; but, subsequently, that part of the federal statute which provided for action by the secretary <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>of the treasury was repealed, and the Supreme Court now exercises appellate jurisdiction in such cases, even though there is no means of executing a judgment against the United States. It is obvious, therefore, that the Supreme Court itself in effect held the above-quoted language (which, by the way, was never formally filed as the opinion of the court) too broad to be accepted as a statement of a universal rule that every judgment, to be accounted such, must be susceptible of having execution thereon. The real reason for the Gordon decision was not that the judgment of the court would be incapable of execution, but that, if rendered, it would not be final, the provision for the action of the secretary being “inconsistent with the finality essential to judicial decisions”: see United States v. Klein, <a href="/us/80/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="13 Wall. 128" data-case-ids="1134251" data-case-paths="/us/80/0128-01">13 Wall. 128</a>, 144.</p>

The government had no interest adverse to the plaintiff, and the Indians affected were not parties; hence there was no real controversy to be adjudicated, and the Supreme Court refused to consider the appeal, Justice Day saying (p. 362), “In a legal sense, the judgment could not be executed.” The Michigan court thought that this “should forever put at rest” the question of the constitutionality of the Declaratory Judgments Act. But Justice Day said also (p. 361), that “judicial power......is the right to determine actual controversies arising between adverse litigants duly instituted in courts of proper jurisdiction,” and (p. 362) that a judgment entered on the then-present record would not be conclusive “when actual litigation” might bring to the court the question there involved; his opinion as a whole clearly shows that it was the lack of an actual controversy between adverse litigants pres<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>ent in court which kept the case from being a proper one for judicial decision.</p>

But, aside from these considerations, the language employed in item 5 is sufficiently clear in itself to indicate the intention of testator. There, in plain words, he first gives a life estate to his son, and, at the son’s death, he gives a life estate, or an estate during widowhood, in an undivided part of the property involved to a possible second wife of the son, if the son should remarry and leave a second wife living at the time of his death, provided this possible second wife meets with certain conditions.

Since Orie has a son in being, this son possesses a vested remainder, subject to open and let in other afterborn brothers and sisters, and also subject to be defeated by his death without issue prior to the decease of his father, and to postponement in part as to its enjoyment by his parent leaving surviving him a second wife.</p>
