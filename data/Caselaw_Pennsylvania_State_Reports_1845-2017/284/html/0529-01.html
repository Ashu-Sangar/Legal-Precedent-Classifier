It may appear by express terms, recitals or necessary implication. It was early held that the intention to execute the power must be so clearly manifested in the act of execution that it is impossible to impute any other (Andrews v. Emmot, 2 Bro. C. C. 297, 29 Repr. 162; Doe D. Nowell v. Roake, 2 Bing. 497, 130 Repr. 398, reversed, 5 B. &amp; C. 721, 108 Repr. 268, which was affirmed 6 Bing. 475, 130 Repr. 1364), and this intention should appear in the instrument: Bingham’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="64 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1021217" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0345-01">64 Pa. 345</a>., 349. A classification was then made whereby the intention to execute was said to be clearly manifested: (1) By a reference to the power in the executing instrument. (2) By a reference to the property on which the power was to operate. (3) Where the instrument of execution would have no operation except as an execution of the power: Wetherill v. Wetherill, <a href="/pa/18/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="18 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="969063" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0265-01">18 Pa. 265</a>, 271; Bingham’s App., supra, 349. Such intent is not to be presumed from the mere grant of a larger estate, though that circumstance, coupled with others, will be sufficient upon which to base a presumption of its exercise: nor should positive legal presumptions judicially arise on equivocal or uncertain conditions of fact: Bingham’s App., supra. In Scott v. Bryan, <a href="/pa/194/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="194 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="912470" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0041-01">194 Pa. 41</a>, 45, where the question was as to the execution of power of sale, the appointee having a life estate, Justice Mitchell said: “The general rule in determining the validity of the execution of powers is that the intention of the donee to execute is the turning point. Such intent will not be presumed from the mere grant of a larger estate than the grantor possessed but it may be gathered from such grant coupled with other evidence......The grantor in the deed had no estate which she could convey, and therefore her deed could not be made operative except as an execution of the power. Under all the cases this is conclusive evidence of her <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>intent to exercise the power: Wetherill v.

Dolan, <a href="/rawle/1/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="1 Rawle 231" data-case-ids="1819262" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0231-01">1 Rawle 231</a>, 248, the power was to appoint and the donee gave a mortgage without reference to the power.

A conveyance by an executor with power to sell is construed to be an execution of the power contained in the will, although that power is not recited. The law, which mainly regards the design and object of the parties, will not suppose them to do a vain and useless thing; but, if there be any other way in which their design can take effect, it shall be deemed to operate in that way.</p>

They executed a deed in fee simple of general warranty, undeniably attempting to sell real estate; not their right or interest but the specific thing, with mining rights that ordinarily could be no part of anything but a freehold, such as ventilation, drainage, opening shafts, and an option to buy the surface at $100 an acre. The executors as individuals had no such estate they could convey and therefore the deed could not operate except as an execution of the power given by the will. The executors as such or as individuals certainly intended to convey a fee. That other heirs joined might have been a wise precaution; the joinder should not defeat the intent clearly manifested by the deed. After this conveyance, the power to sell was similarly exercised in a deed for a right-of-way to the Philadelphia company. This may not have been the formal way to do it but it was an effective way.</p>

In the proceedings and the deeds, by the exception, reservation and “subject” clauses noted above, they did all that was possible to confirm their prior acts, not as individuals but as executors under the will. Such evidence of intention, though in some instances crudely expressed from the standpoint of legal theory, should not now be disturbed.
