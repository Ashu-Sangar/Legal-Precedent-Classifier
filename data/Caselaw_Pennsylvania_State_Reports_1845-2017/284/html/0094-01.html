Buchmiller, of the City of Lancaster, died in 1922, testate, survived by a widow and one daughter. His last will provides, inter alia, as follows: “I give and bequeath the net rents, income and revenue of my three-storied brick store property, Nos. 130-134 North Queen Street, and the six-story brick factory building in the rear thereof, Nos. 131-135 North Market Street, in the city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to my wife, Caroline S. Buchmiller, and my daughter, Mary jB. Led-with, in equal shares or parts, during their natural lives, and, after the death of either of them, I give and bequeath all of said net rents, income and revenue to the survivor of them during her natural life. At the death of the survivor of them, I give and bequeath the net rents, income and revenue to the issue and descendants of my daughter, Mary B. Ledwith, if any, per stirpes, for and during the term of their natural lives, and the life of the survivor of such issue and descendants ; and, in the event of the death of my said daughter, Mary B. Ledwith, without leaving issue or descendants^ then, at that time, or upon the death of the last of such issue or descendants, if any, I order and direct my executors to sell the said premises, either at public or private sale, for the best price that can be obtained therefor; and I then give the net proceeds thereof to my„ said executors, in trust, to invest the same and keep <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>the same invested, in good lawful securities, and the net income thereof, I hereby order and direct my said executors to pay over annually in equal shares, to the Lancaster General Hospital, the Young Men’s Christian Association of Lancaster, Pa., the Young Women’s Christian Association of Lancaster, Pa., and the Ship-pen School for Girls of Lancaster, Pa., for the use of the said various institutions as hereinbefore stipulated.”</p>

In 1924, the plaintiffs, Caroline S. Buchmiller, the widow, and Mary B. Ledwith, the daughter, entered into a written agreement to sell the above described land to S. Grace Hurst for $800,000 and tendered their deed therefor, which was refused on the contention that because of the paragraph of the will above quoted plaintiffs could not convey a fee simple title. In answer, plaintiffs averred that this paragraph of the will was void as it disclosed a general scheme to indefinitely tie up the property therein described in manifest transgression of the rule against perpetuities, and that as to such property there was an intestacy, by virtue of which it vested in them as the only heirs at law. The trial court sustained plaintiffs’ contention and held their deed would pass a good title in fee; from which defendants brought this appeal.</p>

Under this rule, a contingent estate to be valid must vest within the time above stated from the date of its creation. Moreover, the question as to whether the rule has been violated depends upon conditions as they existed at the death of the testator (21 R. C.

If the provision in the will is such that the title to the property may be kept in abeyance and not vest for a longer period than permitted by law the bequest is void: Davenport et al. v. Harris et al., <a href="/grant/3/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="3 Grant 164" data-case-ids="229131" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0164-01">3 Grant 164</a>. “No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest”: Gray on Perpetuities, section 201.

It is not easy to conceive of a more flagrant violation of the rule against perpetuities. The life gift to Mary’s children (none of whom was born prior to testator’s death) is plainly violative of the rule, so the only life estates which apparently are not, are those to the widow and daughter.</p>
