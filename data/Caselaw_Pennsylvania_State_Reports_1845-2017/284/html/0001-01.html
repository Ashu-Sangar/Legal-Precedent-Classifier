    <p id="b26-7" data-blocks='[["BL_26.16",26,[285,1416,1151,807]]]'>George Hogg, domiciled in Pennsylvania, died intestate September 20,1920, leaving certain tangible assets, among others, the live stock and implements on a ranch owned by him in Montana. By an original grant of letters in Montana, the personal estate there situated, consisting entirely of tangible property, was administered under the intestate laws of that jurisdiction;' and, after payment of debts and inheritance taxes, distribution was made directly to those entitled. Later, decedent’s widow, as administratrix of the estate of her husband, filed an inventory and account in Pennsylvania; and, on the insistence of the taxing authorities of this State, included therein, for purposes of taxation under the Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, the amount of the Montana tangible personalty.</p>

    <p id="b27-5" data-blocks='[["BL_27.5",27,[150,736,1154,583]]]'>We need not discuss the reasoning by which the court below reached its conclusion, for, in view of the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Frick v.
