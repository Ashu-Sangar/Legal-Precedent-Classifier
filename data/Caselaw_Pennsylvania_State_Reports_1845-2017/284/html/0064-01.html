L. 468, and May 16, 1921, P. L. 650, prematurely brought where there has been a completion of the contract, but no final settlement between the contractor and the Commonwealth.

Speaking of tbe federal statute (Act of Feb. 24,1905, c. 778, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20Stat.%20811" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="33 Stat. 811">33 Stat. 811</a>), from .which our. own legislation appears to have been copied, the United States Supreme Court said in U. S. ex rel. Texas P. C. Co. v. McCord, <a href="/us/233/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="233 U.S. 157" data-case-ids="3673668" data-case-paths="/us/233/0157-01">233 U.

The cause of action did not exist before and is the creature of the statute. The act does not place a limitation on the cause of action theretofore existing, but creates a new one upon the terms named in the statute......and gives a special remedy for it......[With us the special remedy given by the Act of 1911 is regulated and limited by the Act of 1921]. Upon well settled principles, the limitations on such liability become a part of the right conferred, and compliance with them is made essential to the assertion and benefit of the liability itself.” See also Stitzer v.

The Maryland Casualty Company, surety on the bond and one of the defendants in the court below, has appealed, contending that, under the Act of 1921, suit cannot be instituted on such a bond as here involved, by one in the position of plaintiff, “until after the complete performance of said contract and final settlement thereof with the Commonwealth,” as provided in the Act of 1921.</p>

Such settlement is the ‘same event’ for both the instituting and intervening creditors.” The phrase “same event” is taken from the opinion in the Bryant Case, where the Supreme Court states: “The act imposes a limitation of time on all claimants, the time to......run, from the same event.”</p>

It is more probable that the amending act was passed to protect the interests of the Commonwealth, since it was feared that bonds such as the one. now before us might be exhausted to the latter’s prejudice before the State had made final settlement with the contractor. Accordingly, the Act of 1921 prescribes, both the time and the manner in which suits on such bonds may be brought, the interests of material- and supply-men being made secondary to those of the Commonwealth <em>; </em>and in construing the statute this primary purpose must be kept in mind.</p>
