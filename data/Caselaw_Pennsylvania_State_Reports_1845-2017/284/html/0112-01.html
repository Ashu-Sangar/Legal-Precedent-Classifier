It became necessary to make certain repairs to the spouting of this building, and the decedent and his son were employed for the performance of the work. The cornice, and the spouting beyond, extended some fourteen inches; from the wall. Hoke undertook to secure the necessary appliances, and selected a ladder from the defendant’s stock-room, so that he could reach the point requiring repair. When placed for use, the ladder was underneath the broken spout, and about two feet away from the electric wires which are alleged to have caused the injury. On the day of the accident, he ascended, carrying tools in his right hand, and, on reaching the top, tried to place them above where the work was to be done. In so doing, he lost his balance tried to support himself with his left hand, and, as a result, came in contact with the highly charged wires, fell to the cement pavement below, and was killed. His wife brought this action to recover damages for the loss sustained, averring that no proper instructions had been given to her husband as to the harm which might result from the proximity of the beforementioned electric line, located within a short distance of his working place. The learned court below was of opinion that, no sufficient warning as to possible danger having been given to Hoke, and there being some slight evidence of lack of suitable insulation, it was for the jury to say whether there was want of due care on part of the defendant, and for it likewise to determine whether any contributory negligence appeared on the part of the deceased.
