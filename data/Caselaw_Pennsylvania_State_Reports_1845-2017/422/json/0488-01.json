On November 8, 1965, the court below entered an order dismissing Metropolitan\u2019s motions. From that order the instant appeal was taken.\nNo judgment on the verdict has ever been entered. In the absence of such judgment no appeal lies. In Menyo v. Sphar, 409 Pa. 223, 224 (footnote), 186 A. 2d 9, we recently said: \u201cToo many members of the Bar mistakenly believe that tbe appeal is from an Order which dismissed their motion for a new trial, instead of from a judgment which was entered on the verdict: [citing authorities].\u201d See also: Denmon v. Rhodes, 416 Pa. 568, 569, 207 A. 2d 860; Gelzhiser v. Fisher, 418 Pa. 88, 208 A. 2d 836.\nThe instant appeal, being premature, must be quashed.\nThe stipulation entered into between the parties\u2019 counsel and approved by the court below as to the amount of the verdict and the interest thereon cannot be construed to take the place of a judgment entered on the verdict.",
