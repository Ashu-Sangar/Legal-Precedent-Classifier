        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Cohen,\nThis appeal raises the question of whether diesel fuel used to propel vehicles used by Central Pennsylvania Quarry Stripping & Construction Company (appellant) in its highway and other real estate construction business is taxable under the Selective Sales and Use Tax Act of March 6, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1228, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a73403-1 to 3403-605. Appellant, following receipt of a use tax assessment for the period January 1, 1959, to May 31, 1962, from the Department of Revenue, pursued its administrative remedies and an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, all to no avail. It then took this appeal.\nAs originally enacted, the \u201cSelective Sales and Use Tax Act\u201d (Act) imposed a tax upon the use of tangible personal property within the Commonwealth. \u201cTangible personal property\u201d was specifically defined in seventeen categories, the ones bearing on the present problem being as follows: \u201c(1) Motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers and aircraft and all accessories, parts and equipment used in the maintenance, operation or repair of such motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers and aircraft, except gasoline.\n\u201c(3) All materials, supplies and equipment used in the construction, reconstruction, remodeling, repair and maintenance of any real estate.\n\u201c(4) Furnishings, appliances, supplies, fittings, ornaments, furniture, equipment and accessories for home, business, industrial or commercial use for indoor or outdoor purposes.\n\u201c(5) Business, industrial, professional and commercial supplies, equipment and machines of all types, including parts and accessories purchased on, or used in connection therewith.\n\u201c(13) Fuel oil and petroleum products for heating purposes, natural, manufactured and bottled gas and steam.\u201d\nThis initial enactment, however, had a short life for the Act of May 24, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1707, completely revised the Act. The relevant portions of the definition of tangible personal property became: \u201c(1) Motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers and aircraft and all accessories, supplies, parts, lubricants and equipment used in the maintenance, operation or repair of such motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers and aircraft.\u201d (3) and (4) were unchanged. In (5) the word \u201con\u201d was changed to \u201cfor.\u201d \u201c(13) Fuel oil and petroleum products for heating purposes; steam and natural, manufactured and bottled gas; electricity, intra-state telegraph service and intra-state telephone service.\u201d In addition, the May 24 amendment added an exemption from tax to \u00a7203 of the Act as follows: \u201c(f) The sale at retail, or use of gasoline and other motor fuels, the sales of which are otherwise subject to excise taxes under the \u2018Liquid Fuels Tax Act,\u2019 May 21, 1931 (P. L. 194), as amended, and the \u2018Fuel Use Tax Act,\u2019 January 14,1952 (P. L. 1965) as amended.\u201d\nTo complete the statutory picture reference must be made to three other items. One is the amending Act of April 5, 1957, P. L. 34, which added the following exemption to \u00a7203: \u201c(k) The sale at retail or use of tangible personal property to be used or consumed as fuel, supplies, ship\u2019s equipment, ships\u2019 stores or sea stores or vessels to be operated principally outside the limits of the Commonwealth.\u201d Second is the amending Act of May 9, 1957, P. L. 114, which added a further exemption to \u00a7203 as follows: \u201c(m) The sale at retail or use of coal.\u201d Third is the unappealed decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County in the case of Commonwealth v. Rohm & Haas Co., 74 Dauph. 383 (1960), in which, principally through application of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, it was held that railroad tank cars were not a species of \u201ctangible personal property\u201d as defined in the Act. Since transportation equipment was dealt with specifically in one of the categorical definitions and did not include railroad tank cars, such item was not includible as industrial equipment in the broad categories (4) and (5).\nObviously, we deal with a confusing problem of statutory interpretation. Is diesel fuel used to propel highway construction equipment \u201ctangible personal property\u201d as that term is used in the Act?\nWe turn first to category (13) since the present assessment was based upon a determination by the Department of Revenue that diesel fuel used for propulsion purposes was \u201cfuel oil\u201d as used in that section. Bureau of Sales and Use Tax, Legal Unit Ruling No. 143a. This departmental position, of course, recognized that use of such fuel was not taxable if liquid fuels or fuel use tax had been paid thereon; but here the parties have stipulated as a fact that these other taxes were not paid.\nAppellant\u2019s position is twofold: (1) diesel fuel is not \u201cfuel oil\u201d and (2) even if diesel fuel is \u201cfuel oil,\u201d it is taxable only if used for heating purposes (and not, as here, for propulsion purposes). In support of its first position, appellant cites the differing standards for \u201cdiesel fuel\u201d and \u201cfuel oil\u201d promulgated by the American Society for Testing and Materials and \u00a733 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 P.S. \u00a7533, which admonishes us to construe words \u201caccording to their common and approved usage.\u201d Here, says appellant, referring to Webster\u2019s International Dictionary (3rd Ed.), to the telephone book \u201cYellow Pages\u201d and to a public opinion survey made by it, the common usage of \u201cfuel oil\u201d does not equate this product with \u201cdiesel fuel.\u201d\nIn support of its second point appellant notes that elsewhere in the categorical definitions a modifying phrase (such as \u201cfor heating purposes\u201d here) appearing after a recital of more than one item (such as \u201cfuel oil and petroleum products\u201d here) has been held to modify both. It refers specifically to \u00a72(1) (6) of the Act (as it read during the period involved here) which included: \u201c(6) Cosmetics, toilet preparations, toilet articles, drugs and medical supplies, except when sold on prescription:\u201d and points out that the excepting phrase clearly modifies more than just \u201cmedical supplies.\u201d Similarly, in \u00a72(1) (15), \u201c(15) Live animals, fish and birds (except when purchased as food for human consumption), and supplies, food and equipment used in connection therewith\u201d; the concluding phrase \u201cuse in connection therewith\u201d applies to \u201csupplies\u201d and \u201cfood\u201d as well as \u201cequipment\u201d since food for humans is not taxable. All of this, says appellant, reveals a consistent grammatical approach taken by the legislature, one which requires a subsequent modifying phrase to apply to more than just the immediately preceding word or words.\nCertainly, the issue is not clear cut. Had the legislature inserted the word \u201cother\u201d before \u201cpetroleum products\u201d or had it left out the words \u201cfuel oil and\u201d in drafting category (13), it would be easier to conclude that this category is limited to fuels for heating use and that we must look elsewhere for treatment of fuels used for propulsion purposes. Not having done either of these, the General Assembly has left its intent uncertain.\nNevertheless, we are persuaded that category (13) does not include fuels used for propulsion purposes and that the inclusion of the words \u201cfuel oil\u201d in the category was done in order to emphasize the nature of what was being taxed \u2014 heating oils. We arrive at this position not only because we find recognized technical differences between the terms \u201cdiesel fuel\u201d and \u201cfuel oil\u201d but also because we find an indication elsewhere in the categorical definitions that fuels used for propulsion were not to be included in category (13). Thus, in the original Act of March 6, 1956, supra, \u201cgasoline\u201d was excepted from the items contained in category (1), thus revealing a rather clear legislative intent that motor fuels otherwise were \u201caccessories\u201d used in the \u201c'operation\u201d of the transportation equipment listed therein. The changes made by the Act of May 24, 1956, supra, in eliminating the single word \u201cgasoline\u201d from category (1) and establishing a broad exemption for all \u201cmotor fuels\u201d subject to the other fuel excises also shows that the legislature knew that the words \u201cmotor fuels\u201d could be distinct from \u201cfuel oil.\u201d\nTherefore, we believe that diesel fuel used to propel appellant\u2019s vehicles is not \u201cfuel oil\u201d as that term is used in category (13) of the definitions of \u201ctangible personal property.\u201d It remains to be determined, however, if diesel fuel is included in one of the other categories.\nAt the outset we are faced with appellant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth may not seek here to tax diesel fuel under one of the other categories because (1) the assessment was limited to the application of category (13) and (2) the Commonwealth gave no advance written notice of its intention to present new questions at trial as required by \u00a71104 of \u201cThe Fiscal Code,\u201d Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, 72 P.S. \u00a71104. The relevant language of \u00a71104 is as follows: \u201cThe Commonwealth may raise any question on appeal, although no appeal has been filed by it, and may introduce any facts in support of its settlement or in correction thereof, provided notice of twenty (20) days is given the appellant prior to trial of the intention of raising such new questions or presenting new facts.\u201d We agree with appellant that, for this provision to have any meaning, the Commonwealth must give the taxpayer advance written notice. Our agreement with appellant, as its argument applies here, stops at this point. We do not see in the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that diesel fuel might be taxable under a category or categories other than category (13) any raising of a new question or presenting of new facts which call for such advance notice. The question presented is whether diesel fuel is tangible personal property under the Act, and the Commonwealth is entitled to present all arguments in support of its position.\nTrue, this approach can be carried too far. For example, the Commonwealth could not avoid its obligation under \u00a71104 by saying the question is whether appellant is subject to tax and then raising a host of issues extraneous to the one on which the proceeding had developed. This is not the case here, however; so we shall proceed to an examination of the other categories.\nFirst, the Commonwealth argues that the diesel fuel used by appellant is a material or supply used in the construction and maintenance of real estate and, therefore, is included in category (3), supra. It is true that the fuel is used to operate the equipment owned by appellant and used here in the construction of highways and other real estate. We do not believe that category (3) is meant to include an item two stages removed in its actual application, however. The Commonwealth\u2019s analogy to the water used to make concrete is not in point for the water, although it does evaporate, is certainly a supply used in the first instance in the construction activity. The fuel used in the equipment is more akin to food consumed by the equipment operator, and there is no question that category (3) would not include such food apart from its nontaxable status otherwise.\nNext, we turn to the application of category (1). It can easily be argued that diesel fuel is one of the \u201csupplies\u201d referred to in the amending act of May 24, 1956, supra, and even that it is one of the \u201caccessories\u201d referred to in the original language under the Act of March 6, 1956, supra. And since it is neither \u201cgasoline\u201d as set forth in the original excepting phrase nor a fuel subject to Liquid Fuels Tax nor Fuel Use Tax as set forth in the exemption provision of the amending act, it is not thereby excluded from coverage.\nHowever, to be included it still must be used in connection with \u201cmotor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, and aircraft.\u201d The equipment used here by appellant is not \u201ctrailers, semi-trailers\u201d or \u201caircraft\u201d; the question is whether it is \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d There is no definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in the Act, but the Secretary of Revenue originally promulgated a regulation under the Act which defined the term as including such equipment. The problem is that \u00a7101 of the \u201cStatutory Construction Act,\u201d supra, 46 P.S. \u00a7601(70), contains a definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d which specifically excludes road construction equipment. This definition would be of no utility and would serve no purpose if it did not apply in situations like the present one, and no power to promulgate regulations is sufficient to allow avoidance of an applicable statutory definition. Therefore, we must conclude that diesel fuel, not being an accessory or supply used in the operation of a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d is not a type of tangible personal property included in category (1).\nThis leaves for consideration only the question of whether diesel fuel is included in the general categories (4) or (5), supra. This involves specific consideration of the Rohm & Haas Go. decision, supra. As pointed out above, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County in that case held that railroad tank cars were not included in categories (4) or (5) because another category specifically covered transportation equipment and had omitted such cars. We are inclined neither to disagree with this conclusion nor to agree that its application is controlling here.\nFirst, no category deals specifically with motor fuels used for propulsion purposes. Category (13), we have concluded, does not include such fuels at all. Category (3), we have determined, does not include such fuels by indirection. Category (1) includes, by reference to their use in specified types of transportation equipment, certain motor fuels; but it cannot be described as a category dealing specifically with motor fuels. In short, motor fuels as such receive no specific treatment in the categories and are thus subject to inclusion within categories (4) and (5).\nSecond, the exemption provisions of \u00a7203 indicate that fuels used for propulsion were intended to be covered by the general categories. The exemption in \u00a7203(k) for fuel used on certain vessels is meaningless otherwise; for ships (like railroad tank cars) were a type of transportation equipment not included in category (1). Therefore, fuel used on such ships would not be an accessory or supply within the scope of that category. Yet, fuel used for propelling transportation equipment not included in category (1) must be taxable if the exemption in \u00a7203 (k) is to have any application. Only through its inclusion in categories (4) or (5) is this possible.\nMore confusing, but still of assistance in interpreting the statute, is the exemption in \u00a7203 (m) for coal. Coal, eo nomine, is a fuel used both for heating and propulsion. It is clearly not included among the heating fuels listed in category (13), and strict application of the Rohm, \u00e9 Haas Go. decision, supra, would require our concluding that it could not be included under categories (4) or (5). Since this question is not before us, however, we specifically refrain from passing any judgment on this involved question. On the other hand, coal used as a fuel for propulsion purposes is in the same position as the diesel fuel involved here. It would not be an accessory or supply under category (1) since it is not used to propel motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers or aircraft; so the only interpretation which lends meaning to its exemption by \u00a7203 (m) is one which recognizes its inclusion in categories (4) or (5).\nFor these reasons, therefore, we believe categories (4) and (5) are applicable here; and since diesel fuel used in the operation of construction equipment qualifies as a supply for business or commercial use under category (4) and as a business and commercial supply under category (5), it is \u201ctangible personal property\u201d as defined in the Act. As such, its use by appellant, not being exempted by \u00a7203 (f), is taxable.\nIn concluding, we want to emphasize that the problem involved in this case well illustrates the confused, and sometimes contradictory, nature of the categorical definitions of tangible personal property contained in the Act prior to the amendments made by the Act of May 29, 1963, P. L. 49. The existence of this situation requires our reiteration of the fact that the discussion in this opinion is confined to a determination of the question of whether diesel fuel used to operate construction equipment is \u201ctangible personal property\u201d under the Act and should not be read as containing subtle interpretations affecting other issues not before us. Determinations regarding such other issues must await the presentation of these issues, if ever, so that each can be specifically reviewed.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien and Mr. Justice Roberts concur in the result.\nFor the nature of the nontaxables set forth in \u00a7203 see Commonwealth v. Sitlein\u2019s Junto Co., 412 Pa. 132, 194 A. 2d 199 (1903).\nWe note, as supporting the position taken by us on this point, that the current regulations under the Act (not applicable during the period involved here) exclude road machinery, etc., from the definitions of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Sales, and Use Tax Regulations, Reg. 157, Vehicles, 6; 2 COH Pa.
