        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nElizabeth M. Pratt, testator\u2019s second wife, appeals from the final decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, dismissing exceptions to an adjudication which confirmed the account of the executors of the will of Leonard O. Pratt.\nPratt died testate on March 30, 1963, leaving a will dated November 29, 1956. Three months prior to his will, Pratt and his first wife, Grace W. Pratt, entered into a property settlement agreement. In paragraph 3 of this agreement, Pratt, in discharge of his duty of maintenance and support, agreed that during his wife\u2019s life, or until she should remarry, he would pay her specified sums of money semi-monthly, plus additional amounts based upon his annual income.\nThe parties further agreed in and by paragraph 5 of said agreement: \u201c5. Husband further agrees that he will specifically provide in his Last Will and Testament effective upon the date of his death that the said Grace W. Pbatt, herein referred to as Wife, shall receive one-third (1/3) of his gross estate, including life insurance policies covering Husband\u2019s life, less the costs of administration debts and State and Federal Transfer Inheritance, Succession and Estate Taxes, or any other taxes in the nature thereof, all computed and paid on the entire estate and to be first deducted in computing the 1/3 interest of wife in the remainder. The acceptance of said share of Husband\u2019s estate by Wife shall be in complete release and acquittance of any and all obligations on the part of Husband's estate to pay the sums stipulated in Paragraph 3 hereofS*\nAfter the execution of this property settlement agreement, Pratt was divorced by Grace W. Pratt and married the appellant. Pratt in the third paragraph of his will pertinently provided: \u201cIn fulfillment of the obligation I have assumed under Paragraph 5 of the Property Settlement between Grace W. Pratt and me, dated the 30th day of August A.D. 1956, I give, devise and bequeath one third of my gross estate, as determined after deducting therefrom the costs of administration, debts due by me at the time of my death, State and Federal Transfer Inheritance, Succession and Estate Taxes, absolutely and in fee simple.\u201d\nPratt\u2019s second wife Elizabeth elected to take against his will, and at the audit of the account of his executors claimed her intestate share of her husband\u2019s estate. Elizabeth\u2019s intestate share would of course be ascertained after the deduction (inter alia) of the claims of Pratt\u2019s creditors from his testamentary estate.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court decided that, under the provisions of the property settlement between Pratt and Grace, his first wife, and under the provisions of his will, (1) Grace was entitled to receive one-third of the testator\u2019s gross estate less enumerated deductions, as a creditor and not as a legatee, and (2) that the gross estate to which Grace was entitled was testator\u2019s \u201cgross estate as determined for purposes of Federal Estate taw.\u201d\nIn this appeal, Elizabeth challenges each of the Court\u2019s aforesaid conclusions or rulings.\nThe decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, for reasons hereinafter stated, must be affirmed.\nGrace was a Creditor\nThe law is well settled that where a testator in his will gives specified property or a share of his estate in exact or substantial compliance with the terms of his obligations under an inter vivos property settlement (or separation) agreement made with his wife, that wife is a creditor of his estate and not a legatee under his Avill. Mills Estate, 367 Pa. 504, 80 A. 2d 809. Cf. also, Neller Estate, 356 Pa. 628, 53 A. 2d 122; Brown\u2019s Estate, 340 Pa. 350, 17 A. 2d 331; Mahoney Estate, 356 Pa. 358, 52 A. 2d 328; Coane\u2019s Estate, 310 Pa. 138, 165 Atl. 2; Bowman v. Knorr (No. 1), 206 Pa. 270, 55 Atl. 976. These cases in principle control and rule this case and sustain the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court that Grace is a creditor and not a legatee.\nWhile few, if any, wills have a twin brother, Mills Estate, 367 Pa., supra, is factually close and in principle controlling.\nIn Mills Estate the husband and wife entered into a written separation agreement in which the husband agreed (a) to make specified monthly payments in recognition of his duty of support and (b) to leave her in and by his will all his estate. Thereafter the parties were divorced, but the testator continued making the specified monthly payments until his death. He left a will which pertinently provided: \u201cItem 3: I give and bequeath my entire estate to Anna Irene Mills. This bequest is made in accordance with a certain agreement entered into between Anna Irene Mills and myself dated May 17, 1946.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth contended that this was a legacy which was subject to inheritance tax. We rejected this contention and held that if the debt was \u201ccontracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s Avorth,\u201d Anna Irene Mills would take as a creditor that portion of Mills Estate for which he had received \u201cfull aud adequate consideration in money or money\u2019s worth in exchange for his agreement.\u201d\nGross Estate\nTestator\u2019s will clearly shows an intention on his part to fulfill the obligations which he had contracted under paragraph 5 of the property settlement agreement.\n\u201cGross estate\u201d is a term which is always used in connection with the estate of a decedent for purposes of Federal Estate taxation, but never used in connection with an estate under the law of Pennsylvania (except in the Pennsylvania Estate Tax Apportionment Act). In Pennsylvania, the term \u201cgross estate\u201d is, we repeat, never used to mean assets which are includable in an accounting by an executor (or administrator) or even to define the assets which belong to, or are a part of, a decedent\u2019s estate. In other words, if the parties to this agreement had meant to give the wife only one-third of the estate which came into the possession of the husband\u2019s executors and which was subject to their accounting and to State inheritance taxes, they would never have used the words \u201cgross estate.\u201d This is made especially clear by the fact that if that had been their intention, the husband, after the agreement, could easily have deprived his wife, by various legal devices, of a very large part of his property and estate.\nWe therefore hold that Grace W. Pratt is entitled to receive as a creditor one-third of the gross estate of Leonard C. Pratt, \u201cincluding [all] life insurance policies covering Husband\u2019s life,\u201d valued at the time of his death, less the deductions spelled out below. This would be computed by first adding together the following assets:\nPratt\u2019s testamentary estate, including life insurance policies in the amount of $90,558.56 payable to his estate...... $198,358.45\nLife insurance policies which were payable to named beneficiaries .......... 12,712.00\nReal estate held in the name of Pratt and his second wife Elizabeth as tenants by the entireties ............... 34,100.00\nA jointly-owned bank account in the name of Pratt and his second wife Elizabeth........................... 418.47\n$240,588.92\nFrom this figure of $240,588.92, there must be deducted \u201cthe costs of administration, debts [except, of course, the debt which is created in favor of Grace W. Pratt by this Agreement] and State and Federal Transfer Inheritance, Succession and Estate Taxes, or any other taxes in the nature thereof, all computed and paid on the entire estate . . .\u201d When this net figure is ascertained, Pratt\u2019s first wife, Grace W. Pratt, is entitled to claim under this agreement one-third of it as a creditor of his estate.\nDecree affirmed, each party to pay own costs.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nThe obviously implied words \u201cto her\u201d are omitted.\nWe remanded in order that the Orphans\u2019 Court could determine this fact.\nEven in the field where the term \u201cgross estate\u201d is used, its exact meaning not infrequently puzzles many people including tax experts inside and outside the Government.\nNo decision of this Court and no statute of Pennsylvania defines or even uses the term \u201cgross estate,\u201d with this one exception, namely, the Estate Tax Apportionment Act of August 24, 1951, P. Jj. 1405, as amended, 20 P.S. \u00a7881, where the term \u201cgross estate\u201d is used and defined as meaning \u201call property of every description required to be included in computing the [federal] estate tax.\u201d\nThe Federal Estate tax return reveals no property held jointly by testator and his first wife, Grace W. Pratt, at the time of testator\u2019s death.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen :\nThe rights of Grace W. Pratt are governed by the clause contained in paragraph 5 of the property settlement agreement between her and her former husband. This clause provided: \u201c5. Husband further agrees that he will specifically provide in his Last Will and Testament effective upon the date of his death that the said Grace W. Pratt, herein referred to as Wipe, shall receive one-third (1/3) of his gross estate, including life insurance policies covering Husband\u2019s life, less the costs of administration, debts and State and Federal Transfer Inheritance, Succession and Estate Taxes, or any other taxes in the nature thereof, all computed and paid on the entire estate and to be first deducted in computing the 1/3 interest of wife in the remainder.\u201d The problem which remains, therefore, is to determine exactly what Grace Pratt is entitled to receive. We acknowledge that the specific language \u201cone-third (1/3) of his gross estate\u201d and what follows as set forth in the agreement is hardly an example of careful draftsmanship and affords no useful clue as to what was in Leonard Pratt\u2019s mind nor what Grace Pratt understood the agreement to be. However, since we must come to some decision, I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the quoted language as referring to the \u201cgross estate as determined for purposes of Federal Estate tax.\u201d As the majority seems to recognize, to refer to Federal Estate Tax concepts under these circumstances is fraught with pitfalls because of the uncertainty of the federal tax definition of \u201cgross estate.\u201d Yet, in its statement of the holding, the majority applies the tax definition to the words generally.\nThe complexity of the federal law with reference to determining the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes is well illustrated by the sheer size of that portion of the United States Code Annotated devoted to the problem. Part III of Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC) sets forth the statutory provisions governing the determination of the contents of the gross estate. These provisions and the annotations of the holdings of the cases interpreting and defining the gross estate sections of the Code are encompassed in 219 bound pages and 56 pocket part pages of 26 U.S.C.A. It is thus apparent that \u201cgross estate\u201d has been and in the future will continue to be, a source of involved litigation. Consequently, there is an immense and growing body of intricate law being developed for the purpose of determining what is meant by \u201cgross estate\u201d as defined in \u00a7\u00a72031 through 2044 of the IRC.\nSuppose, for example, the value of the estate\u2019s assets is less on the alternate valuation date a year after death than on the date of death. If the executors were to choose the alternate valuation in order to reduce the estate tax, Grace Pratt would surely complain. If they were to choose the date of death values, testator\u2019s second wife would object because of the resulting additional taxes. IRC \u00a72032 permits this delayed valuation of the assets of the estate, and could certainly provoke litigation.\nWhile the majority opinion sets forth the sums in the \u201cgross estate\u201d, it does not indicate whether any option under \u00a72032 has been elected, or whether the executor has been allowed to make an election, or, if having done so for federal tax purposes, he is here bound by that election.\nAnd further, would the majority include as life insurance within the meaning of gross estate for Federal Estate Tax purposes the proceeds of a policy irrevocably transferred to the second Mrs. Pratt with no incident of ownership retained by the defendant after Mr. Pratt\u2019s remarriage? IRC \u00a72042 does not require the inclusion of the proceeds in the gross estate. Yet, a reading of the agreement would appear to require its inclusion. Such a device could be used to deprive the first wife of as much property as any device which the majority could construct under a more practical definition of \u201cgross estate.\u201d The majority\u2019s self-conjured fear that decedent could have deprived his first wife of property rightfully hers is insupportable. Had decedent transferred property in fraudulent avoidance of the agreement, the wife had recourse to the law to preserve her interest.\nThe generality of application of the tax definition of \u201cgross estate\u201d resulting from the majority\u2019s reasoning invites an inquiry into the following situations:\nIRC \u00a7\u00a72033 and 2037 would require, in the case of a testator who had settled an irrevocable trust upon two daughters to pay income to each and at the death of each to pay the corpus supporting her share of the income to her descendants, reserving to testator only a power to appoint the corpus by will should both daughters predecease him without leaving descendants, that the entire corpus be included in the testator\u2019s gross estate even though the daughters survived him. Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company v. Rothensies, 324 U.S. 108 (1945).\nIRC \u00a72035 requires an inquiry into the motivation of the decedent\u2019s inter vivos gifts. Suppose testator made substantial inter vivos gifts which \u00a72035 would make includable in his gross estate for federal estate tax purposes but not for probate purposes. If the tax on these gifts were sufficiently large to deplete the probate estate so that it would be insufficient to pay the creditor-wife\u2019s one-third, would the majority require the donees to return the gifts?\nAs recently as March 23, 1966, the definition of \u201cgross estate\u201d for federal tax purposes was being developed. In United States v. O\u2019Malley, 383 U.S. 627, 34 L.W. 4285 (1966), the Supreme Court held that where settlor created an irrevocable inter vivos trust of which he was one of the three trustees and the trust provided that the trustees, in their sole discretion, might pay trust income to the beneficiary or accumulate the income in which event it became principal, settlor\u2019s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes included that part of the principal accumulated from income as well as the funds originally transferred to the trust, although the estate did not include any of the distributed income. This case not only illustrates that the federal law defining \u201cgross estate\u201d is an ever changing one, but as applied to the instant case it could have defeated the expectations of the parties.\nAs I have said, the contract language is anything but clear. But if, as the majority holds, testator meant his gross estate as determined for federal estate tax purposes, his reference to insurance policies would have been unnecessary, since by IRC \u00a72042 insurance proceeds on policies owned by decedent are includable in his gross estate as determined for federal tax purposes.\nHence, I would conclude that Leonard Pratt agreed to devise to Grace in satisfaction of her claim under the agreement one-third of his net probate estate (with no diminution for the debt to Grace) plus one-third of the proceeds of the insurance on his life not otherwise includable in his probate estate.\nI grant' that there are obvious difficulties in any interpretation of such unclear and indefinite language, but I think that it is safer to adopt my interpretation, since we would be dealing with terminology and practices with which we have experience. While the majority opinion studiously avoids clearly stating that it is imposing all the rules of the tax definition of \u201cgross estate\u201d on the instant agreement, the computations which the majority set forth are plainly those which might be used in computing the gross estate as determined for purposes of Federal Estate Tax. I use the conditional since one familiar with the Estate Tax provisions would recognize that \u00a72040 of the IRC requires that the portion of jointly-held property includable in the deceased participant\u2019s gross estate depends upon what fraction of the property was contributed by each individual. However, the majority sets forth no facts supporting the figures arrived at in items three and four of its computation, and the record discloses none.\nI believe that the record is insufficient to allow any computation to be made in this matter or to permit us to gauge the effect of my conclusion. Accordingly, I would remand this record to the lower court for a determination of what assets belong in the estate as inventoried by the personal representative and diminished as set forth in the agreement, and for an order for payment to Grace from the estate of an amount equal to one-third of decedent\u2019s thus diminished estate plus one-third of his life insurance proceeds.\nI dissent.",

Moreover, interpreting the words \u201cgross estate\u201d in such a manner (which is what the lower court did and said so and what this Court does without saying so) could lead to an unfair and unrealistic result, if not in this case then in one that may come tomorrow.\nFor instance, if the testator at the time of his death held title to property jointly with his first wife with the right of survivorship attached, title to this property Avould pass completely to the first wife by operation of Pennsylvania law. Its total value would also be included in the computation of the value of the estate for federal estate tax purposes. Under the Majority\u2019s construction of the present will, the first wife would receive not only complete title to the property involved but, in addition, one-third of its value as her share of the gross estate as computed for federal tax purposes. In other words, she would receive four-thirds of the value of the one property. I cannot conceive that the testator intended any such thing.\nI dissent.",
