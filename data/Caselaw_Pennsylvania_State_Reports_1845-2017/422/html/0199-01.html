Shelburne appealed to the Tax Review Board of the City of Philadelphia, which sustained the imposition of the tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> A further appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County resulted in the decision of the Tax Review Board being reversed and the assessment being set aside.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The decision of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed by the Superior Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and we allowed the petition of the City of Philadelphia for allocatur.

    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.8",225,[123,1473,1157,751]]]'>The essential facts are not in dispute. Appellee, Shelburne, was organized in 1954 for the purpose of engaging in a form of manufacturing known as “full fashioned” knitting. So far as the record reveals, it is a de jure corporation, having issued shares of stock, elected directors, and appointed corporate officers. It has one or more bank accounts; it owns certain property including the knitting machinery employed in its operations; it rents space for its facilities; it employs and pays labor; and it pays for repairs to its machinery, for spare parts, and for certain supplies used in its operations. While its officers do not receive remuneration, appellee’s president, on occasion, received a salary.</p>

      <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>The “full fashioned” knitwear manufactured by appellee is devoted exclusively to supplying Clover Knitting Mills, Inc., an affiliate having the same stockholders owning shares in the same proportion and the same directors and officers. Shelburne’s operations are comprised of knitting yarns supplied by its affiliate, Clover, into unfinished garments such as “sweater bodies” and transferring its work product to Clover. In exchange for the service rendered by appellee, Clover provides sufficient funds for Shelburne to meet its expenses. Thus, appellee’s receipts from Clover are not based upon a unit or other fixed price for the services which it performs but are calculated merely to meet Shelburne’s costs of operation. As a result of this arrangement, appellee operates in a state of economic stasis, showing neither profit nor loss.</p>

Its position is predicated on the fact that Shelburne re<a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>turns no profit and was not intended to return a profit but was organized to permit Clover to engage in a new enterprise, full fashioned knitting, without subjecting itself to the claims of creditors of that venture should it fail.</p>
    <p id="b227-3" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[122,668,1154,527]]]'>Embodied in appellee’s argument are two distinct but related contentions. It first argues that it is not an independent business entity and, thus, not within the class of enterprises sought to be subjected to the Mercantile License Tax. It further urges that even if it be deemed a business enterprise separate and apart from Clover, it is not engaged in business “for gain or profit” within the meaning of the ordinance and, therefore, not subject to the tax. We are unable to agree with either contention.</p>

    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[208,995,1152,1237]]]'>In considering the validity of appellee’s contention that it is a mere bookkeeping device rather than a truly independent business entity and, therefore, not subject to the present tax, we recognize an element of merit in the argument advanced. However, the matter is one of vantage point, for surely a corporation which does engage, by all traditional standards, in an independent and profitable activity could make the same claim with respect to its relationship to an affiliate wholly owned by the same principals. Even more persuasive would be a like claim by a subsidiary with respect to the parent corporation. Yet, even though “a wholly owned subsidiary is generally incorporated or acquired by the parent corporation for the purpose of advantageously carrying on some phase of the parent corporation’s activities or business, the courts have been reluctant to disregard the separate legal entities . . . merely to grant relief from sales, or similar taxes at the expense of the state or its subdivisions.” <em>Commonwealth v.

While the principals of Shelburne seek to claim the protection of corporate identity for one purpose, to insulate Clover from the claims of creditors of the “full fashioned” knitting operations, they ask that we pierce the corporate veil for the purpose of reducing the incidence of taxation.

What tax consequences should flow in the instant case is a matter of legislative intent. While “courts neither follow the law’s fictions blindly nor reject them out of hand,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> with respect to appellee’s contention that, for the purpose of the present tax, it is not an entity separate and apart from Clover, nothing has been called to our attention which persuades us to disregard those principles which otherwise guide us in the determination of corporate identity. All the indicia of such identity are presented by appellee. Appellee conducts a form of activity which is subject to taxation, if it may be deemed an independent business. It has elected to treat itself as such a business for some purposes; it <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>may not disavow that identity merely to avoid the burden of taxation.</p>

However, in our view, the mere fact that Shelburne’s operations are not profitable when viewed from the perspective of its balance sheet, the relationship of its expenditures to its receipts, is not sufficient to place it beyond the reach of the instant tax. The terms “gain or profit” are not limited to the accomplishment of an excess of receipts over expenditures. A contrary conclusion would require the adoption of a narrower construction of the phrase “gain or profit” than has generally been accorded those terms by courts of other jurisdictions and one more circumscribed than we believe was intended by their inclusion in the present ordinance.</p>

There, two corporations engaged in the petroleum business organized a pipe line company to operate and extend a line for the transmission of oil. The pipe line company dealt exclusively with the parent corporations and received in payment for the services which it rendered amounts just sufficient to meet its expenses. In contesting the imposition of the tax, the pipe line company argued that it was not a corporation organized for profit, contending that it had never earned a profit and that its income had never exceeded the cost of maintenance and operation. In sustaining the imposition of the tax, the court stated: “It is hard to conceive that the formation of the cor<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>poration was had with a view other than the realization of profit.

      <em>Tax Review Board v. Brine Corp., </em>supra, is not here relevant, that decision having involved a consideration of the concept of “passive income”. Likewise, <em>Jefferson Grocery Co. of Pittsburgh v. Pittsburgh School District, </em>supra, presented a problem of statutory construction involving the phrase “wholesale dealer or wholesale vendor” under an ordinance other than that which controls the instant case. We do not view the considerations relevant to the disposition of that case here controlling.</p>
