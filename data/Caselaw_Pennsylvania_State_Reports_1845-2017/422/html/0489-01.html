The legislature, by the enactment of §612 of the Code, has now supplied the legislative deficiency pointed out in <em>Anderson Appeal, </em>supra; §612 expressly imposes liability on the Commonwealth for certain damages to abutting property<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> even though there has not been an actual “taking”.

The language, except as to tense, “taken, injured or destroyed” in Article XVI, §8 of our Constitution extending liability for consequential damages to municipal or other corporations is identical to the definition of “condemn” under §201(1) of the Code. There is no sound reason why the effective date of an act of condemnation in the case of damages resulting from “injury” to property under §612 of the Code should be interpreted differently than the effective condemnation date under the constitutional provision; if so interpreted, there was no “condemnation effected” in the case at bar until the physical work of construction was begun and, since such took place after June 22, 1964, §612 should be applicable.</p>

In the first place, the damages which an abutting owner may recover as consequential must be proved; such proof must not be of a speculative or remote nature but, rather, of actual damages incurred: <em>Ogontz Avenue, </em><a href="/pa/225/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="225 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="965256" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0126-01">225 Pa. 126</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.%201096" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="73 A. 1096">73 A. 1096</a>.

It is not the projected plan which causes the damage; it is the work pursuant to the plan which causes the “damage” and, until such work has been begun, the nature and extent of the damage cannot be evaluated. In <em>Sunbury E. R. R. Co. v. Hummell, </em><a href="/pa/27/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="27 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="979429" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0099-01">27 Pa. 99</a>, Mr. Justice Lowrie, speaking for this Court, said: “It is unreasonable to ask intelligent men to make a sworn estimate of a mere risk, which can be founded on no present data, but only on an imaginary state of things which may never exist, or which may come complicated with other things which may totally change their character;” (at p. 107). In the second place, if we pinpoint the date of filing the plan as the date of the condemnation at which the statute of limitations begins to run, and, if the actual work under the plan is not begun for years after the plan was filed,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> the property owner finds himself in a dilemma; if he starts suit before the actual work has begun, his damages are speculative whereas if he delays suit until the work is begun he may find himself barred by the statute.</p>

As we have previously noted, where the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, acting through its Department of Highways, has filed its plan which involves the “taking” of property, then the date upon which the plan was filed is the date upon which the condemnation is effected. Where the Commonwealth under the plan does not “take” property but the work contemplated under the plan will involve an “injury” to an abutting property owner, then, by analogy to the case law applicable to municipal or other corporations having the power of eminent domain, the date upon which a condemnation shall be deemed effected should be the date when the work shall have been begun, i.e., when the “injury” shall have actually occurred. Applying such rule there was no injury effected in the case at bar until 1965 at which time §612 was in effect.</p>
