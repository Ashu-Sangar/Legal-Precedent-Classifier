    <p id="b329-10" data-blocks='[["BL_329.17",329,[154,1472,1152,532]]]'>Patricia Ann Lambert, plaintiff instituted an action of trespass against Stephen S. Soltis. Soltis is a dentist, who treated plaintiff’s teeth. Plaintiff contends that Dr. Soltis’s treatment was negligent and constituted malpractice, and as a result of such treatment she suffered serious injuries. The Court ordered plaintiff to try only the issue of liability. At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case the Court entered a compulsory nonsuit, which the Court en banc refused to take off. Plaintiff thereafter appealed to this Court.</p>

It is by now hornbook law that this is the applicable and correct principle of law. That portion of the brief pertinently states: The defendant, during the period of June to September, 1960, was a practicing dentist in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>The plaintiff first went to see him in June, 1960, to have some work done on a chipped tooth. On the occasion of this particular visit, the plaintiff was accompanied by her father and the defendant indicated to them that the plaintiff had two or three cavities which should be filled and the plaintiff and her father agreed that the defendant could go ahead and fill the cavities. Plaintiff thereafter saw defendant on at least twelve occasions through the months of July, August, and September, 1960. According to the testimony of the plaintiff, the defendant never took any X-rays of her teeth notwithstanding the fact that he was requested to do so by both her and her father. On each occasion when plaintiff was treated by defendant he injected an anesthetic, Xylocaine, into her gums with a needle. On each of these occasions no unusual result followed the injection of the Xylocaine. In September, 1960, plaintiff came to defendant’s office and complained of pain in a tooth which had previously been filled. Defendant advised a “root canal”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> He testified at the trial as follows: “Q. And then you came in and said to her, ‘You need a root canal because there is a slight thickening of this pulp,’ is that correct? A. Yes. Q. You explained to her what had to be done? A. Yes, sir. Q. And she agreed that you do it? A. Yes, sir.”</p>

The only exception to this otherwise invariable rule is in cases where the matter under investigation is <em>so simple, </em>and the lack of skill or want of care <em>so obvious, </em>as to be within the range of the ordinary experience and comprehension of even nonprofessional persons, as, for example, where a gauze pad is left in the body of a patient following an operation (Davis v. Kerr, <a href="/pa/239/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="239 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="995992" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0351-01">239 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20A.%201007" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="86 A. 1007">86 A. 1007</a>), or where a dentist, in working on a tooth, uses a tool with a small rotating emery disc at the end and allows it to slip and to remain revolving in the patient’s mouth, grinding and tearing her tongue (Dux v. Shaver, <a href="/pa-super/105/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="105 Pa. Super. 344" data-case-ids="701622" data-case-paths="/pa-super/105/0344-01">105 Pa.

So, likewise, there might be imagined a case where a surgeon engaged in removing a tumor from a patient’s scalp would let his knife slip and cut off his patient’s ear, or where he <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>undertook to stitch a wound on his patient’s cheek and by an awkward move would thrust his needle into the patient’s eye. It would be a matter of <em>common knowledge and observation </em>that such things do not ordinarily attend the service of one exercising ordinary skill and experience in the work of surgery <em>because they involve ulterior or extraneous acts or omissions the judgment of which would not require scientific opinion. </em>But such is not the present case.’ ”</p>

Stearne (pp. 541, 542, A. pp. 844, 845), that all that had been shown was that the defendant did certain things and failed to do other things, <em>but that there was no evidence as to whether a careful and competent practitioner would have done otherwise. </em>Accordingly the opinion proceeded to state that ‘It is argued . . . that a jury of laymen under the present facts could find negligence in the same manner as in any other tort action. It is urged that a lay jury might find that plaintiff’s jaw was found to have been broken, and from this fact might conclude that defendant had used unwarranted force and was therefore negligent. We disagree with such doctrine .... Negligence may not be <em>inferred </em>by <em>laymen </em>merely because the jaw was found to have been broken. A jaw could be broken even though there was no lack of care or skill by the dentist. <em>Expert testimony is necessary to establish negligent practice in any profession </em>.... As plaintiff failed to offer any <em>expert </em>witness to establish the measure of professional skill required of a dentist in extracting a tooth, she did not meet the burden of es<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>tablishing, by the weight of the evidence, that defendant failed to treat her with reasonable and ordinary professional skill. ... In all such <em>malpractice cases </em>this Court has uniformly applied the above principles:’ [citing many cases].

However, that case involved a fall of an elderly man who had a spastic paralysis of his right side which, it is a matter of common knowledge, might and often does result in a bone fracture. The Court said (pages 104 and 105) : “The circumstances here command an exception to the general rule which requires the production of expert testimony for it is a matter of common knowledge that the fall of an elderly person may be due to or accompanied by a fracture of the bony structure of the body; furthermore, when subsequent to such fall, the patient suffers severe pain, a ‘crunching’ noise in the hip where the severe pain is centered, an outward turning of the leg and other symptoms, such symptoms point to the necessity for the use, in arriving at a diagnosis, of the commonly accepted method of fracture detection, i.e., the X-ray.” The Court concluded that not every case involving a failure of a physician to use X-rays as an aid to diagnosis presents a prima facie case of negligence.</p>
