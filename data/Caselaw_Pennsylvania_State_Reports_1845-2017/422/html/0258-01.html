Analysis will demonstrate that this language was an accurate expression of testatrix’s intent. Where a legatee is given one-fourth of the income from an entire residuary estate, the ascertainment thereof is a matter of simple arithmetic. However, it is much more difficult to express an intent to <em>set aside </em>shares of common stocks (the assets in this estate) which will produce the <em>emact </em>amount of income which a legatee would have received if he had been given one-fourth of the income from the residuary estate. This intent was accurately expressed by the words “approximately equal”, since the income from common stocks often varies from year to year.</p>
