Moran executed a written agreement with the brokerage firm of Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, which provided for the maintenance of a margin account by Mrs. Moran with that firm. Paragraph 15 of that agreement specifically stated: “If any controversy arises out of this contract it shall be determined by arbitration.”</p>
    <p id="b91-9" data-blocks='[["BL_91.15",91,[122,1575,1154,521]]]'>Mrs. Moran alleged that on March 17, 1960, the brokerage firm induced her consent to purchase 1,000 shares of Carrier Corporation stock by misrepresentations and misleading statements and that the brokerage firm made an unauthorized purchase of 1,000 shares of American Cable and Radio stock on September 1, 1960. In consequence of the alleged mishandling of her brokerage account, Mrs. Moran claimed losses in excess of $14,000 incurred chiefly in the purchase and resale of the stocks mentioned above.</p>

After making written inquiries to the New York Stock Exchange and to the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning what remedies were available, Mrs. Moran <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>entered into a submission agreement in August 1968 with tbe brokerage firm providing for tbe dispute to be arbitrated by five persons acting under the rules of tbe New York Stock Exchange. After a bearing, tbe arbitrators entered an award for Mrs. Moran on October 30, 1963, in tbe amount of $1,564.05, plus $240 for costs.</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[196,712,1152,484]]]'>Dissatisfied with this result, Mrs. Moran then filed a petition for modification and/or vacation of tbe arbitration award on January 27, 1964, in tbe Court of Common Pleas of Erie County. After having permitted Mrs. Moran to amend her original petition four times, the trial court sustained with prejudice tbe brokerage firm’s preliminary objections to tbe petition. From that order of November 8, 1965, dismissing her petition, Mrs. Moran has appealed to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.6",92,[196,1205,1154,853]]]'>Mrs. Moran’s main contentions can be summarized as follows: (1) tbe 1960 margin agreement is void and unenforceable insofar as it requires that all stock disputes to arise in the future be resolved by arbitration; (2) tbe 1963 agreement of submission to arbitration [submission agreement] is also void and unenforceable because (a) it constitutes an illegal waiver of tbe remedial advantages of tbe Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934 and (b) arbitration is not tbe proper judicial forum to decide any disputes between investors and their brokers and (3) Mrs. Moran cannot be said to have elected to submit her claims to arbitration because she was only complying with tbe express mandate of tbe void margin agreement and bad no knowledge of her right to avail herself of remedies in a court of law.</p>

Ct. 26</a>, where it was held that an agreement restricting creation of a liability would violate the policy of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, Mr. Justice Reed stated: “We need not and do not go so far in this present case. By the terms of the agreement to arbitrate, petitioner is restricted in his choice of forum <em>prior to the existence of a controversy. While the Securities Act does not require petitioner to sue, a waiver in advance of a controversy stands upon a different </em>footing.” <a href="/us/346/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="346 U.S. 427" data-case-ids="6931436" data-case-paths="/us/346/0427-01">346 U.S. at 438</a> (emphasis added). Mr. Justice Jackson added, in his concurring opinion, this terse dictum: “I agree with the Court’s opinion insofar as it construes the Securities Act to prohibit waiver of a judicial remedy in favor of arbitration by agreement made before any <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>controversy arose.

    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[210,488,1155,1406]]]'>Thus, far from containing language construing as void a submission agreement made after a controversy arose, the <em>WilJco </em>opinion has some language, albeit dictum, which would condone such an agreement. “Voluntary submission of an existing claim to arbitration would not appear to be a ‘waiver’ within the meaning of the Securities Act non-waiver clause. [Section 14, 15 U.S.C. §77n] . . . although he may not know the extent of recovery, a claimant who submits a dispute to arbitration knows in considerable detail just what he is entrusting to whom. Hence, if a settlement is permitted because the consequences of the bargain are clear, a submission should not be barred as a waiver of recovery rights. Nor should a submission be invalid as a waiver of the judicial forums made available by the Act. A submission, like the filing of a complaint, initiates proceedings to dispose of a particular claim. It would seem that the mandate of the non-waiver clause [15 U.S.C. §77n] is to leave open the defrauded investor’s choice of forums and recovery methods until he is ready to begin proceedings. . . . Binding election of a permissible remedy, be it litigation, settlement, or arbitration, should be valid when the action taken actually sets in motion the machinery which will decide the dispute.”: Notes, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Yale%20L.J.%20985" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="62 Yale L.J. 985">62 Yale L.J. 985</a>, 994, 995 (1953).

Evidence of record directly refutes this contention. On November 10, 1962, Mrs. Moran wrote to Mr. John S. Watterson, Jr., of the brokerage firm asking for an explanation of the margin agreement. In that letter Mrs. Moran referred to two previous letters which she had received: “In Mr. Mc-Kernan’s letter to me [Mrs. Moran] dated February 6, 1962, he [Mr. McKernan of the New York Stock Exchange] says — ‘We have always felt that such matters are more properly for resolution before <em>a court of law or board of arbitration.’</em>
