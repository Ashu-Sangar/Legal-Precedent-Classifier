One is located at 6628 North Eighth Street, in Philadelphia; the other at 6644 North Eighth Street. On December 2, 1960, the Rands signed a so-called standard sales agency contract engaging Victor J. Zaro, a salesman in the employ of Sork, to procure a purchaser for 6628 North Eighth Street, at the suggested price of $225,000, and agreeing to pay a commission of 5% of the selling <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>price. Sork produced a prospective purchaser, Edward A. Garabedian, and by [a written] agreement dated February 14,1961, the Rands agreed to sell 6628 North Eighth Street to Garabedian, and Garabedian agreed to buy, for a total consideration of $220,000. The agreement named J. M. Sork and the Priestman Co. and V. J. Zaro as agent, and contained a provision that the agent’s commission was to be 5% if title passed, and in case of default, was to be one-half of the amount deposited.”</p>

Eighth Street was a pre-condition to the sale of 6628 North Eighth Street; (2) the Rands, the sellers, notified Sork <em>before </em>the Rands had authorized or signed any binding agreement of sale for 6644 North Eighth <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>Street, that they had changed their minds and no longer wished to sell 6644 North Eighth Street; (3) having exercised their discretion<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> not to sell 6644 North Eighth Street at all, the Rands were correct in insisting that the previously valid agreement of sale of 6628 North Eighth Street became null and void by its own terms; (4) the Rands, no longer bound by any agreement of sale,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> could rightfully refuse Sork any commission because his right thereto was predicated on the passing of title.</p>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[182,939,1150,593]]]'>Sork has assiduously argued in his original and reply brief that the crucial issue in this case is whether or not the Garabedians had “a reasonable credit standing”. Sork asserts that, if this Court believes that they did have such “standing”, then Sork produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to meet the sellers’ terms but who was refused the chance due to the Rands’ wrongful refusal to accept their credit. Consequently, Sork is entitled to his commissions. See : <em>Connell v. Avon Garage Company, </em><a href="/pa/391/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="391 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1276855" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0189-01">391 Pa. 189</a>, 193-195, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="137 A.2d 765">137 A. 2d 765</a>, 767,-768 (1958).</p>

If <em>any one </em>of the contingencies failed, which, as we discussed above did occur when the Rands refused to sell 6644 North Eighth Street, then the entire agreement failed and with it Sork’s right to a commission. The injustice that Sork complains of derives from the agreement of sale of 6628 North Eighth Street itself. In that agreement, the sellers were al<a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>lowed to state that, in order for it to be binding, a <em>second </em>piece of real estate had to be sold. Most importantly, there was no provision in the first agreement that prohibited the Rands from withdrawing the second property from sale. Both of Sork’s commissions were predicated on the continuing desire of the Rands to sell 6644 North Eighth Street.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

There being no restriction on the Rands’ power to refuse to sell their second piece of property, 6644 North Eighth Street for <em>any reason </em>and there being no allegation or proof of the Rands’ bad faith in so doing (see <em>Axilbund v.
