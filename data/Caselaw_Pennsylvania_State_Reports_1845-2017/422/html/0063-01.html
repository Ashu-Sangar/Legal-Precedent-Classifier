Alleging that various of the statements were libelous, <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>appellant instituted an action in the lower court and obtained a substantial verdict. Pending determination of appellee’s motions for judgment non obstante veredicto or a new trial, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em><a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">376 U.S. 254</a> (1964).

The doctrines there set forth have been developed in subsequent litigation. See, <em>Garrison v.

Neither can we find as a matter of law that appellant satisfied the requisites of his cause of action under <em>Sullivan </em>or that, were a new trial to be granted, he could not do so.</p>
    <p id="b89-6" data-blocks='[["BL_89.7",89,[125,1635,1156,472]]]'>In the very recent case of <em>Rosenblatt v.

Because trial here was had before New York Times, we have concluded that we should not foreclose him from attempting retrial of his action.” We agree with this language and so hold here.</p>
    <p id="b89-7" data-blocks='[["BL_89.8",89,[129,2128,1155,310]]]'>Appellant, in addition to requesting a new trial, also asks that we find as a matter of law that the statements sued upon were defamatory and that they applied to him. We, however, have determined that fairness to the parties requires a remand of the case on all issues.</p>

      <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>Finally, appellant argues that several of the articles defamed him as a private citizen, and that, therefore, <em>Sullivan </em>does not apply. Because of the chronology of the case with regard to <em>Sullivan, </em>there was no opportunity to present this question to the lower court and therefore no determination was made in the court below. Since the court below will be able to pass upon the question on remand, we do not believe it is properly here for decision now.</p>
