MacLatcbie (MacLatchie), for personal injuries and property loss suffered as the result of a collision which occurred at a street intersection on April 5, 1957, between Gray’s automobile and an automobile owned and driven by MacLatchie. At the time of the accident, MacLatchie was insured by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide), under an automobile liability policy, the coverage of which was limited to $5,000 for personal injuries plus interest, costs and property damage. Nationwide undertook to defend MacLatchie pursuant to the provisions of its insurance policy. Gray obtained a $15,000 jury verdict against MacLatchie. Post-trial motions for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial were denied and the judgment entered on the verdict was affirmed per curiam, on May 22, 1961, by this Court: <em>Gray v.

Three very sound reasons justify the adoption of this "nonpayment” view: (1) such view prevents an insurer from benefiting from the impecuniousness of an insured who has a meritorious claim but cannot first pay the judgment imposed upon him; (2) such view negates the possibility that the insurer would be “. . . less responsive to its trust duties where the insured is impecunious than where the insured is able to pay the excess judgment. Were payment the rule, an insurer with an insolvent insured could unreasonably refuse to settle, for, at worst, it would only be liable for the amount specified by the policy.

If, as we believe, the insured’s claim is based on a breach of contract and is not personal to the insured, then it would follow that, if the insured were to file in bankruptcy, his cause of action against the insurer would be a part of the bankrupt estate which would vest in his trustee in bankruptcy. <em>In Re Layton, </em><a href="/f-supp/221/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="221 F.

This duty arises not so much under the terms of the contract but is said to arise because of the contract and to flow from it.’ Southern Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.

I [District Judge East] would liken this duty to. that of <em>an implied contractual warranty </em>on the part of the compensated insurer to at all times exercise due care and good faith when utilizing its expertise during its exclusive control of investigating and conducting the defense of claims against its insured. <em>Under this concept the chose in action sounds in contract rather than in tort </em>— likened to a manufacturer’s or a stevedore’s im<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>plied warranty of fitness and meet and proper conduct.” <em>In Re Layton, </em><a href="/f-supp/221/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="221 F.

If we permit the assignment in cases such as the one at bar, bankruptcy proceedings would be unnecessary; the insured, after a judgment has been rendered against him, can follow the more simple and less expensive procedure of assigning the cause of action against the insurer, directly, to his judgment creditor.</p>
    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[190,819,1150,647]]]'>The final phase of our inquiry is to answer the question, if the insured’s right of action is in assumpsit which would pass to his trustee in bankruptcy if he was forced into or filed for bankruptcy, is this right of action assignable? In an assumpsit action, where the measure of damages is fixed and the amount of damages can be specifically ascertained, the action may be assigned even though litigation is necessary for its collection: Glenside <em>Home Protective Association v. Cheltenham and Abington Sewerage Company, </em><a href="/pa-d-c/81/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="81 Pa.

We disagree. As Judge Hoffman so ably reasoned in his dissenting opinion: “The fears of the lower court are unwarranted. The possibility of collusion between a judgment holder and an insured is in no way increased by an assignment. If the insured’s liability on the judgment is not affected by the assignment, the interests of the parties are similarly unaffected. Whether the action would be brought in the name of the policy-holder or in the name of the assignee, the policy-holder would be intent upon relieving himself of the excess judgment and the assignee would be seeking to secure the balance due him. If the insured’s liability is terminated by the assign<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>ment, as in the present case, the possibility of collusion is more remote. Having been relieved of the judgment, the insured no longer has any pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation.” <em>Gray v.

It might be said that the result reached herein will cause more injured claimants to propose settlement for the policy limit when the insurance company is defending the action against an insured who is apparently judgment-proof. <em>Yet the insurer has nothing to fear so long as its refusal to settle is made in good faith.
