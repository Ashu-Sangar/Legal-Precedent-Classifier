Based upon appellants’ allegation that real estate would be illegally exempted thereby, the chancellor reasoned that the project was amenable to challenge by one whose tax burden would be affected.

Private parking is supplied only on a profit basis and, following the profit motive, when there is no profit there is no parking.
