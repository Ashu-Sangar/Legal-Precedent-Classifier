    <p id="b267-2" data-blocks='[["BL_267.3",267,[145,381,1152,470]]]'>
      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>The record reveals that prior to the instant petition, appellant petitioned the court below to permit an appeal nunc pro tunc. Counsel was appointed to represent appellant in the matter. However, after considering the trial record, counsel informed the court that in his opinion there was no ground which would merit an appeal and requested permission to withdraw from the case. Permission was granted and the petition dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b267-3" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[145,873,1151,370]]]'>In dismissing the present petition, the court below relied in part on the conclusion of counsel appointed on the nunc pro tunc petition that an appeal was not warranted. The court concluded, therefore, that appellant had been afforded his day in court and that no deprivation had occurred by reason of his failure to obtain appellate review. We do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[143,1255,1152,1076]]]'>It is not our impression that the <em>Douglas </em>decision was intended merely to replace counsel for the courts as a screen to determine which cases have sufficient merit to warrant the appointment of counsel for the prosecution of an appeal. In our view, the mere fact that counsel did not consider appellant’s prospects on appeal as favorable was not of itself sufficient grounds for holding that appellant’s constitutional right to the assistance of counsel on appeal had been fully satisfied. That right embodies more than the right to the assistance of counsel in “meritorious cases”; it embodies the right to representation on appeal if the defendant so desires, whatever the prospects of success may appear to be to the court or counsel. As this Court pointed out in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Cunningham v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/421/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="421 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1900298" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0157-01">421 Pa. 157</a>, 160, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="218 A.2d 811">218 A. 2d 811</a>, 813 (1966), “had appellant the funds with which to retain counsel, we do not doubt that he would have been able to indulge his grievances, real or fanciful, on appeal. Appellant was entitled to no less.”</p>

      <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>Accordingly, we are nnable to conclude that appellant may be foreclosed from exercising his constitutional right to representation on appeal merely on the assurance or opinion of counsel that there are no grounds to warrant appeal. Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Cunningham v. Maroney, </em>supra. The right to such assistance, however, as is the case with all constitutional rights, may, under appropriate circumstances, be waived. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Robinson v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/420/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="420 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1898565" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0072-01">420 Pa. 72</a>, 76, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20637" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="215 A.2d 637">215 A. 2d 637</a>, 640 (1966); cf. <em>Henry v.
