L. 1242, §420, 36 P.S. §670-420); (c) in the regulation of traffic and in the interest of public safety, the Commonwealth, acting within the scope of its police powers, may make reasonable rules and regulations which may dilute or diminish the rights of abutting property owners without liability to respond in damages. The theory is that, in such field, the interest of the abutting property owner must be subordinated to the interest of the public at large. In <em>Breinig, </em>supra (at pp. 482, 483, 484), this Court stated: “The absolute prohibition of driveways to an abutting owner’s land which fronts on a single thoroughfare, and which cannot be reached by any other means, is unlawful and will not be sustained. But the public authorities have the undoubted right to regulate the manner of the use of driveways by adopting such rules and regulations, in the interest of public safety, as will accord some measure of access and yet permit public travel with a minimum of danger. The rules and regulations must be reasonable, striking a balance between the public and the private interest. The abutter cannot make a business of his right of access in derogation of the rights of the traveling public. He is entitled to make only such use of his right of access as is consonant with traffic conditions and police requirements that are reasonable and uniform. . . . And high<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>ways may be so regulated by them [tbe Commonwealth and its political subdivisions] as to limit the rights of abutting owners: [citing authorities]. . . . But such acts of regulation, or limitation of rights, under the police powers must be reasonable. They cannot be sustained if they are capricious, arbitrary, or unduly delimit and unreasonably intermeddle with the rights of an abutting property owner. . . . Ordinarily the determination of this question is a legislative or executive matter, and the presumption is established that these officials act lawfully in exercise of their discretion. But it is nevertheless the duty of the judiciary to inquire into that exercise, and if it is found the discretion of these other branches of government has been abused, we interfere immediately to relieve against oppressive and arbitrary action. This happens only when the asserted exercise of the police power is manifestly unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory, and the action of the officers patently unreasonable or oppressive.”; (d) if the Commonwealth, by virtue of and in the reasonable exercise of its police power, restricts or limits the use of the highway in such manner that there may be a dilution or diminution of the rights of the abutting property owners, save only in regard to reasonable access to and from the highway, the Commonwealth does not become liable to respond in damages for such dilution or diminution: <em>McCrady Case, </em>supra, p. 593, and the authorities therein cited; (e) in the absence of statutory authority, the Commonwealth is not liable for <em>consequential </em>damages incurred in the construction or reconstruction of highways:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.

Moreover, the construction of this highway did not deprive Wolf of their right to access to the highway and from the highway to their property; after the taking and after the construction of the highway, reasonable means of ingress to the property and egress from the property were fully preserved. <em>McCrady Case, </em>supra, upon which Wolf and the court below so heavily relied, presented an entirely different situation. In <em>McCrady Case, </em>the Commonwealth, by the installation of high curbing along the highway frontage of the McCrady property, had made exceedingly difficult and, in some instances impossible, any ingress and egress into the property and the property owner had for all intents and purposes been deprived of any reasonable right of access to and from the highway.</p>

By reason of such necessitated circuity of travel, Wolf contends that business which might have been reasonably expected and anticipated to be generated from vehicular traffic in the eastbound lanes will be considerably diminished and that such diminution should be considered as an element in determining the <em>after </em>value of the property.

In <em>Johnson’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/344/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="344 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="1210977" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0005-01">344 Pa. 5</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20880" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="23 A.2d 880">23 A. 2d 880</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> the property owner contended that the diversion of traffic arising from the construction of a new highway and consequent loss of business to his restaurant-beer parlor were elements to be considered in determining the <em>after </em>value of his property. This Court, noting that it was true “that many who formerly passed on the road <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>south of [Johnson’s] restaurant now take another route, resulting in loss of custom to [Johnson], this change in travel is due not to the taking of [Johnson’s] land hut to a change in the road system of that locality whereby the travelers at points one-quarter mile and one mile from [Johnson’s] land are given the choice of alternative routes having different attractions”; (p. 9), held that the loss in traffic was due to changes remote from the land taken, that the diversion of traffic was not an element in determining the <em>after </em>value of the property and that any loss which resulted was damnum absque injuria. The Court said (at p. 10) : “The state owed no duty to [Johnson] to see that travel continued to pass by his door. . . . The owner of land abutting on a highway has no property or other vested right in the continuance of a certain amount of traffic over that highway so long as he is not deprived of ingress or egress. Here the diversion of traffic was not due to the taking of [Johnson’s] land, but was occasioned by the laying out of a new road which attracted the public. ...

The right also includes the further right to connect with or reach the system of public highways, which right is also subject to reasonable restrictions under the police power of the State in protecting the public and facilitating traffic. The right does not include the right to travel in any particular direction from one’s property or upon any <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>particular part of the public highway right-of-way because, after one is upon the highway he has the same right as all other travelers and the right of travel is a public right and controlled by the police power of the State. Nor does the right of ingress or egress to or from one’s property include any right in and to the existing public traffic on the highway, or any right to have such traffic pass by one’s abutting property. The reason is that all traffic on public highways is controlled by the police power of the State, and what the police power may give an abutting property owner in the way of traffic on the highway it may take away, and by any such diversion of traffic the State and any of its agencies are not liable for any decrease of property values by reason of such diversion of traffic, because such damages are ‘damnum absque injuria’, or damage without legal injury.</p>

Respondent has never had a property right in the traffic, great or small, on the highway, nor a right to recover damages for a decrease in value of her premises by reason of the diversion of traffic away from her property, nor has she had a property right to have the same amount of traffic pass her property as before or to have it move in the same direction. Respondent’s property right of access has never extended further than the right to enter <em>upon </em>the highway or to leave it and have reasonable connection to the public road system. Once upon the highway, the police power of the State controlled and respondent and her invitees were subject to the ‘Rules of the Road’ as established . . . under the police power of the State. . . .” (at p. 857).</p>
