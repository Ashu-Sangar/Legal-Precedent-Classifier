Mushinsky was shot as he was leaving the Blue Belle Coffee Shop in Pittsburgh by one Robert Heard, a police officer for the City of Pittsburgh. Mushinsky died within an hour. Complaint in trespass was brought by Raymond Graysneck, administrator of decedent’s estate, under the Pennsylvania wrongful death<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and survival acts<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> against Robert Heard, the City of Pittsburgh and the owners of the Blue Belle Coffee Shop— Gregory Pappas, Steve Kavalis, Chris Pappas, and Andy Pappas.</p>
    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.9",136,[210,1242,1150,476]]]'>The City of Pittsburgh [City] filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the complaint based mainly on its assertion of immunity from liability for a tort committed by its police officer acting within the scope of his governmental authority. By an order filed on August 17, 1965, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County sustained the City’s position and dismissed the complaint as to the City of Pittsburgh. Plaintiff then appealed to this Court.</p>

These relevant facts are that at approximately 5:00 a.m., April 12, 1964, the deceased, Charles F. Mushinsky was sitting in the rear of the Blue Belle Coffee Shop when a series of fights broke out among the patrons. Mushinsky decided to leave the premises to escape the fracas. As Mushinksy was exiting, Robert Heard, an off-duty City of Pittsburgh police officer who was nevertheless participating in the fights, attempted to quell the disturbances by drawing a revolver which discharged, striking accidentally Mushinsky fatally in the chest.</p>

I wonder, however, why he says that if the municipality immunity from tort is to be abolished, this case “would not be the appropriate vehicle.” I would not wait for the perfect case to overrule an imperfect rule. Governmental immunity is so wrong in principle, so contrary to the most elementary rules of justice, and so opposed to the modern and healthy doctrine that government should not enjoy any privilege denied to the people who constitute it, that this Court should welcome the opportunity — any opportunity — to eradicate, abolish and forever wipe out the fallacious, unjust, cruel proposition that the government, like the king, can do no wrong. Our very nation is founded on the proposition that a king can be wrong, very wrong. Thomas Jefferson wrote a strong indictment against King George III, it will be recalled.</p>

The first case in Pennsylvania which proclaimed governmental immunity from liability for the torts of its agents was <em>Fox v. Northern Liberties, </em><a href="/watts-serg/3/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 103" data-case-ids="1854612" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0103-01">3 W. &amp; S. 103</a>, decided in December, 1841. In that case, a superintendent of police seized a horse allegedly under false pretense that the owner was violating the ordinance of the district. The Court held that the law compelled the presumption that the horse seizer was acting of his own will, and not for the municipal corporation which employed him. Then came the case of <em>Elliott v. The City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/75/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="75 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1036793" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0347-01">75 Pa. 347</a>, decided in 1874, where a policeman seized another horse, charging the owner with driving it faster than was permitted by ordinance. He so negligently maintained the horse that it ran away and met an untimely end. The owner of the horse sued the municipality for the negligence of its agent and this Court held the municipality was not liable, citing for its authority the previous horse case of <em>Fox v. Northern Liberties. </em>And then, in 1954, appeared the <em>Boorse v. Springfield Township </em>case, <a href="/pa/377/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="377 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1249577" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0109-01">377 Pa. 109</a>, where three governmental agents shot a race horse in a display of stupidity and brutality rarely surpassed in the annals of jurisprudence. The owner of the horse sued the municipality involved and for his pains he was greeted with equine <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>laughter because the Court trotted out the two previous horse cases.</p>

Is it not about time that these horse cases be retired to the Pasture of Innocuous Desuetude?”</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[189,860,1150,697]]]'>And I would say today, as we consider once again the subject of governmental tort immunity, is it not about time to discard horse sense and apply the common sense of a democratic people? What is government but the people and, since people may be sued in their individual capacities for their civil wrongs, is there any reason why they may not be sued in their collective grouping? I am confident that if a Gallup Poll were taken among the citizenry of Pennsylvania on this subject, the results would show that the people overwhelmingly condemn the outmoded, outdated, unjust, inhumane, decadent rule known as governmental immunity.</p>
