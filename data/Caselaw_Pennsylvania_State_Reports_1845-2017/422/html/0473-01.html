Craig Realty Corporation (Craig), a do<a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>mestic corporation, incorporated in 1953, maintained its business address in Pittsburgh. On or before July 19, 1962, Craig’s total outstanding common stock consisted of ten shares which were owned by Leonard D. Passell, Eobert E. Behrman and Benjamin I. Lederman (appellants). On July 19, 1962, by appropriate stockholder and director action, it was decided to terminate Craig’s business and to distribute Craig’s assets to its stockholders in August 1962. At that time appellants surrendered all their stock to the corporation secretary with instructions to mark the stock “cancelled” on the corporate books and this was done. In August 1962, Craig terminated its business and distributed all its assets. After August 22, 1962, Craig “conducted no business, owned no assets, had no liabilities, received no income and incurred no expenses” with the following exception :<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> since Craig had not been dissolved <em>formally </em>it continued to file a Pennsylvania Capital Stock tax report, showing a nominal $1,000 corporate stock value, upon which it paid a $5 tax and also a Corporate Net Income tax report, showing no income and one item of expense, to wit, the $5 capital stock tax.</p>
    <p id="b499-3" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[142,1594,1153,366]]]'>Craig’s sole remaining asset, prior to its distribution, was certain realty located in Pittsburgh and, on August 22, 1962, by deed, Craig distributed this realty to appellants. This deed was recorded August 22,1962, and, at that time, appellants affixed to the deed Pennsylvania Eealty Transfer tax stamps in the amount of $2500.</p>

Appellants pursued the appropriate steps for <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>a re-determination of the tax and, finally, the Board of Finance and Revenue, on November 12, 1963, sustained the imposition of the tax. Appellants then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County which affirmed the imposition of the tax and entered a judgment against Craig from which judgment this appeal has been taken.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[203,768,1152,481]]]'>Appellants’ argument is predicated on the following premises: (a) the Act imposes a tax not on <em>all </em>but only on <em>certain </em>realty transfers; (b) a realty transfer by a corporation to its stockholders, pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation of the corporation, is not a taxable transfer because it is not a <em>real </em>transfer of a bene? ficial interest <em>effectuated </em>by means of a “document”, i.e., the deed, and that, absent either or both of these elements, the transfer is not taxable.</p>
    <p id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[200,1259,1153,749]]]'>The Commonwealth, taking the position that the transaction is taxable, contends that the deed of Craig to appellants falls within the statutory definition (§2) of a “document” since it <em>conveyed </em>the corporation’s interest in this realty to appellants. The Commonwealth further contends that, upon voluntary liquidation of a corporate business, the Business Corporation Law (§1104, Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, as amended, 15 P.S. 2852-1104) requires that the corporate assets be <em>pmd </em>or <em>distributed </em>to the shareholders by the directors, i.e., by affirmative action, and, therefore, the transfer takes place not by operation of law but only by some affirmative director-action which, in the case of realty, must be by deed.</p>

Appellants take the position that it makes no difference, in the case at bar, whether a “beneficial interest” means an “equitable interest” or the entire property interest and that the transfer of the realty here at issue involves a transfer of neither the <em>equitable </em>interest nor <em>all </em>the property interest<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> since the court below found that the Act applied even though only the bare legal title was transferred.

    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[190,551,1156,1393]]]'>In <em>Sablosky v. Messner, </em>supra, we said: “. . . the Act’s clear import, despite some lack of clarity in the language employed, is to impose a tax only upon transactions where there is a real transfer of beneficial interest; . . . .” (at p. 55). Both parties to this controversy have spent much time on an interpretation of what this Court meant in <em>Sablosky v. Messner, </em>supra, by “beneficial interest”. However, the statutory language indicates clearly what the legislature intended. The title of the statute describes its purpose as “An Act to provide revenue by imposing a State tax relating to certain documents; . . . .” (Emphasis added) and §2 of the Act defines such “document”, inter alia, as a deed “whereby any lands ... or <em>any interest </em>therein” shall be conveyed. (Emphasis added). This description and definition of what constitutes a taxable “document” seems clear beyond question. “The word ‘any’ is generally used in the sense of ‘all’ or ‘every’ and its meaning is most comprehensive: [citing authorities].”: <em>Belefski Estate, </em><a href="/pa/413/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="413 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1888600" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0365-01">413 Pa. 365</a>, 375, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20850" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="196 A.2d 850">196 A. 2d 850</a>. When this Court in <em>Sabloslcy, </em>supra, referred to a “transfer of beneficial interest” it was not changing or altering the statutory language: the Court simply used the phrase “beneficial interest” in the statutory sense of “any interest”, assuming that the transfer of “any interest” in land carries with it a benefit.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.6",502,[190,1964,1150,424]],["BL_503.1",503,[140,383,1151,207]]]'>In addition to the use of the phrase “any interest” in a comprehensive sense, the legislature by listing transfers which should not be taxable under the Act further exhibited its intent for an examination of the types of excepted transfers reveals transfers which involve in some instances a transfer of legal title only, in others a transfer of an equitable interest only and in others of all the title, equitable and legal. In view <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>of the explicit statutory language, we conclude the transfer of <em>any </em>interest in land is a taxable transfer if such transfer is <em>effectuated </em>by a “document” recorded or presented for recording.</p>
    <p id="b503-3" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[143,600,1156,1345]]]'>A study of §3 of the Act — the section which imposes the tax — reveals that the realty transfer tax is imposed only upon a transaction in which a “document” is involved and, when §3 is read in conjunction with the statutory definition of a “document” in §2, it is crystal clear that the tax is imposed only upon transactions in which the “document” <em>conveys </em>the interest in land. Our case law fully supports this interpretation. In <em>Smith v. Messner, </em>supra, we held that an agreement for the sale of an interest in land, although it constitutes an undertaking to execute and deliver an instrument of conveyance, is not taxable; such an agreement, through operation of law, <em>creates </em>but does not <em>convey </em>an interest in the land. In <em>Com. v. Willson Products, Inc., </em>supra, stating (at p. 84) “that the document referred to in the Act clearly meant any deed or similar instrument <em>which conveyed to the grantee </em>or purchaser lands, tenements or hereditaments”, we held that a transfer of realty arising as the result of the merger of two corporations, even though articles of merger were filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, was not taxable for two reasons (a) the transfer was by operation of law and (b) the articles of merger as filed were not within the contemplation of §2 as a “document”.</p>

The merger statute (The Business Corporation Law, Act of MAy 5, 1933, P. L. 364, §907, as amended, 15 P.S. §2852-907) provides, inter alia: “. . .

Any surplus of cash or property remaining after paying off all debts and liabilities of the corporation shall <em>be paid to or distributed </em>among the shareholders by the board of directors, according to their respective rights and preferences.” (Emphasis added). From the language of the liquidation statute, the Commonwealth argues that the directors <em>must </em>take affirmative action to <em>effectuate </em>the transfer of its interest in the remaining realty, i.e., by a “document” in the form of a deed.

Dauphin Co.) the Commonwealth entered into a stipulation of record “. . . that deeds made in connection with the liquidation of corporations were not subject to Realty Transfer Tax prior to the amendment of The Realty Transfer Tax Law by the Act of Tune <em>X, </em>1955, P. L. 128” and that the City of Philadelphia — which has a realty transfer tax under an ordinance most similar to The Realty Transfer Tax Act of the Commonwealth — has determined that corporate conveyances to stockholders in liquidation or dissolution are not subject to tax. Such authorities, while of interest, are in no sense controlling.</p>
