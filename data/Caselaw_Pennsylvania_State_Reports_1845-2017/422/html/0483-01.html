In the early morning of July 16, 1953, Loveday, with two confederates, Mahaffey and Smith, planned to rob a motel near Harrisburg; the trio went to the motel; Mahaffey remained outside at the wheel of an automobile; under the pretext of renting a motel unit, Loveday and Smith entered the motel and lured the aged father (David Fawber), of the motel owner to the motel room they professedly were to occupy; after they had entered the room, Smith pulled out a gun stating this was a “stickup”; Fawber grappled with Loveday who was also armed; Smith, with his gun, hit Fawber three times on the head, the gun was discharged and Fawber was killed. The trio, by automobile, then fled to Cleveland where they were apprehended and returned to Harrisburg several days later. Loveday, Smith and Mahaffey were indicted on the charge of murder. Smith was found guilty by a jury of murder in the first degree and the penalty was fixed at life imprisonment. Thereafter, Loveday, then represented by counsel, changed his plea from not guilty to guilty<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and a three judge court, after a hearing on December 24, 1953, found Loveday guilty of first degree murder and fixed the penalty as life imprisonment.</p>

    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[184,498,1152,1186]]]'>The trial of Loveday took place in 1953. It is now clear beyond donbt that <em>Escobedo v. Illinois </em>and the guidelines therein established do not apply to Love-day: <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">384 U.S. 719</a>, <a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">86 S. Ct. 1772</a>, 34 LW 4592 (6/20/66). Moreover, in view of what <em>actually </em>transpired at Loveday’s trial, <em>Jackson v. </em>Denno, and the impact of its ruling cannot be invoked to aid Loveday. After Loveday had entered his plea of guilty to murder generally, the three judge court took testimony. At that time Loveday’s counsel made no objection to the introduction by the Commonwealth of the oral statements and no question as to the voluntariness of such oral statements was ever raised until the filing of the instant petition. Moreover, Loveday testified and restated in large measure that which was contained in the oral statements. Such set of circumstances render ineffective an attempt to invoke the ruling in <em>Jackson v. Denno. </em>See: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Adderley v.

The record shows that the trial court personally questioned Loveday regarding his understanding of what the entry of a guilty plea would involve and whether the plea was made of his own volition; that Loveday stated the plea was entered of his own free will and <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>that lie understood the consequences of pleading guilty.

This allegation is so vague and indefinite as to be unintelligible. There is no averment that his counsel ever refused to perfect an appeal on his behalf or that any other “officer of the Court” in any manner interfered with his right. Bearing in mind that the record shows conclusively that Loveday intelligently and understanding^ pleaded guilty to murder generally, the present ephemeral allegation that he was denied the right to appeal does not justify the grant of this writ.</p>
