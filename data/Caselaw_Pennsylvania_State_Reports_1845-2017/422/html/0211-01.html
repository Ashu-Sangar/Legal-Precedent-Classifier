On the prior appeal, we affirmed the action of the court below in dismissing the defendant-union’s objections contesting the jurisdiction of the court and held that the action was authorized under §301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20Stat.%20156" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="61 Stat. 156">61 Stat. 156</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7185" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §185">29 U.S.C. §185</a>(a). <em>Shaw Electric Co. v.

L. 23, §1, 12 P.S. §672, <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>as raising a question of jurisdiction. It contends that if there is a binding contract between itself and Shaw Electric, then the terms of that contract, which provide for arbitration of claimed violations of the agreement, preclude resort to the courts for the enforcement of its provisions. Thus, appellant-union contends that the arbitration clause contained in the collective bargaining agreement between the parties deprives the court below of jurisdiction over the suit and that its refusal to enter judgment on the pleadings raises a jurisdictional question under the Act of 1925. However, we are unable to agree that this contention raises a jurisdictional question appealable under that Act.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[126,1087,1154,750]]]'>In the previous appeal to this Court, it was held that the court below had jurisdiction to determine the various contractual issues involved. <em>Shaw Electric Co. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local No. 98, </em>supra. We, therefore, view the nature of the issue raised by appellant-union’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as going to the merits of the dispute. Thus, whether or not the court correctly concluded that the present dispute was not one for arbitration, it is clear that its refusal to grant appellant-union’s motion for judgment on the pleadings does not raise a jurisdictional question within the meaning of the Act of 1925.

    <p id="b238-7" data-blocks='[["BL_238.10",238,[187,920,1152,477]]]'>In the first case of <em>Shaw Electric Company, Inc. v.

    <p id="b238-8" data-blocks='[["BL_238.11",238,[191,1409,1148,261]]]'>The majority now holds that since the Union did not raise the jurisdictional objections to the then nonexistent but later court-supplied allegations at the same time it raised the original jurisdictional objections, the Union is now prohibited from so doing.</p>

      <em>Drummond v. Drummond, </em><a href="/pa/414/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="414 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1890407" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0548-01">414 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20887" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="200 A.2d 887">200 A. 2d 887</a> (1964), is not authority for the majority’s position. In <em>Drummond v. Drummond </em>it was held that since the original jurisdictional objections had been adjudicated that became “the law of the case as to all jurisdictional objections which were actually raised or <em>might have been raised in that </em>appeal.” (Emphasis supplied). Since there were no allegations in the original <em>Shaw </em>complaint that alleged a breach of the collective bargaining agreement, the Union could not have raised in the first appeal the provisions of the contract requiring arbitration. It was only after the majority in the original <em>Shaw </em>action supplied the allega<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>tions that constituted a breach of the collective bargaining agreement that the arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement became an issue. Hence, in effect, the majority now says that since the Union raised jurisdictional problems in the original complaint, it may not now raise additional jurisdictional questions which were created by the court-amended complaint. Accordingly, I would not quash the appeal. On the merits I would hold that the contract obligation to arbitrate is clear and broad enough to include the dispute in question and enter judgment in favor of the appellant as we did in <em>United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/413/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="413 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1888554" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0358-01">413 Pa. 358</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20857" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="196 A.2d 857">196 A. 2d 857</a> (1964), and as the Supreme Court of the United States did in the following : <em>United Steelworkers v.
