Appellee, in his complaint, prayed for an accounting from each and all of the appellants, and further prayed that a trusteeship as to one-third of the capital stock of the corporation be set up, and that stock be assigned to him.</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[133,884,1153,915]]]'>Appellants contend that appellee joined the Margolis organization as an employee, that subsequently he had been offered a one-third share of the profits, but that this offer had never been accepted by the appellee. Appellants further contend that all of appellee’s dealings were exclusively with Dorothy C. Margolis, one of the appellants, who had assumed control of the operation of the business because of the illness of her husband, John; that the appellee had no dealings whatsoever with Sheldon B. Margolis, the son of Dorothy and John, who, until he was made a partner on June 28, 1958, had been only an employee of Margolis Associates, nor with the First Pennsylvania Banking &amp; Trust Company, the appointed guardian for John A.

Margolis, acting on behalf of herself and the other appellants, except for her husband, John A. Margolis, and his appointed guardian, the First Pennsylvania Bank and Trust Company, as to whom the action was nonsuited. The chancellor denied the motion of appellants’ counsel for a nonsuit with respect to Sheldon B. Margolis and Margolis Associates, Inc. The chancellor found that although the evidence was insufficient to show a valid partnership as contended by appellee, pursuant to an oral agreement, appellee-plaintiff was entitled to a one-third share of the profits of the business during the period of June 15,1957, through June 30, 1963, and ordered an accounting for that period as to the sole proprietorship, the succeeding partnership, and the succeeding corporation, as well as <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>against Dorothy C. Margolis and her son, Sheldon B. Margolis, as the principal beneficiaries of the proceeds of the various business entities. The appellants-defendants filed exceptions to the chancellor’s adjudication, argument was heard by a court en banc, and the exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed, and the decree nisi was entered as the final decree; this appeal followed.</p>

However, the chancellor’s “conclusions, whether of law or ultimate fact are no more than his reasoning from the underlying facts and are reviewable” . . .’” <em>Skydlinslci v.

Certainly the voluminous correspondence between the parties cannot be ignored. The chancellor, in his findings of fact No. 7, (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> ****<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> indicates some written agreement, although his <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>subsequent conclusion of law No. 3,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> indicates this was not intended by the parties to be the entire agreement. The chancellor refers also to other correspondence in his adjudication, and we can reach no other conclusion but that he certainly must have given considerable weight to this correspondence in reaching his decision, yet the court en banc's opinion of affirmance indicates almost total dependence on credibility of the witnesses appearing before the chancellor.</p>
    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.6",582,[212,886,1152,910]],["BL_583.1",583,[147,384,1151,262]]]'>Appellee alleges that by reason of an oral agreement made in 1957, he is a one-third partner with the appellanbdefendants in the enterprise. He prays for an accounting, and, in addition, the shares of stock to which he, as a partner, is entitled. If credence is attached to his oral testimony, and if the chancellor reached his conclusion on this basis alone, we fail to perceive how he reached his decision that although plaintiff was not a partner and was not entitled to any of the shares of stock of the corporation, he was, nevertheless, entitled to one-third of the profits of the enterprise for the period he was employed or associated. To find one and not the other appears to be most inconsistent. Had the chancellor believed appellee-plaintiff as a witness, why did he not allow all that was requested in the original complaint? The only reasonable conclusion that we can reach is that considerable weight must have been <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>given to the voluminous correspondence between appellee and appellants. This correspondence refers on many occasions to a contract intended for appellee-plaintiff, yet on two occasions when contracts were offered to appellee, they were not accepted.</p>
