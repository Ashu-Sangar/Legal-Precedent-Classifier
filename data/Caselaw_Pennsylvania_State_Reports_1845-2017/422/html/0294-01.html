    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.8",319,[138,860,1151,588]]]'>Appellant, while represented by counsel, pleaded guilty to murder. He was tried before a three Judge Court which found him guilty of murder in the first degree with penalty fixed at death and judgment of sentence was entered thereon. He appealed to this Court which ordered that he be resentenced, and the lower Court resentenced him to death. He again appealed to this Court. In that appeal we vacated the sentence of death and ordered that he be sentenced to life imprisonment. See <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b319-6" data-blocks='[["BL_319.9",319,[137,1460,1151,369]]]'>Relator’s main contention in this habeas corpus proceeding is that the admission of his confession at his trial after he had pleaded guilty, while represented by counsel, deprived him of due process of law because his confession was coerced and was made at a time when he was without counsel and when he was not advised of his right to counsel.</p>
    <p id="b319-7" data-blocks='[["BL_319.10",319,[137,1841,1151,305]]]'>Green’s conviction and sentence and his right to appeal therefrom became final prior to <em>Escobedo v.
