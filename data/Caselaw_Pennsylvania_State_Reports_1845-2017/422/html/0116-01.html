The Church began as an unincorporated association prior to the year of 1907. During 1907, it was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation for the purpose of worshiping God according to the faith, doctrine and discipline of that branch of the Greek Catholic Church, which is in union with the The Holy See at Rome, and recognizes the Pope of Rome as the spiritual head of the Church. From its founding until the year 1935, the Church conducted all of its affairs, both spiritual and temporal, as a Greek Catholic Church in union with Rome, and all of its property was acquired and used for this purpose.</p>

The question of its application does not depend upon the fact that a certain definite time has elapsed since the cause of action accrued, but rather whether, under the circumstances of the particular case, the complaining party or parties are chargeable with want of due diligence in failing to institute or prosecute the claim: <em>Lutherland, Inc., v.

As a result of the plaintiffs’ knowing acquiescence for thirty years, without taking action, in the existence of conditions about which they now complain, the original purpose of the Church has become obscure, the testimony of important witnesses no longer available, and the ascertainment of the true facts rendered much more difficult, if not impossible. Compare, <em>First Nat. Bk. v. Lytle Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/332/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="332 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1186597" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0394-01">332 Pa. 394</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20350" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 A.2d 350">3 A. 2d 350</a> (1939), and <em>Barnes &amp; Tucker Co. v.

Moreover, plaintiffs advance no reason for the prolonged delay in properly asserting their claim. Further, those members of the congregation who have practiced the form of worship which the Church has followed continuously for thirty years, and for whom the named defendants are acting in a representative capacity, have contributed substantial sums of money thereto in justifiable reliance that the Church would continue to follow the theological course and spiritual beliefs to which they adhere. It is obvious that to now permit the Church property and assets to be used for another purpose <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>would result in serious injury to them.

Further, §2 of the Act of June 20, 1935, supra, 10 P.S. §81a, which is controlling on the issue of how church property shall be held, specifically places disputes in regard thereto within the jurisdiction of the courts of equity.

Two theories in support of the principle of law have evolved. Some courts apparently concerned with continuity of title to property have based the rule on the fact that a church entity is defined by its doctrinal coherence. See, <em>Geiss v. Trinity Lutheran Church </em>Congregation, <a href="/neb/119/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="119 Neb. 745" data-case-ids="4598407" data-case-paths="/neb/119/0745-01">119 Neb. 745</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=230%20N.W.%20658" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="230 N.W. 658">230 N.W. 658</a> (1930). Other courts have reasoned that the basis for the doctrine lies in the desire of the courts to carry out the intent of the original donor or donors of the church property, and have assumed that such individuals would have continued in the original faith. Pennsylvania seems to follow the latter rationale. See, <em>Trustees v. </em>Sturgeon, <a href="/pa/9/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="9 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="960747" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0321-01">9 Pa. 321</a> (1848). <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>However, the former has also been favorably recognized in recent decisions.

From that point on, the “Dissenters” were in possession, and the plaintiffs slept on their rights.
