    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.6",412,[177,718,1154,1245]]]'>Section 2-318 provides: “A seller’s warranty whether express or implied extends to <em>any natural person who is in the family or household of his "buyer </em>or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. . . .” (Emphasis supplied). Act of April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, §2-318, 12A P.S. §2-318. The comments to this section elaborate on its purpose and scope: “2. The purpose of this section is to give the buyer’s family, household and guests the benefit of the same warranty which the buyer received in the contract of sale, thereby freeing any such beneficiaries from any technical rules as to ‘privity.’ It seeks to accomplish this purpose without any derogation of any right or remedy resting on negligence. It rests primarily upon the merchant-seller’s warranty under this Article that the goods sold are merchantable and fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used rather than the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Implicit in the section is that any beneficiary of a warranty may bring a direct action for breach of warranty against the seller whose warranty extends to him.</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.7",412,[181,1972,1150,425]],["BL_413.1",413,[131,378,1152,259]]]'>“3. This section expressly includes as beneficiaries within its provisions the family, household, and guests of the purchaser. Beyond this, the section is neutral and is not intended to enlarge or restrict the developing case law on whether the seller’s warranties, given to his buyer who resells, extend to other persons in the distributive chain.” Thus, if the decedent, “a natural person,” was connected with the “buyer”, his aunt, in <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>one or more of the ways set forth in §2-318 then his lack of “privity” is not a bar to a suit under the “Survival” statute by his representative against his aunt’s immediate seller, Wallace Preitz, trading as Hartsville Pharmacy.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[132,650,1154,1247]]]'>With respect to this inquiry appellant contends that the decedent, being a nephew of the “buyer,” was in her “family,” as that term is used in §2-318, and, therefore, within the benefit of defendant Hartsville Pharmacy’s implied warranty. The lower court held and appellees urge that the word “family” was meant by the Legislature to be used interchangeably with the word “household” and that since the decedent, who lived next door to his aunt, was not a member of her “household” he could not be in her “family.” In our opinion such a construction is erroneous. The word “family” appears in the phrase “any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home.” Obviously, the clause “guest in his home” has significance different from and independent of the clause “person ... in the . . . household.” It would seem also that the clause “person . . . in the family” has significance different from and independent of the clause “person ... in the . . . household” rather than being mere surplusage. The use of the conjunction “or” strengthens the natural conclusion that “family” and “household” have different meanings in this statute.</p>

    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[204,504,1151,1022]]]'>The statute provides no clear indication of the meaning to be given to the word “family,” and we have found no case on the matter. In our opinion, considering the remedial nature of the provision and the natural connotations of the word, its meaning was not intended to be unduly restrictive. Accordingly, we hold that the word “family” as used in this statute includes the nephew of the purchaser. This interpretation of the word “family” is not too burdensome on the seller who makes the warranty because not only must the beneficiary be in the buyer’s family but also it must be “reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods. . . .” Whether this member of the family was also within the latter clause is a factual and objective question and depends upon all the relevant circumstances, which may include such factors as the remoteness of the family relation, the geographical connection between the buyer and the member of his family, and the nature of the product.</p>

The second inquiry, therefore, is whether there is any rule of case law permitting the persons designated in §2-318 to maintain an action of assumpsit against remote sellers. . With respect to this inquiry a consideration of the case law is pertinent and it is necessary to determine whether defendants’ lack of “privity” is a bar thereunder. Much has been written regarding the demise of the requirement of “privity of contract” <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>in implied warranty actions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and, indeed, its demise is plainly evident in some jurisdictions.

      <em>If </em>we are to retain in assumpsit actions the requirement of privity, I perceive no sound reason why the right of recovery should be limited to the persons occupying the statutes designated in §2-318 of the Code. The framers of that section by their comment have invited its enlargement. If privity is so important to retain, then we should logically limit the right to recover in assumpsit, based upon implied warranty, to the parties who actually were participants in the sale of the product out of which the warranty impliedly arose and allow only the actual purchaser to sue the actual seller. However, §2-318 permits nonparticipants in the sale — family members, household members and houseguests of the purchaser — to sue the actual seller. Section 2-318 departs from the conception of privity as based upon contract since certainly none of the persons in the class were participants in the contract of sale: instead, §2-318 creates a fictitious privity of contract and then engrafts thereon such fictitious privity a concept of negligence, i.e., that the persons who occupy the specified statuses must be of a class which the seller of the product could reasonably foresee would use, consume or be affected by the product. While I believe that the retention of the concept of privity is unsound, at least, if we are to retain the requirement of privity,— actual or fictitious, — then I would eliminate any requirement that the suing party must occupy any spe<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>cial status and would hold that the warranties extend to any person or persons whom the seller could have reasonably foreseen would use, consume or be affected by the product.

      <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>In my opinion, the requirement of privity is illogical both when applied to the immediate purchaser or restricted to the immediate seller. A review of the case law in this and other jurisdictions reveals almost ludicrous attempts by the courts to fashion the concept of privity to individual cases. I would favor the abolition of the requirement of privity in assumpsit actions in this field. The remote manufacturer of a product shown to be defective should be held liable to any person or persons who might be reasonably foreseen to use, consume or be affected by the defective product.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_18" id="ref_footnote_3_18">18</a>

Those who make and market products which are to be used and consumed by the public must be held to a special responsibility to any member of the using or consuming public who may be injured by the use and consumption of the product. The public, with justification, expects that, in the case of products of which it has a need and for which it must rely upon those who make and market the product, such manufacturers and sellers, be they proximate or remote, will stand behind their products; the burden of injuries <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>caused by defects in such products should fall upon those who make and market the products and the consuming public is entitled to the maximum of protection.

With that holding I agree.. <em>Second </em>— §2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code alone determines the status necessary to “horizontal privity” and that the deceased child under the instant factual situation was a member of the “family” of the product purchaser. With such a <em>restrictive </em>interpretation of §2-318 I disagree. Moreover, the <em>ad hoc </em>method employed by the majority to determine whether this deceased child was a member of the “family” of the purchaser is both unsound and unsatisfactory. I would find “horizontal” privity is not <em>commanded </em>by §2-318; even if it were, I would find this child’s representative could sue because this child was a person whom the seller could reasonably have foreseen would use this product. <em>Third </em>— that, because the case law in this Commonwealth requires that, in nonfood' cases, there must be <em>privity of contract </em>in assumpsit actions between those entitled to sue under §2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code and those sued, the instant action against the “remote seller”, i.e., the distributor and manufacturer of the product cannot be maintained. In my opinion the case law in this Commonwealth which requires such privity of contract should no longer be considered authoritative, the requirement of privity in assumpsit should be abolished and the instant action against the “remote sellers” should be permitted.</p>

In my view, once the issue of plaintiff’s right to claim the protection of strict liability has been settled, as it has by reason of §2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Act of April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, §2-318, reenacted without change, October 2, 1959, §2, 12A P.S. §2-318 (Supp. 1965), there is no justification for permitting conceptual abstractions and procedural niceties to preclude a direct action against remote parties in the distributive chain.</p>

Moreover, the decedent was a member of a class of persons which the seller and manufacturer should reasonably have anticipated would use or be exposed to the product, so that injury to him, in the event of a defect, was within the foreseeable ambit of expectation. Thus, if the policy of strict liability for injuries caused by defective products has merit and is to be adopted, certainly the circumstances of this case call for its application. It should also be noted that §2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code, by setting aside the requirement of privity as a predicate to the maintenance of plaintiff’s action against the retail seller Preitz, has in part resolved the issue, since plaintiff may recover without regard to fault on the basis of a breach of the retailer’s implied warranty that the defective product was fit for human use. Thus, the only issue which presently confronts this Court is whether, despite the Code’s relaxation of the requirement of horizontal privity, we should insist on the presence of vertical privity before an action against other, more remote parties in the distributive chain may be permitted.</p>

      <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>Over 500 years ago it was recognized that sellers of products for human consumption owed a special responsibility to purchasers of their products, a responsibility which extended beyond the mere avoidance of negligence. See Prosser, The Assault Upon the Citadel (Strict. Liability to the Consumer), <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Yale%20L.J.%201099" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="69 Yale L.J. 1099">69 Yale L.J. 1099</a>, 1103-04 (1960). Many courts, including those of this Commonwealth, characterized this special responsibility as being in the nature of an implied warranty that such products would be fit for human consumption, the breach of which rendered the seller absolutely liable. See <em>McNaughton v. Joy, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%20470" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 470">1 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%20470" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 470">W.N.C. 470</a> (1875). At first this implied warranty was viewed as running merely from the seller to the immediate buyer and the ultimate consumer, if he were not the actual purchaser, was barred by lack of privity from recovering on the basis of this “special” or absolute liability for injuries sustained as a result of the consumption of adulterated or poisoned food.</p>
    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[208,1427,1153,1024]]]'>Courts soon recognized the injustice inherent in such a limitation, however, and developed numerous theories which extended the scope of strict liability and permitted the ultimate consumer to recover, without regard to fault, for injuries caused by defective food products. <em>See </em>Gillam, Products Liability in a Nutshell, 37 Ore. L. Rev. 119, 153-55 (1958). Today, most jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, afford protection in the nature of strict liability to consumers in food cases without reference to the doctrine of privity, a doctrine which has been discarded in such cases as circumscribing too narrowly the circle of those persons who should be permitted to obtain redress for injuries sustained without regard to fault.

Thus, the majority’s insistence on privity in order for plaintiff to proceed against Rexall or Northern Electric does not insulate those defendants from liability, since each may be required to indemnify its immediate purchaser in the event that Preitz, the retail seller, is held liable in the instant suit.

It should be noted, however, that although the major expansion of liability would occur as the result of dispensing with “horizontal” privity, such as is done in part by §2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code, a certain degree of practical expansion would also occur where “vertical” privity, the issue here in dispute, is discarded as a <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>prerequisite to recovery, since those who would otherwise he unable to obtain redress from the immediate seller because of his inability to pay any judgment awarded, or because of the inability to obtain jurisdiction over such seller, would have the alternative remedy and additional protection of an action directly against the manufacturer or others in the distributive chain.</p>

Certainly, once the issue of plaintiff’s right to recover without the necessity of establishing negligence has been settled, as it has in this case by reason of §2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code, I see no reason for introducing the complication of privity to insulate remote parties in the distributive chain from responding directly to the injured party. Nor do I see what is to be gained by remitting plaintiff to an action of trespass when the same result would obtain through the simple expedient of disregarding the lack of privity between the parties.</p>

Section 2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which contains an exception to the requirement of horizontal privity where suit is brought by a member of the family or guest of the actual purchaser, permits, at least with respect to the persons therein specified, recovery in assumpsit. The majority, however, would require that those cases not within §2-318 and <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>all cases in which vertical privity is to be dispensed with be brought only in trespass.
