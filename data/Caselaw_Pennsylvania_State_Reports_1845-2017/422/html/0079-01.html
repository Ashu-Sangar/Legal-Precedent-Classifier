However, when the testatrix <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>wished to make a specific bequest, or wished a pecuniary bequest to be specifically paid out of her bank accounts, she had said so in her will. For example, she provided, “My friend Alice Elston shall be given the sum of $500.00 of my bank deposits also to my friend Margaret Wahl the sum of $500.00.” We repeat: We agree with the Orphans’ Court that testatrix intended the bequest of “What is left of the monies,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> **I leave to my friend Paula Roseling” to be a residuary gift and consequently it must abate before the specific legacies and devises.</p>

Since, as of the date of the execution of the codicil, she could not have known the amount of money necessary to satisfy the tax due, the bequest was as specific as it could possibly be.</p>
