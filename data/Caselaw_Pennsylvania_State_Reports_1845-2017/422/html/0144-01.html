Admittedly, there was ample competent evidence to support the jury’s findings. In fact, certain testimony indicated that the fair market value of the land taken was substantially higher than the jury found. The only reason urged in support of the argument of excessiveness is that the jury awards were greater than those given by the board. Such a disparity is not, in itself, grounds for a new trial.

From this the Commonwealth argued that four of the eighteen holes of the course were located on land not included in the lease and not owned by Catherine Hoffman.

This was never questioned.

The comment to §705 states: “As under existing law, the viewers or the trial judge, as the case may be, determine whether the witness is qualified to express an opinion, <em>except in the case of a condemnee.” </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, the condemnee is a “qualified expert” automatically under the act. As such, he may properly testify, as the lessee did here, as to what elements were considered in the valuation he puts on the property. The purpose of the pertinent sections of the code is to bring out before the jury the elements which a witness is using in valuing the condemned property, and thus aid the jury in properly ascertaining the true facts, and in assessing the witness’s testimony as to valuation. To hold otherwise would mean that the owner of the property could state only the valuation he put on his property without being permitted to demonstrate to the jury the elements <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>lie considered in reaching his valuation. A qualified expert, on the other hand, could show the elements he considered in reaching his valuation.
