We are unwilling to permit the city to thwart her justifiable expectations after she has passed away.

The invalid segregation portions of the ordinance are such vital features of both funds and are so essential to the operation of the funds, especially the provisions allowing a retiree to select his own retirement pay, that both ordinances in their entirety must be declared invalid. As this Court stated in <em>GenMnger v. New Castle, </em><a href="/pa/368/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="368 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1230391" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0547-01">368 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20303" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="84 A.2d 303">84 A. 2d 303</a> (1951), <em>. , </em>an ordinance must be in conformity with the provisions of the enabling statutes; if it conflicts therewith, it is void.” In other words, being a creature of the General Assembly, a municipality has no power to enact ordinances except as authorized by enabling legislation of that body. <em>Allentown School District Mercantile Taco Case, </em><a href="/citations/?q=870%20Pa.%20161" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="870 Pa. 161">870 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20480" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="87 A.2d 480">87 A. 2d 480</a> (1952). A municipality holds its property in trust for public uses, and its funds may be used only for valid purposes authorized by enabling legislation. Passage of an ordinance in violation of specific enabling acts does not give rise to enforceable rights thereunder. Accord, <em>Eisenberger v. Harrisburg Police Pension Commission, </em><a href="/pa/400/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="400 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1292485" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0418-01">400 Pa. 418</a>, 421, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20347" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="162 A.2d 347">162 A, 2d 347</a>, 348 (1960). Accordingly, all rights under either ordinance are unenforceable and we may declare that no claim thereunder may be made by any retired police officer or fireman, or by the widow or estate of any member of either force.</p>

Any other disposition, including that ordained by the majority, is unlawful, unwise, and a waste of the assets of a municipal corporation. As I view the matter, the City of Sharon is a trustee ex maleficio of the funds <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>unlawfully received from its police and firemen and, as such, is liable neither more nor less than any other trustee ex maleficio.</p>
