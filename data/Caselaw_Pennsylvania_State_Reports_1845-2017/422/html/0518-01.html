Early in the evening of November 22, 1956, a fire occurred which resulted in the total destruction of Marrazzos’ building and most of its contents.</p>

This machine was owned and serviced by Scranton Nehi Bottling Company, Inc. (Nehi); its location in the building had been selected by Marrazzos; between Nehi and Marrazzos there was no written agreement, Nehi receiving a profit by adding to its charge for cases of soft drinks an additional amount for the use of the machine; Nehi kept the machine in repair.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.6",544,[212,1308,1150,855]]]'>Marrazzos instituted a trespass action in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County against Nehi to recover the damages caused by the fire to their building and its contents. It was Marrazzos’ theory that it was Nehi’s duty to keep the vending machine in proper operating condition, that Nehi had failed in the performance of that duty and that, by reason of the breach of that duty, the machine caught fire and, in turn, set fire to the building. Nehi’s defense was two-fold: (1) that Nehi had assumed no duty to service and maintain the machine but that such service and maintenance was Marrazzos’ responsibility and (2) that the negligence, if any, of Nehi was not the cause of the fire but that the fire occurred because of the actions, either by mischief or design, on the part of an outside agent.</p>

Later at Camp Hill Correctional Institution, this boy denied being in Marrazzos’ building at any time and, at trial, when called as a hostile witness by Nehi, he reiterated this denial.

The testimony of the experts who saw and made post-fire examinations of the machine and its various parts and made scientific tests thereof, the physical evidence presented by the machine and its parts, the condition of the floor upon which the machine was posed and the testimony of those who first observed the fire in that area of the building where the machine was located all furnish a sound basis for concluding the fire started in the machine. Nehi sought to show that the fire originated outside the machine and, in support of its position, produced the testimony of an expert whose opinion was that the fire, whose origin he could not determine, did not originate in the machine, and, impliedly at least, Nehi suggested that the cause of the fire was due to the actions of the three youths, supposedly in Marrazzos’ building at the onset of the fire.

This machine developed a fire in the lower compartment and was repaired by Nehi’s serviceman. On complaint of a similar occurrence the entire machine was removed and replaced in 1955 or early 1956.

It was for the jury to determine whether or not the defendant had exercised reasonable care in the maintenance and operation of the vending machine. This is particularly so when there was no evi<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>dence produced by either side to the effect that the fire could have been caused by defective electrical connections occurring outside of the machine. Defendant, however, contends that the jury was permitted to pass on negligence based only upon the conjecture of the experts as to the origin and cause of the fire. But as stated by the court below and in which we concur, this was not conjecture but sound scientific reasoning in attempting to establish the origin and cause. See Brueckner v. City of Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/368/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="368 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1230315" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0554-01">368 Pa. 554</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20197" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="84 A.2d 197">84 A. 2d 197</a>.”</p>

What Dr. Willard testified as to the causal connection was an inference from facts which had an evidentiary basis and not an inference from facts assumed and not in evidence. In <em>Kerr or Lendrum (Pauper) v. Ayr Steam Shipping Co. Ltd. </em>(1915), A. C. 217, 233, Lord Shaw said: “The distinction [between an inference and a conjecture] is as broad as philosophy itself. It is that an inference rests upon premises of fact and a conjecture does not.” An opinion of an expert based upon an adequate factual foundation is neither speculative nor conjectural, but a legitimate inference and as such has evidentiary value in determining disputed questions of fact. “It is the intrinsic quality of the conclusion that matters, and not the label or characterization. Words mean what they manifest. Their meaning may vary. As Mr. Justice Holmes said in Towne v. Eisner, <a href="/us/245/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="245 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="3694133" data-case-paths="/us/245/0418-01">245 U.S. 418</a>, 425, <a href="/us/245/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="245 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="3694133" data-case-paths="/us/245/0418-01">38 S.

A reading of her entire testimony, both on direct and cross-examination, reveals clearly that her “postulation” was not conjectural or speculative in nature but based upon sound reasoning from the scientifically established and observed facts of record. Dr. Willard’s testimony that the fire, which originated in the vending machine, was communicated therefrom to the nearby wooden portion of the building is based upon fact and not on fancy.</p>
