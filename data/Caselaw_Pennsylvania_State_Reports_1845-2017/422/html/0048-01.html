Some of these depositors complained to Girard about the charge-back<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and in response Girard re-credited their accounts in the total amount of $17,492.23. A breakdown of these re-credits and other items for which Girard is now suing Brink’s reveals the following: Item (a) Girard files possessed written evidence that Girard depositors could not identify from the depositors’ records the identity of the makers of the checks. The face amount of checks in this category was $7,374.29; Item (b) Girard files contained no records of any inquiry by Girard in regard to its depositors’ identification of the makers of checks. The face amount of checks in this category was $10,117.94.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In addition to Items (a) and (b), Girard claims that Brink’s should be liable for the loss of: Item (e) 64 checks drawn on Philadel<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>pliia National Bank and cashed at Girard of which photostats had been made but 23 such photostats were illegible and the other 41 photostats were lost. The face amount of checks in this category was $4,514.28. Item (d) checks, where all the parties were known and photostats available, drawn on Philadelphia National Bank for which payment had been refused at the request of Philadelphia National Bank’s depositors. The face amount of checks in this category was $3,-765.87. Girard also demanded: Item (e) that Brink’s pay for the overtime expenditures incurred by Girard to investigate the loss (986 hours of overtime pay which amounted to $3,051.30) ; Item (f) a right to <em>6% </em>interest as part of the damages, based on the period between January 2, 1962 and January 6, 1965, the date of the verdict in the court below.</p>

Brink’s excepted to this verdict and denied any liability for any of Items a, b, c and e. Girard also filed exceptions to the court’s failure to award interest on the verdict (Item f), and failure to include as damages the $3,765.87 representing the photostats of cheeks where all parties were known for which payment had been refused at the direction of Philadelphia National Bank’s depositors (Item d).</p>

We disagree. While neither party could present direct evidence as to what did happen to the bag of checks in question, there was adequate circumstantial testimony on behalf of Girard to substantiate the trial court’s finding of “a chain of events to support an inference of delivery” to Brink’s. Brink’s argument completely ignores the pointed conclusion of the trial court that the key witnesses for Brink’s were not credible: “Although the guard and chauffeur who drove Brink’s armored car on the morning of the disappearance testified that they did not receive a bag for Philadelphia National Bank, we find their testimony to be unworthy of belief.” The trial judge’s finding of delivery, which in this case carries the same weight as the verdict of a jury, (cf. <em>Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives and Granting Annuities v. Wallace, </em><a href="/pa/346/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="346 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="1216505" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0532-01">346 Pa. 532</a>, 535, <a href="" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="31 A.2d 71">31 A. 2d 71</a>) should not be overturned where it is supported by evidence in the record.</p>

The contract between the two parties, which states in part “. . . [Brink’s] will be liable for any such loss arising from dishonesty or negligence of any such chauffeur or guard” — only declares who should be liable if such negligence occurs but it does not alter the burden of production of evidence to establish negligence in the bailor-bailee relationship.

Bailey Sales &amp; Service, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/385/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="385 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1267134" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0547-01">385 Pa. 547</a>, 550, 551, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.2d%20425" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="123 A.2d 425">123 A. 2d 425</a> (1956) Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Charles Alvin Jones set forth the relevant considerations: “A bailor makes out a prima facie case against his bailee for hire for the recovery of the value of unreturned <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>bailed property by showing his delivery of it to the bailee and the latter’s failure to redeliver it upon the bailor’s due demand therefor. It then becomes the bailee’s duty, if he would escape responsibility for the loss of the bailed article, to show that his failure to redeliver it upon the termination of the bailment was because of its loss by fire, theft or other casualty free from fault on his own part.”</p>

At the heart of both of Brink’s assertions is the assumption that, if Girard could not be held responsible for the loss by its depositors, then Girard should not be permitted to collect from Brink’s. We believe this assumption is ill founded here. The underlying posture of this case as to Items (a) and (b) is that as between the makers of the checks, the depositors of Girard, Girard and Brink’s, the makers of the checks in total amount of $17,492.23 should be ultimately charged for the amount lost. (Uniform Commercial Code, Act of April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, §3-804, as amended, 12A P.S. §3-804) for other<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>wise the makers would receive a windfall. However, that is impossible here because the makers of these checks are not known to the depositors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Hence among the remaining three parties, Brink’s, the party who was allegedly negligent in losing the bag should bear the liability in the absence of the discovery of the makers’ identification. Girard, instead of putting the loss on its blameless depositors by charging back their accounts,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> instead sued Brink’s to ensure that Girard would not itself sustain the loss because of its inability to be paid by the payor bank, Philadelphia National Bank. The Uniform Commercial Code specifically provides (§4-212(5), 12A P.S. §4-212(5)) : <em>“A failure to charge bade </em>or claim refund does not affect other rights of the bank against the customer <em>or any other party.” </em>(Emphasis added). The Pennsylvania Bar Association Notes on §4-212(5) declare that the “Right of charge-back is optional.”</p>

Cast in this light, Brink’s contentions that Girard suffered no loss and gratuitously recredited the depositors’ accounts are not on point. Girard merely exercised its option to hold Brink’s liable rather than charge back its depositors.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[211,814,1151,1066]]]'>Brink’s objection to its being held liable for 64 checks drawn on Philadelphia National Bank and cashed at Girard for which photostats had been made but 23 of which were illegible and the other 41 of which were lost by Girard (Item (c)) has merit. Unlike the checks listed in Items (a) and (b), photostats of checks listed as Item (c) were available. Hence, if Girard had not lost or made the photostats illegible, Philadelphia National Bank would have made final settlement with Girard for the 64 photostats in the same way that final settlement was made for the other 4,239 lost checks cashed and photostated by Girard. The fact that the makers could not be identified as to the 64 Item (c) checks was specifically Girard’s fault. Even though the loss of 64 out of 4,303 photostats of the checks that were cashed and then disappeared is small (approximately 1%%),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> that should not cause Brink’s to be held for Girard’s failure to mitigate by producing these photostats which would have been otherwise available.</p>

Under §4-212 (5), Girard had the choice of seeking a refund from the non-depositors who had cashed the checks at Girard, or sue the individual makers of the checks who were, of course, known in this instance, or sue Brink’s who, in turn, could collect from the known makers. Girard elected to try to collect the amount in one action by suing Brink’s, the party that caused Girard to rely on a photostatic copy in the first place.</p>

In the light of the testimony, the complaints registered by these depositors were due to the depositors’ failure to have a record or to remember the identity of the makers of their checks. For example, the following testimony was given by Mr. Walter Glasgow, Assistant Treasurer of Girard: “Q. Would you give His Honor an example of the type of complaints you received? A. We received telephone calls from customers who stated that they just don’t keep a record of who gave them a check to actual threats of a law suit.” Thus, we must assume that, for the purposes of this case, the makers of Item (b) checks were as unknown to the depositors as were Item (a) checks, even though Girard had no written evidence of any inquiry into Item (b) checks.</p>
