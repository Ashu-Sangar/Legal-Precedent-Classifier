    <p class="author" id="Audu" data-blocks='[["BL_194.7",194,[518,598,447,42]]]'>Mr. Justice Roberts,</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.8",194,[200,649,1150,478]]]'>This appeal arises out of a dispute in which appellants, taxpayers of the Township of Exeter, Berks County, Pennsylvania, sought to restrain appellees, the Board of Supervisors of Exeter Township and the Exeter Municipal Authority, from proceeding with the proposed construction of a sanitary sewage disposal system. Appellants’ complaint alleged fraud and manifest abuse of discretion on the part of appellees in the planning and design of the proposed system.</p>
    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.9",194,[202,1138,1150,576]]]'>At trial, no evidence was adduced by appellants in support of the allegation of fraud, the evidence introduced being directed to establishing that appellees had committed a manifest abuse of discretion in approving the construction of a system more extensive than that which appellants considered economically feasible. At the conclusion of appellants’ evidence, the chancellor granted appellees’ motion for a compulsory nonsuit. The court en banc, after argument, refused a motion for the removal of the nonsuit and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b194-7" data-blocks='[["BL_194.10",194,[205,1735,1150,694]]]'>Appellants do not contest the right of appellee Exeter Municipal Authority to engage in the project in dispute, the power to do so having been explicitly granted by the Act of May 2, 1945, P. L. 382, §4, as amended, 53 P.S. §306. The sole disagreement between the parties lies in the manner by which appellees have elected to proceed, and, more specifically, with the size of the proposed system. Appellants have expressed a preference for a more limited system than that contemplated by appellees’ project, urging that the additional number of persons to be served by the more extensive system planned by appellees does not warrant the expenditure involved.</p>
