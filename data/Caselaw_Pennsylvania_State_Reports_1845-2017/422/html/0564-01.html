We all feel that both parties are at fault and each should share the loss. If you have any suggestions, please advise.

A prime example of the necessity for such rules is in the area of criminal procedure, where the accusatorial system, the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial, and the presumption of innocence, combine to admonish an appellate court not to substitute its belief of guilt, however justified it may seem to us on the record, for the independent <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>ascertainment by a jury. See, e.g., <em>Estes v. Texas, </em><a href="/us/381/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="381 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6172302" data-case-paths="/us/381/0532-01">381 U.S. 532</a>, <a href="/us/381/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="381 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6172302" data-case-paths="/us/381/0532-01">85 S.

The reason for prohibiting a trial judge from communicating with a jury ex parte is to prevent the court from unduly influencing the jury and to afford counsel an opportunity to become aware and to seek to correct any error which might occur. Where there is no showing either that the court’s action may have influenced the jury or that its directions were erroneous, then the reason for the rule dissolves.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.6",596,[207,1323,1151,644]]]'>Trial judges are rarely afforded the luxury of time given to the appellate bench to carefully consider and reconsider each decision they make during the course of a trial. Thus, I do not think it is necessary to reprimand a trial judge for making a perfectly understandable mistake provided that no one is prejudiced thereby. By imposing a per se rule, the loss falls upon the successful party below, who in all probability will prevail on retrial, although he will have been forced to expend additional time and money, and on other litigants whose cases will be delayed because of the addition to trial court backlog.</p>
