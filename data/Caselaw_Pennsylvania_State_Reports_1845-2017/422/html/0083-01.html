As they approached the property, the detectives noticed defendant sitting at a window and observed him look in their direction. One of the detectives knocked on the door with his hand, waited about one minute during which time there was no response within, and knocked once again. Still hearing no response, the officers indicated that they were about to apply a crowbar between the door and jamb when the defendant cried out, “Don’t break my door. I will let you in.” Defendant then opened the door and admitted the detectives who identified them<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>selves, read the warrants and began their search, in the course of which they confiscated two different editions of the Armstrong Daily and several blank sheets of paper.

Preserving this right in the state, Mr. Justice Clark stated: “We reiterate that the reasonableness of a search is in the first instance a substantive determination to be made by the trial court from the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the ‘fundamental criteria’ laid down by the Fourth Amendment and in opinions of this Court applying that Amendment.

Indeed, it is this very possibility which should allow state law enforcement officers to adopt techniques to suit the concrete situation. Blakey, The Rule of Announcement and Unlawful Entry: Miller v. United States and Ker v. California, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20499" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="112 U. Pa. L. Rev. 499">112 U. Pa. L. Rev. 499</a>, 557 (1964). In view of the foregoing, the conduct of the county detectives in this matter did not violate the safeguards of the Fourth Amendment. The testimony reveals that they were observed by defendant as they approached his door; that there was an interval of silence which lasted one minute following their first knock at the door; and that even before they were able to apply the crowbar the defendant opened the door. Under these circumstances, it is obvious that defendant knew their identity and purpose without a formal announcement. Furthermore, there was absent here the “forceful entry” which confronted the Court in <em>Ker. </em>Although the argument may well be made that the detectives were not voluntarily admitted by defendant but gained admission by means <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>of property duress, the entry was not unlawful under the <em>Ker </em>standard. Even the dissenters in <em>Ker </em>recognized that exceptions to the rule of announcement exist, <em>inter alia, </em>where the persons within already know of the officers’ authority and purpose or “where those within, made aware of the presence of someone outside (because, for example, there has been a knock at the door), are then engaged in activity which justifies the officers in the belief that an escape or the destruction of evidence is being attempted.” <a href="/us/374/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="374 U.S. 23" data-case-ids="8495" data-case-paths="/us/374/0023-01">374 U.S. at 47</a>. Certainly, if the instant case does not fall within the former exception, then the lengthy silence maintained by defendant after observing the officers and hearing their knock would justify the application of the latter exception to the present matter. In any event, neither the arrest nor the search and seizure was violative of federal constitutional standards.</p>

In <em>Manduchi, </em>police officers, armed with a search warrant, broke down the accused’s door with a sledge hammer only a few seconds after knocking and receiving no response. At the same time, other officers broke through another door with a section of a telephone pole. The Third Circuit held that the search which followed was unreasonable and the evidence obtained therefrom inadmissible because the officers had not made known their identity and purpose, nor had they allowed the accused the opportunity of opening the door peacefully. Defendant herein has neither objection available to him, because he was given ample opportunity to open the door, as he finally did, and every indication was that he was well aware of who were at his door and why they were there.</p>

It says that “the lengthy silence maintained by defendant after observing the officers and hearing their knock” justified what the detectives did. To being with, there is not a word in the entire record that the defendant was <em>“observing </em>the officers” or that he was “hearing their knock.” At the trial MacCrory testified “we could see Mr. Ametrane sitting at the window.” Sitting at the window certainly does not establish that Ametrane saw the detectives. Or, even assuming he did see these two individuals, how could he know they were detectives or that they were seeking him? There was no evidence he had ever seen them before. They were in plain clothes and they did not shout or signal to the defendant that he should come down to open the door for them. At the preliminary hearing MacCrory testified that “he looked down as we were coming down.” This was simply a conclusion on MacCrory’s part. He did not say that Ametrane acted in any way to show that he saw the detectives or recognized them as detectives. Thus, the Majority founds its <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>conclusion on a fanciful speculation and improves on the detective’s self-serving guess by stating that the defendant was <em>“observing </em>the officers,” plus that he heard the knock. To <em>observe </em>means more than merely to see or perceive; it means to watch, to study, to pay special attention to. There is not the slightest whisper of testimony to justify any such assertion of studying or lingering perception on the part of the defendant. It is more likely, from the record, that Ametrane came down to open the door, because he heard the detectives battering at it with their crowbar, than that he saw the detectives, and recognized them, or that he even heard the first knock. At any rate there is nothing to justify the Majority’s gratuitous assertion that Ametrane was “observing the officers.”</p>

The Majority speaks of “the <em>lengthy </em>silence maintained by the defendant.” What does the Majority regard as “lengthy”? Is one minute lengthy? It took the Revolutionary war patriots seven long years to win independence and gain constitutional guarantees against forcible searches, but the county detectives could not wait more than one minute to break down the monument erected over the sacrifices of the soldiers of our republic and the founders of our democracy. And this Court, instead of castigating with suitable language this arrogant usurpation of police power by camouflaged servants of the law, pins a medal on their breasts and commends them for not delaying more than a minute before they unleashed the fury of their riotous attack on a private dwelling. Even the Minute Men of Lexington waited more than one minute before firing on the Redcoats, but the detectives of Delaware County had to whip out their crowbar and smash at a door sixty seconds after announcing their dictatorial presence with a resounding knock of their knuckles on the door.</p>

It was through his ears that he learned of the grating and battering of the crowbar against the outer portal of his habitation. The mere knock that the detectives testified to would not have alarmed the defendant into pleading: “Don’t break the door.” Thus the defendant opened the door because he was compelled to do so in order to save it from being smashed open.

In addition to pointing out the illegality of the search and seizure, the defendant in his appeal has contended that the conviction is unsustainable because there was not sufficient evidence upon which to base a guilty verdict and that the trial court permitted improper opinion evidence. These contentions are serious ones and a great deal depends on their being considered and correctly adjudicated. The defendant was sentenced to pay a fine of |300 and undergo imprisonment for a term of three months. Thus, not only is the defendant’s liberty at stake but also his name, reputation and future standing in society. How has the Majority Opinion disposed of these crucial matters? The detectives in the case at least waited one minute before applying their crowbar. The Majority Opinion did not give even one <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>minute to a discussion of the contentions advanced, a disapproval of which will result in a jailing of the defendant plus an ever-continuing sociological imprisonment in having to move through life with a tarnished name. This is what the Majority Opinion said: “Defendant further argues that . . . one of the detectives was improperly permitted to testify as an expert and express his opinion that defendant was a bookmaker; and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. Each of these arguments is without merit and has been properly decided by the Superior Court.”</p>
    <p id="AbK" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[205,980,1153,636]]]'>Let us see if these arguments are without merit. What was the evidence that the detectives found in the defendant’s home? First they found two editions of the <em>Armstrong Daily, </em>one in the living room and another behind a refrigerator. The detectives made much of the location of the paper behind the refrigerator. Where does one place a periodical when he is through reading it, at least for the time? On a table, on a chair, behind a refrigerator, behind the radio? The fact that one of these papers rested behind the refrigerator certainly does not connote any profound premeditated concealment.</p>

That it specializes in race tracks news and information does not make it illegal or even suspect in any way. Horse racing is not only not illegal in America but it is also indeed a favorite American pastime. Each year some 20,000 horses are raced in the United States. Crowds numbering 30,000,000 attend annually some 77 major tracks in the country. Horse racing daily commands space in the sports pages of the metropolitan newspapers, and classics like the Kentucky Derby command front page, feature television and radio coverage.</p>

Suppose an expert witness were called to give his opinion as to whether the defendant was a murderer or a burglar.

Often I will simply note a dissent in a case because I have already expressed, in some previous litigations, my views on the legal questions involved. However it was mandatory that I write a Dissenting Opinion here, and one of some length, because I am hoping that the defendant will petition the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari.
