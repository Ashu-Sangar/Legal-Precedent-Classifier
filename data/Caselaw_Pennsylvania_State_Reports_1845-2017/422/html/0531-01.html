Becker (Becker) was enjoined until August 27, 1966, “from engaging in any way, directly or indirectly, in any business competitive” with Beneficial Finance Co. of Lebanon (Beneficial). The decree further enjoined Becker until August 27, 1968 “from disclosing to any person or business competitor the names of past, present and prospective borrowers of Beneficial Finance Co. of Lebanon.

On October 10, 1953, Becker signed a contract of employment with Beneficial Finance Co. of Easton which was accepted by Beneficial Management Corporation on October 19, 1953. After gaining considerable training and experience, Becker became manager of Beneficial’s office from March 4, 1959 until August 27, 1965, at which time he resigned from his position. Becker then commenced to work for Andrews Consumers Discount Co., a competitor of Beneficial, in Lebanon on September 1, 1965. Beneficial filed this suit in equity on September 22, 1965.</p>

Becker, on this appeal, does not challenge the reasonableness of the restrictive covenants which are sufficiently circumscribed, in our opinion, to be legally valid but rather asserts that the contract was <em>not </em>ancillary to Becker’s taking of employment with Beneficial’s affiliated corporation, Beneficial Finance Co. of Easton, and therefore lacks consideration.</p>
