    <p id="b183-9" data-blocks='[["BL_183.16",183,[127,1567,1151,477]]]'>Prior to the Act of August 27, 1963, P. L. 1257, 71 P.S. §§741.3-741.1005 (Supp. 1965), appellant, Harry L. Hunter, an employee of the Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, held a position classified under executive civil service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> By virtue of that Act, his position was placed under coverage of legislative civil service and, in accordance with the provisions thereof, appellant was given probationary status for a period of eighteen months.</p>

Upon the refusal of the commission to inquire into appellant’s charge, he obtained a writ of mandamus from the Commonwealth Court directing the commission to afford him a hearing. On appeal, this Court affirmed the issuance of the writ. <em>Hunter v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/417/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="417 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="1893963" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0372-01">417 Pa. 372</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20784" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="207 A.2d 784">207 A. <em>2d </em>784</a> (1965).</p>

At the termination of the proceedings, the commission concluded that appellant had failed to establish that his discharge had been motivated by non-merit factors, finding that he had been removed for just cause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> An order was entered sustaining the action of the Secretary of Revenue in dismissing appellant from his position.

Rather, he contends that the commission erred in construing the Civil Service Act not to re<a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>quire the Budget Secretary to conduct an independent investigation prior to the discharge of a probationary employee for unsatisfactory work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant contends that the Act should be read so as to impose upon the Budget Secretary the non-delegable duty of conducting such an investigation prior to affixing his signature to the notification of discharge.</p>
    <p id="b185-3" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[132,767,1150,316]]]'>Although acknowledging receipt of a notification of discharge countersigned by the Budget Secretary, appellant contends that the admitted failure of the Secretary to make an independent inquiry into the merits of the dismissal voids his discharge as being unauthorized and irregular.</p>
    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[134,1096,1152,807]],["BL_186.1",186,[206,388,1149,372]]]'>We are unable to agree with the contention advanced by appellant. Section 28(c) of the Civil Service Act, the section here in dispute, provides that the Budget Secretary must countersign not only notifications of dismissal of probationary employees but also notifications that an employee has been accorded regular employment status. Thus, the Secretary is required to countersign notifications of change of status of probationary employees relating to matters other than discharge. This fact confirms our view that the countersignature requirement was intended to conform with the long standing administrative practice of processing changes in the governmental work force through the office of the Budget Secretary prior to their becoming effective so that central personnel control and, <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>thus, central budget control, may be more efficiently secured. In addition, the requirement constitutes a safeguard for the Commonwealth by affording the Budget Secretary an opportunity to coordinate personnel changes and thereby avoid dislocations which might interfere with the functioning of the executive branch of the government.</p>
    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[205,769,1150,795]]]'>Under this view, the one adopted by the Civil Service Commission and the one which we find more compelling, the Budget Secretary is not required by the Act to conduct an inquiry into the discharge of probationary employees prior to his countersigning a notification of dismissal. Under the position advanced by appellant, the Budget Secretary would be required to investigate the merits of <em>all </em>changes of status affecting probationary employees. Such an interpretation of the Act would vest the Secretary with appointive and discharge authority greater than that of department heads, and would impose responsibilities upon him far beyond the realm of his expertise. Nothing has been called to our attention which supports such a construction of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[204,1585,1150,368]]]'>Appellant also contends that he was denied procedural due process by the application of the amended Civil Service Act to his case. This contention, since it presents a constitutional question, is reviewable even though the case is here on narrow certiorari. See <em>Keystone Raceway Corp. v. State Harness Racing Comm’n, </em>supra; <em>DeVito v. Civil Service Comm’n, </em>supra.</p>

Cf. <em>Kelly v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/419/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="419 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1896907" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0305-01">419 Pa. 305</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=214%20A.2d%20345" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="214 A.2d 345">214 A. 2d 345</a> (1965); <em>Hunter v.

    <p id="b187-3" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[127,752,1151,318]]]'>Assuming arguendo that appellant is correct in his assertion that the conduct upon which the charge of unsatisfactory work was based occurred prior to the effective date of the Act of 1963, we do not agree that the application of that Act to appellant constituted a denial of a constitutionally guaranteed right.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[124,1080,1153,586]]]'>A governmental employee has no vested right in the terms and conditions of his employment, <em>Kelly v.

Cf. <em>Philadelphia Civil Service Comm’n v. Eckles, </em><a href="/pa/376/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="376 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1246222" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0421-01">376 Pa. 421</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.2d%20761" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="103 A.2d 761">103 A. 2d 761</a> (1954).
