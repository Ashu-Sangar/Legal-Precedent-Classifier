Prior to tbe passage of that statute, an Orphans’ Court bad tbe power to dispose of an appeal from tbe probate of a testamentary instrument in tbe following manner: (a) if tbe dispute of fact concerning tbe validity of tbe writing alleged to be testamentary was <em>substantial, </em>then tbe court was under a <em>statutorily-mandated </em>duty to award tbe parties a trial by jury and (b) if tbe dispute of fact was <em>not substantial, </em>then tbe court could refuse a jury trial and either (1) sustain or (2) declare invalid tbe testamentary writing.

Under sucb prior law when a party was <em>statutorily </em>entitled to a trial by jury or when tbe Orphans’ Court, <em>in its discretion, </em>awarded a jury trial, then tbe statute provided that “tbe verdict of tbe jury shall be conclusive only if the court is satisfied with tbe justness of it on tbe basis of all tbe evidence. If tbe court is not so satisfied, it may set aside tbe verdict, grant a new trial, or enter sucb other judgment as satisfies its conscience.” See: Act of August 10, 1951, P.

L. 610, §1, 20 P.S. §2080.745(c). (Emphasis added). As a result of this change in the statute there is now no <em>statutorily-mandated </em>right to a trial by jury in a will contest; the impanelling of a jury lies solely within the discretion of the chancellor. Moreover, since a jury verdict is now advisory only, the refusal of the chancellor to impanel a jury does not constitute an abuse of discretion: <em>Hunter Will, </em>supra, at p. 137.

It has long been well established that the findings of a chancellor, approved by a court en banc, are ordinarily controlling upon an appellate court.

If, after accepting the jury’s findings as to credibility, the Court in reviewing the matter, then decides the verdict cannot reasonably be supported by the evidence, the chancellor would be proper in overturning the verdict. But the verdict should not be overturned where,, using the jury’s findings on credibility, the verdict can reasonably be supported by the evidence.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> To adopt this Board-suggested rule would require this Court to rewrite the clear language of the statute; that we cannot do.</p>
