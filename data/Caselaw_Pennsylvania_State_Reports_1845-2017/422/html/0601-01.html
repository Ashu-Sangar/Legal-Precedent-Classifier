The curb cut requirements of appellee were not permissible within the limits of the City regulations, but exceptions and deviations from the regulations could have been granted by the Street Commissioner. Surely, the parties could have made appellee’s performance specifically dependent on the grant of an exception, in which event appellant would clearly have failed to perform. Since exceptions were possible, the actual language of the agreement was tantamount to a requirement that a deviation from the normal standards <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>be obtained, should appellee’s specifications require such deviation.</p>

The question is in reality merely one of good faith on the part of the appellee for insisting on the requirements in question.
