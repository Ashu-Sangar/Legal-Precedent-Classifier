An alleged parol gift, therefore, from a husband to a wife, under such circumstances, should be proved by clear and convincing testimony. The claim in the present case however appears to have met this requirement. Two disinterested witnesses testified to the actual delivery of the box containing the securities and the subsequent continued possession by the wife. Three other witnesses testified to decedent\u2019s repeated declarations, about the time of the gift, that all his property was to be his wife\u2019s, and one at least, to his regret that he had not made a will giving it all to her. We do not regard this as conflicting with the fact of a gift of the securities, because the evidence shows that the decedent had real estate and perhaps some other personal property that was not included in the gift, but would have passed by a will. These declarations would not of course establish a gift, but they are confirmatory of the intent with which the actual delivery of the securities testified to by the other witnesses was made. The evidence as a whole was sufficient, if believed, to sustain the claim of a gift; the auditor and the judge below believed it; and we have not been convinced that they were in error in so doing.\nDecree affirmed with costs.",

    "head_matter": "Estate of Joseph Wise, deceased. Appeal of Edward J. Wise.\nDecedents' estates \u2014 Gift\u2014Husband and wife \u2014 Evidence.\nA widow claimed that certain securities had been given to her by her husband shortly before his death. Two disinterested witnesses testified to the actual delivery of the box containing the securities, and also to the subsequent continued possession by the wife. Three other witnesses testified to decedent\u2019s repeated declarations, about the time of the gift, that all his property was to be his wife\u2019s, and at least one witness testified to decedent\u2019s regret that he had not made a will giving it all to her. The decedent had real estate and some personal property other than the securities. The auditor and the orphans\u2019 court found in favor of the widow. Held, that the decree of the court below should be sustained.\nArgued April 26, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 3, Jan. T., 1897, by Edward J. Wise, from decree of O. C. Cumberland Co., dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nExceptions to report of auditor, James W. Eckels, Esq.\nThe court dismissed the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, in an opinion by E. W. Biddle, P. J., which states the facts as follows:\nMrs. Catharine Wise was manifestly incompetent as a witness in her own behalf, and the auditor was- therefore right in disregarding her testimony. The pivotal question in the case is, Did Joseph Wise, shortly prior to his death, make a gift to his wife of the securities in the box? On this subject Miss Jennie Hunnnelbaugh, who had lived with decedent since early childhood, testified that about two weeks before his death he handed to Mrs. Wise his securities, which were in the little box wherein they were always kept, and said they were hers; and that Mrs. Wise then put them in her bureau drawer and locked it. The witness specified a mortgage and other property which were in the box as follows: \u201cThere was a mortgage for $700; Kern\u2019s note; Otto note for $300; Siplinger, $300; Kressler, $300; Naugle, $150; and McKay note, $300.\u201d\nJ. B. Hofferd, who was at decedent\u2019s house every day for the last two weeks of his life, and was present when he died, testified as follows: \u201c Q. State what he said to you with reference to his personal property. A. He told me that everything was to be Mrs. Wise\u2019s, and he gave it to her. I had seen the box and seen the contents. He said to Mrs.-Wise, \u2018 That is yours; take it.\u2019 Q. And the contents wer\u00e9 in it? A.- Yes, sir. Q. Did or did not he speak about these things on more than one occar sion? A. Yes, sir. Q. What did he say? A. He said it was all hers ; they had worked hard for it and it was his wife\u2019s.\u201d When questioned in relation to the notes, he stated: \u201c I said I knew some of them. The notes were in his hand and he read one to me, I was standing right alongside of him. I was standing to the left of him, and Mrs. Wise was standing to the other side, and he laid them on the stand, and the box in his lap, and he read the notes over and put them back in his box, and closed the box. The key was in the box, and he said to his wife, \u2018 Take this; it is yours.\u2019 \u201d\nDr. J. C. Davis, the attending physician, said that Mr. Wise spoke to him several times during his last illness in reference to lfis papers, and seemed to regret that he hadn\u2019t made a will, and stated that he desired his wife to have all Ms property. Annie Hofferd testified that she was with decedent during the last two weeks of Ms life, day and Mght, and she heard him say more than once that all he had was to go to Ms wife; that it belonged to her. George H. Wise stated that at different times, up to shortly before his death, decedent said to him that everything hd had was to be his wife\u2019s. It is now settled in Pennsylvania that a valid gift of non-negotiable securities may be made by a delivery of them to the donee, accompanied by appropriate words, without a written assignment: Com. v. Crompton, 137 Pa. 138; Pryor v. Morgan, 170 Pa. 568; and the same doctrine is now upheld, with substantial unanimity, in other states: 8 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 1322.\nIn the present case the evidence to sustain the gift was ample : Rhodes v. Childs, 64 Pa. 18; Pryor v. Morgan, supra. The natural affection of the decedent for the donee and the faithful services rendered to him by her are corroborative of the positive testimony that a gift was made: Yeakel v. McAtee, 156 Pa. 600. After a careful consideration of the evidence and of the legal principles applicable thereto we are of opinion that none of the exceptions should be sustained. The administratrix should at once charge herself with the $140, which she received from Peter Guttshall, one of the executors of F. Wise, deceased, and with all other personal assets belonging to her husband\u2019s estate, and proceed with the settlement of said estate in strict accordance with law. No question in regard to the propriety of an order for the sale of real estate arises at the present time, and a discussion of that subject would therefore be premature.\nError assigned was decree of the court.\nS. M. Leidich, with him II. S. Stuart, for appellant.\nWhile the Supreme Court will give weight to an auditor\u2019s report when confirmed by the court below, yet, when the facts reported by him are only deductions from other facts in the case, the court above are as able to look into these facts as he: Hindman\u2019s App., 85 Pa. 470 ; Phillips\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 130; Milligan\u2019s App., 97 Pa. 525; and when it clearly appears to the Supreme Court that an auditor has not only found facts against the weight of the evidence, but has disregarded the evidence, and thereby reached an unjust result, his findings of fact and law, though confirmed by the court below, will be reversed: Miller\u2019s App., 102 Pa. 544.\nGifts from a husband to his wife must be clearly proved: 8 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 1333; Scott v. Reed, 153 Pa. 14; Fross\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 258 ; Smith\u2019s Est., 144 Pa. 435; Scott v. Lauman, 104 Pa. 593 ; Wagoner\u2019s Est., 174 Pa. 562; Helfenstein\u2019s Est., 77 Pa. 328.\nK. H. Mercer, for appellee.\nIt is an established rule that the finding of an auditor upon the facts, when approved by the court below, will not be disturbed on appeal, except for flagrant error: Lewis\u2019s App., 127 Pa. 127; Hess\u2019s Est., 150 Pa. 346 ; Prouty v. Prouty, etc., Shoe Co., 155 Pa. 112 ; Donaldson\u2019s Est., 158 Pa. 292; Countryman\u2019s Est., 151 Pa. 577; Penn Bank\u2019s Est., 152 Pa. 65 ; Harbison\u2019s Est., 145 Pa. 456; Stevenson Co. v. Sample, 174 Pa. 165; Hughes\u2019s Est., 176 Pa. 387.\nThis evidence was ample to sustain the finding of the auditor that a valid gift was made of the designated property by Joseph Wise to his wife, Catharine Wise : Rhodes v. Childs, 64 Pa. 18; Pryor v. Morgan, 170 Pa. 568; Yeakel v. McAtee, 156 Pa. 600; Com. v. Crompton, 137 Pa. 138.\nJuly 15, 1897:"
