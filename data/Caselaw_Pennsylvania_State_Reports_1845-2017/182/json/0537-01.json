        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chiee Justice Sterrett,\nThis case was argued with the appeal in Samuel Mitchell\u2019s Estate, No. 505, of January term, 1896, in which an opinion has just been filed affirming the decree of the orphans\u2019 court. The questions considered and decided in that case virtually dispose of the questions presented by the record in this case, and require that the decree of the court below be affirmed. There is nothing in either of the specifications of error- that requires discussion. For reasons which sufficiently appear in the record of this case, and in the opinion above referred to, the learned judge was clearly right in dismissing appellant\u2019s exception to the auditor\u2019s report, etc., and in discharging rule to show cause.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s cost.",

T., 1896, by Elizabeth Mitchell, from appeal of C. P. Huntingdon Co., Execution Docket,No. 2, Sept. T., 1896, distributing proceeds of sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate of Thomas Mitchell.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nException to report of J. F. Schock, Esq., auditor to distribute proceeds of sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate.\nThis case grows out of the will of Samuel Mitchell, deceased, and the principal facts are stated in Mitchell\u2019s Estate, ante, p. 530. The court in that case having refused to grant an order to the executor to sell the real estate of the decedent for the payment of debts, also refused to stay the writ of fieri facias' against Thomas Mitchell; and the land devised to him by Samuel Mitchell, deceased, having been sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, the auditor to distribute the fund rejected the claim of appellant, who was a creditor of testator.\nError assigned was dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nOct. 11, 1897:"
