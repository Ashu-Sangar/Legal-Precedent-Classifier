    <p class="syllabus" id="b84-8" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[248,1352,1173,720]]]'>In an action upon a policy of fire insurance the insurance company set up as a defense misrepresentations made by one S. who was alleged to be the agent of the insured. It is undisputed that the policy was procured from the insurance company on the representation by S. that plaintiff was a man, when the fact was that she was a married woman. The testimony showed that S. was an insurance broker, having no special relation to the defendant, but occasionally, through its regular agent, taking out policies in it for his customers whose risks he did not place in other companies which he personally represented. When he placed the insurance in question he was not defendant’s agent, and had never been its agent, and was not acting at the suggestion of its regular agent. In soliciting the insurance he was pursuing his own business as a broker, and using his own judgment where to place the insurance which his customers authorized him to procure for them. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the evidence was sufficient to establish the fact that S. was the plaintiff’s agent; (2) that there was such misrepresentation and fraud as would avoid the contract, and a verdict and judgment for the defendant should be sustained.</p>

Freedman was a man living in the borough of Athens and doing business there, when the fact is that R. Freedman was a married woman.

In this he followed the law as settled in Freedman v. Fire Association, <a href="/pa/168/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="168 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="868534" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0249-01">168 Pa. 249</a>. The fact of such misrepresentation is undisputed, though as to whether Sturdevant knew it was untrue at the <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>time he made it, the evidence is conflicting. The correctness of the instruction therefore depends on the relation of Sturdevant to the parties. If he was the agent of defendant then there was a question for the jury whether he had been informed, or had notice, that R. Freedman was a married woman. But if he was the agent of plaintiff then his knowledge was immaterial, the plaintiff cannot avoid the responsibility of a misrepresentation by her own agent, whether made knowingly or not and at the same time claim a benefit arising from such misrepresentation.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[120,842,1174,815]]]'>An examination of the evidence shows that the learned judge was clearly right in holding Sturdevant to be the plaintiff’s agent. His own testimony which is uncontradicted on this point, shows that Sturdevant was an insurance broker, having no special relation to the defendant company but occasionally taking out policies in it, through its regular agent, for his-customers when he could not or did not wish to place their risks in the other companies which he personally represented. He was not at the time he procured this insurance, and had never been, an agent for the defendant, nor was he acting on this occasion in behalf or at the suggestion of the regular agent, Darte. On the contrary, in soliciting this insurance he was pursuing his own business as a broker and, as he says, using his own judgment where to place the insurance his customers authorized him to procure for them. The case was clearly in line with Pottsville Ins. Co. v. Minnequa Springs Co., <a href="/pa/100/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="100 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="498458" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0137-01">100 Pa. 137</a>.</p>
