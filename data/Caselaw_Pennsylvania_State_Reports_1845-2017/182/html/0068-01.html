Nothing could be more utterly vain and speculative than an attempt to fix the valué of the debtor’s interest in the real estate under such circumstances.

    <p class="summary" id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[243,548,1170,646]]]'>Messrs. Lamed &amp; Haas claim a lien against the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., in the real estate of his father by virtue of their judgment of July 11, 1893. As a judgment is not a lien upon personalty, and as execution was not here issued until after the assignment for the benefit of creditors, the question is whether E. S. Handy, Jr., has such an interest in land as is bound by the lien of a judgment. In Pennsylvania a judgment binds equitable, reversionary, and even inchoate interests, but those interests must be estates in the land, and unless the debtor has an interest in specific real estate which he could himself convey, a judgment against such debtor is not a lien against said real estate. In Morrow v. Brenizer, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%20188" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Rawle 188">2 Rawle, 188</a>, Chief Justice Gibson said:</p>

This takes for granted that the legatee had in fact an interest in the land. . . . But, it is proper to remark, that both the major and minor are untrue. The interest of a mortgagee, judgment creditor, owner of a legacy charged on land, creditor of an intestate estate, mechanic or material man, or of a preferred creditor under an assignment to trustees (to each of whom the land is debtor), is not the subject of judgment and execution. Nothing is such but an immediate interest, as, for instance, the estate of a tenant by the curtesy <em>initiate; </em>or of a widow, whose interest is put, by the intestate acts, on the footing of a rent charge. The only thing peculiar to a judgment with us is that it binds an equitable, or even an inchoate interest, but that interest must be an estate in the land.” So in Thomas v. Simpson, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Pa.%2069" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Pa. 69">3 Pa. 69</a>, the court said: “ In Pennsylvania a judgment is a lien on every kind of equitable as well as legal interest in land vested in the debtor at the time of the judgment, and such interest may be seized and sold in execution in payment of debts. A rent charge on estates of a tenant by curtesy initiate; or widow’s dower, her interest being put by the intestate acts on the footing of a rent charge; or right or title in land, although unaccompanied by <em>possession; </em>in short, every <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>interest, of every description, provided it be an interest in the land, may, in this state, be sold on execution.” To tbe same effect are Allison v. Wilson, 13 S. &amp; R. 330; Hess v. Sborb, <a href="/pa/7/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="957921" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0231-01">7 Pa. 231</a>. Hence it has been held that a judgment is not a lien upon the right to live upon land belonging to another: Calhoun v. Jester, <a href="/pa/11/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="11 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="404680" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0474-01">11 Pa. 474</a>.

The sole right of the distributees is, after the death of the widow, to receive something which will amount to one fourth of the entire estate of the testator, and this is to be worked out by the trustees alone, and it is their decision and allotment which the testator directs shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds, which alone vests the title in specific pieces of property. Prior to allotment, of what real estate is E. S. Handy, Jr., seized? What specific land could he convey ? Upon what real estate could the sheriff post his notices of execution ? The interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., is not a three sixteenths interest in each piece of land of which the testator died seized, for that would imply a jurisdiction to compel the trustees to allot a three sixteenths interest in each tract or house to the said E. S. Handy, Jr. The only control which E. S. Handy, Jr., has over the trustees, and his only present specific interest in the estate, is an interest to compel a proper execution of the trust, viz: to compel an allotment of one equal fourth part to the said E. S. Handy, Jr. He has no interest to compel the allotment of specific items of the estate. That discretion the testator has vested in his trustees by the second codicil, and this clause has been decided by the Supreme Court and held to empower the trustees to make allotment “ in their unfettered discretion,” the only limitation being that it shall be divided into “ four equal shares: ” Handy’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20Pa.%20564" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="167 Pa. 564">167 Pa. 564</a>. The trustees could allot one share in personalty, provided that it was equal in value to every other share. Under the evidence there is ample personalty to make such allotment. The <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>scheme of the testator is apparently not to invest any child with any specific interest in any specific property prior to allotment and division by the trustees. The powers of sale vested in the trustees as to many properties would lead to the same conclusion as to the testator’s intention, for a sale of any piece of real estate by the trustees under their power would defeat the title of a judgment creditor, and searches would not be taken out against the cestuis que trust, who are distributees. Under the statute executors who are given powers of sale are invested with the estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[250,869,1169,404]]]'>The interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., under the present will would seem to be somewhat analogous to the interest of the distributees in Chew’s Executors v.

If there was a conversion; of course no lien by judgment would attach. But because there is no conversion it does not follow that the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., is a specific interest in each piece of real estate of which his father died seized. The rights and interests of E. S. Handy, Jr., are solely conferred by the will of his father, and he takes them in such, manner as the testator chooses to direct, and there is nothing illegal in the testator giving a vested interest in the execution of the trust, and deferring that vesting as to any specific item of his estate within any time regulated by the rule against perpetuities. No illegal injustice to creditors is effected by such provision, for the testator, had he so chosen, could have exempted the entire interest from liability of every kind to creditors by making a spendthrift son trust of the entire interest, instead of as to only one fourth thereof, as he has done. The question is, whether E. S. Handy, Jr., has such a tangible interest in the land of which his father died seized qua land, as entitles a judgment to become a lien thereon, or whether, on the contrary, the interest of E. S. Plandy, Jr., is simply an interest in a blended fund, the specific proportions of which are <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>impossible to ascertain until division. In the opinion of the master the latter is the correct construction of the testator’s will. To hold that prior to allotment each son is invested with a specific interest in each specific piece of real estate, of which the testator died seized,' whereby executions may be issued, and a specific interest sold in certain described real estate, would seem necessarily to conflict with the plan of distribution provided by the testator, as it divests the trustees of any discretion whatever in mating their allotment and division. By such construction it would necessarily follow that the trustees had no discretion other than to make their allotments so that each share should contain an equal fourth interest in realty and an equal fourth interest in personalty. Whereas the Supreme Court in this case have held that the trustees are to make such “ partition and distribution in their unfettered discretion, . . . and the trustee may allot his share in personalty, or on the other hand, they may put it all in realty with or without owelty.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[149,1236,1174,1173]]]'>It was, however, argued that all parties in interest had a right to elect to dispense with the execution of the trust, and to take the land as land, and that the judgment given by E. S. Handy, Jr., was evidence of his election to take sufficient land as land as would be necessary to satisfy the judgment. But E. S. Handy, Jr., could not disturb the will by his sole election, and there was no evidence of any election on the part of the other distributee; and, moreover, giving a judgment would seem to be no evidence of such an election on the part of E. S. Handy, Jr. The judgment was establishing by matter of record the validity and amount of an existing indebtedness. Such judgment could be enforced against personalty as well as realty, therein differing from a mortgage, which was held to be a provisional election in Bailey v. Allegheny Bank, <a href="/pa/104/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="104 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="452126" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0425-01">104 Pa. 425</a>. In the last-named case it also appears that all the other distributees under the will had united in an express election. If giving a judgment is to be treated as an election under a will to appropriate land to satisfy the judgment, it might in this case, with equal force, be conversely argued that the prior assignment by E. S. Handy, Jr., of April 29, 1893, to the Philadelphia Trust Company, was equally declaratory of Ms Mtention to elect to appropriate so much personalty as would be necessary to fully satisfy that assignment.</p>

S. Handy, Jr., to the said estate. At this date the trustees, who (except the widow) are also executors, were and are in possession of the estate.

As appears in the second original finding of fact, this is composed of three promissory notes, given by E. S. Handy, Jr., to his father, amounting to $24,746, and of the sum of $17,285.13, being the amount due by the said E. S. Handy, Jr., upon the pledge of certain shares of stock loaned him by his father and redeemed by the executors’ payment of this sum of $17,285.13. This last-named indebtedness arose in the lifetime of the testator, the said testator having loaned his son fifty shares of the Philadelphia Trust Company stock, for the purpose of borrowing for the use of his said son such sum as the Philadelphia Trust Company might loan thereon to him. The Philadelphia Trust Company thereupon loaned the said E. S. Handy, Jr., $18,000, which was subsequently reduced by payments to $16,500. On April 29,1893, this sum amounted, with interest, to the aforesaid sum of $17,285.13, and as the stock was more valuable than the amount of the loan, the executors reduced the liability to a cash basis by paying the debt for which it was pledged. As this indebtedness arose from the express act of the testator in Ms lifetime, being in reality a loan of cash by the testator in the form of- stock, which was liquidated in cash by the execu<a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>tors, it would seem that, although not recited in the will, its validity is the same as the other loans made by the testator, which were so set forth in his said will.</p>

Apart from this liquidation, the master has investigated the amount of the indebtedness and finds that the sum stated in said agreement is correct, and that all interest thereon had been previously paid or adjusted. The executors presented a claim for interest on the notes held by the testator from 1881' down to the testator’s death in 1889, but this claim was negatived by the evidence and by subsequent admissions. Since the testator’s death the interest on these notes has been paid in full to October, 1895, by deductions from E. S. Handy, Jr.’s share of the income of the estate.

Thus, the interest created by the assignment of April 29, 1893, is such an interest by way of lien as would seriously embarrass any private sale attempted to be made by the assignee. In the language of the act of 1876, it is to the “ manifest interest of all parties ” that the purchasers title shall be a clear and unincumbered title. Otherwise the property would be more or less sacrificed in value, as the purchasers would be compelled to speculate on the duration of the life of the widow in determining how long they could hold the property before being called upon to pay the principal of the lien subject to which they bought it, and the existence of this prior lien and its uncertain duration would also prevent the purchasers from borrowing money thereon by way of mortgage or other charge, and in other ways add to the unmarketability of the title. These contingencies would defeat the obtaining a fair price for the property, and it is obviously the interest of Messrs. Larned &amp; Haas, as well as the assignee, that the sale shall be made in such manner that the largest price can be obtained. The executors are also interested in such result, and hence themselves pray that the sale may be free and discharged from any claim upon their part, and that their rights shall be asserted upon the fund to'be produced thereby. There does not seem to be any rule of law which prevents this. The decisions are the other way, for the indebtedness to secure the payment of which the assignment of April 29, 1893 was executed, in so far as said indebtedness consists of the amounts advanced by the testator, has been decided by the Supreme Court to consist merely of loans and not technical advances; and in so far as said indebtedness is composed of the amount due by E. S. Handy, Jr., upon the stock loaned him by bis father, such indebtedness is also clearly a loan. Hence the entire sum for which the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., in his father’s estate is held by the executors of the estate is a debt due by the said <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>E. S.

    <p id="b101-8" data-blocks='[["BL_101.12",101,[110,1677,1173,710]]]'>The matters involved in this controversy were before this court in Handy’s Estate, <a href="/pa/167/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="167 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="866776" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0552-01">167 Pa. 552</a>, and most of them decided. The principal question now raised is whether the estate of E. S. Handy, Jr., under his father’s will included any interest in land which would be subject to the lien of a judgment against him. This question was incidentally considered in the former case but in the state of the record then was not decided though some intimation was given of the leaning of the court. The learned master, however, to whom the matter was referred back for the ascertainment of the liens and the effects of the sale upon them, took up the question anew with great learning and ability, and has stated his conclusions with such clearness and accuracy that little more is necessary for us than to express our approval of them.</p>

      <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>The testator left his estate in trust but gave a beneficial interest in one fourth of it to his son E. S. Handy, Jr. The proportionate part was fixed but the specific property of which it should consist was left wholly within the control of the trustees, and could only be determined when they made the division directed by the testator on the death of his widow. Such division is within their absolute discretion, subject only to the requirement that it shall be into equal fourths in value. They may set apart as this son’s share all personalty, or all realty, or a portion of each. Until such allotment he has no vested interest in any part of the land, but only a mere possibility or expectation, not the subject of lien.</p>
