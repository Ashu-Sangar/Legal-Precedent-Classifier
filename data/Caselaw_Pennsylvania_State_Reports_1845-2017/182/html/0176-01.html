The balance due on the duplicate for 1893 was settled and paid in full to the borough treasurer on July 27,1895.

Burnell, decided by the House of Lords and reported in 7 Cl. &amp; Fin. 572, is a leading case upon the legal question which is embodied in the special verdict. The ruling there was, in substance, that - the condition of a tax collector’s bond for a certain year was broken, and the surety became liable whenever any money received from the taxes of that year was applied in payment of the arrears of a former year. This decision is of the highest authority, for it was adopted only after grave and protracted deliberation, and it represented the opinion of many judges. To the same effect is Inhabitants of Colerain v. Bell, 9 Mete. 499, in which it is held that where the sáme person is collector of taxes for two consecutive years and pays to the town the arrears of taxes due by him on the tax list of the first year, with the moneys collected on tbe second year’s list — the town officials not knowing whence the money came — the sureties on the second bond, when sued for his default, are not entitled to set off or deduct the amount so paid by him upon the tax list of the previous year. So in Frownfelter v. State, <a href="/md/66/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="66 Md. 80" data-case-ids="1810026" data-case-paths="/md/66/0080-01">66 Md. 80</a>, there is a similar determination, the court saying: “ If the commissioners or the treasurer knew that the money applied to the taxes due for previous years had been collected on the levy of 1881 certainly they would have had no right to permit such application. But in the absence of any knowledge of the sources from which it was obtained, it is difficult to see how they could have prevented Myers from applying it to his indebtedness for any year which he might name. When the money was in his possession there <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>was nothing to identify it, or to distinguish it from other funds under his control or rightfully belonging to him. The obligation assumed by his sureties was that he should pay the money in discharge of the tax levied within the time required by law. If he paid it in discharge of previous taxes it was as much a breach of his bond as if he had retained it in his own pocket. We think the law on this point is correctly stated in Inhabitants v. Bell, 9 Mete. 499, and in G Wynne v. Burnell, 7 Cl. &amp; Fin. 572.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.4",198,[256,802,1168,504]]]'>The exact point is also ruled in State v.

The appeal from the judgment of the trial court is by the sureties. The principal acquiesces in the judgment, presumably because as collector he is indebted to the borough in the amount thereof. He was duly elected collector of taxes in and for said borough in February, 1893 and in February 1894, and he gave in each year the bond required by law. The bond of 1894 is the bond in suit, and four of the sureties on it were sureties on the bond of 1893. <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>The sureties on the bond in suit concede their liability for $958.88 of the duplicate of 1894, but deny that they are liable for $2,888.63 of it which their principal paid to the borough treasurer in settlement of the balance due on the duplicate of 1893. There is no direct evidence of notice to the treasurer that the sum thus paid to him was collected on the duplicate of 1894, nor anything on the record which shows that the sureties claimed on the trial that the jury might infer such notice from the circumstances in the case. There is no presumption that the payment in settlement of the duplicate of 1893 was a misappropriation of money collected on the duplicate of 1894.</p>
    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[176,921,1174,1484]],["BL_202.1",202,[236,356,1171,289]]]'>The misappropriation was not discovered until the settlement of the latter was called for. Besides, there is nothing in the statutes relating to the assessment and collection of taxes which makes it the duty of the treasurer to ascertain how or from what source the money paid to him by the collector was obtained. The duties of the latter are defined by his bond which requires that he “ shall well and truly collect and pay over or account for according to law the whole amount of taxes charged and assessed in the duplicates which shall be delivered to him.” "While he is elected for a term of three years he must “ give a bond annually to be approved by the court.” The bond of each year is applicable to and security for the taxes of that. year. It does not extend to or include the taxes of a preceding or subsequent year. If, therefore, a collector applies the money received on the duplicate of one year in satisfaction of a balance due from him on the duplicate of another year he has not paid over according to law, the money so applied. It follows that the application of the money collected on the duplicate of 1894 to the payment of the balance due on the duplicate of 1893 was a clear misappropriation of the money so collected. It was the act of the collector, and a breach of the .bond in suit. It cannot operate as a release of the sureties from liability for the money so appropriated. If the application had been made with the knowledge of the borough that it was a misappropriation of money collected on the duplicate of 1894 there would be substantial ground, we think, for acquitting the sureties of liability on the bond to the amount of the misappropriation. But it has not been shown that the treasurer or borough had such knowledge, and there are no circumstances in the case <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>which authorize an inference of it. No act or omission of the borough affecting the transaction complained of, or affording support to the sureties’ contention, was shown. The defense therefore rests exclusively on their principal’s breach of the bond, and this certainly is no impairment of their liability upon it.</p>
