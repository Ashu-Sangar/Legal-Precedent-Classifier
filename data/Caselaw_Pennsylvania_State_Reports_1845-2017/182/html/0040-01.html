The measure of damages is the value of the property at the time of taking, to the owners, not only by the mere value of the road itself, the mere structure or physical turnpike, its tollhouses and gates, but plaintiff’s entire property rights, with the value of its franchise in connection with those property rights, under and by virtue of which they are used and enjoyed. The jury will readily understand that the mere possession of a roadbed without the privilege of exacting toll would be of but little account.</p>

      <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>Various elements enter into the determination of this question. The value of the company’s franchises, its rights and privileges, depends largely upon its earning capachy. The value of its road, its tollhouses and gates, the amount of net tolls, the market value of its capital stock, are all elements to be considered in ascertaining the money value of the turnpike and its corporate franchises. To help you to ascertain this value, and, as bearing upon this question, testimony was submitted to you for the purpose of showing the length of the turnpike, its construction, the kind of material used, its state of repair, earning power year by year, and the market value of the stock. You have heard the witnesses describe its condition. It is hardly necessary for me to say that a turnpike with ruts and hollows, out of order and repair, is not as valuable as a road in good order and repair. Therefore, amongst other things, 3mu will ascertain what kind of a turnpike road was taken by the county. A road without any or little travel is not as valuable, in point of tolls, as one well traveled. The earning capacity is, therefore, material, for if no money return over and above expenses is yielded, the money value of the road, stock and franchises would naturally be affected.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b63-3" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[123,1422,1171,963]],["BL_64.1",64,[255,344,1167,92]]]'>In passing upon the value of the turnpike road, tollhouses, tollgates, the property of the plaintiff, you are not to be controlled by the cost of the original construction. It is not a question of original cost, but of value at the time of taking. For illustration, a farm costing $10,000 ten years ago may have decreased to half that figure at the present time. Land costing $5,000 then, may have risen in value to double that. In either event, if a farm or land were taken under the right of eminent domain, the value would be ascertained, not by its cost ten years ago, but by its market value at the time it was taken. A fairly and reasonably constructed turnpike twenty years ago may have fairly and reasonably cost $5,000 per mile. A fairly and reasonably constructed turnpike in 1894, as stated by one witness in the case — if his testimony is credible and trustworthy — might possibly be made for from $1,500 to $2,000 per mile. The cost of labor, cost of material, cost of construction may vary. But- you, as jurors, are required to consider this property just as it lay there, in the condition in which it was when it was taken, and its value then and there, with its accompanying fran<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>chises, under the conditions existing at and immediately prior to the time of its being taken.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b64-4" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[249,445,1173,1370]]]'>Good business and earning capacity, with a road in good condition, expenses moderate, 'dividends large, would be elements tending naturally to increase the value of the stock, road and franchises, whilst opposite conditions, a poor road,-poor income, meager travel, would naturally tend the other way, and depreciate the value of the stock, road and franchises. The values that will control you, whether of property, stock or franchises, must, therefore, be of the time of taking ; then and then only. What was the property value at and immediately prior to the time of taking ? As bearing upon that question, various witnesses were called as to the condition of the road, the value of the stock held, the franchises and property of the plaintiff, together with returns made by the plaintiff to the department at Harrisburg. All this testimony was presented to you to give you data and means of ascertaining what is the proper and just compensation to be paid plaintiff for the taking of this road. Where witnesses contradict each other, it is the duty of the jury to reconcile their testimony, if they can. If not, then it is their duty to make up their minds fairly and honestly which testimony they will believe, and act accordingly. This is a case in which the judgment of the jury must be given upon the evidence fairly and without prejudice. The law makes no intendment against the county of Chester or against the plaintiff. They stand here, both entitled to the protection of the law, and all that either of them can ask is that you fairly hear the testimony, fairly judge it and give such a verdict as the honest consciences of the jury can approve.</p>

The jury will readily understand <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>that the mere possession of a roadbed without the privileges of exacting toll would be of but little account. Yarious elements enter into the determination of this question. The value of the company’s franchises, its rights and privileges, depends largely upon its earning capacity. The value of its roads, its toll-houses and gates, the amount of net tolls, the market value of its capital stock, are all elements to be considered in ascertaining the money value of the turnpike and its corporate franchise. . . . But you as jurors are required to consider this property just as it lay there, in the condition in which it was when it was taken, and its value then and there, with its accompanying franchises, under the conditions existing at and immediately prior to the time of its being taken.” There was much more to the same effect in the general charge, and in the answers to points, and it is beyond all question that in all that, was said by the court on the measure of damages there was absolute correctness and no error whatever. Thus in Montgomery Co. v. Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/110/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="110 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="543724" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0054-01">110 Pa. 54</a>, we said: “ The bridge structure, the stone, iron and wood, was but a portion of the property owned by the bridge company and taken by the county. There were tbe franchises of the company, including the right to take toll, and these were as effectually taken as was the bridge itself. Hence to measure the damages by the mere cost of building the bridge would be to deprive the company of any compensation for the destruction of its franchises. The latter can no more be taken without compensation than can its tangible corporeal property. Their value necessarily depends upon their productiveness.” In Mifflin Bridge Co. v. Juniata County, <a href="/pa/144/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="144 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="823800" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0365-01">144 Pa. 365</a>, Paxson, C. J., said: “ It was held in Montgomery Co. v. Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/110/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="110 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="543724" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0054-01">110 Pa. 54</a>, that where a bridge is taken by a county for public use under the Act of May 8, 1876, P. L. 131, the measure of damages is the value of the property to the owners, not to the county taking it, and that such value is to be ascertained, not only by the cost of the structure, but also by the value of its franchises. The value of its franchises depends largely upon its earning capacity.”</p>

    <p id="b69-3" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[104,673,1174,302]]]'>The learned court below followed these cases in the charge and answers, and yet the principal complaint in a number of the assignments of error is that the franchise was ignored, and that only the materials that composed the road were considered, both in the testimony and charge. We do not so understand the rulings, either on offers of testimony, or in answers to points.</p>
    <p id="b69-4" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[98,983,1188,1432]]]'>As to the evidence received under the first assignment, it was offered and received manifestly for the purpose of showing the condition of the road at the time the turnpike was taken. Most assuredly this was entirely ■ competent. Undoubtedly it was proper for the defendant or the plaintiff to show precisely what was the condition, in a physical sense, of the property to be taken. If this turnpike was out of repair, having but a thin and irregular supply of hard material on its surface, if it had ruts and inequalities through the whole, or a portion of its length, would not the property be worth less as a whole, and in connection with the franchise, on that account ? It would be a strange proposition, and one which we cannot possibly sanction, that such evidence cannot be given, because the property must be valued as a whole, including the franchise, and that no other testimony can be received except such valuation in the aggregate. The value of such a property as a whole depends largely upon its physical condition for the purposes for which it is intended, and proof of the condition, therefore, is proof as to value. In no event can it be said that such testimony is irrelevant or incompetent. In Mifflin Bridge Company v. Juniata County, supra, the court below said to the jury, “I therefore charge you that in estimating the damages you are to take into consideration the value of the physical structure at the time of the taking; and this value must be arrived at by taking into consideration the length and width of the structure and ■ number of piers, the value of the masonry, the value of the fill and abutments, as well as the superstructure, and to that you add the value of the franchises.” We said upon this subject,</p>
    <blockquote id="b70-3" data-blocks='[["BL_70.3",70,[281,362,1174,505]]]'>
      <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>“ The witness, L. G. Brown, was asked as to the value of the bridge, by which I understand to be meant the superstructure only. This was objected to on the ground that Brown, having contracted for the erection of the bridge, should have been asked as to the contract price. We do not think this objection well taken. The true question was the value of the bridge, not what it cost. The contractor may have taken it at too low a figure or the owner may have paid too much. The county is entitled to pay for it at its actual value at the time of the taking.”</blockquote>

The court did not state to the jury that the evidence did not show what the property cost. The affirmance of the third point of the defendant was correct. There was no evidence of the actual cost of the property. Not one of the witnesses whose testimony is referred to in support of these assignments gave any testimony whatever as to the actual cost o£ the property. They were not examined upon that subject. They were called and testified as to the value of the shares of capital stock. They argued that because the dividends were five and one half per cent on the capital stock of $14,250 the shares were worth par, and that is the whole effect of their testimony. Not one of them testified that the property of the plaintiff had cost $14,250. While if there had been evidence of the actual cost of the property, that subject would have been one of the elements to be taken into consideration, with the other matters mentioned, in determining what was the value of the property, including the franchise, at the time of the taking; in the absence of such testimony there was no error in the answer to the point. What the court did say upon the subject of the cost was entirely correct, thus, “ In passing upon the value of the turnpike road, toll-houses, tollgates, the property of the plaintiff, you are not to be controlled by the cost of the original construction. It is not a question of original cost but of value at the time of taking.” •The court then proceeded to illustrate the matter fully and with absolute correctness, so there could be no question of misunderstanding on the part of the jury. Of course the jury was not to be controlled by the element of cost, but were to consider all <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>the elements affecting the question of value at the time of the taking.</p>
    <p id="b71-3" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[136,437,1179,1488]]]'>The introduction of proof of the returns made by the officers of the company to the state authorities, as to the value of the plaintiff’s capital stock, was certainly legitimate. Those returns were the acts of the plaintiff’s officers. They were made under oath and constituted important official documents. They were evidence, therefore, on the subject of the value of the stock at the time of the taldng, and hence were proper for the consideration of the jury. The very question was ruled in the case of Mifflin Bridge Co. v. Juniata County, supra. We there say, “ It was clearly competent therefore for the defendant to show the value placed by the company upon its own stock, a valuation made upon oath by its own officers. It is no answer to this to say that the return was made by the officers and not by the stockholders. The officers were the duly constituted agents or representatives of the latter, and their act was the act of the corporation itself. The return was made in pursuance of the act of assembly, and was the official act of the corporation. Hence we need not discuss the cases cited as to the power of an agent to bind his principal by his declarations. They are not relevant. While its return does not conclude the bridge company upon the question of value, it is nevertheless competent evidence for the consideration of the jury, and is moreover important.” We do not think there is any force in the contention that all or none of the returns should have been offered and received. Each return is independent of the others and speaks for itself. If it was an admission against interest it was admissible for that reason, and its competency would not be destroyed or affected because there were other returns for other years.</p>

The circumstance that unless the road was completed by March 16, 1899, the franchise was subject to forfeiture under the law, certainly was an element affecting value. If the franchise 'might by any possibility be subject to termination and forfeiture in so short a time, it would certainly be much less valuable than if it continued for a long period. And if in order <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>to avoid that penalty it was necessary to double tbe length of tbe road by additional construction to that extent, most certainly that obligation would be of very great consequence in determining tbe present value of tbe franchise, and consequently of tbe property. If tbe business of tbe road was profitable and prosperous it would probably enhance tbe value of tbe property, but if tbe contrary was true, it would simply increase tbe burdens of tbe company, and might seriously impair the marketable value of the property. The assignments are not sustained.</p>
