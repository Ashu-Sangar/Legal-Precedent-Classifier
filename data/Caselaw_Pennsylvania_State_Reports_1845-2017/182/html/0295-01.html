While he gave his wife the use, income and profits of his estate, she was given no power to use or consume any part of the corpus or principal. She had full power and authority to “ sell the lands and to change the investments and securities.” Under the will she was undoubtedly authorized to convert the whole estate into money at any time she chose, and to have it in this form, for distribution at the time of her death, there need have been no real estate to be sold after her death, if she had seen proper to sell it during her life. It will be observed that the. power to sell is not given to her nominatim merely, nor to her .... as his wife or widow, as life tenant, or as the beneficiary of the trust.</p>

The testator makes no devise of any portion of his real estate as such to any person named in his will, but blends his whole estate, “ the whole of the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed,” into one mass, one fund for distribution, and distributes it, or rather orders it to be distributed as money, thus rendering it necessary that his real estate should be sold for the purposes of distribution, for the purpose of carrying out the testator’s disposition of his estate.</p>

While in Waters v. Margerum, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%2044" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="60 Pa. 44">60 Pa. 44</a>, ShabsWOO», J., held that the deed by the administrator d. b. n. conveyed no title, because the power to sell given by the will to the executors was not for the payment of debts, but for distribution among legatees and for investment; in Evans v. Chew, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Pa.%2049" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="71 Pa. 49">71 Pa. 49</a>, Sbabs'WOOD, J., delivering the opinion of the court of nisi prius, modified this decision somewhat by expressly deciding that administrators c. t. a. had all the power given to executors virtute officii; that the general power to sell will be presumed to be for the payment of debts, and that a power to sell for the purpose of distributing the proceeds amongst persons named in the will is a power belonging to the executor “ virtute officii,” as well where the power is discretionary, as where the direction is absolute. In view of the former dicta of Chief Justice Gibson, and of what Justice Shabswood admits to have been a slip on his part, and inasmuch as the opinion of Justice Shabswood at nisi prius is adopted by the court, per curiam, in Evans v. Chew, it is interesting as well as highly important to this case to note the opinion of the court: “ A general power to sell will of course be conclusively presumed to be for the payment of debts; for a purchaser is never required to call for or look into an account, or to demand an inventory of personalty or list of debts. Such was the power in Meredith’s Estate, 1 Parsons 433. Mr. Binney’s opinion, Hood on Executors, 241 and note. About the authority of an administrator with the will annexed in such a case there could be no question. A power also to sell for the purpose of distributing the proceeds amongst persons named or described in the will is a power which, it <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>seems equally clear, belongs to the executor virtute officii. This would seem to he the case without question where there is an absolute direction to sell, and not a mere discretionary power, for in that casé the estate would be converted into money from the death of the testator; but the same rule, as it appears to me,applies where there is only a power. In the case of Keefer v. Schwartz, <a href="/pa/47/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="47 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="485539" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0503-01">47 Pa. 503</a>, there was indeed an absolute direction, but it is not rested upon that ground in the opinion. Mr. Justice Strong said : 1 The executors were not made testamentary trustees of the property. They were directed to sell for distribution. Their powers and duties were official by virtue of their office.’ Some difficulty appears to have arisen in the minds of counsel, from what was evidently merely a dictum of Gibson, C. J., in Ross v. Barclay, that ‘ no statute of Pennsylvania empowers an administrator with the will annexed to execute a trust of land confided to an executor by title or name for any other purpose than to sell for payment of debts ; ’ and his declaration in the same case that a power could not be exercised by such administrator ‘to turn the land into money for the convenience of partition.’ This last phrase is repeated in Waters v. Margerum. In both these cases the trust extended beyond the sale and distribution, virtute officii, to an investment; in short, a trust for a collateral purpose. The executors were, in both of these cases, testamentary trustees, and they were invested with power as such. These dicta were, therefore, entirely aside from the case. For myself I- may say that I copied the phrase from Ross v. Barclay, as is often done, in the hurry of composition, and it passed without notice in consultation. I may have, and probably had in my mind, not a sale for the purpose of distribution, but, what is not uncommon in the country, a power to executors to make partition, with an ancillary power of sale and conveyance for that purpose.”</p>

The executors were discharged, and letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. granted to Boyer. Sharswood, J., again delivering the opinion, the court held that “ it may now be considered as definitely settled that whenever a power is given by will to executors to sell real estate with a view to the distribution of the proceeds among legatees, such power belongs to them virtute officii, and may be exercised by an administrator de bonis non with the will annexed. ... It seems equally clear that it mates no difference whether the distribution is to be immediate or upon the expiration of a certain period-of time, or upon the uncertain contingency of a life or lives. In the case before us, the life estate was given to the widow, and absolute direction to the executrix to sell, if she should desire it, and the proceeds of the sale to be invested in good real estate security, the interest to be paid to the widow for her life, and a part of the principal, if she should desire, to be invested in a house for her use for life.”</p>

The court says: “ He makes a common fund of his estate, real, personal and mixed, and by whom is the distribution to be made ? By Ms executors, certainly, and that, virtute officii. This duty of distribution then devolved of necessity upon the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. If' so, he must be entitled to receive and invest the fund, and hold it so invested until that period of final distribution shall arrive.” Upon this reasoning it was held that the administrator, with the will annexed, had power to vest in the purchaser a title to the real estate. We might refer to other cases in further illustration, but this seems to fit the case under consideration in all material points with such great precision that we forbear.</p>

In Swift’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="87 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1057806" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0502-01">87 Pa. 502</a>, the fact, as found by the court, was, that enough realty had been sold to pay the devises; that for this purpose alone the power had been conferred, and when the purpose was accomplished the power was exhausted. There is, really, no conflict in these cases with those cited by the court. The direction that his wife should not be required to give security for the interests of the persons “entitled in remainder” and the words “bequeath the said residue and remainder of my estate ” are not significant of a limitation of the power, in view of the whole will, and especially of the codicil. True, technically, a remainder is an estate in land, limited to take effect and to be enjoyed after another estate is determined; and such estate vests immediately on the death of the donor, to be enjoyed in possession after the determination of the particular estate. But the testator, manifestly, here used these technical words in the sense of “ balance of,” “ what is left,” or “ what may remain.”</p>
