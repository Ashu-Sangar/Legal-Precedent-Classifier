It is sometimes cheaper for a man to pay a trifling fax than it is to run the risk of a lawsuit, or in order to have no more bother about it. It is also to be borne in mind that a taxpayer sometimes does not know that he has been assessed twice for the same land — he may not know it — he has no way of knowing it until the assessment has been made. If he is notified beforehand with what he has been assessed, then he could tell whether he was going to be assessed twice for the same land or not. After the assessor has made his return, he has had his notice, gone to'the commissioners, and finds his name only on the seated list in one place, and if he should find himself there taxed with all the land which he claims to own, he might not look on the unseated list to see whether part of the land included in that general acreage also included the land that was assessed on the unseated list.

If the jury believe that the same owner has paid taxes assessed for many years upon the Daniel Turner tract as unseated, and as a separate and distinct tract, containing thirty-six acres, and upon another separate' tract in the seated list as containing four hundred and eight acres without correction of any continued error in the assessment as to the number of acres, and if he has recognized and treated them as distinct and separate tracts, he cannot now claim that his payment of taxes for 1882 upon the four hundred and eight acres, as seated, covered also the taxes for the thirty-six acres unseated, which he neglected to pay, although for that year he paid taxes for more acres than <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>he possessed in the seated list. The number of acres is not material to the validity of the assessment, but if any error was made therein it was the owner’s duty to correct it. <em>Answer : </em>I affirm this proposition, gentlemen of the jury. You will observe that the proposition supposes that the owner recognized that the Turner tract and the other land which Martin Crippen purchased were assessed separately; that is, that the Turner tract was assessed as one tract, by itself, and that the other land was assessed by itself. Of course, if the owner understood that, recognized that, acquiesced in it, that was the end of the defendant’s right. That is the very bone of contention in this case, the plaintiff assumes one of the vital questions in this case. But if you should find that the owner knew that his land was separated into two distinct tracts, the Turner tract on the unseated list and the rest of his land on the seated list, then it is entirely immaterial whether that other land that he owned, not included in the Turner tract was more than the amount of acres which it actually contained 'or not.

If in 1882 the owners of the Turner tract paid the taxes assessed thereon for the years 1879,1880 and 1881, as a separate and distinct tract of thirty-six acres on the unseated list, which were assessed upon a valuation varying from $10.00 to $15.00 an acre, and at or about the same time he paid the taxes assessed upon a separate tract of four hundred and eight acres assessed in the seated list at a valuation varying from $2.40 to $8.00 per acre, he should have known that the tracts were separately assessed and that the taxes for 1882 had been assessed in the same manner, but failing to make any correction in the usual assessment, and failing to pay the taxes for 1882, as assessed upon the Turner tract, he cannot now claim that simply because he had in fact less than four hundred and eight acres on the seated list his payment of taxes for the year 1882 upon the four hundred and eight acres included also the taxes on the Turner tract. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm this point as it is written. The point assumes payment on separate and distinct tracts ; in other words, it assumes that the owner of the land, or the Crippen representatives, paid taxes upon the Turner tract assessed as unseated land separate and distinct by itself, and paid taxes upon the other land as an assessment separate and distinct from the Turner tract as seated land. Of course, if the owner did <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>that, it would be a recognition of a separate and distinct assessment, it would be a recognition of what is claimed here by the plaintiff, that the four hundred and eight acres did not include the Turner tract, because if they were assessed separately one did not include the other. If, however, the thirty-six acres were included in the land assessed as four hundred and eight acres as seated land, and the taxes on the seated land were paid, the additional payment of taxes levied upon the same land, also assessed as unseated land, would not stop the owner from showing that the taxes had already been paid. In other words, if the owner chose he might .pay taxes on both assessments, but he was not obliged under the law, if the land assessed as seated included the other, to pay taxes upon it as seated land and then pay taxes again on it as unseated land.

If the jury believe that Martin Crippen, who it appears purchased certain lands from Paul Aten in 1873, had them surveyed out and embraced in one tract, and returned them to the assessor on the seated list, as unimproved lands, and that the total acreage thereof, to wit: four hundred and nine acres, more or less, embraced the Daniel Turner tract, as well as all of the Joseph Hunter, except the two pieces formerly sold to Race and Coolbaugh, and that the said tract was assessed as one tract in the name of Martin Crippen, owner, in the seated list, as unimproved lands for the year 1882, and that the taxes for that year were paid on the same, the verdict must be for the defendants. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm this proposition as it is written, for the reason that there is no evidence that Martin Crippen had these lands surveyed. There is evidence, however, that the land he purchased included the Turner tract as well as part of the Hunter tract, that is, that the land that Martin Crippen purchased from Paul Aten included the Turner tract and all of the Hunter tract, except what Paul Aten had sold to Race and Coolbaugh.

    <p class="summary" id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[236,514,1177,1682]]]'>The facts on which this case turns are practically undisputed. In 1882 — the year for the unpaid taxes of which the sale on which the plaintiff relies took place — the estate of Martin Crippen, deceased, was assessed with four hundred and eight acres in Ransom township at the value of $3.00 per acre, making a total valuation of $1,224. On this assessment the taxes for that year were duly levied and paid, and in the face of such payment the owners of the land could not in my judgment be called upon to pay a second time for taxes upon any part of it. They paid upon all the land which they had and all the land which there was there, and more than that could not be made out of it. If there was any dispute as to the quantity of land this might be different, but there is none. On this both parties practically agree. It is true that Mr. Wolfe, the plaintiff’s surveyor, at one place in his testimony says there were four hundred and forty-eight acres, but further inquiry from him established that this was not the result of an actual survey made by him, but was a mere matter of calculation. He plotted the lines, and notwithstanding that the final course called for in the description of the Joseph Hunter tract is carried to the place of beginning he left this course unconnected and unclosed, thus adding to that tract a strip of several rods in width the whole length of it, and making the extra quantity which he gave. But there is no such excess in fact; it existed only in his suppositions and incorrect map, and later on in his testimony he concedes that correcting this there is but the four hundred and eight acres contended for by the defendants, except that by locating the southerly line of the Joseph Hunter a few rods further south there might be five or ten acres more in the tract. This is not thirty-six acres such as is called for by the assessment on which the plaintiff relies, and even as to this alleged five or ten extra acres the testimony of Mr. Wolfe is altogether too indefinite to raise any substantial issue as to the true acreage of the tract.</p>

It might be more successfully contended for in the present instance if the assessment were for a round sum for the whole tract, but that is not the case. It is assessed at so much per acre, and the total assessment is derived by multiplying the number of acres by the value per acre given to them. The acreage thus enters directly into and governs the quantum of the assessment and the taxes levied and paid upon it. The owners for the year in question paid taxes upon four hundred and eight acres of land, neither more nor less; not on a tract indefinitely described as having that number of acres.</p>

There cannot but be a double assessment if the same land is assessed twice, and it is assessed twice if the whole number of acres are assessed in any single assessment as they were here in the assessment to the Crippen estate of four hundred and eight acres, and then a part of it assessed again under the guise of another assessment.</p>

In 1882, and in at least seven of the eight years previous thereto and directly following Aten’s conveyance to Crippen, the land was separately assessed by the proper officer in the unseated list. In the first three years of the period thus defined the .assessed valuation of it was #108, or #3.00 per acre; in the fifth and sixth years, #360, or #10.00 per acre; and in the seventh, eighth and ninth years, #540, or #15.00 per acre. In 1876 the land was sold by the county treasurer for taxes levied on one or more of these assessments, and A. D. Dean, as attorney for Martin Crippen, and on his request, became the purchaser of it. On August 8, 1881, Dean conveyed the same to Crippen’s administrator who, on July 18, 1882, paid the taxes upon it for the years 1879, 1880 and 1881. While the land in question was separately assessed and valued as above stated, the land as<a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>sessecl to Martin Crippen was returned in the seated list as unimproved, and was valued in 1874, 1875 and 1876 at $5.00 per acre, in 1877 and 1878, at $2.40 per acre, and in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1882, at $3.00 per acre. It is a reasonable inference from the above recited facts that the Turner tract was separately assessed in the unseated list from 1874 to 1882, inclusive, and that the taxes levied on the separate assessments of it made prior to 1882 were paid by Martin Crippen or his estate. It may also be reasonably inferred from them that the separate assessments of it in the lifetime of Martin Crippen were made with his knowledge and consent, and that like assessments of it subsequent thereto were recognized and approved by his administrator.</p>

Everhart, the plaintiff in this suit. His claim of title to it is contested by the defendants on three grounds: (1) The assessments to Crippen from 1874 to 1882 included it and, as Crippen or his estate, prior to the sale under which the plaintiff claims, paid all the taxes levied on these assessments, the sale was unwarranted and void; (2) if there was a valid assessment and sale of the Turner tract the treasurer’s deed of it “ was so in-descriptive as to be inoperative,” and (3) the defendants were purchasers without notice or knowledge of any separate assessment of it.</p>

This was undoubtedly a circumstance to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining whether the Turner tract was included in the Crippen assessments, but it was not, in and by itself, conclusive that their claim of inclusion was well founded, nor fatal to the plaintiff’s contention. “If the quantity in the assessments was too great it does not follow that the disputed land was included nor, if not enough, that it was excluded. The quantity returned and assessed would be a fact to consider in ascertaining if the land in dispute was a part of the tract assessed: ” Kramer v. Goodlander, <a href="/pa/98/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="98 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="496919" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0370-01">98 Pa. 370</a>.

These were matters proper for the consideration of the jury in determining whether the Turner tract was included in the Crippen assessments. Whether it was so included was a question for them to decide on the relevant and competent evidence in the case. This was the view taken of it by the court below, and this appears to have been in accord with the view of it entertained on the trial by the learned counsel for the defendants.</p>

They have cited adjudications of the courts of other states which seem to give color to it, but these were undoubtedly made in accordance with the legislation regulating and governing tax sales within their respective jurisdictions. The numerous decisions of the courts of Pennsylvania relating to sales of unseated lands for taxes are certainly not in clear accord with the adjudications referred to, and while they may not cover the exact point in question their trend is obviously adverse to this branch of the defendants’ contention.

That land by whatever name it was sold, was the debtor for the taxes imposed, and if it was sold and conveyed to the plaintiff in satisfaction of the assessment, lie acquired a good title. The name of the warrantee and of the township are circumstances of designation but not conclusive. The identity of the tract assessed must be fixed to the satisfaction of the jury — if by the warrantee and the township, very well — if by other circumstances of designation, equally well: <a href="/watts-serg/1/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 166" data-case-ids="1852519" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0166-01">1 W. &amp; S. 166</a>; 4 Harris, 404. The evidence here tended to identify the tract conveyed with that assessed and sold; and having proved satisfactory to the jury, it must be so to us.” In our case the defendants frankly admitted in their printed argument that the defect in the deed was the result of the treasurer’s mistake in describing the land, and that it was within the power of the court to correct it, or to consider that as done <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>which ought to have been done, but in connection witli this admission they characterized the plaintiff’s claim as without merit, and maintained that the treasurer’s error was therefore fatal to it. <em>We </em>cannot assent to this view of the treasurer’s mistake, because, aside from the admission above stated, the evidence in the case clearly and undisputedly identified the land described in the deed as the land assessed and sold and now in question.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[232,776,1174,554]]]'>The specifications of error which relate to rulings upon offers of evidence are not sustained. The evidence admitted under these rulings was relevant to the questions already discussed, and proper for the consideration of the jury. As to the claim of the defendants that they were purchasers without notice of a separate assessment and sale of the land in question, it is sufficient to say that the treasurer’s sale of it to Dean, as hereinbefore stated, was recited in Willard’s deed to them, in his deed from the sheriff and in the sheriff’s deed to Smith, and that, at the time of the sheriff’s sale to Willard, public notice of Ever-hart’s title was duly given.</p>

    <p id="b534-7" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[281,1390,355,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
