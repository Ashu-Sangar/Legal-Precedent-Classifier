The decedent had real estate and some personal property other than the securities.

On this subject Miss Jennie Hunnnelbaugh, who had lived with decedent since early childhood, testified that about two weeks before his death he handed to Mrs. Wise his securities, which were in the little box wherein they were always kept, and said they were hers; and that Mrs. Wise then put them in her bureau drawer and locked it. The witness specified a mortgage and other property which were in the box as follows: “There was a mortgage for $700; Kern’s note; Otto note for $300; Siplinger, $300; Kressler, $300; Naugle, $150; and McKay note, $300.”</p>

I was standing to the left of him, and Mrs. Wise was standing to the other side, and he laid them on the stand, and the box in his lap, and he read the notes over and put them back in his box, and closed the box. The key was in the box, and he said to his wife, ‘ Take this; it is yours.’ ”</p>

Wise, deceased, and with all other personal assets belonging to her husband’s estate, and proceed with the settlement of said estate in strict accordance with law. No question in regard to the propriety of an order for the sale of real estate arises at the present time, and a discussion of that subject would therefore be premature.</p>

An alleged parol gift, therefore, from a husband to a wife, under such circumstances, should be proved by clear and convincing testimony. The claim in the present case however appears to have met this requirement. Two disinterested witnesses testified to the actual delivery of the box containing the securities and the subsequent continued possession by the wife. Three other witnesses testified to decedent’s repeated declarations, about the time of the gift, that all his property was to be his wife’s, and one at least, to his regret that he had not made a will giving it all to her. We do not regard this as conflicting with the fact of a gift of the securities, because the evidence shows that the decedent had real estate and perhaps some other personal property that was not included in the gift, but would have passed by a will. These declarations would not of course establish a gift, but they are confirmatory of the intent with which the actual delivery of the securities testified to by the other witnesses was made. The evidence as a whole was sufficient, if believed, to sustain the claim of a gift; the auditor and the judge below believed it; and we have not been convinced that they were in error in so doing.</p>
