    <p class="summary" id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[139,500,1170,559]]]'>[It seems that on the Wednesday before, if we may accept the undisputed testimony, some wagons in going out pulled this door off, and the evidence is that at the time this accident occurred there was no crossbar on it and the transom was out, and there is evidence to show that at the lower part where the door was fastened the woodwork was rotten. The question is whether the door was in such a condition as to be dangerous to the public, whether it had remained in that condition long enough to charge those who were responsible for keeping it in repair with notice, so that in the exercise of ordinary prudence that repair would have been made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.6",103,[139,1068,1172,710]]]'>It seems that on May 10, the day before this accident occurred, the defendants, Morris, Tasker &amp; Company, had consummated by the execution of a deed a sale of these premises to a man named Lodge. They were, at the place where the accident ocourred on these premises, in a sort of transition state. It appears that some twenty-five or twenty-seven men of the defendants were still there at work, and it also appears that Mr. Lodge had done some acts which have the look of taking possession on May 10. That is, some acts were done under his direction which were the exercise of control. His men directed the workmen of the defendants to stop their work. After that the order was recalled, and the letters would indicate that for the removal of the scrap iron and the machinery the defendants were to have until the following Monday.</p>

The question, however, is not one of the exact time of the transfer, nor one of the delivery of possession. The real question is as to whether or not there was a failure of duty on the part of the defendants, and whether that failure of duty was the cause of this accident. No doubt, as soon as Mr. Lodge took possession of this property, then a duty would begin with him. He ought within a reasonable time to see that the property which he had purchased, if it was in a dangerous condition to the public, was put in repair, but with that question we have nothing to do in this case. The real question in the <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>case is not as to when there was a transfer of the possession, nor when there was a transfer of the title, bnt was there any act of commission or of omission upon the part of the defendants which amounted to that want of reasonable care which the law makes negligence, and whether you find that to be the fact.</p>

The question would be not when I parted with the ownership in the knife, but whether or not the facts were such as to show that I, M doing what I did, exercised reasonable care.</p>

So, as' I say to you, the real question in the case is nob as to what the exact time when the transfer occurred was, but whether or not the circumstances of this case are such as to show that the defendants here were negligent in the failure to perform the duty, or any duty, M the repair of these premises, and that negligence was the cause of the accident.] [1]</p>

The very letting by him of to him known defective property, without stipulation <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>for repair, is significant of continuous negligence on his part: Godley v. Hagerty, <a href="/pa/20/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="20 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="972362" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0387-01">20 Pa. 387</a>, and the cases following it down to McKenna v. Paper Co., <a href="/pa/176/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="176 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="882214" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0306-01">176 Pa. 306</a>. But this is not a letting of the land by a landlord to a tenant; it is an absolute sale, whereby the owner divests himself of title and all right to possession, or of.re-entry for repairs, or for any other purpose; any future possession in face of his deed, unless there be an independent stipulation to the contrary, would be a palpable trespass; and with his surrender of possession, all the duties incident to ownership, as to him, were at an end; from the moment Lodge took possession under his deed, the duties theretofore incumbent on Morris, Tasker &amp; Company were transferred to him, and he became answerable to the public for neglect in their performance.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[140,1076,1175,1214]]]'>The learned judge of the court below adopts a di derent event for the commencement of liability on the part of the grantee than possession taken under the deed; he says “he ought, within a reasonable time, to see that the property which he had purchased, if it was in dangerous condition to the public, was put in repair.” That is, he imports into the deed an implied covenant on part of the grantors that they will be answerable to third parties for defects in the building for a reasonable time after the grantee takes possession. Public policy does not demand that such clogs on the transfer of real estate should be imposed by construction; nor does the law warrant such an implication. Before he purchased the real estate the law presumes the grantee examined the property, and was cognizant of its situation, surroundings, the character of the structures upon it and their condition of repair. Without an express covenant by the grantors, as between them and the grantee, there was no duty on the grantors to repair; the purchaser, thereafter, assumed that duty, because he then became the owner and occupant. If the grantors after possession by Lodge, the grantee, owed no duty to him, why should there be neglect in performance on their part as to the public ? It is not even the case of no actual occupancy, where the law casts the duty on the owner, but one where the owner and actual occupant were the same. .</p>
    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[143,2306,1167,95]],["BL_110.1",110,[231,355,1177,1158]]]'>If, the accident did not happen during the ownership and occupancy of Morris, Tasker &amp; Company, and the evidence showed <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>that it happened after Lodge took possession, the question for the jury was not whether there was negligence on part of defendants in maintaining a defective gate; the real question on the evidence was, did Lodge take possession of the property described in his deed on Friday the 10th of May ? If he did, ■then the accident which occurred on the 11th must be imputed to the negligence of the owner and occupant of the premises, and not to Morris, Tasker &amp; Company who before that time were owners and occupants. And this is the principle announced in Grier v. Sampson, <a href="/pa/27/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="27 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="979418" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0183-01">27 Pa. 183</a>, Cheetham v. Hampson, 4 T. R. 318, and Blunt v. Aikin, 15 Wendell, 522, although the facts in all these cases are different from those before us. And while laying down this rule in this case, we do not intend to be understood as declaring there can be no exception to it. There may be a case where the- grantor conceals from the grantee a defect in a structure known to him alone, and not discoverable by careful inspection, that the owner would be held liable, though out of possession ; but that is not this case; the rotten gate, the testimony shows, was as obvious before the accident as afterwards, and the reasonable time for the purchaser to discover it was not limited to the twenty hours after he took possession, but to the weeks and months pending the negotiations, before the delivery of the deed.</p>
