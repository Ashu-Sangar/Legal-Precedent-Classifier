He left an estate, consisting largely of land, part being a valuable improved farm of one hundred and thirty-five acres. Of this, he devised a particularly described field of twenty acres to an adopted daughter, Olive D. Pittman; another field, of thirty acres, particularly described, to his nephew, Thomas Johnston, this last, subject to the payment of $500 to a niece, Pleasant E. Mann; to his wife, Elizabeth, he devised and bequeathed the balance of the land and estate, subject to the payment of $150 to his adopted daughter, Olive D. Pittman, she, Olive, however, to pay the collateral inheritance tax on the field before devised to her. By a codicil, instead of an absolute estate in the balance, he gave to his wife the use thereof during life, with authority to sell, convey and dispose of the same, and use the proceeds if she thought necessary; if anything remained at her death, then it was to go to certain nephews and nieces in particular allotments.</p>

However, after his death, 'the event of the suit on the bond fixed his indebtedness in this particular at $2,004.49, which with counsel fees, funeral expenses, and a few other items, made the entire debts for which the estate was answerable, $S,064.49. In addition to the land, there was some personal property, which was taken by the widow, the value of which is in dispute, but it was stated by the counsel in argument before us, as worth about $600, and for the purpose of ending strife, we adopt that valuation in making up our decree. Under these circumstances, application was made -by the widow and executrix to the orphans’ court for an order of sale to pa3&gt;- debts, with a request that the court direct in what order the land should be sold; she, contending, that as widow, the land devised to her should be last resorted to. The two other devisees contended that theirs were specific devises, and the widow’s a rpsiduary one, therefore, under the law, the latter must be first subject to payment of the debts. The court below, was of opinion that the devise to the widow was residuary, having no semblance of a specific devise, and, therefore, must be first appropriated inpa3unent of the unanticipated indebtedness.</p>

It would be easy to answer when he manifests an intention to do so by express language. But it often happens that there is no express charge, and language which the testator directed to other objects has to be so construed as'to get at his presumed intention upon this particular point.”</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[133,1274,1171,1067]]]'>What was the intent of this testator ? If it was that his wife was to have only what remained after the two legacies to his nephew and adopted daughter and his debts were paid, then the property devised to the wife must be first sold. It will be noticed that neither in the will nor in the codicil does he speak of debts, and, as it is admitted that the obligation of suretyship, with the expenses incident to a defense against it, with a trifling exception, constitute his whole indebtedness, it is not probable that the testator considered the matter as of sufficient gravity to warrant a direction concerning debts. The principal part of his estate consisted of his 185 acre farm, and he disposes of this first, by giving a particular field of twenty acres to his adopted daughter, then a particular field of thirty acres to his nephew, imposing upon that a specific charge of $500. This left eighty-five acres of the farm and his personalty; he then says : “ I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Elizabeth, her heirs and assigns forever, the balance of all my property, real, personal and mixed, of what nature or kind soever, and wheresoever the same shall be at my death, subject, however, to the payment of one hundred and fifty dollars to my adopted daughter, Olive D.

Was not the devise to his wife just as specific as the fields to his adopted daughter and nephew? He could, just as precisely and specifically, have expressed the same intention by saying, “I devise and bequeath to my wife all my estate, real and personal, except the twenty acre field which I devise to my daughter, and the thirty acre field which I devise to my nephew, subject to a charge of $500.” Then all three, it is not questioned, would have been specific; the wife’s would have been determined by an inspection of his titles and a schedule of his personalty; the daughter’s and nephew’s by pointing out to them the designated fields. It was, perhaps, more convenient to note the exceptions to the wife’s devise first; but in doing so hers was not made less specific ; the word “ balance ” left to her the eighty-five acres of the farm and every article of personal property, as specifically as if enumerated and ■ described at length. He does not leave to her a balance, in the sense that she Avas to have what remained after payment of debts and legacies ; she was to have the balance distinct and specific, after cutting off the trvo fields. The devise was not a residue of an estate, implying an unknown value or quantity of property by one in conscious ignorance of possible claims or charges; it was a specific devise of the land and bequest of the personalty, capable of absolute certainty the day after his death, by one having full knowledge of his estate, and believing it subject to no charges except those directed in his will. In view of the testator’s surroundings, the character and value of his estate, the objects of his bounty, and the language used to express his intention, there is no room for the presumption that by the use of the word “ balance ” he meant to give his wife the residue of his estate after deducting the devises specified, debts not known, and other charges. He meant just what he expressed, a specific <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>devise to her of all his estate, after taking out the two devises of the two fields, and the $150 directed to be paid his adopted daughter.</p>
