It had its origin in the amendment of 1857, which was prompted by the growing evils of reckless and extravagant municipal subscriptions to railroads, plank roads, etc. Those evils were so aggravated that it became necessary to interfere and prevent by a constitutional prohibition all future pledges of municipal faith and property for such purposes under the sanction of the legislature, which alone possessed the power to grant the proper authority: Railroad v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20Pa.%20193" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="47 Pa. 193">47 Pa. </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=47%20Pa.%20193" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="47 Pa. 193">193</a>; </em>Speer v.

    <p id="b396-7" data-blocks='[["BL_396.6",396,[235,1188,1167,391]]]'>In Speer v. School Directors, supra, it was held “ that money paid to save a community from a (military) draft is not obtained for a party or individual, but is a direct appropriation to a public purpose, and that raising money by the ordinary powers of borrowing and taxation for a common purpose, affecting the interest, happiness and welfare of a community, is not obtaining money or loaning credit to any party within the terms of the amendment.”</p>

The evident purpose of the prohibition was to confine municipalities to the objects for which they were created and to restrain the legislature from authorizing any perversion of them. By the act of March 17,1789, which appears to be still in force, the city councils of Philadelphia “ have full power and authority to make, ordain and establish such and so many laws, ordinances and regulations as shall be necessary for the welfare and comfort of the city.” We have no right to assume, nor is there anything from which it may be fairly inferred that the constitutional prohibition in question was intended to revoke or curtail any of the powers or authorities with which the city councils were theretofore invested by the comprehensive grant above quoted. It is not even suggested that a reasonable appropriation by councils for the creation or maintenance of a police pension fund is not an ap<a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>propriation to a strictly municipal use, and “necessary for the welfare and comfort of the city.” A judiciously administered pension fund is doubtless a potent agency in securing and retaining the services of the most faithful and efficient class of men connected with that arm of the municipal service in which every property owner and resident of the city is most vitally interested. Reasons in support of this proposition need not be stated in detail. They are such as readily suggest themselves to every reflecting mind.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[147,838,1176,764]]]'>But, aside from the general charter authority of councils to make such appropriations, and aside from any question of expediency or propriety in their doing so, this case might well be disposed of on the ground that the constitutional prohibition relied on by the defendant is inapplicable to councils. In Indiana Co. v. Agricultural Society, <a href="/pa/85/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="85 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="440469" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0357-01">85 Pa. 357</a>, this court held that the section in question “ deals only with legislative power. .... That power is thereby limited and restricted. It declares what the legislature ‘shall not’ do. It annuls nothing that it had done. It forbids such legislation thereafter. It struck down no law. Its prohibitions were wholly prospective.” It is not pretended that the ordinance in question was enacted in pursuance of any legislation passed since the adoption of the constitutional prohibition. It therefore follows that the latter has no application here.</p>
    <p id="b397-6" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[145,1611,1175,559]]]'>There is no merit in the objection that councils delegated the distribution of the sum appropriated to the “ Philadelphia Police Pension Fund Association,” instead of distributing it themselves. If they were satisfied, as they doubtless were, that the distribution of the fund would be better effected through the agency of the association than by an agency of their own creation, they had a right to so provide. As we have seen, the association was incorporated for the express purpose of administering such funds on just and equitable principles. If it should attempt to divert any of the funds to improper purposes ample redress could be had by application to the proper court.</p>
