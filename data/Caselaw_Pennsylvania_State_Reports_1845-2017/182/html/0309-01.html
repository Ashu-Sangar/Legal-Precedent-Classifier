There was no evidence before us to show that the license assigned by the Backus Manufacturing Company was not of any value, or that the increase of the capital stock and bonded indebtedness of the Gas Company was not made in compliance with the act of assembly. Admitting, for the sake of the discussion, that P. B. Shaw, one of the defendants, who controlled the Edison Companjr by reason of holding a majority of its stock, and virtually the Gas Company for the same reason, and made the purchase of the Citizens’ Company, devised a scheme for the purpose of controlling the three companies, which is the most that can be inferred from the testimony adduced, the transaction, in our opinion, did not prejudice the rights of the stockholders of the Gas Company. On the contrary, the proof rather shows it to have been of benefit to the company. We cannot conceive how, therefore, under the circumstances of this case, it has prejudiced the rights of the complainant. All the stockholders of the Gas Company, it appears, with the exception of the plaintiff, and, perhaps, one other, willingly entered into the transaction and gave it their support. The acts of its directors were not considered improper within the belief of all these stockholders, many of whom as will be seen are among our best and most in<a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>telligent business men, who, doubtless, would have been the first to complain if these acts had been done to their prejudice as stockholders. Thus, we have the request of but one stockholder, invoking the aid of a court of chancery to declare the acts of his company in the premises illegal and void, unsupported by any proof of fraud or collusion, or evidence of fraud or corrupt motives by other parties than the company defendant, as charged and averred in plaintiff’s bill. Had it been shown at the hearing of this case that P. B. Shaw or a majority of the Gas Company or any of its directors had entered into an alleged scheme to benefit themselves at the expense of the Gas Company or of the minority of the stockholders, the case would have been different. The plaintiff has not brought himself, however, within this chancery rule, by reason of the lack of proof, and, therefore, we must hold that the plaintiff has no standing on this point of the case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-3" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[135,1180,1177,711]]]'>The second question, however, needs careful consideration. It involves the interpretation of the statute governing the franchise of the company; and in this we recognize the principle that a single stockholder may, when measures are adopted, which are plainly beyond the powers of the company and inconsistent with the objects for which the company was incorporated, invoke the aid of a chancellor to interpose in behalf of the minority stockholders to prevent the performance of such act. The usual remedy, however, is by quo warranto by the commonwealth through the attorney general, but in our opinion it is not the only remedy. We will, therefore, consider this question: That is, were the acts of the Gas Company in the purchase of the Backus heater, and consequently, its increase of the capital stock and bonded indebtedness, ultra vires ?</p>

The application for the charter of the gas company says that the corporation was formed for the purpose of manufacturing and supplying illuminating and heating gas to the public in the city of Lancaster.

The furnishing of light contemplates more than the supply of illuminating gas; so, also, the furnishing of heat more than the furnishing of heating gas.

In order to distribute heating gas there are required not only pipes for the conveying of gas, but, also, in our opinion, all other necessary appliances and fixtures for its reception and use by the patrons of the company. Gas stoves and gas heaters, therefore, are indispensable to the use of heating gas, and, therefore, are not foreign to or inconsistent with the objects for which the company was incorporated.

But, if we were to say that they can do nothing for which a warrant could not be found in the language of their charters, we should deny them in some cases the power of self-preservation, as well as many of the means necessary to effect the essential objects of their incorporation. And, therefore, it has been an established principle in the law of corporations that they may exercise all the powers within the fair intent and purpose of their creation, which are reasonably proper to effect the powers expressly granted. Nor should anything that is fairly incidental to those things which the legislature has authorized be held ultra vires, <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>unless expressly prohibited. Thus, it has been decided, that e. g. the grant to a municipality of power to ‘prevent and extinguish fires,’ granted, by implication, the power to erect a fire-engine house; of power to ‘ make police regulations or needful by-laws,’ a power to purchase fire-engines; of power to contract ‘ for lighting ’ streets, a power to acquire street fixtures, including gas pipes and lamp-posts for that purpose; and a grant of power to a railroad company to purchase land in order to procure stone and other material necessary for the construction of its road, a grant of power to purchase land in order to get cross-ties and firewood. Indeed, it may be generally said, that, whenever a power is given by statute, everything necessary to make it effectual, everything essential to the exercise of it is given by implication: ” Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 418.</p>

There was no contention at the argument of this case that the Gas Company did not follow the act of assembly in its proceedings to increase its capital stock and bonded indebtedness. The plaintiff simply denies that the increase was for value received, or in furtherance of the real interests of the company. In this respect we do not agree with him. The increase, in our opinion, was not only regularly and lawfully made, but it was made for a valuable consideration, and the effect has been without any prejudice to any of the rights of the plaintiff or to any interest of the Gas Company. It cannot be questioned that the Gas Company had a legal right to increase the capital stock and bonded indebtedness of the company either for money or for labor done or for property actually received: 2 Thompson’s Commentaries on the Law of Corporations, sec. 1604, et sequitur; act of April 29, 1874, relating to corporations; Purd.

It is a stockholder’s bill to enjoin the issue of new stock and the increase of the corporation’s bonded indebtedness, upon two grounds, first, that the increase is not in good faith for the purposes and in the interest of the corporation, but in pursuit of a scheme to acquire control of the corporation and run it in the interest of a rival; and secondly, that <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>the new debt is to be created for the purchase of certain patent appliances, not for the manufacture or distribution of gas, but for its consumption, the dealing in which appliances is not within the company’s charter purposes.</p>
    <p id="b341-3" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[134,570,1170,1222]]]'>It is beyond dispute that the increase of the stock and the bonded debt was duly authorized by the stockholders under all the formal requirements of the law, but plaintiff charges, on the first branch of the case, that the increase was procured fraudulently by the defendants, other than the Gas Company, who being stockholders, owners and directors in the Edison Company, a rival electric light and heat company, acting through their agent, Shaw, bought up a majority of the shares in the Citizens’ and also in the Lancaster Company, and having thus obtained control of the latter, issued the new stock and bonds nominally to buy the Backus patent heating apparatus, but in reality to raise money to pay’' for the stock of the Citizens’ Company, previously secured on options, and intended to be merged in the Edison for the profit of the latter. Of course, the burden of proof of such charge was upon the plaintiff, and it is sufficient to say that we agree with the learned court below that there was no evidence which in any degree sustained it. The agency of Shaw for the other defendants was affirmatively disproved both by him and them, and it was shown that ten of the fourteen defendants were not stockholders, owners or directors of the rival company, the Edison, at the time Shaw acquired the control of the stock of the Lancaster Company, charged to be in the interest of the Edison.

It is argued for plaintiff that the charter purpose of the Gas Company is limited by the words “ manufacturing and supplying illuminating and heating gas,” and that nothing can be included which is not a necessary part or appliance for manufacturing or supplying. This is too narrow and literal a construction, and overlooks the fundamental object of the corporation, the manufacture and supply of gas to customers for profit. It would be of no use-to manufacture gas if there <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>were not customers to buy, and hence the company may fairly supply not only the gas itself, but incidentally such appliances and conveniences as will induce new customers to use gas or old ones to use more. This is a legitimate mode of extending the company’s business, in direct furtherance of its charter object. In considering such questions, much weight must be allowed to the judgment of the parties most interested, the officers and stockholders of the corporation itself, and while they will not be permitted, as against the commonwealth or a dissenting stockholder, to go outside of their legitimate corporate business, yet where the act questioned is of a nature to be fairly considered incidental or auxiliary to such business, it will not be unlawful, because not within the literal terms of the corporate grant.</p>

The illustration given by Mr. Brice is that railway companies may erect refreshment rooms or book stalls, and “ adopt other similar measures for both providing for the comfort of their customers and adding to their own receipts.” The American illustrations in the same line, which have revolutionized modern travel will occur to everyone. In Brown v. Winnisimmet Co., <a href="/mass/93/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="11 Allen 326" data-case-ids="313782" data-case-paths="/mass/93/0326-01">11 Allen, 326</a>, it was held that the contract of a ferry company to charter one of its boats for temporary use in another business was valid. Many illustrations are suggested in the opinion of Bigelow, C. J., who said, “We know of no rule or principle by which an act creating a corporation for certain specific objects, or to carry on a particular trade or business, is to be strictly construed as prohibitory of all other dealings or transactions not coming within the exact scope of those designated. Undoubtedly the main business of a corporation is to be confined to that class of operations which properly appertain to the general purposes for which its charter was granted. But it may also enter into' contracts and engage in transactions which are incidental or auxiliary to its main business, or which may become necessary, expedient or profitable in the care and manage<a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>ment of the property which it is authorized to hold.” See also Lyndeborough Glass Co. v.

It was held that their acts were not ultra vires, Gordon, J., saying (page 392) “We know of no other material upon these lands more abundant or more obviously requiring development than the timber. Neither can we conceive of anything better calculated to develop this kind of materials than sawmills. So we regard a hotel of some kind in so large a territory of wild lands, as not only a convenience adding greatly to the settlement of the country, but a necessity.”</p>
