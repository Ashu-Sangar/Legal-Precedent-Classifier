    <p class="summary" id="b363-5" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[143,904,1174,659]]]'>At the argument it was contended that the use of the word “absolutely,” as qualifying the ownership of the widow in the personal property bequeathed to her, indicated an intention on the part of her husband that she should take said property free from liability for debts. B ut the better opinion would seem to be that said term “ absolutely ” was used, not in the sense imputed to it by counsel for the widow, but in contradistinction to the phrase employed in item fourth, “ for the term of her natural life,” as limiting the devise of real estate. “ Absolutely ” was intended to define the duration and extent of the widow’s estate ; was employed to guard against the idea of a life estate only; had no reference to the question of debts, because that question had not occurred to the testator.</p>

If the testator had intended to give a preference to his widow in this matter of Avhat property should be primarily liable for debts, he could have so indicated by the use of a few simple words. Why should he adopt the roundabout method of so indicating such purpose by saying that there Avas no need of an appraisement? Was not the idea of the testator in dispensing with an inventory rather that, as he had made ample provision, as he thought, for his debts in item eighth, and as his wife was to haAe almost all the personal property, the holding of an appraisement would be but an idle cere<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>mony, annoying, possibly, to her, and subserving no useful purpose ? The possible contingency of the insufficiency of the assets mentioned in item eighth to satisfy his indebtedness, had not entered the testator’s mind.
