    <p class="summary" id="b366-13" data-blocks='[["BL_366.15",366,[243,1707,1169,711]]]'>Whether this case be considered as one of infringement of a trade-mark or as a simulation intended and likely to deceive the public, the evidence is most conclusively with the plaintiff. It is established that the article of commerce known as “ Hires’ Root Beer,” by a long and costly method of advertisement, has attained a trade character and value peculiar to itself. The sales have reached an extraordinary yearly volume, and the article is known to consumers and merchants by the designation of “ Hires’ Root Beer,” and often, and perhaps as commonly, by the name of “ Hires ” alone. The shape and color of the cartoons, as well as the general typography and substance of the printed matter thereon and the shape of the bottles, have also been peculiar to the article made by the plaintiff, and have served to give it commercial distinction and identity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.3",367,[131,353,1175,608]]]'>
      <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>The respondent, Hires, a kinsman of the plaintiff, availing himself of the sameness of family name, is about to manufacture and place on the market for sale a root beer which in all the externals of physical preparation and presentation is so nearly an approach to the plaintiff’s commodity that, but for the use of the Christian or surname of the respondent, Hires,, it might be termed a complete reproduction of the plaintiff’s preparation and device. The cartoon, its color, the substance of the printed matter, the bottle, the indicating designation or title. — all—while slightly varying from the plaintiff’s device, make up a trade commodity which, except to the sophisticated or closely inquisitive, would be taken to be a like article to the plaintiff’s.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[134,971,1174,460]]]'>It is not necessary now to pass upon the question of how far a family name may be the subject of a trade-mark so as to exclude from its use others who lawfully bear it. The use of the family name in the present case only increases — most potently increases — the conjoined force and effect of respondents’ other devices in working a deceptive simulation. All cases of this character must depend upon their own facts and circumstances. Actual fraudulent intent can never be inferred from anything outside of the case 'itself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b367-6" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[135,1438,1175,805]]]'>The testimony of the case now before us, we think, makes it indubitably clear that the respondents’ purpose — their sole and only purpose — was to fabricate an article of trade which, in shape, color, designation or name and general appearance, should resemble the plaintiff’s article and thereby deceive and mislead the public and purchasers generally. It is impossible to come to any other conclusion but that this was the main intent of the respondents. But for the fortuitous identity of family name, it is clear that the respondents would not have embarked in this proposed commercial venture, and the evidence shows that their studied purpose was to keep as close to the appearance and name of the plaintiff’s article as possible and preserve similarity while yet presenting minor differences. We find, therefore, upon the evidence now presented, that the allegations of the plaintiff’s bill are established, and that the temporary injunction prayed for should be awarded.</p>
