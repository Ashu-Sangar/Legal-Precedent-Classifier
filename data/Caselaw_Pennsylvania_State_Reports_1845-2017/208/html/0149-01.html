Plaintiffs paid the auctioneer a small proportion of the purchase money in cash and tendered him in payment of the balance a receipt upon account of ar-rearages of interest on certain mortgages. This receipt was declined. It appeared that the mortgages owned by the plaintiffs were made by certain of the members of the limited company, and when the company was organized it assumed these mortgages. It did not appear that the liquidating trustees ever assumed payment of the interest upon the mortgages or were liable for it in any way. There was evidence that the liquidating trustees subsequently sold the real estate of the company and the purchaser took it subject to payment of the mortgages. Held, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to maintain their action of replevin and that a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

It is contended that the title and right of possession of the goods became vested in the plaintiffs when they paid $500 on account of the purchase money, and received a receipt from the auctioneer. The offer does not set forth the terms and conditions of the sale nor the terms of the receipt. But in the absence of a special provision or understanding to the contrary, a cash sale is generally presumed to have been contemplated: 24 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 1095. “An absolute payment in cash . . . . is always implied when nothing is said: ” Benjamin on Sales, sec. 706. In Welsh v. Bell, <a href="/pa/32/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="32 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="986687" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0012-01">32 Pa. 12</a>, Mr. Justice Strong said (p. 17) : “ No agreement having been made for a credit, it was of course a contract for a cash sale and without actual delivery the property would not pass to the vendee until payment of the consideration.” In Mitchell v. Zimmerman, <a href="/pa/109/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="109 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="542316" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0183-01">109 Pa. 183</a>, it was held that the above rule that the title to goods sold does not pass to the purchaser until the price is paid, unless payment is waived, applies to auction sales.</p>

It is not claimed that payment in full in cash was ever made; but appellants contended that the tender of a receipt for overdue interest on the mortgages was equivalent to payment. But the interest which the plaintiffs sought to use as a s et-off was not owing by the defendants. It was incurred by certain individuals who were not parties to this suit. The assumption by the Barrows-Savery Company, Limited, of the mortgages, does not make the defendants who are liquidating trustees, liable for the interest. There is no allegation that the trustees ever assumed payment for the interest upon the mortgages or were liable for it in any way. The indebtedness of the plaintiffs to the defendants arises by reason of the purchase of the goods sold by the liquidating trustees, and we do not see that any claim which the plaintiffs may have to overdue interest on the mortgages can properly be used by way of set-off as against the purchase price of the goods sold by the trustees. In making this sale the trustees were acting in a representative capacity. The act of assembly under which they were so acting <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>requires that the proceeds of the sale of the property, after defraying costs and charges, must be applied first to the payment of wages of labor, and then to the satisfaction of all other indebtedness; and the balance remaining is to be distributed among the members of the company, and not to the company itself.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[276,672,1178,447]]]'>In no event were the plaintiffs entitled to a preference in the payment of their claim for interest, even though the liability in that respect was assumed by the partnership association ; on the contrary, the claims for wages, if any, were entitled to be first paid out of the fund. So that obviously the proper course for the plaintiffs would have been to pay in the full amount of the purchase money, and then make their claim with the other creditors of the partnership association against the fund.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[275,1139,1179,392]]]'>It does not appear from the offer that the plaintiffs had any interest' in the real estate except as mortgagees, and that alone would not give them the right of possession. The real estate appears to have been sold by the trustees in a separate transaction, but how or where or to whom is not shown; but it does appear that the new purchaser took it subject to the payment of these mortgages, and as a natural inference, the accrued interest would also be assumed.</p>
    <p id="b184-7" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[274,1551,1178,355]]]'>The offer of proof which was excluded shows no right of possession on the part of the plaintiffs to the goods replevied, unless it be through and by means of the purchase at the trustee’s sale of the personal property. As the full purchase money was not paid, nor was there any delivery of the goods to the plaintiff, we cannot regard the offer as sufficient to establish any right to recover, and it was therefore properly excluded.</p>
