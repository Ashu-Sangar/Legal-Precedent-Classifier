Piper on June 11, 1869, executed to the Fire Association of Philadelphia his bond and mortgage for <em>$ </em>7,000 for one year. The property covered by the mortgage was sold by William A. Piper in 1893, to Alexander H. McAdam, and by the executors of his will was conveyed to Theodore H. Conderman, the • vice president of the Fire Association of Philadelphia, appellant herein, in 1900. Conderman having made default suit was brought to foreclose the mortgage in August, 1900, and no notice having been given to appellees, either of the default or of the suit, judgment was taken against Wm. A. Piper on two returns of nihil habet. No claim was made by appellant against appellees until after November 1, 1900. William A. Piper died. July 6, 1896, having first made a will of which the appellees were appointed executors. The account of the executors was filed on August 25, <em>1897; </em>was audited by the orphans’ court on October 8, 1897, Judge Ashman filing his adjudication thereon on October 22, 1897. To this adjudication exceptions were filed to the allowance of the claim for direct inheritance tax on the legacies. These exceptions were sustained, and order and decree entered “ that the legacies mentioned in ad judication be awarded without deduction for direct inheritance tax.” On March 30, 1901, the Fire Association filed a petition for a citation to file an account for the purpose of having legacies, paid to the legatees, applied to the payment of the deficiency resulting from a sale of the mortgaged premises for less than the amount of the mortgage. ...</p>

If it should be conceded, for the sake of argument, that the court erred in not making the distribution conditioned upon the giving of refunding bonds, the error was one that could only be corrected by appeal, or by review at the instance of one who was not chargeable with laches. Even where a legatee has received a voluntary payment from the executor — as decided in Montgomery’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/92/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="92 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="490821" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0202-01">92 Pa. 202</a>; Miller v.

After this lapse of time, there would, ordinarily, be a presumption of payment; but if such presumption has been rebutted by the conveyance of the mortgaged property, in June, 1893, “ under and subject to ” the mortgage, it was clearly the duty of the creditor, if not satisfied with the security of the mortgage, and claim upon the personal estate of the mortgagor, under the bond, was contemplated, to give prompt notice to the executors, and, still more, to present such claim when their account was before the court. If this had been done, the legatees, if their defense of lapse of time, estoppel, etc., had failed, would either have been subrogated to the right of the creditor upon the mortgage, or proceedings would have been suspended until the amount required from personal estate to make good the deficiency of the real estate had been ascertained by suit on the mortgage and sale of the land: Saffin’s Estate, 12 Pa. Dist. Rep. 99; and in the latter case they would have had the opportunity of attending the sale and preventing a sacrifice — an opportunity which they have been deprived of by <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>reason of the judgments having been obtained upon two returns of nihil, though, it would seem, the mortgagee knew that the mortgagor was dead, but gave no notice to the executors.

    <p class="summary" id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.4",668,[258,601,1177,508]]]'>The position of the latter is not made any better by the fact that payment of interest on the mortgage continued to be made regularly by the terre-tenant until nearly three years after the account of the. executors had been adjudicated. The principal of the debt had become due many years before; and the failure to give notice that the personal estate of the mortgagor was looked to for payment or to present the claim to the auditing judge, indicated, as strongly as actions could indicate, that the idea of such claim was not entertained, and that the creditor was satisfied with the security of the mortgage.</p>

Hence, it was held in Quain’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/22/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="22 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="413727" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0510-01">22 Pa. 510</a>, followed by Williams’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/47/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="47 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="485579" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0283-01">47 Pa. 283</a>, that the covenant of one who had purchased land upon ground rent could only be enforced for rent falling due after his death, as against the land. It is not easy to see the distinction between the personal liability of a mortgagor, on the bond accompanying the mortgage, after he has sold the land subject to the mortgage, and after his death, and that of a purchaser on ground rent on his covenant to pay. Theoretically, the bond is the principal debt and the mortgage the collateral, but in general the reverse is the real relation; and after the <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>lapse of many years, during all of -which the creditor has received his interest from the successive purchasers of the mortgaged property, with no suggestion of claim for the principal, though long overdue, from the original debtor on his bond, it may well be presumed that personal liability has been released or discharged. A presumption of payment arises after twenty years, and in the present case there have been more than thirty.</p>
