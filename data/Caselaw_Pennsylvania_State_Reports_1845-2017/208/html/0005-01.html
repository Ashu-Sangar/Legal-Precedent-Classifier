It was devised to him “ and his children.” “ Children ” is a word of purchase and not limitation. It does not limit or qualify the estate devised but describes the persons who take.

There is nothing in the will of William Crawford showing clearly that he used the word in any other than its technical sense, and in the absence of such a clear intent of the testator gathered from the language of the will itself, we cannot say that he used the word children as a word of limitation. The exact question here raised has been decided by the United States circuit court of appeals, Forest Oil Company v. Crawford, 77 Fed. Repr. 106, and 83 Fed. Repr. 109, and the decision of that court is certainly highly persuasive if not a binding authority, and with the general rule just given and these decisions before us we could not do otherwise than hold that Matthew Crawford took only a life estate in the land in controversy under his father’s will, and that his children took an estate in remainder.</p>

Are the plaintiffs estopped from denying that William Crawford had a fee simple estate in this land ? Not unless they did something to deceive the defendant company, upon which it acted to its injury. The evidence shows that two of the plaintiffs after the death of Matthew Crawford told the defendant company’s agent that they would not give the company any trouble, but this was coupled with the information that others of the children would and the advice that Mrs. Erskine of Steubenville should be seen. Clearly there is nothing here that would estop the plaintiffs from standing on their legal rights. But it is claimed that George Crawford and Thomas L. Crawford, and perhaps others of the plaintiffs, acquiesced in the father’s making of the lease to T. J. Vandegrift and had knowledge of the Woodland Oil Company drilling under that lease and of its paying royalties to their father for the oil taken; and this is alLtrue, as we have set out in our findings of fact. But can these facts be set up as constituting an estoppel by the defendant company? It may be conceded that they would estop the plaintiffs from claiming damages from the Woodland Oil Company for taking oil during the life of Matthew Crawford, but from such a concession it would not follow that the same contention could be sustained as to the Forest Oil Company that entered upon this land two months after the plaintiffs had entered upon their in<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>heritance and the lease of Matthew Crawford to T. J. Vandegrift had been ended by the death of Matthew Crawford. Oil is a mineral in situ and like coal can be taken by the life tenant if at the time his testator dies there are on the land open mines. If there are no open mines and he opens them, he is liable to the remaindermen for the oil or coal taken in an action of waste. Matthew Crawford, a life tenant, through the 'Woodland Oil Company, the assignee of his lessee, drilled wells and took oil.. The remaindermen as against both had a right of action, but if they encouraged the opening of the mines, they would be estopped from bringing such action. But this certainly would not be the case for oil taken after the death of the life tenant. The lease terminated at his death. The testimony shows that when the lease was made and when it was being operated by the Woodland Oil Company, the plaintiffs consented to their father as a life tenant taking the oil. And if the father had lived long enongh, all the oil might have been taken. The lessee when he took the lease was expressly told that Matthew Crawford had only a life estate, and the source of his title was known to the lessee or ought to have been known as it was on record in the register of wills office for his inspection and examination. Certainly there was nothing done by any of the plaintiffs that was not wholly consistent with the theory that they were allowing the life tenant to take or mine the oil the same as though wells had been drilled or mines opened before the death of his testator and that his right or those claiming under him so to do would terminate with the death of the life tenant. When the Forest Oil Company entered, it knew the source of the title of Matthew Crawford, it examined his father’s will for the express purpose of seeing what his estate in the land was, in the eyes of the' law it knew or ought to have known that he had only a life estate, it knew that the plaintiffs had not signed the lease to T. J. Vandegrift, and it had good reasons for knowing that the plaintiffs or at least some of them would likely make trouble if their claim that their father was only a life tenant should be controverted. Knowing these things, it is evident that it was not induced to buy an assignment of the Woodland Oil Company by any representations or conduct of the plaintiffs, but because, after an examination of the will of <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>William Crawford, it believed that Matthew Crawford took a fee simple estate in the farm devised to him. If the interpretation it put upon this will was a mistake in law, it cannot now charge that mistake up to the plaintiffs by saying that they are estopped from claiming their rights under their grandfather’s will.</p>

All of these actions under the act of 1887 are now “actions of trespass.” The wrongful taking of oil in the pipe lines, if nothing more appeared in the case, would be the wrongful taking of personal property and either of the first two actions named would be a proper remedy; but if this oil, before it reached the pipe lines, had been severed by the wrongdoer from the land where nature stored it, then the wrongful taking of it would be a wrong that would involve the question of the possession of the land out of which the oil was taken, or of the oil in situ which is in a sense real estate. In the case at bar the defendant company severed the oil from the land, therefore we take it that the plaintiffs’ statement and the proof thereunder to sustain the action at bar ought to be sufficient to support either an action of trespass quare clausem fregit, or an action of trespass for mesne profits. To sustain either of these actions, title and actual possession or the right to immediate possession are involved. If the defendant is in possession and is a wrongdoer without claim of title, title and the right to immediate possession in the plaintiffs are sufficient to maintain an action of trespass quare clausem fregit. If the defendant is in adverse possession under color of title, the plaintiff must first establish his title in an action of ejectment. If&gt;e succeeds and regains possession, then he is in position to maintain and prosecute to judgment an action of trespass for mesne profits. Under the Act of 1879, P. L. 125, this action of trespass maybe instituted before possession is regained but cannot be prosecuted to judg<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>ment until the question of title in the ejectment suit is fully settled. As we have found in this case, the plaintiffs entered upon the farm in controversy at the death of their father. This entry was not by all of them in person it is true, but as they were tenants in common, that was not necessary. Those that did actually enter made an entry for all which the law recognizes as putting them all in possession. Two months after this date, the defendant company entered upon the same farm and took possession of the four wells that had previously been drilled and enough of the surface of the land to operate these wells, and carried away large quantities of oil without any title to either the land or the oil and without any such claim of adverse possession under color of title as would prevent the plaintiffs from maintaining an action of trespass before first bringing action of ejectment and recovering back the oil wells and the surface necessary to operate them. The defendant company did not deny the title of the plaintiffs to the farm in question; its claim was that they did own the farm but as heirs of Matthew Crawford and that it held a lease thereof <em>“ </em>for three years from December 4,1890, and as much longer as oil and gas is found in paying quantities thereon, yielding and paying to the lessor the one-eighth part of all the oil produced and saved from the premises delivered free of expense into tanks or pipe lines,” which was made bj' their predecessor in title and bound him and “ his heirs.” The plaintiffs claimed that Matthew Crawford being only a life tenant could not make a lease binding them, — that their title was not derived from him but from William Crawford from whom he himself derived his title, and that the paper title of the defendant company, to wit: the will of Wm. Crawford and the lease of Matthew Crawford, did not in the eyes of the law give to it even color of title but on their face showed that the defendant had no right of entry on November 27,1894, when it did enter. To repeat, we hold first that George Crawford entered on the farm in controversy on September 30,1894, that he entered for all the plaintiffs who were tenants in common with him and that he was in possession w'hen the defendant did the initiative act of trespass complained of in this action ; second, that as against the defendant company which was without title and out of possession, the original entry of the. plaintiffs upon the sur<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>face was an entry as to the oil contained in the land and under the surface; third, that the possession of the defendant company after November 27, 1894, was that of a presumptive wrongdoer and was not such adverse possession under color of title as to prevent the plaintiffs from maintaining an action of trespass for the oil wrongfully mined and carried away until they had established their title and regained possession of the four oil wells in actions of ejectment. If, however, we are mistaken in these conclusions, it does not follow that the plaintiffs cannot maintain this action of trespass. On July 30, 1897, the possession of these four oil wells was taken away from the defendant company and there is no evidence that it ever retook possession after that date or that it was in adverse possession under color of title on October 13, 1900, nor is there even any evidence that these oil wells on October 13,-1900, were producing oil “ in paying quantities,” or in other words, that the lease under which the defendant claimed had not expired by its own terms. If the defendant company before October 13,1900, had exhausted all the oil, then on its own showing it at that date had no title or color of title, and if it never went into actual possession after the receivership terminated, there could be no right of action in ejectment in the plaintiffs against the defendant company on October 13, 1900, and they would be free to bring their action of trespass for mesne profits or damages for taking and detaining the oil. All that the Act of 1879, P. L. 125, authorizing actions for mesne profits; requires, is that the plaintiffs shall have obtained possession before the trial of such action. There certainly was no claim at the trial that the defendant company was still in possession of these oil wells producing oil. And of course we could not say that a writ of habere facias possessionem was under such circumstances indispensable. “ If possession is voluntarily given up, the right to institute an action for mesne profits is as clear as if it had been forcibly taken under a writ: ” Caldwell v. Walters, <a href="/pa/22/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="413709" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0378-01">22 Pa. 378</a>.</p>

In law it had no claim, but it thought the law gave it a claim. It was honestly mistaken when it made the entry, <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>and therefore we are of opinion, as we have already indicated, that the net value of the oil in the pipe lines is the true measure of damages for the oil taken, and in arriving at that sum we have taken what the oil sold for in the market and from this deducted the cost of production. The claim that the value of one eighth of the oil was the true measure of damages is clearly untenable. That was the usual royalty paid to a landowner, at that time and in that locality, by a lessee who drilled the wells. Here the landowner had four wells already drilled and that were producing oil. And the net value of the daily production would be the profit accruing to the owner of the land. The defendant company drilled no wells and it had no property rights in the wells it operated. It was a trespasser, and if it is allowed its expenses in producing the oil, together with the difference in value of the improvements, etc., it put on and the machinery, etc., it took away from the wells, what more could it ask ? To say it is entitled to seven eighths of the oil is to say indirectly that it had a good title under its assignment to the oil that it took, and the plaintiffs would be getting no more than if they had acknowledged that the company’s possession was lawful.</p>

    <p id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[132,626,1182,657]]]'>The language of the devise is : “ And I will and devise to my son Matthew and to his children, my old farm adjoining Mark Kelso and others, provided however, at ihe end of one year after my decease, or when called upon for it, he shall pay to his mother the sum of three hundred dollars, in addition to the sujn as above bequeathed her; and he shall pay also to my son' Oliver’s child when it shall become of age, the sum of two hundred dollars, but if the said child shall die before it shall become of age, I will that he be altogether exonerated from the payment of the said two hundred dollars.” The will was exécuted in 1843. At that time Matthew had seven children living. Subsequently six more were born — five before and one after the death of the testator.</p>

In very many, of our cases, it is true, the word has been used as one of limitation; “ but in all of them such construction was clearly in accord with the intent of the testators as gathered from the four corners of the will, as when ‘ children ’ has been used with ‘heirs of the body’ or ‘issue’ as its synonyms:” Oyster v. Oyster, <a href="/pa/100/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="100 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="498384" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0538-01">100 Pa. 538</a>. The rule, as laid down by Lord Hardwicke in Bussar v. Brandford, 2 Atk. 220, is, that “ children, in their natural import, are words of purchase, and not of limitation, unless it is to comply with the intention of a testator, where the words cannot take effect in any other way.” There is nothing in any other portion of the will of William Crawford clearly indicating his intention to use the word in any other than its technical sense. If the children of Matthew took directly from their grandfather, what was the estate given to their father and what passed to them ? In England and this country there are numerous authorities bearing upon the question which might be collated and commented upon, if we could longer regard it as an open one with us. That was done in Coursey v. Davis, <a href="/pa/46/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="46 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="420645" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0025-01">46 Pa. 25</a>, and it was held that a conveyance to a married woman, “ and her children <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>exclusively, and their heirs and assigns, to have and to hold ” to her “ and to her children exclusively and their heirs and assigns,” vests in her a life estate, with remainder in fee to her children as a class, so that those in being at the date of the deed, as well as those subsequently born, would be entitled to take in the distribution on the termination of the life estate at her death. Mr. Justice Read, in delivering the opinion of the court, followed Jeffery v. Honywood, 4 Madd. Ch. Rep. 211. Though doubt has been thrown upon it as authority, it was there held by the vice chancellor that a devise to the testator’s daughter, a married woman, “ and to all and every the child and children, whether male or female, of her body lawfully begotten, and unto his, her, and their heirs or assigns forever, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants,” gave a life estate to the mother and a remainder in fee to the children. In the comparatively late case of Hague v. Hague, <a href="/pa/161/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="161 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="854216" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0643-01">161 Pa. 643</a>, where the testator directed his executors to deliver to his daughter, Sarah Jane Hague, a deed which he had executed to her, we held that the conveyance to “ Sarah Jane Hague and her children ” gave to the mother but a life estate, with remainder in fee to her children as a class, and that those born after the death of the testator participated equally with those born before. In construing this devise the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Pennsylvania held that <em>“ </em>Matthew Crawford took a life estate in the land in question; that his children living at the testator’s death took an estate in remainder, which, under the authority of Hague v. Hague, <a href="/pa/161/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="161 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="854216" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0643-01">161 Pa. 643</a> (29 Atl. Repr. 261), and Gernet v.

The sole question before this court is as to the correctness of this interpretation, and upon that question we have no doubt whatever. The learned judge was right in accepting the decisions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court as controlling. They are sufficiently referred to in his opinion ; his understanding of <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>them accords with our own, and his application of them to the matter in hand is entirely satisfactory. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed:” Forest Oil Company v. Crawford, 77 Fed. Repr. 106, and 83 Fed. Repr. 109. The learned judge of the common pleas justly' regarded this as high authority.</p>
