Indeed, plaintiff’s counsel, who, through this most difficult and unpleasant litigation, has sought to protect and enforce the interest of his client with a zeal and intelligence which is worthy of the highest commendation, rested his argument in this aspect of the case not so much upon any proof of actual conspiracy, as upon the ground that the claim of Barton Pardee was so clearly devoid of merit as to render his action in pressing it in connection with the circumstance, that by so pressing it the entire fund was tied up, was per se fraudulent and so inequitable as to justify a chancellor • to reopen the settlement and compel restoration of the booty.</p>

    <p id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.4",651,[146,573,1175,560]]]'>The findings of fact take up thirty-eight printed pages of appellant’s paper-book, his conclusions of law nineteen pages more. While the elaborate report of these findings and conclusions was necessary for a proper review of the case in this court, they are not otherwise important to the legal profession or to other than the parties. The full publication of them would only incumber the printed reports with useless matter. We therefore direct that the decree be affirmed on that part of the opinion embodying the referee’s general conclusions, as set out on pages sixty-six to seventy-two inclusive of appellant’s paper book.</p>
