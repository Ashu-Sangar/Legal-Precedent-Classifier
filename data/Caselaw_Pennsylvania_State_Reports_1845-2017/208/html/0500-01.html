The answer depends upon whether the direction to divide among the children of the life tenant living at his death describes the class who shall-take, or simply fixes the time at which the gift shall be paid. If it is descriptive of the class, then the children or other issue who died before the life tenant must be excluded, because that is the date at which the estate so created by the testator first <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>comes into being. Its badge of membership designed by the testator can be given only to the persons who are living at that time ; and where the persons to wear it are uncertain, as until then they must be, the gift is contingent: Smith on Exec. Int. 281. The intendment of the law in favor of vested over contingent interests will not prevail over a fairly-defined testamentary intention to the contrary. A strong hint of such a contrary intent is found in the limitation over in default of issue of the son. On the theory that the remainder vested at testator’s death, that limitation was already defeated, because at his death and even at the time of the writing of the will issue of the son was already in being. Another hint to the same effect, and which in many cases has been held, of itself, to import a contingency, is the absence of distinct words of gift to those who are to take the remainder — the bequest being implied only from the simple direction to divide. The distinction is subtle, but it has heen recognized in the numerous cases which hold that a gift is contingent' which rests in a mere direction to pay. These points were discussed and determined in Reiff’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/124/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="563119" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0145-01">124 Pa. 145</a>. With the single exception that a trust was created, the provisions of the will in that case were in terms almost identical with those of the will before us; there were the same direction to pay at the death of the life tenant “ to her children who may then be living, or the issue of such as may be dead,” and the same limitation in default of leaving child or issue to testator’s surviving children.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[294,1704,1173,457]]]'>In Reichard’s Appeal, T16 Pa. 232, in a similar trust to pay the income to a daughter for life, and at her death to pay the income to her child or children who should be living at her death, and to the issue of any deceased child until their majority, and then to pay them the principal, it was held that the interest of the daughter’s children was contingent upon their survival of the mother. The case is even stronger, because there was no limitation over to other children of testator in default of issue of the daughter.</p>

Following the gift in trust for the husband for life, the will proceeded: “ I give, devise and bequeath the whole estate then remaining to my brothers and sisters; <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>the child or children of any of my said brothers or sisters who may then be living to take and receive the share that his or their parent would have taken if living.” The gift to the brothers and sisters was in absolute terms, with no condition that they should be living at the death of the husband, the tenant for life; and there was simply an alternative limitation, that if a brother or sister should be then dead, but leaving issue, his issue should be substituted to his interest.</p>

It was an absolute gift in express terms to a class generally, with no restriction that its members should be living at a given time; whereas, in the present case, there are no words of gift except as implied in the direction to pay, and the designated class is “the children then living;” and there is the further limitation, which did not appear in Oarstensen’s Estate, supra, that if the life tenant should die without leaving issue, his share should go to certain of the testator’s children.</p>
