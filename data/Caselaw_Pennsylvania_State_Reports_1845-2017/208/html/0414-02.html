The testatrix was a member of a German reformed congregation of which proponent was and is the pastor. It was not until quite near the close of 1898 or the beginning of 1899 that the relations between them were anything but the ordinary ones of pastor and parishioner. For years in matters of investments, and in 1898 in the settlement of the estate of her sister with whom she had lived, who died in March of that year, and from whom she derived the bulk of her property, then amounting in the whole to about $20,000, testatrix had had the services of a certain member of this bar. She had expressed to him (as she did to others) her annoyance over the fact that the greater part of her estate, upon which collateral inheritance tax had been paid when it came to her from her sister, should again be subject thereto upon her own death; had asked him how that could be avoided, and had been told by him (as she was by others) that she could avoid it by giving away her property while she lived. She had spoken to him in an indefinite way about drawing her will; but she had actually asked this service of an old and intimate acquaintance, the husband of a cousin, who was not a lawyer. She seems to have had little intercourse with most of her relatives, and not much kindly feeling for the contestants who are the nearest of her blood, but through whose father she had lost heavily. In the earliest intimations she gave of her intentions concerning the disposition of her property, she disclosed the purpose of excluding the contestants from any share in it, but yielded to the persuasion of the person with whom she was discussing the matter, and who was to draw her will, so far as to say that she would leave them the house she lived in or its equivalent in money- — which is substantially what the will in dispute gives them.</p>

It was in December of that year that she first mentioned to him the matter of a will, requesting his advice as to some church charity she might remember with a bequest, whereupon he named several for her consideration. Early in 1899, having <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>made up her mind on this subject, she asked him to write her will and dictated to him a number of items which he took down by way of memoranda. When she asked him to be the executor of the will, he declined to write it, but suggested among others Rev. A. C. Whitmer, of Lancaster, with some of whose writings on mission matters the testatrix was acquainted, and whom eventually the proponent invited to Reading for the pur-; pose. Tjhe issue, as formulated in the precept of the orphans’ court, making the contestants the plaintiffs, they at the trial admitted the due execution and proof of the will in controversy, and called and accredited as their witnesses the only persons who, besides the proponent, know anything whatever about the manner and time and circumstances of the making of it or of either of the two wills that preceded it. By their testimony it appears that in February, 1899, Whitmer, at proponent’s invitation, came to his house in Reading, there met the testatrix, and the proponent being in and out of the room, wrote her will, using memoranda, in proponent’s handwriting — each being read by the scrivener to the testatrix and approved by her — all of them referring to specific bequests, and none of them to the proponent’s being named as executor or residuary legatee. The direction to that effect was given by the testatrix. Executed at proponent’s house and witnessed by the scrivener and a physician living nearby, whom proponent called in, the will was taken away by testatrix after demonstrative acts and expressions on her part of satisfaction with what she had done.</p>

Whitmer was again called to Reading by a letter from proponent advising him that testatrix desired to alter her will. Meeting her at proponent’s house, he was told by her that she wished the same person to rewrite her will as had written it, and proceeded to do so according to her directions — the changes made relating to minor items, of which there was quite a number, but marking no departure from the main original disposition of her estate. After the writing and before the execution of this instrument, Whit<a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>mer, while alone with the testatrix, asked her whether any one had influenced her in making any part of this will — to which she replied with an emphatic no. On this occasion also the same scrivener drew a deed (from hers brought with her by the testatrix), in which for the consideration of one dollar, the testatrix conveyed to proponent the house she lived in. Both instruments were executed (and the deed acknowledged) the following morning, testatrix calling at proponent’s house for Whitmer who was to witness the execution of both. The will was retained by testatrix. The deed was not put upon record. It was subsequently on or about June 4, 1901, returned to and destroyed by the testatrix, who at the same time executed another drawn by proponent’s son (then a student at law) by proponent’s direction, reserving to the grantor a life estate in the property. A consideration is therein mentioned of #1,900, the value put upon the property by the testatrix (about #2,100) less the value of the life-estate as estimated by the scrivener. No consideration, however, passed. This deed remained unrecorded while testatrix lived.</p>

The will to be rewritten was over two years old, and had three or four codicils added to it in testatrix’s handwriting. She directed a few changes, the most important being a bequest of #500 to Florence Ball (of which the latter knew nothing). The scrivener simply rewrote the provisions of the old will and its codicils with the alterations directed. When drawn, the instrument was read over to testatrix, handed to her, and examined, pronounced satisfactory and taken away by her. The following morning, by appointment, she brought it to the office of the scrivener’s preceptors and there, after again looking over it, executed it, expressing her surprise and approval at the formality of signing every page, because “ so many signatures should make a will proof against attack.” She took the executed will with her when she left the office, and subsequently gave the scrivener a fee for drawing it. Sometime thereafter, she handed the will to the proponent, and it remained in his custody until it was probated. To Whitmer, the testatrix on one occasion-spoke of this will, 'explained her rea<a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>sons for having it made anew, and expressed her contentment with it.

The closer association with proponent, which she had sought, had become an intimacy that embraced his family and continued to the end. There is no evidence of the utterance by her of any complaints of, or dissatisfaction with them. She often spoke of them as her chosen friends — her friends not by proximity or long acquaintance but by choice. Proponent’s visits to her were frequent. So were hers at his house. It became her habit to dine there on Sundays. She gave the members of the family Christmas remembrances, and at various times, the last three or four days before her death, made money presents to proponent ranging from $10 to $400, and aggregating $615.50. She sought and had his assistance in some business matters. Once he advised her in the purchase of a small house. Another time, in September, 1899, he was active in procuring an assignment to her of a $3,000 mortgage upon the parsonage belonging to the church and occupied by him, the interest on which he had been paying to the mortgagee and continued thereafter to pay to her. On another occasion, in October, 1899, he found for her an investment for $2,800 upon a judgment note of two of his parishioners, one of them the physician who witnessed her will. As the intimacy between her and proponent and his family went on, cultivated on both sides, there was a corresponding impairment of the frequency and doubtless the cordiality of her intercourse with her neighbors; especially when her dependence upon their attentions became diminished by her employing, in the fall of 1899, as a companion, a young woman, Florence Ball, who had been for a few years prior to 1894 an inmate of proponent’s household — whom, upon testatrix’s inquiring for a suitable person, proponent’s wife had suggested — to whom, at testatrix’s instance, she had written to Los Angeles, Cal., where she was living with her brother — and who, at her own and her brother’s expense, had come on to take the situation. There is nothing in the evidence to show that testatrix was mentally or bodily weak. On the contrary, it is evident that she was a woman of a rather positive sort, of strong feelings, and physically and intellectually well preserved. She was in <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>the habit of making annual visits to friends at some distance from Reading, at Lititz, Easton, etc., always except once unattended. One of these visits she made alone shortly before her death. Her handwriting, of which there are in evidence several specimens, done both before and subsequently to the will, shows a regularity and firmness quite remarkable considering her age, while the style and substance of the writings convey no suggestion whatever of mental decay, but rather of alertness and vigor.</p>

It includes nothing resting in the uncorroborated testimony of the proponent, whose credibility the contestants are, of course, at liberty to question. His testimony — and under the rule established by a long line of decisions from Brawdy v. Brawdy, <a href="/pa/7/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="957936" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0157-01">7 Pa. 157</a>, down, as applicable to oases tried before a jury in which the trial judge sits as chancellor, it cannot be ignored, but in so far as it is responsive must be overcome — positively denies the assertion by him of, or the attempt to exert, any influence over the testatrix by suggestion, persuasion or prompting of any description, save that be admits having recommended to her a certain church charity with a view to a bequest which she refused to consider. He asserts, detailing testatrix’s acts and statements as well as his own, that in all the benefits conferred upon him or his family by her, executed during her life orto take effect after her death, she acted without any solicitation or constraint, moved solely by kindly feelings towards himself and friendly affection and devoted interest in his family. He avers, again .giving conversations, etc., that the methods pursued, whereby what she did remained unknown to her relatives, were adopted in deference to her explicit desire that they should so remain; that he had nothing to do with bringing Florence Ball from the west to live with testatrix ; that she at all times had perfect control over her will even in his hands ; and that his custody of it, beginning some time after its final execution, had its origin, according to testatrix’s statement to him, in the misbehavior and threats of a cousin who wanted to be made her executor, whom <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>she objected to, and whose violence she feared — and it may be noted that in this he is corroborated by two writings'of the testatrix preserved with her will. He does not pretend to have advised her to consult an attorney about her will or to employ one to write it. But he swears that the suggestion of a scrivener from out of town was hers, and that the selection of the particular persons who acted in that capacity was her own deliberate act. As to the conveyance of the house and the transfer of the bank stock, he testifies that they were made at her repeatedly expressed desire to do in her lifetime what would otherwise have to be done after her death — the thought of it having come to her, as she explained, through a recent gift of bank stock by another old lady in Reading to a pastor.</p>

The word “ undue ” in this connection is not used in the sense lexicographers give to it as one of its popular meanings — “disproportionate,” “inordinate,” “unworthy,” as in the phrases “undue excitement,” “undue partiality,” “ undue attachment,” or the like. As a legal phrase, it is used in a stricter sense as denoting something wrong according to a standard of morals which the law enforces in the relations of men, and therefore something legally wrong, something violative of a legal duty — in a word something illegal. And again the word “influence” does not refer to any and every line of conduct capable of disposing in one’s favor a free and self-directing mind, but to a control acquired over another which virtually destroys his free agency. -In Browne v. Molliston, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Whart.%20129" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Whart. 129">8 Whart. 129</a>, it was said, at p. 138, that, in order to constitute undue influence sufficient to avoid a will, “there must be imprisonment of the'body or mind;” nor is there a decision in Pennsylvania which recognizes anything short of that as satisfying the legal definition of undue influence. In.deed that definition, as indispensably involving the existence of fraud, or threats, or misrepresentation, or circumvention, or inordinate flattery, or physical, or moral coércion to such a degree as to subjugate the mind of the testator, to destroy his free agency and to operate as a present constraint upon him in the making of the will, has been so thoroughly settled in this state that it is only necessary to cite the recent decisions in <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>Logan’s Est., <a href="/pa/195/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="195 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="914062" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0282-01">195 Pa. 282</a>, 289, and Englert v.

    <p class="summary" id="b451-3" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[131,623,1182,1235]]]'>It is thus very manifest that undue influence is not to be predicated of an impression, though seemingly exaggerated, that is produced upon another by kindly offices, gratifying attentions, the force of mutually voluntary association revealing secret needs and unspoken desires. Neither does it consist in bad taste, in a want of delicacy, in a willingness to cultivate another’s good graces even with a view to possibly profiting thereby, or in a readiness to accept benefits generously and undeservedly offered. These and similar things belong to the domain of what Chief Justice Gibson in Kintzing v. McElrath, <a href="/pa/5/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="5 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="953589" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0467-01">5 Pa. 467</a>, 469, calls “principles of morality too subtle for administration by an earthly tribunal,” and therefore not attempted to be enforced by our law.

And hence, when undue influence is alleged, the inquiry is not whether the beneficiary’s conduct was that which was becoming to him in his station, whether it was judicious, discreet, high-toned or disinterested, but whether there was any wrong in it whereby the free agency of the testator was set at naught in the making of his will. That wrong, where its end and purpose are the benefit of the party perpetrating it, is practically indistinguishable from fraud: Boyd v. Boyd, <a href="/pa/66/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="66 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="432476" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0283-01">66 Pa. 283</a>, 293.</p>

Whatever may be the difference in the manner or burden of proof as to undue influence between the case of a stranger to the testator’s blood and that of a relative — and there is no difference between them in respect to what constitutes undue influence- — it is clear under the authorities that neither want of kinship, nor the existence of confidential relations, nor activity in drawing the will, nor all of these, can be sufficient to overcome the denial of undue influence by the proponent and his explanation of the attendant circumstances, where not only testamentary capacity is conceded but there is nothing in the case to suggest any bodily or mental weakness or infirmity on the part of the testator creating a susceptibility to influence, which, though short of incapacity, may yet be enough to render it probable that the disposition made of his estate was the act of some one else dominating his will, that person being pointed out by the intrinsic evidence furnished by the instrument itself.

Half a year or more before she made any testament she had decided against the contestants as to anything beyond the house she lived in or an equivalent of its value in money. Holding on to that purpose, that is what she gave them'in the first will she made, gave them again in the second, and finally gave them in the will in controversy. All the wills were written under her personal direction as to every detail. They were in her possession before and after execution during nearly the whole of a period of three years. During this time, twice in having them rewritten, three or four times by the addition of codicils in her own hand, she reaffirmed the disposition she had originally made in favor of the proponent. She repudiated the insinuation that any one had influenced her in any part of her determinations, and instead of ever complaining of their tenor or of her relations with the proponent or his family, she repeatedly expressed her intense satisfaction over both. If, as is profoundly remarked in Robinson v. Robinson, <a href="/pa/203/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="203 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="994779" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0400-01">203 Pa. 400</a>, 425, thwarted weakness is evidenced by complaints accompanied by inaction, it must also be true that uncontrolled freedom of action is shown by an absence of complaints re-enforced by positive expressions of satisfaction and acts unequivocally indicative thereof. The testatrix’s expressions and acts just referred to are certainly such. If the conveyance of her house, the transfer of her bank stock, and the gifts of money to the. proponent after the determination to make him the residuary legatee had been fixed upon paper may not fairly be looked upon as acts of this kind (though in view of the testatrix’s abhorrence of the collateral inheritance tax law — of the suggestion made to her by her legal adviser and others of the possibility of avoiding it by giving her property away — and of the fact that she continued in undisturbed possession of the house and enjoyment of the income from the stock while she lived, they would seem to tend that way) — yet the most that can be said of them favorably to the contestants is that they are equally open to a contrary interpretation ; which is not enough to give them the force of evidence of undue influence. It has been laid down that there is no rule of law or morals which will prevent clergy<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>men from receiving gifts, great or small, from their parishioners: Greenfield’s Est., <a href="/pa/24/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="24 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="9504070" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0232-01">24 Pa. 232</a>, 240. But the conclusiveness of these transfers in a proceeding in equity between the donor and the donee, is not the test of their evidential effect in this proceeding. Conceding that in the former a legal presumption of invalidity would have arisen against the donee, that circumstance cannot here be made the basis of a finding of undue influence in the execution of the will as a matter of fact. An inference of fact can surely not be based upon a legal presumption which, while it stands, stands in the place and ignores the question of fact. When this matter of gifts is eliminated as one at least as capable of militating against as in favor of the contestants, what is there left of the case undisposed of by the admitted fact of testatrix’s testamentary capacity, and the indisputable one of her freedom from any such weakness as would render her liable to be imposed upon ? There is nothing in the testimony of the draftsman of her wills or of any witness, or in any remembered saying of the testatrix to show that proponent had suggested any provision embodied in them favorable to himself or his family or any one he was interested in, or in any way taken advantage of his confidential relation with her, conceding that character to the relation existing between them. His own testimony is emphatically that he had not, and he stands uncontradicted. To say that the jury might nevertheless have presumed the contrary, is to say that a presumption against the evidence may be made the foundation of a valid finding of fact, which cannot be : Hays v. Hays, <a href="/pa/6/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="6 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="954602" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0368-01">6 Pa. 368</a>, 370. There is not only no indication that she did not fully understand what she was doing when she made her successive wills (as there was in Scattergood v. Kirk, <a href="/pa/192/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="192 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="908994" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0263-01">192 Pa. 263</a>), but the evidence is uncontradicted, and most of it unimpeachable by contestants, that she was fully able to understand it, carefully pondered it, did understand it, knew it by heart, expressed her satisfaction over it, and persisted in it for three years knowing that it in a large measure excluded and would disappoint her relatives. Suppose she did, the evening before she died, let fall some vague expressions to one of the witnesses which the latter construed as evidencing a doubt as to the propriety of what she had done. At the most the witness’s statement was only one of opinion, or suspicion, or belief, <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>and therefore unavailing as proof (see Hook’s Est., supra), as is also the assertion by certain other witnesses that after Florence Ball’s arrival testatrix was not as free to go about and converse as she had been — an imputation explicitly denied and not borne out by anything tangible in tbe evidence. Besides, if testatrix did mean to express dissatisfaction with something she had done, nobody can tell what portion of her testamentary disposition she had in mind, if any. And finally, the inquiry here is as to her free agency, her real and uncontrolled intention at the time of the execution of the will in controversy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-3" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[132,922,1176,406]]]'>There remains the so-called unnaturalness of the will, and of the entire conduct of the testatrix in relation to her property — the fact that by gifts and by testamentary disposition she deprived her nearest relatives of the succession to so large a proportion of her estate in favor of one who is a stranger to her blood. The argument has' a legitimate basis, but it is a weak one at best. Says Mr. Justice Pax son, in Cauffman v. Long, <a href="/pa/82/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="82 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1047992" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0072-01">82 Pa. 72</a>, at p. 77.</p>

No right of the citizen is more valued than the power to dispose of his property by will. No right is more solemnly assured to him by the law. Nor does it depend in any sense upon the judicious exercise of it. It rarely happens that a man bequeaths his estate to the entire satisfaction of either his family or friends. In many instances testamentary dispositions of property seem harsh, if not unjust, the result perhaps of prejudice as to some of the testator’s kindred, or undue partiality as to others. But these are matters about which we have no concern. The law wisely secures equality of distribution where a man dies intestate. But the very object of a will is to produce inequality, and to ... . reward those who have been affectionate, and to punish those who have been disobedient. It is doubtless true that narrow prejudice sometimes interferes with the. wisdom of such arrangements. This is due to the imperfections of our human nature. It must be remembered that in this country a man’s prejudices are a part of his liberty. He has a right to them; he may be <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>unjust to his children or relatives; he is entitled to the control of his property while living, and by will to direct its use after his death.</p>

But in this case a sufficient reason lies upon the surface. The testatrix was an old woman practically alone in the world. She had relatives; but some of them she seems not to have had anything to do with — some of them she did not like — some of them she thought had already had more from her than was their due. It does not appear that she forgot their existence ; for her will contains a long list of small bequests in the nature of remembrances. Beyond that she did not feel under obligations to them. It is not unnatural to give or leave the bulk of one’s property to those with whom one associates and whom one likes, rather than to-those one rarely sees or disapproves of. The testatrix’s friends were certainly nearer to her than most of her relations. Then, too, it is one of the legitimate uses to which a person in the situation in which the testatrix was may put her means, to secure herself such environment, such attentions as are acceptable to her. If thereby her happiness and comfort are increased, it is perhaps difficult to conceive in what way more satisfactory to her she could employ her money. It is as clear as can be from the evidence in this case that the testatrix found exceeding great pleasure and contentment in her relations with proponent and his family.and in the attentions they bestowed upon her, and that she was very fond of these people. If prompted by a' feeling of admiration for proponent and affection for his family, or by a sense of gratitude for kindnesses received at their hands, or by a shrewd desire to insure their continuance, she saw fit to present the proponent with part of her estate (her enjoyment of her home and income not being thereby interfered with) and to assure him, by a will whose provisions he was acquainted with, a portion of the remainder upon her death — it would be a bold thing to say that she was doing that which was unnatural from her standpoint, or that her judgment was at fault or her choice constrained. Indeed, in the absence of any evidence of mental or bodily weakness inconsistent with the assumption of a conscious motive freely acted upon, all this ap<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>pears ill-calculated to base an inference of undue influence, but rather tends the other way.</p>

Of the Pennsylvania cases some, indeed, have already been referred to. The remainder relate to questions arising in proceedings involving gifts inter vivos, the principles controlling of which are admittedly not identical with those applicable to testamentary dispositions. The cases gathered from other jurisdictions, however respectable, in which, as to such, different rules obtain from those settled in this state are, of course, not authoritative here.</p>

It is, however, proper to note that, as gathered from statements of counsel, in the presentation of the case in the orphans’ court, the relation of the most material witnesses to the respective parties was reversed, and therefore the range of inferences capable of being contended for by contestants much Avidor and the question.of credibility much more important. A painstaking re-examination of the case as here presented has led to the conclusion that, whilst some of the principles involved Avere perhaps not apprehended with entire accuracy, the direction of a verdict for proponent was imperative. Conceding that upon him was the burden of explaining whatever was left unexplained by witnesses called by contestants, yet his comprehensive explanation of the circumstances and denial of wrong, under oath, supported in most of the significant details by the Avitnesses referred to or by witnesses called in his behalf, and in others corroborated by undisputed facts, must, under the decisions cited, be accepted, as discharging that burden in the absence both of direct proof of undue influence actually exercised by proponent, and of a presumption thereof arising against him from something in the evidence indicating weakness or infirmity in the testatrix.</p>
