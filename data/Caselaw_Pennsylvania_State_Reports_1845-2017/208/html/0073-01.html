    <p class="summary" id="b103-8" data-blocks='[["BL_103.9",103,[158,2367,1132,45]],["BL_104.1",104,[294,340,1195,2058]],["BL_105.1",105,[126,364,1174,94]]]'>1. It is undoubtedly the law that an agreement to convey <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>land fronting upon a public highway includes the grantor’s title to the center of the highway, unless a contrary intention plainly appears: Falls v. Reis, <a href="/pa/74/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="74 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1034706" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0439-01">74 Pa. 439</a>. The agreement of September 5, 1902, does not in direct words provide for a retention of title by the railway company to the'land embraced within South Twentieth street. Is such reservation necessarily implied by its terms ? To our mind the agreement indicates no such intention. Under its provisions the machine company bound itself to convey to the railway company the lot at the corner of Twenty-first street and Edwards alley, and in consideration therefor the railway company agreed in the event of the vacation of Twentieth street to convey the portion of that street which would revert to it as an' abutting owner. Unless the vacation be accomplished the railway company would have no marketable title to that strip of land, and its deed therefor would be practically valueless. To meet that contingency it was provided that in the event of a failure to procure the vacation of Twentieth street, the railway company should convey forty by 120 feet at the corner of Mary and Twentieth streets, the conveyance of this lot “ to be in lieu of the West ■half of South Twentieth street.” Counsel for plaintiff place great stress upon the words just quoted, and claim they clearly imply an intention that the one half of the street should be reserved by plaintiff in the event of a conveyance being made of the corner lot. It seems to us a reasonable interpretation of these words in connection with the other parts of the agreement indicates just the opposite. The railway company was to give something in exchange for the lot it was to receive from defendant. If it could make title to the strip occupied in part by the street, defendant would be required to accept that strip; if not, then instead of that strip it was to convey the lot at the corner which means not only the lot but everything that ordinarily attaches to and goes with a conveyance of land, and includes the reversion in abutting streets: Paul v. Carver, <a href="/pa/26/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="26 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="977306" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0223-01">26 Pa. 223</a> ; Cox v.

No other conclusion would be equitable or just. There being no reservation of the reversion in the street expressed in the agreement and no words from which a reservation can be reasonably implied, it follows that plaintiff, having failed to comply with its part of the agreement, defendant had a right to rescind the contract, and <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>having done so, plaintiff is not entitled' to the relief prayed for.</p>
