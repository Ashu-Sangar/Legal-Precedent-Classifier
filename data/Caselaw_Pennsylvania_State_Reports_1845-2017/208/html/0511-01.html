The material furnished by the claimant was partly furnished for and partly used for sidewalks, and as claimant has failed to show what portion went for sidewalks and what portion for other purposes, it is impossible to determine what portion of its claim would, upon this ground, be bad and what would be good.

The referee is unable to concur in the argument of - counsel for the claimant, that the letter of September-14, 1899, operates to estop the defendants to deny that the claimant might file claims against the entire property at any time until-December 27, 1899. Granting, even, that all the elements ordinarily necessary to raise an estoppel were present, the referee is of opinion that there should be no estoppel here, for the reason that estoppel is distinctly personal, and can bind only those-persons who are privy to the - act relied upon to raise it. In this case, the attempt is not to charge any person or persons, but the land itself, and the referee holds it clear that no representations of the defendants, however binding upon themselves, should be allowed to have such an effect. Estoppel, by its very nature, is inapplicable in cases in which- property, no.t the person, is to be charged.</p>
