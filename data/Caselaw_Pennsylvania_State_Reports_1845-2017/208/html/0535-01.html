The real complaint made before us does not appear in the reasons upon which the application for the allowance of this appeal was based. It is that the notice of the limitation, which the appellee had fixed to its liability for the loss of the appellant’s baggage, had not been given and assented to by her. That this is her real contention appears from the following, taken from the printed argument' of her counsel: “ Moreover, the law is equally well settled that while a common carrier may restrict its common-law liability in cases other than those occasioned by its own negligence, yet it cair only do so in such cases by special contract with the passenger or by a notice brought to the passenger’s notice and assented to by him. . . The rule is relaxed in the case of baggage only to the extent that reasonable limitations of liability for lost baggage are permitted when fairly made, properly brought to the passenger’s notice and assented to by him.”</p>

There is no evidence that she was unable to read, and it would be a violent presumption that, when she paid for and received the ticket, she did not look at it to see that the agent had handed her what she wanted. It was not a small piece of pasteboard, such as is ordinarily used for tickets between stations, on the same line, but a paper of some size, setting forth on its face — not in small type unlikely to attract attention, but clearly, prominently and legibly —the terms on which it had been issued. The carrier had.' entered into a contract of carriage with the appellant, and so far as the terms of the contract appeared on the face of her ticket, and were reasonable, she was bound by them: Dietrich v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/71/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="71 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1031245" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0432-01">71 Pa. 432</a>; Oil Creek &amp; Allegheny River Ry.

It will' be found discussed in Fonseca v. Cunard Steamship Co., <a href="/mass/153/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="153 Mass. 553" data-case-ids="815983" data-case-paths="/mass/153/0553-01">153 Mass. 553</a>, <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> and the cases there cited. In the absence of proof to the contrary, the presumption is that the appellant read the ticket, to the character of which attention has been called. While in no one of our own cases brought to our attention by counsel for appellee, or which we have been able to find, has the question of this presumption been passed upon, yet that it does arise seems to have been recognized in Penna. Central P. R. Co. v. Schwarzenberger, <a href="/pa/45/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="45 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="9502732" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0208-01">45 Pa. 208</a>. In that case the passenger purchased a ticket from Philadelphia to Cincinnati. On the face of it there was printed: “ In selling this ticket for passage over road west of Pittsburgh, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company acts only as agent for the western lines, and assumes no responsibility westof Pittsburgh.” The passenger’s baggage was lost beyond Pittsburgh. There' was no evidence that Schwarzenberger had read his ticket. The court, through Strong, J., in speaking of the contract between him and the railroad company, said: “But contemporaneously with the receipt of the fare, and as evidence of the contract into which they entered, they gave to the plaintiff a ticket, informing him that they assumed no responsibility for his carriage, and of course for the carriage of his baggage beyond Pittsburgh. They notified him that they acted only as agents for the carriers, whose route extended westward from Pittsburgh, and not at all for themselves. With this express disclaimer of personal liability, there is no possibility of implying an engagement.”</p>

She was distinctly notified that the baggage which the appellee would carry for her was limited to 150 pounds in weight and in value to one dollar per pound; but she was notified still further that, by special agreement with the company, its liability would not be so limited, for the limitation is followed by the words: “ Unless special agree<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>ment be made.” Without additional compensation, her baggage, limited in amount and value, would be carried; for additional compensation, by “ special agreement,” she could have it carried without the limitation imposed which had been brought to her notice and assented to by her by her acceptance of the ticket: Crary v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/203/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="203 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="994744" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0525-01">203 Pa. 525</a>. She did not avail herself of her right to make a special agreement by which her baggage, at its full value, would have been carried by the railroad company, and she is, therefore, bound by the reasonable limitation placed upon its liability, for it contravenes no statute, violates no duty to the public and was brought distinctly to her notice.</p>
