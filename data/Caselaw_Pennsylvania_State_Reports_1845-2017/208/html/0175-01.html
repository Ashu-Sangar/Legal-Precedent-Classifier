Assuming that under the circumstances it was the right of the driver to turn to his left to pass the obstruction, it was his duty to exercise care commensurate with the greater danger of the situation, and to allow a wagon which was in the passageway to move out before he attempted to enter it. Otherwise a collision would be inevitable. The defendant’s witnesses presented the occurrence in an entirely different light, and in one that wholly relieved the driver from blame. As these witnesses were without interest in the result of the trial, and had the best opportunity to observe what took place, their testimony should have great weight with the jury; but its only effect was to raise a controversy as to the facts, which the jury alone could decide.</p>
