The only point left open by that adjudication was the disputed compensation of the assignee. This has since been taken up by the auditor and disposed of. It is admitted that vouchers were presented for the credits claimed, and no evidence has been shown to us from which any inference can be drawn that the vouchers did not set forth fully the services rendered, or that the auditor was in error in any of his findings. After they have been fully considered and sustained by the court below they would not be disturbed here without convincing evidence of error.</p>
