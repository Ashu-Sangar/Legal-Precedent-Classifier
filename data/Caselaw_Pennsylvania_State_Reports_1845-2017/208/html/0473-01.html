Williams as partners had a contract with the defendant, the Meadow Brook Water Company, to construct a tunnel. In this work they used a large quantity of tools. Williams, desiring to be released from the contract, entered into an agreement with the defendant by which he turned over to the defendant the tools in consideration of release from the contract and bond. Williams took the paper to Fowler who signed it. Fowler claimed that his signature was procured when he was in the state of intoxication. There was no evidence, however, of fraud or duress. It did not appear that Fowler made any prompt effort to rescind the agreement, or to surrender the release, or carry out the original contract. Plaintiff presented these points :</p>

      <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>We think this was going too far. In Bush v.

    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[282,882,1181,710]]]'>In the present case the court was therefore in error in its instruction to the jury with regard to the effect of the intoxication of the plaintiff upon the validity of the contract. But in order to recover, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove not only that he was incapacitated by intoxication, when the contract was made which he now seeks to repudiate, but he must go further and show that he rescinded the agreement within a reasonable time after his recovery. The rule with regard to rescission is thus stated in 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency of Law, 84: “ Where a contract is sought to be rescinded by one of the parties thereto, he must place the other in statu quo. He will not be allowed to repudiate a contract and retain the benefit derived thereunder against equity and good conscience, but must return, or offer to return, such benefit.”</p>

    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[283,1965,1177,405]]]'>In the present case the consideration received by the plaintiff was a release in full for himself and his partner from the obligations of a prior contract under which he was liable to incur serious losses.

The plaintiff says he went to Mr. Scranton’s office to ask if he might resumé work. In reply the plaintiff states, “ He asked me if I didn’t understand my situation. I said, ‘ What situation ? ’ He said, ‘ Don’t you know that we have took the contract away from you? ’ I said, ‘No, sir.’ ‘ Well,’ he said, ‘ it is so, and jrou cannot go on with it.’ ‘ Well,’ I said, ‘ I cannot leave my tools there for you.’ He said, ‘ I dare you to take them away.’ Them is all th.e words.” We cannot gather from this the expression of any desire or willingness to restore the defendant company to the position in which it was prior to the execution of the agreement by which it gave up its bond of indemnity and cancelled the original contract and released the plaintiff and his partner from all liability for the further prosecution of the-work as required by the former agreement. The plaintiff cannot be allowed to retain the benefits of the release from his former contract and at the same time recover for himself the value of his interest in the tools and machinery which he had transferred by means of the second agreement, to the defendant company, as part of the consideration for that release.</p>
