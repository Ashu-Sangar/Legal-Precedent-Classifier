    <p id="b333-7" data-blocks='[["BL_333.10",333,[127,1190,1183,865]]]'>The court below has demonstrated the correctness of its judgment by unquestionable authority and the soundest reasoning. Whatever duties the state chooses for its own advantage to impose upon county officers for the collection of its revenue, it cannot so blend such duties with those they owe to the county as to make these duties indistinguishable. Primarily, the officer’s allegiance is owing to the county; the state may as a matter of convenience or economy use him for certain purposes of her own, but the question still is, is there a liability on the part of the county to the state to which the county through her officers must respond ? If so, in so responding the officer acts for the county and in that respect he is a county officer. It is wholly immaterial that at the further end of the line the state receives the answer and either accepts, modifies or rejects it, the officer acts throughout as a county officer and comes clearly under the provisions of the 5th section of the 14th article of the constitution and of the act of 1876.</p>

All through Judge Allison’s opinion in that case his reasoning is based on the clearly defined thought, that the state may “ lay hold of the treasurer of counties and make them its own officers,” by imposing upon them clearly separate and distinct duties from those of county treasurers and for the performance of such separate and distinct duties may provide for their special compensation. And the state did in that case provide a separate and distinct compensation which, it was held, the county treasurer was authorized to receive but which ivas wholly outside his salary as county treasurer. This was the whole scope of that decision. It was affirmed by this court in a per curiam opinion of less than three lines.</p>

While in nearly all the items on which the treasurer claimed commissions, such commissions were under the opinion in the case referred to properly allowable, there crept into the case a few items which were purely county fees and which should have been paid into the county treasury. As to these items the court below in the case before us well says :</p>

Either the parties were unconscious that the sources of the treasurer’s commissions were not all of one quality, or their eyes were fixed on the single point of the right of the treasurer to receive anything beyond his salary.”</blockquote>

Martin does and what it does not decide ; we hope this is the last time it will be urged upon our attention as holding that the fees of county officers can have any other destination than the county treasury.</p>

As to this the court says: “ In the matter of the personal property tax and the municipal loan tax the defendant was performing his simple duty as city treasurer to pay into the state treasury the money which the city was bound to pay.” We directly decided this point in Commonwealth v. Phila.

The purpose of the fundamental law was to so reduce this extravagant and burdensome compensation, that it would in some degree be measured by the capacity, work and responsibility of the officer. It is not without interest to note how persistent has been the effort to narrow the interpretation of this section. In Pierie v. Phila., <a href="/pa/139/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="139 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="11252359" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0573-01">139 Pa. 573</a>, on a claim by the recorder for fees in addition to his salary, it was held that the law fixed the salary of the officer at $12,000, which sum could not be exceeded on any pretense. In Commonwealth v. Grier, <a href="/pa/152/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="152 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="838097,838129" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0176-01,/pa/152/0176-02">152 Pa. 176</a>, it was argued that the district attorney was to be paid partly in salary and partly by fees; this court held he must be paid wholly by salary. In McCleary v.

The same ruling was made in Von Bonnhorst v. Allegheny County, and in McGunnegle v. Allegheny County, in the same volume. In Commonwealth v. Mann, Same v. Shields, and Same v. Latta, <a href="/pa/168/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="168 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="868554" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0290-01">168 Pa. 290</a>, it was decided that the act of 1876 to carry into effect the 14th article of the fifth section of the constitution was a substitute for all previous legislation on that subject; that thereafter, all county officers in counties having a population of over 150,000 must be paid by salaries and that they could lawfully receive nothing more. In Schuylkill Co. v. Pepper, <a href="/pa/182/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="182 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="893270" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0013-01">182 Pa. 13</a>, the county treasurer claimed fees ofi liquor licenses, because he had to divide the money realized among the different townships in such proportions as they were entitled thereto. This, the treasurer argued, was a township duty and he was entitled to additional compensation. We said no, he received the money as county treasurer and must pay it over as county treasurer and his compensation was his salary alone. In City of Pittsburg v. Anderson, <a href="/pa/194/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="194 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="912405" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0172-01">194 Pa. 172</a>, it was sought to rest the claim of the county treasurer for fees in liquor licenses on Phila. v.

    <p id="b337-7" data-blocks='[["BL_337.9",337,[143,1443,1181,977]],["BL_338.1",338,[283,353,1178,295]]]'>The second reason is also technical but insuperable. The city has shown no title to the money in the hands of the appellant. The tax was imposed by the state on the county, and it was held in Com. v. Philadelphia County, <a href="/pa/157/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="157 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="846595" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0531-01">157 Pa. 531</a>, that the treasurer acts on behalf of the county until actual payment into the state treasury so that the county is liable for the loss by embezzlement of its treasurer before such payment. By such payment, however, the money becomes the money of the state. Neither that case nor any other has held that it continues to be the money of the county after the latter has once discharged itself -of the tax by payment. Though under the law the state returns part of it to the county, yet it does so as a gratuity and on its own terms. It does not permit the county to retain its ultimate share from time to time on its collections, but requires the whole to be paid in full and then returns the county’s share. The legislature might at any time repeal the allowance of this' gratuity, without in any way affecting the status of the money up to and including its payment into the treasury. In settling therefore with the county treasurer <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>for his compensation after he has paid in the full amount, the state is making an allowance out of its own moneys, and it alone has any title to claim a repayment from him. If through illegal allowances to the treasurer the county receives less than its legal due, its only claim is against the state for a proper settlement.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[283,667,1178,807]]]'>But thirdly, waiving all technicalities, and on the broad ground of the substantial merits, the case is with the appellant.

The state may appoint its own agents to collect its own tax even though such agent be also for other purposes a municipal officer, and his duties as state agent will not necessarily blend, or become part of his duties as a city officer.” This was what the state did in the present case, and the effort to reach a contrary conclusion, however desirable the result may be on grounds of public policy, does not appear to me to rest on sound construction of tbe statute or the constitution.</p>
