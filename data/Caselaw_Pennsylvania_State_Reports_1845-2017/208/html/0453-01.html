To sustain this argument Penna. R. R. Co. v. Montgomery County Pass. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/167/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="167 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="866789" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0062-01">167 Pa. 62</a>; Dempster v.

We concede that inferentially under the legislation on which those cases are founded, or rather in the absence of legislation giving a right of eminent domain to the corporation, the argument here is sound, on the assumption that the acts of assembly are the same. But the legislation here is essentially different. The <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>express grant by the statute is to a corporation to supply light, heat and power by electricity to the public in the borough, town, city or district where it may be located and to such persons, partnerships and corporations residing therein or adjacent thereto as may desire the same. Then, by its charter Radnor township, Delaware county, is pointed out as its place of business or operation, with a principal office at Harrisburg. The public of Radnor township do desire the same, for it may be fairly assumed that the electric company would not invest its capital and make its improvements for those who did not want and would not use its product. The power to create a corporation within the terms of the act is unlimited ; it is restricted only by its purpose and it must designate the locality of its operations. Much significance in the argument is placed on the word “ district ” in the act as a word used in a restrictive sense. To give the word its common meaning it would unquestionably embrace a township as well as many other subdivisions of territory, although in its application it would in many cases include less territory than a township, such as an election district or a school district, but if no subdivision of the township be indicated it would point to a township as the district meant.</p>

Therefore, that its unlimited corporate power to manufacture or produce shall not be excluded from any territory of the state where it may be desired by the inhabitants or it may be advantageous to the corporation to locate its works, a descriptive word is used which is unlimited in its application as to territory except by the limitation placed upon it by the statute and charter. To narrow the meaning of the word district so as to include only subdivisions of boroughs and cities is a strained interpretation. If such had been the <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>intention of the legislature, it would have been wholly unnecessary to name any division other than boroughs or cities; but there are towns which are neither cities nor boroughs, and. districts both townships and less than townships. The act had accomplished its purpose in its descriptive words by covering all of them.</p>
    <p id="b487-3" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[138,679,1180,714]]]'>It is argued that the right of eminent domain is nowhere given in this act and that if conferred it must be by construction, which is in direct opposition to the authorities both in this country and in England. Our own leading case, Penna. R. R. Co. v. Canal Commissioners, <a href="/pa/21/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="21 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="411595" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0009-01">21 Pa. 9</a>, which is only in line with all the authorities on the subject holds that, “ Corporate powers can never be created by implication nor extended by construction.” As we have noticed, the corporate power to make or produce the light in the district specified by the statute and its certificate is unlimited ; it necessarily follows that this power to manufacture was given for purposes of distribution in the district where the corporate power was to be exercised; to exercise this power, a limited right of eminent domain at least, must be conferred, so these words follow:</p>
    <blockquote id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[137,1406,1178,350]]]'>“ Every such corporation shall have the authority to supply light, heat and power,” etc.,' “ and the power, also, to make, erect and maintain the necessary buildings, machinery and apparatus for supplying such light, heat and power, or any of them, and to distribute the same, with the right to enter upon any public street, lane, alley or highway for such purpose, to alter, inspect and repair its system of distribution.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.6",487,[135,1765,1178,563]]]'>It is difficult to see how the power thus conferred can be said.to be by implication or construction; true,'no power to actually take and appropriate land is given, but an additional servitude is imposed upon the land, a servitude additional to that of the turnpike company and this by express positive grant. It cannot be doubted that the legislature had the power to do this; that it did not authorize the taking of all it might have authorized in no way defeats the grant of a merely additional servitude. That the words “ right of eminent domain ” are not used is wholly immaterial. The power is conferred to the extent specified in apt language.</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.7",487,[136,2337,1174,94]],["BL_488.1",488,[300,372,1172,140]]]'>We are of opinion that appellee had the power of eminent domain to the extent it attempted to exercise it and that the <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>court below committed, no error in negativing appellants’ fourth and fifth conclusions of law. All the assignments of error are overruled and the decree is affirmed.</p>
