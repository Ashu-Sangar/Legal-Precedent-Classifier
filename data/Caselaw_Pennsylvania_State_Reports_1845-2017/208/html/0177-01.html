But in this present case the appellee who was called as for cross-examination testified that he understood that the appellant wanted the stocks in question purchased outright and that the appellant told him that he owned his saloon and house on Poplar street, and that consequently he had unlimited credit with the appellee. He further testified that he was always ready to deliver certificates of stock and that he was ready to deliver the certificates for the stocks so purchased at any time that he was called upon to do so. It is manifest that under such circumstances the mere intention of the appellant could not give the transaction a gambling character.</p>

Its name may possibly spring from the diminutive character of the operations there conducted. It may well be that nearly all of the transactions made there are of an understood wagering character and the definition that a “bucket shop ” is a place where wagers are made upon the fluctuations of the market price of stocks and grain or other commodities, as stated in Bryant v. Telegraph Company, 17 Fed. Repr. 828, may be correct, but a place should not necessarily stamp its character upon a particular transaction and especially should not in this case where the proof, coupled with a denial that the duebill was <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>given in a gambling transaction, was that the appellee was actually ready to deliver the stock purchased. A deduction that it was given in one of a gambling character simply because the appellee ran a “bucket shop ” has no substantial warrant and may aptly be characterized as extravagant. Clearly whether the appellee did or did not make returns to the United States government and pay a tax on a “ bucket shop ” was immaterial and irrelevant and the offer to prove the same was properly rejected by the court below.</p>
