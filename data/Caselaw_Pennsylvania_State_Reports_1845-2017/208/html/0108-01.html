Thus in regard to licenses to sell liquor, it was said in Pollard’s Petition, <a href="/pa/127/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="127 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="565764" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0507-01">127 Pa. 507</a> (522), “ the granting of wholesale licenses is a matter specially commited by act of assembly to the courts of quarter sessions.

And the rights of electors acting together as a party are equally beyond question. The electors themselves are the only tribunal to decide whether the principles, platform, aim or method of reaching the desired object, are broad enough, permanent enough or important enough to be the basis of united action as a party, and if they so decide, courts must recognize and treat them accordingly. The only province of the courts is to ascertain whether the parties before them are within the terms of the statute in regard' to the rights claimed. The provisions of the Act of June 10, 1893, sec. 2, P. L. 419, in regard to the question now before us are “ any convention of delegates or primary meeting of electors or caucus held under the rules of a political party or any board authorized to certify nominations representing a political party which at the election next preceding polled at least two per centum of the largest entire vote for any office cast in the state or in the electoral district or division for which such primary meeting caucus convention or board desires to make or certify nominations, may nominate one candidate for each office which is to be filled in the state or in the said district or division at the next ensuing election by causing a certificate of nomination to be drawn and filed as hereinafter provided.” Any combination or aggregation of electors with sufficient coherence and organization to have acted together for a common purpose, and sufficient strength and continuity to have polled two per centum of the highest vote at the next preceding election, is a political party within the statute, having the right to put nominations on the ballot by certificate. What the bond shall be which holds the combination together is exclusively within its own determination. It may be different principles from those of other political parties, a different object, or the same object by different means. These and all similar matters are outside the jurisdiction of the courts and rest exclusively on the will of the individual electors.</p>

If as Independents they polled the requisite vote in this county at <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>the last election, they are a separate party so far as the court is concerned, to mate nominations for a county election. It is not necessary that the object of the party should be broad enough to apply to the whole state, or that it should have polled a vote in the whole state. If they proposed to nominate for a state office the rule would be different, for the statute makes the test, the vote in “ the state or in the electoral district or division for which such .... convention desires to make nominations.” They may therefore call themselves and act as Independents in this county and as Democrats through the rest of the state. So far as the court is concerned they may form a party within a partjq or may be a branch or wing or section or faction of one party and yet have a separate standing of their own in the district where they have polled the requisite vote as such. No doubt the court for certainty and the avoidance of confusion may require a .distinctive name whenever a distinctive right is claimed but no such question arises in this case. Whether such assertion of individual liberty and such separate party action for municipal purposes while adhering to Democratic national policy is so great a departure from Democratic principles, practice and discipline as to forfeit the right to act as an' integral part of the Democratic party in convention on state or national matters will be for the majority of that party to decide when the question arises.

It is that the so-called Independence party did not poll two per centum of the largest vote “ in the electoral district and division of the state of Pennsylvania known as the city of Philadelphia at the election next preceding,” etc. In the original paper filed of record the expression first used was “known as the city and county of Philadelphia,” but the words “and county” were struck out before filing. It is now explained that this was intended to limit the denial of the requisite vote to that cast at the last preceding municipal election, and it is conceded that the party did not cast such vote at the municipal election in February, 1903, but.did so at the general election in November, 1903. This fully met the requirements of the statute. The language is “ at the election next preceding.” This means exactly what <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>is says, the last election without qualification whether municipal or general.
