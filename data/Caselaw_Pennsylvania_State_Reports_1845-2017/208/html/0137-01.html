But the proceeding is unusual, and it does not appear that there is public necessity for special haste. The parties for whom it is charged that improper bail was received, were discharged from custody by the quashing of the indictments against them. No injury was done therefore to the public or to the cause of justice in those particular cases, though the practice as to the taking of bail in the manner charged is one requiring investigation. The present proceeding against the magistrate was begun only on November 28 last passed, and being unusual and unfamiliar he is entitled to a reasonable time to prepare for trial. The newspaper clamor on the subject is in itself a sufficient reason why the trial should not be hurried out of its due and regular course. It is proper, therefore, that the rule should be made a temporary supersedeas.</p>

A strong prima facie case was made out by the petitioner on each of these grounds. The facts were not seriously contested by the commonwealth, though the inferences drawn by the petitioner were denied. It is not <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>now necessary, however, to go into any discussion of the evidence. The petitioner’s argument on this rule admits that he has now had sufficient time for preparation, and that the popular prejudice from the newspaper discussion has subsided. No present reason is shown, therefore, why the cases should not proceed in the regular course in the court where they are pending.</p>
