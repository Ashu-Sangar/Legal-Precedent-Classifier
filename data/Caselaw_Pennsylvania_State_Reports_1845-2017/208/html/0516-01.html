The jury will take that into consideration, coupled with this fact, that the option to purchase the Safe Harbor Match Company was at a price to be determined by an examination of the books, said price not to exceed the actual cash paid into said company, the option to cover a period of six months, and the parties to agree to control the balance of the stock, and also that during the period of the option the second party should have the entire output of the Safe Harbor Match factory at the factory cost. In other words he was to sell at the expiration of six months, if Mr. Eaton wanted to buy at a price, not larger than the amount of the cash put in and he was to sell all his goods at factory prices, and it is for you to say' whether a man could lose anything if he sold for what it cost and if he was paid the price of his manufacture and whether that could be a consideration for the payment of $200,000 under the other circumstances which are in evidence before you.] [12]</p>

Synnott testifies that they were to receive but $30,000. The figures of Cummings, however, are accepted as correct by Graham in fixing the amount of his claim. Cummings also testifies that Synnott had agreed to give two other persons a certain amount of stock, but we need not consider this in the present controversy. If Synnott failed to keep his promise, the controversy will be between him and those with whom he is alleged to have contracted.</p>

This proceeding was instituted by Graham to recover from Cummings his proportionate share of it, on the ground that Cummings had received it as the agent for all the stockholders. The claim is for one fourth of the amount received by Cummings less 11/200, or $11,000, which is the amount Cummings may owe the four stockholders who had agreed to serve as directors. The stock of the Atlantic Match Company which they were to receive was never issued to them. They did, however, receive their proportionate shares of the stock of the National Match Company.

He insists that he was acting for himself alone and negotiating only for the sale of his stock. The agreement to pay him $200,000 is conceded by him to have been a secret one, so far as Synnott and Graham were concerned, and he .contradicts the statement of -Synnott-that the latter suggested he should ask .Eaton for $200,000 in cash in addition to the-offer of stock of the National Match Company, that they should be directors in that com<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>pany, and that the contract should he guaranteed by it. His testimony is, that from the beginning to the end of the negotiations, Synnott never said anything about cash. Without reciting his testimony, corroborated in material matters by Eaton, it is sufficient to say that, if the jury had believed them, there ought to have been a finding that he was not agent for Synnott and Graham in making the sale of the stock, and, under the court’s instructions, the verdict ought to have been in his favor. The verdict having been against him, the finding as to his agency must have been against him, notwithstanding all to which he and Eaton had testified. They both testified that he had not acted as agent for Synnott and Graham, and, unless the jury found that he had, a verdict could not, under the instructions given, have been returned for the plaintiff. In his charge the learned trial judge clearly and distinctly stated that it was the right of Cummings to sell his own holdings for whatever price he might be able to get for them, and that, if he acted only in his own behalf and for his own advantage, as he testified, be had a right to retain the $200,000; and the jury were further told that, unless they found be had acted for Synnott and Graham as well as for himself when he procured the promise to pay him the money, which he admittedly received, plaintiff was entitled to no portion of it. The question of fact became a very narrow one, and that there was ample evidence to justify the finding reached, that the appellant had acted as agent for the appellee and Synnott, is very clear.</p>

Cummings and Synnott then separated, to meet again on the following Tuesday, July 28. On July 19, the day after Synnott says he and Cummings had discussed the counter-proposition to be submitted to Eaton, Cummings and Eaton met, and the memorandum of agreement, by the terms of which Cummings was to receive $200,000, was initialed by them. By its terms Cummings agreed to sell, not his, but the entire capital stock of <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>the Atlantic Match Company, in consideration of $500,000 of the preferred stock of the National Match Company and $250,000 of the common stock and $200,000 in cash in addition- — -the very sum named by Synnott as the one he and Cummings had agreed they would ask to be paid to them in cash. The further consideration spoken of by Synnott appears, that he and Cummings should be elected directors of the new company. Cummings .met Synnott on Tuesday, July 23, but made no mention, as he admits, of the agreement of July 19. If there were nothing more in the case, it is hardly conceivable that Synnott’s testimony as to what occurred between him and Cummings on July 18 could be discredited, and, if not, the’ conclusion would be irresistible that Cummings, on the 19th, had acted not only for himself, but for Synnott and Graham as well. When they met on July 23, Cummings not only said nothing to Synnott about the agreement of July 19, but, according to the testimony of the latter, said Eaton would not pay any cash. Synnott then saw Graham and, having got his authority to act for him, authorized Cummings to make the deal upon the basis of the proposition of July 18, if he could do no better; thereupon the first agreement of July 23, between Eaton, Synnott and Cummings, was executed. On the same day Eaton and Cummings executed the other agreement, admittedly concealed from Synnott, by which Cummings was to be paid $200,000. It is true, in consideration of one dollar, Cummings “ further ” agreed that Eaton should have the option to purchase the interest of Cummings in the Safe Harbor Match Company, and that, for six months, he should have the entire output of that factory at the factory cost of goods.</p>

As he was thus entitled to his proportionate part of this stock he was admittedly to get, by the separate agreement, $200,000 more than either of the other two. As to the provision in the agreement of July 23, relating to the Safe Harbor Company, the court said, in answer to the twelfth point submitted by the defendant: “ If the jury believe that <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>Mr. Cummings, acting in perfect good faith with the other two gentlemen, and if they believe he, while so acting, gave another consideration which, added to the stock, made it worth $200,000 more than the other two gentlemen got for their stock, then, if that consideration were a valid one, he should have credit for it. If, on the other hand, the jury find that the consideration was simply the transfer of the stock, and that the introduction into the agreement of the Safe Harbor Company was only an invention to cover up a fraudulent transaction, then it can have no bearing upon the verdict which will be found by the jury.” Of this the defendant cannot complain, for the court allowed the jury to take into consideration this agreement as to the Safe Harbor Company in determining whether or not Cummings was acting for himself alone or for the other two stockholders. If, as he now contends, the court ought to have passed upon the question whether the agreement as to the Safe Harbor Company was a separate and independent covenant, supported by the separate consideration of $1.00, error would not have been committed, if the court had read the agreement just as it is written — $200,000 in consideration for the stock and $1.00 as the consideration for the covenant as to the Safe Harbor factory. Each receipt given by Cummings for the three instalments of the $200,000 is on account of the contract covering the sale of the Atlantic Match Company, and makes absolutely no reference to anything else. They could well be regarded by the jury as -evidence of what the real agreement between the parties was, viz.: that the $200,000 was for the stock alone.</p>

The cause of action, as set forth in plaintiff’s statement, and. as submitted to the jury under the evidence, was the indebtedness of Cummings to the plaintiff for money had and received by him for the use of the latter. On that issue the plaintiff was entitled to recover, if he could sustain his allegation ; if he could not, the money in the hands of Cummings was his own. But it is further contended that, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover any portion of the $200,000, his remedy is by a bill in equity for an accounting.</p>

Here there is no complicated account. There is nothing for which the plaintiff must account to the defendant, and there is but a single item in his hands for which he is to account to those owning the fund with him. The only accounting that is involved is unilateral. No discovery is necessary, for everything is known that the plaintiff needs to know, and there was no such trust relation between Cummings and Synnott and Graham as required an accounting under the decree of a chancellor. Where accounts are all on one side, and no discovery is sought or needed, courts of equity will not take jurisdiction of the cause : Gloninger v.

    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[139,549,1179,658]]]'>The question of the waiver by the plaintiff of a tort committed by Cummings against him and Synnott jointly is not involved in this proceeding. It may be that the attachment ought not to have issued, but defendant withdrew his motion to, dissolve it, and the case proceeded and was treated by both parties as an action of assumpsit. It is for the recovery of a debt alleged to be due by the defendant to the plaintiff, and the affidavit upon which the attachment issued so states. True, there is an allegation that it had been fraudulently contracted, but, for that reason, assumpsit is no less the appropriate remedy for its collection. The act of 1869, P. L. 8, providing for an attachment, is only for the collection of debts.</p>

The appellant contends that the transaction, if for the benefit of all the stockholders of the corporation, as the plaintiff insists, was a joint transaction for the benefit of all, and that, if Cummings is liable at all, he is liable to account to all the stockholders jointly. If the contract between Cummings, Graham and Synnott, on the one hand, and the purchaser, on the other, was a joint contract, and if one of the terms of that contract had been, in addition to the exchange of stock, the payment of the sum of 8200,000 to- Cummings, Graham and Synnott jointly, the obligation of the purchaser to them would have been to them jointly; but this is not the case. The 8200,000 formed no part of the consideration set forth in the contract.- It was paid and received by Cummings alone, who neither promised nor intended to pay any portion of it to any of the other stockholders. If, however, he was acting as their agent in making the sale, he cannot retain what was paid him. “ All profits made and advantage gained by the agent in the execution of the agency belong to the principal. And it matters not whether such profit or advantage be the result of the performance or of the violation of the <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>duty of the agent. If his' duty be strictly performed, the resulting profit accrues to the principal as the legitimate consequence of the relation ; if profit accrues from his violation of duty, that likewise belongs to the principal, not only because the principal has to assume the responsibility of the transaction, but also because the agent cannot be permitted to derive advantage from his own default. It is only by rigid adherence to this rule that all temptation can be removed from one acting in a fiduciary capacity, to abuse his trust or seek his own advantage in the position which it affords him: ” Mechem on Agency, sec. 469. An agent cannot make profits out of his principal in the business of the agency: Simons v. Vulcan Oil, etc., Co., <a href="/pa/61/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="61 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="428583" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0202-01">61 Pa. 202</a>. “ There is no doubt where a duty arises out of an implied undertaking to do an act requiring skill or fidelity, that a breach of the duty may be the subject of an action of assumpsit upon the implied promise, or an action upon the special case for the tort: ” Reeside v. Reeside, <a href="/pa/49/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="49 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="998530" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0322-01">49 Pa. 322</a>.</p>

In such a case there is not a contract, and the obligation arises ex lege: ” Milford v. Commonwealth, <a href="/mass/144/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="144 Mass. 64" data-case-ids="774248" data-case-paths="/mass/144/0064-01">144 Mass. 64</a>. <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> There are express, implied and constructive contracts. A constructive contract is where, as 'here, duty defines it, instead of the contract defining the duty to be performed. Constructive contracts are fictions of law adopted to enforce the legal duties by actions of contract where no proper contract exists, express or implied: Hertzog v. Hertzog, <a href="/pa/29/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="29 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="982930" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0465-01">29 Pa. 465</a>. Here, the duty of Cummings was to pay to his principals what he had received for them. He received the $200,000 not only for Graham and Synnott, but for himself as well. On what principle can it be contended that, after deducting his own share, as he would- have a right to do, he owes the balance of it to the other two stockholders <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>jointly? He did not <em>owe </em>the full sum of $200,000 to them jointly, and-they could show no joint title to the same: hence they could not join in an action to recover. Just as each one was entitled to receive his proportionate share of the stock given in exchange, so thei’e is the right of each to receive his proportionate share of the money received for his use. The obligation of Cummings being a legal one, growing out of his relation to the several stockholders, who did not own their shares of stock jointly, but severally, and who had not turned jointly over to him their shares of stock and authorized him to sell or exchange them, his duty to account to them for whatever he may have received for them is to them severally, and not jointly. Having discovered no error in this record, we cannot disturb the judgment.</p>
