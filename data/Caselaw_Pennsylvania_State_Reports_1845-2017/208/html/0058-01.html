Thus gifts expressed to be “ for the distribution of good books among poor people in the back parts of Pennsylvania : ” Pickering v.

If this be sufficient to show charitable purpose and create valid charities, surely Dr. Daly’s gift for the “ endowment, founding, establishment and maintenance of a home or homes for industrious girls and women without regard to age or sect ” must be regarded in the same light.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[286,1018,1178,297]]]'>The objection made to this view, that because Dr. Daly’s scheme contemplated the inmates of the home shall pay “ the lowest possible cost for shelter, instruction,” etc., overlooks the fact that they are beneficiaries, not only of reduced cost, but the absolute enjoyment of the large estate, which is the foundation of the charity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b92-6" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[283,1323,1179,665]]]'>It must, of course, be conceded that if profit had been in contemplation the objection would have been well taken; but the terms of the gift excluded this idea, and it is too well settled to admit of doubt that a gift does not lose its character of charity simply because the scheme of management contemplated revenue from the recipients of its bounty, sufficient to keep it in operation: Episcopal Academy v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/150/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="150 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="834426" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0565-01">150 Pa. 565</a>; Price v.

The rule that to raise a valid trust there must be sufficient words, a definite subject and a certain object has its exception in charitable uses of which uncertainty and indefiniteness of object are characteristic: Bispham’s Equity, sec. 116. The act of 1855, re-enacted in 1895, expressly declares that no disposition of property made for charitable use shall .fail “ by reason of the objects being in<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>definite ” or “ uncertain.” They are necessarily indefinite and uncertain because they apply to a .class with whom it is optional to claim or refuse the proffered bounty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[140,513,1178,561]]]'>Nor is the objection that there was no trustee in existence, when Dr. Daly died, competent to take. The direction that his “ executors and trustees ” should “ forthwith ” obtain a “ proper charter ” impliedly made them trustees for the purpose of formal organization of the charity and vested the estate in them, until that had been accomplished. But even assuming that duty had not been imposed upon them, this court would have been required by the mandate of the act of 1855 to prevent failure of the-“use” by supplying a trustee and carrying,out the testator’s intent so far as consistent with law and equity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b93-6" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[139,1083,1179,816]]]'>Thus where a bequest was made to a person or corporation incapable of taking, the court appointed a trustee to carry out the trust: Frazier v. St. Luke’s Church, <a href="/pa/147/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="147 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="829769" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0256-01">147 Pa. 256</a>. So where there was a bequest “ to the trustees of such free library which may be established in the-city of Philadelphia,” it was held that the fund was properly given to such library established after the administrator’s death: Pepper’s Estate, <a href="/pa/154/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="154 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="842423" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0331-01">154 Pa. 331</a>.

The organization of the Infidel Society, which was intended to act as trustee, was made dependent on the option of strangers who might never organize; no duty was imposed on the executors in the matter, and the power was therefore too remote; while here Dr. Daly having imposed the duty of immediate action, the executors were made-the link between him and incorporation.</p>

By the provisions of the tenth section of the act of assembly, passed April 25, 1855, this rule is impliedly recognized, and a remedy enacted for future cases in which the donor and testator has omitted to vest such a discretion in a trustee or trustees,” by making it the duty of <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>the orphans’ court to supply a trustee and carry out the don- or’s intent so far as consistent with law and equity. But even under the old rule the power to act at discretion in the administration of a charity need not have been expressly given for it could be implied from the nature of the trust, Pickering v. Shotwell, <a href="/pa/10/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="10 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="962665" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0023-01">10 Pa. 23</a>, and here there was a very large discretion implied in respect of the buildings and management of the Home.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[259,763,1195,1636]]]'>There is no apparent reason why at least the main features of Dr. Daly’s scheme should not be carried out. There exists the encouragement of successful issue of many similar schemes. Even assuming there will be no voluntary contributions, this is but a secondary intent which may not defeat the main scheme: Manners v. Phila. Library Co., <a href="/pa/93/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="93 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="442101" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0165-01">93 Pa. 165</a>. In any event, all of those who fill the description of intended beneficiaries could not be accommodated. Even charitable institutions of the largest endowments are unable to meet all the demands made upon .them; and yet forfeiture of their powers would be a public calamity. -Dr. Daly’s estate is of itself large enough to afford a commodious home; and no one can doubt that there are many “ industrious girls and women ” who would be glad to avail themselves of its advantages. Some of the suggestions, and they are not more than suggestions made by Dr. Daly, which may now seem impracticable, may prove the reverse. Dr. Daly had ample opportunities of observation, and must be given the credit of having studied the subject carefully. His scheme should not be smothered in mere speculation, but be given a fair trial. Even if some of his suggestions as to management should prove impracticable, it is not at all likely -that there will be enough to seriously cripple the administration. Assuming that the whole scheme of management should fail, the charitable use will not be permitted to fail. Charities have always been favorites of the law in Pennsylvania, and the act of 1855 provides remedies which seem to make it impossible: that any charity should fail through defects in the scheme of management. If the power of the courts under existing law to give relief be “ exceeded,” the legislature has reserved the power to turn the trust fund over to “public use.” Once therefore establish the use, and the next of kin can have no. further concern in. the matter. . , ,</p>
