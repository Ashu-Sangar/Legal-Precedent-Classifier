The words used are not the land or building, but “ the use of the premises occupied by me.” He meant merely to limit and locate the premises “ occupied by ” him. “ Occupied” implies actual possession, not constructive possession. This limitation must stand as it was, true or false, at the time it was made. If the testator did not occupy the part in the tenure of the bank at the time he made his will, though he might afterwards have acquired the actual possession of it, yet it would not pass under the will.
