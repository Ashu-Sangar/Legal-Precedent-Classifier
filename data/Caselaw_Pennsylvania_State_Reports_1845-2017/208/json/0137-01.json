A strong prima facie case was made out by the petitioner on each of these grounds. The facts were not seriously contested by the commonwealth, though the inferences drawn by the petitioner were denied. It is not now necessary, however, to go into any discussion of the evidence. The petitioner\u2019s argument on this rule admits that he has now had sufficient time for preparation, and that the popular prejudice from the newspaper discussion has subsided. No present reason is shown, therefore, why the cases should not proceed in the regular course in the court where they are pending.\nRule discharged.",

Fletcher.\nCriminal law \u2014 Buie for certiorari \u2014 Discharge of rule \u2014 Practice, Supreme Court.\nWhere the Supreme Court lias granted a rule for a certiorari to the quarter sessions on the ground of shortness of time allowed the defendant to meet unusual proceedings by information against him, and also on account of the excitement of the public mind caused by newspaper comment, but it appears that at the time the rule is heard conditions have changed, so that the defendant is no longer at a disadvantage, th\u00e9 court will discharge the rule.\nRule to show cause why certiorari should not issue to the quarter sessions of Philadelphia county. Miscellaneous docket 2, No. 24.\nIn granting the rule on December 2, 1908, Chief Justice Mitchell said :\nThe regular and orderly proceeding in criminal cases is by. indictment before the grand jury. The constitution expressly declares that no person shall for any indictable offense be proceeded against criminally by information, except in certain' specified eases, one of which is misdemeanor in office.\nThe present proceeding is for one of the excepted cases,-and it must be assumed that it is justified by the evidence before the court, though that is a disputed question which remains to be settled. But the proceeding is unusual, and it does not appear that there is public necessity for special haste. The parties for whom it is charged that improper bail was received, were discharged from custody by the quashing of the indictments against them. No injury was done therefore to the public or to the cause of justice in those particular cases, though the practice as to the taking of bail in the manner charged is one requiring investigation. The present proceeding against the magistrate was begun only on November 28 last passed, and being unusual and unfamiliar he is entitled to a reasonable time to prepare for trial. The newspaper clamor on the subject is in itself a sufficient reason why the trial should not be hurried out of its due and regular course. It is proper, therefore, that the rule should be made a temporary supersedeas.\nRule to show cause granted.\nMaxwell Stevenson, William, W. Porter and John II. How, for the rule.\nJohn O. Bell, district attorney, contra.\nFebruary 1, 1904:"
