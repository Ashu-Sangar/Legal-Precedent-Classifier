    "head_matter": "Handley\u2019s Estate.\nWill \u2014 Life estate \u2014 Devise.\nWhere a testator gives to his housekeeper \u201cfor and during her natural life, the use of the premises occupied by me, together with the use of all the furniture and fixtures now in and upon such premises free of charge,\u201d and it appears that at the time of the testator\u2019s death a portion of the premises referred to in his will were occupied by him as a residence, and a portion occupied by a bank as a tenant paying a money rental, the will will be construed as giving to the housekeeper the use for life of the portion of the premises occupied by testator, and not an estate for life in the whole property.\nArgued Feb. 23, 1904.\nAppeal, No. 18, Jan. T., 1904, by Annie Hafey, from decree of O. C. Lackawanna Co., Series A, No. 692, dismissing petition for citation in estate of John Handley, deceased.\nBefore Dean, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Thompson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for citation.\nSando, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThe petitioner claims that she is a life tenant of the property, known as 420 Lackawanna avenue, in the city of Scranton, and as such is entitled to the use and occupancy of the whole.\nJudge Handley died on February 15, 1895, testate, the city of Scranton being at the time of his death his place of residence. By virtue of the will the estate of the testator, real and personal, is under the management and control of his executors and their successors.\nThe validity of the petitioner\u2019s contention must depend on the intention of the testator, under the provisions of whose will she claims. The words of the will to be construed are:\n\u201c Item. I give and bequeath to Annie Hafey, my faithful housekeeper, for and during her natural life, the use of the premises occupied by me, Situated at No. 420 Lackawanna avenue, Scranton, Pennsylvania, together with the use of all the furniture and fixtures now in and upon said premises free of charge and in addition thereto I hereby bequeath her the sum of five thousand dollars, and I direct my executors to pay the said Annie Hafey the sum of one thousand dollars per year for and during her natural life, said annual sum to be paid monthly on the first day of each month.\u201d\nThe building, No. 420, Lackawanna avenue, was occupied by the testator as a dwelling house and law office, and by the Merchants\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank. The bank occupied on the first floor, the large bank room, bank vault, together with the use of the room in the rear for the directors or the officials to transact the business of the bank, and the use also of one coal vault in the front. Judge Handley occupied a portion of the cellar, the hall and rear room on the first floor; and the second, third and fourth floors for dwelling purposes.\nAfter Judge Handley died, the bank continued to occupy the part of the building leased and used for banking purposes; the executors collected and distributed the rents, as by the will directed; and the petitioner occupied the part used by testator before his death and used the furniture and fixtures until August 4,1900, when the building was demolished by an explosion, the cause unknown.\nThe testator\u2019s executors have from the date of his death, until August 4,1900, collected the rents from the bank, and in their annual account, have credited the same among the assets of the estate.\nThe petitioner claims, under the provisions of the will, a life estate in the -land and building, and the rents heretofore collected by the executors from the Merchants\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank, the tenant occupying the building before it was destroyed, and also any rents which may' be hereafter collected, and for use and occupancy.\nIn Hunter\u2019s Estate, 6 Pa. 106, Coulter, J., says:\n\u201c If anything is distinctly and authoritatively settled in our law, it is, that in the construction of wills the intent of the testator, collected from the words and language of the whole will, must be the guide to legal conclusion, and the governing principle of judgment. The intent must therefore be gathered from the words of the will, as such words are understood and accepted by the common mind.\u201d Again he says:\n\u201c It is true, that in cases where the courts have established a construction upon a given collocation of words, such decision would be entitled to great respect and consideration, where words of similar collocation, and like import, occurred in another will; but it would only be regarded as a key and help to the true construction. Shades of difference, will always occur, and therefore, as absolute authority, cases are of little authority in the true construction of testamentary dispositions by will.\u201d\nWills must be conformable to the rules of law; but this is not and cannot be applied to the construction of words; it relates to the nature and extent of the estate or interest granted; Bagshaw v. Spencer, 2 Atk. 577.\nThe plain and unambiguous words of the will must prevail and cannot be controlled or qualified by any conjectural or doubtful constructions growing out of the situation, circumstances or condition of the testator, his property or the natural objects of his bounty: Schouler on Wills, 520.\nAll things being equal, the natural and literal import of words and phrases is presumed to have been intended; each word is to have its effect, if the general intent be not thwarted thereby: Schouler on Wills, 529.\nThe inconvenience or absurdity of a devise is no ground for varying the construction, where the terms of it are unambiguous ; nor is the fact, that the testator did not foresee all the consequences of his disposition a reason for varying it: 3 Jar-man on Wills, 706.\nThe first thing is to ascertain what the object of the testator is ; the next, whether it is such as the rules of law and equity admit. This is the substance of the common sense and the law on the subject.\nIn the present case, what was the true intent of the testator, according to the common acceptation and meaning of the words which he uses for the purpose of expressing that intent ?\nThe petitioner is described as the testator\u2019s faithful housekeeper. It was the testator\u2019s intention to provide her with a home at the place where she then lived, with the furniture and fixtures to make her comfortable. His bequest of $1,000 a year was for maintenance and the bequest of $5,000 was for emergencies. If he had intended she should have in addition the rent received from the bank, he would have said so. In this case there seems to be no ambiguity latent or patent.\nThe intention of the testator was to give the petitioner, \u201c for and during her natural life, the use of the premises occupied by \u201d him \u201c situated at 420 Lackawanna avenue,\u201d and not an estate for life.\nIf he had intended to give the whole property the language would have been \u201c I give and bequeath to Annie Hafey, my faithful housekeeper, for and during her natural life the use of the premises, situated at 420 Lackawanna avenue, together with the use of all the furniture and fixtures now in and upon said premises.\u201d\nThat he did not intend to give the whole is very clear because the gift is limited to \u201c the premises occupied by me.\u201d Either these words must be expunged from the will, or they must be given their full weight.\nWhat then were the premises occupied by the testator ? He certainly did not occupy that portion of the building used by the bank. The possession of that portion of the building was not in him but in the bank. The occupancy was not in him. When he used the words of limitation, it was with some purpose. Had he intended otherwise, he would have said so.\nThe subject of the gift is described as \u201cthe use of the premises,\u201d and the premises are defined by the phrase \u201c occupied by me,\u201d and \u201csituated at 420 Lackawanna avenue.\u201d\nThe estate given to the petitioner is expressly limited to an estate for life in the premises \u201c occupied by me,\u201d and we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the intention was that she should take only an estate for life, in the part or portion occupied by the testator.\nThe testator has used apt and explicit words of limitation to express his intention. If he had intended to give a life estate in the whole building he would have expressed that intention by the use of equally apt and explicit words and terms.\nBy the terms of the will the petitioner took an estate for life in the \u201c premises \u201d occupied by the testator. The estate in the premises cannot be enlarged to an estate for life in the entire property, 420 Lackawanna avenue.\nThe words \u201c the use of the premises \u201d and \u201c occupied by me\u201d are expressive of the purpose for which the testator desired the property to be used and are explanatory of his bounty, and clearly express a restrictive condition or stipulation that cannot be construed in any other way.\nA larger estate will not be implied where a smaller one is expressly granted: Schouler on Wills, 682.\nThe most comprehensive words of description applicable to real estate are tenements and hereditaments, as they include every species of realty, as well corporeal as incorporeal. The word \u201clands\u201d is not equally extensive; it would not comprehend incorporeal hereditaments: 2 Jarman on Wills, 382.\nThe word \u201cpremises,\u201d which literally denotes that which-is already stated, should depend for its breadth upon the expression to which it refers: Schouler on Wills, 553.\nA devise of the house \u201c now occupied by me,\u201d or my house lot will not include adjoining property occupied by tenants: Brown v. Saltonstall, 44 Mass. 423. .\nIn Doe v. Parkin, 5 Taunt. 321, and 1 Marsh. 61, the testator devised in these words: \u201c All my messuages in T., now in my occupation.\u201d The testator had two messuages in T., of which he occupied only one; and it was held that only one passed by the devise.\nIn the present case the words of the bequest are clear and entirely sufficient to control their obvious meaning. In no sense could the testator be considered to have the occupation of that part of the building in the tenure of the bank. What the testator did occupy was certain. There is no ambiguity in the will itself. The intention and the language are both clear. The words used are not the land or building, but \u201c the use of the premises occupied by me.\u201d He meant merely to limit and locate the premises \u201c occupied by \u201d him. \u201c Occupied\u201d implies actual possession, not constructive possession. This limitation must stand as it was, true or false, at the time it was made. If the testator did not occupy the part in the tenure of the bank at the time he made his will, though he might afterwards have acquired the actual possession of it, yet it would not pass under the will. The lease to the bank was for rent reserved in money. Had Judge Handley entered without leave of the tenant, he would have been liable as a trespasser.\nThe word \u201c occupied \u201d has a legal meaning. It is where possession and management is in a person.\nThe bank, therefore, and not the testator, must be considered as in possession and occupation of such part of the building in question as was described in its lease.\nThe application of the words to the proper subject of the bequest support the inference that the testator meant to give a life estate in the \u201c premises occupied by \u201d him, and not in the entire building.\nThe term \u201c occupied \u201d both in a popular and legal acceptation, has a known, certain and definite meaning. It cannot be said that any person occupies a building which is in the tenure, actual possession and management of another. The term, in legal acceptation, implies use and possession. We must understand the \u201c premises occupied by me \u201d as used in the common and popular sense, according to which the part of the building in possession of the bank was separate and distinct from that occupied by the testator.\nThere is no question, whether the testator was in point of fact, in the actual possession of the part used by the bank, at the time of making his will, or at the time of his death.'\nWe are asked to say that the premises in the occupation of the testator meant also the part in the occupation of the bank as a tenant. It would be requiring us to understand more by the phrase \u201c premises occupied by me \u201d than the ordinary or legal sense would warrant. It would be extending it to a part in the possession of another. The phraseology of the bequest shows that the testator intended to limit it to that of which he himself was then in possession.\nBy applying the bequest to the premises in the actual possession of the testator, there would be harmony and consistency between the thing and the subject, and every part of the description. The incongruity would be created by applying the bequest of the premises, which were in the possession of the bank. The convenient enjoyment and use of the premises devised show no necessity for the part used by the bank.\nThere can be no doubt that the only subject in the mind of the testator, when he made the gift, was \u201c the use of the premises occupied by\u201d him as it then was and always had been, and that he intended to give the petitioner the use of the premises, \u201c together with the use of all the furniture and fixtures now in and upon said premises free of charge,\u201d and that he did not intend to include in the gift a life estate in the building situate at 420 Lackawanna avenue. The word \u201cnow\u201d seems to be used emphatically, so as to leave no possible doubt as to the identity of the thing devised.\nIn Wusthoff v. Dracourt, 3 Watts, 240, the Supreme. Court construed a devise of a house, in which the testator said, \u201c reserving, however, two of the rooms of said house for the use and during the life of W. I devise by this fourth article, that the widow W. may have the choice of those two rooms which shall best suit her, because I desire that the said W. should be sure of a shelter during the time she may have to live.\u201d This reservation, the court says, vests in W. an estate in the two rooms for life, of which she may make any disposition. It does not create a mere easement for her personal use ; she might occupy it herself, or let it to another, receiving from it the rent it produces.\nWe think we perceive the clear intent of the testator manifested in the whole, and every provision of the will taken together, and that is the light we have followed in arriving at the conclusions we adopt.\n'The intention of the testator was to give Annie Hafey, the petitioner, the use for life of the premises occupied by him \u201c situate at \u201d No. 420 Lackawanna avenue, and not an estate for life in the whole property.\nEntertaining' these views we hold that the petitioner is not entitled to the specific relief prayed for and her petition is therefore dismissed.\nError assigned was the decree dismissing the petition.\nS. B. Price, with him II. A. Fuller, for appellant.\nL. A. Watres and II W. Palmer, for appellee, were not heard.\nMarch 7, 1904:"
