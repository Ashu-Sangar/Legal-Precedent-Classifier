        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Dean,\nSimon Y. Fenton died intestate October 10,1871, the owner of a farm of about sixty-six acres in Bucks county, leaving a widow, Ann L. Fenton, and four children, Elizabeth, Joseph T., Maria, a lunatic, and John C. The farm descended to the widow and children under the intestate laws, and they agreed to sell it to one of the sons, John C., and petitioned the orphans\u2019 court for leave to join with the committee of Maria, a lunatic, in a sale to him. Whereupon the court appointed an auditor to report upon the facts. He reported that the widow and children had agreed to sell the farm to John C. for the sum of $10,000, in which was included the widow\u2019s dower to remain secured upon the premises. Whereupon the court approved the report and confirmed the sale; the widow and all the children, except John C., then joined in a conveyance to him of the farm by deed of April 1, 1892; on the same day John C. executed a mortgage upon the farm to Pierson Mitchell, administrator of Simon V. Fenton, the ancestor, conditioned for the payment of $3,333.33 at the death of the widow, Ann L., to said administrator, with interest on said sum to be paid annually to the widow, the payment being specified as part of the purchase money of the farm.\nOn May 6, 1893, John C., the purchaser, executed a second mortgage to Daniel Dewees on the farm for the payment of $2,000, in one year, which Dewees assigned to Theodore Cornell, this appellant, who on default of payment had the farm sold subject to lien of the first mortgage and became the purchaser. Ann L. Fenton, the widow, died October 24, 1902, when by the terms of the mortgage it became payable ; Mitchell, the mortgagee, having died, the court appointed Joseph T. Fen-ton trustee to collect the same, who obtained judgment for the full amount, $3,643.33 debt and interest.\nAt the trial of the scire facias on the mortgage to secure the widow\u2019s dower interest in the land the court directed a verdict for the full amount in favor of the trustee, reserving the question as to whether the amount of John C. Fenton\u2019s interest in the mortgage had merged with his interest in the land as a purchaser, and therefore the amount of the judgment should be reduced by the amount so merged. Afterwards the court entered judgment on the point reserved in favor of plaintiff and we have this appeal by Cornell, the first purchaser, who claims that the interest of John C. in the first mortgage merged in his interest as a purchaser of the farm from his mother and the heirs, therefore passed under the second mortgage to him as purchaser at the sale under that mortgage. There is no doubt whatever as to the rule applicable to the distribution of the principal of a widow\u2019s dower among those entitled to it at her death, where the land liad been accepted under proceedings in partition by one of the heirs and the payment of the principal of the dower has been secured at her death to the other heirs. The rule was at an early day announced in Reigle v. Seiger, 2 P. & W. 340:\n\u201c A son who accepts his father\u2019s land at a valuation in the orphans\u2019 court takes it subject to interest on a third of the valuation, when there is a widow, and to payment of the other children\u2019s shares of the principal at her death. In respect to his own share he has nothing to pay or to receive. Being in his own hands it is paid presently by the operation of the law; and when land so taken is sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, expressly subject to the payment of the whole third of the valuation at the widow\u2019s death, such son can never recover any portion of that third.\u201d\nIt has been followed in Stecker v. Shimer, 5 Wh. 452, Duey v. Clemens, 1 Pa. 118, and in many later cases. All these cases, however, rest upon the statutory fact that the widow\u2019s interest under the intestate laws is an estate in the land which estate she may voluntarily relinquish but of which she cannot otherwise be deprived. But consider the records .before us : On October 10, 1871, the husband died; the widow and heirs agreed to sell the land to John C. Fenton for the consideration of $10,000, not that he should in proceedings in partition or at a valuation under the intestate laws, take it; then on April 1, 1872, she and all the heirs except John C. joined in an absolute deed to him; this placed in him an absolute, legal and equitable title divested of every possible outstanding interest in either the widow or heirs. But at this point the widow\u2019s interest is not secured nor is that of the heirs in the principal sum. The statutory mode points out fully how this may be done where one of the heirs accepts the property in compulsory proceedings in partition, but they are not bound' to adopt the statutory mode in the division of the ancestor\u2019s estate, but may agree on some other method of division, just as they did in this case. On the same day the deed was delivered, John C. executed to a trustee a mortgage upon the farm to secure to the widow the interest annually during her life on $3,333.88 and the payment of the principal to the heirs of his father at her death.\nThus this sum was no longer an estate in the land but a debt secured by a mortgage on the land. It is wholly immaterial that the mortgage was the exact value of the widow\u2019s and children\u2019s interest in the land, it was plainly a substitution of a wholly different form of security for that which proceedings in partition provided. The mortgage 'was but a chose in action : Wilson v. Shoenberger, 31 Pa. 295; Moore v. Cornell, 68 Pa. 320. To work a merger by operation of law of John C. Fenton\u2019s share in the mortgage with his estate in the land in the absence of any express intention that the interests should merge, both must have been estates in the land, which they were not, for the mortgage was only a security for his debt. Merger is largely a question of intent: Danhouse\u2019s Estate, 180 Pa. 256; Carrow v. Headley, 155 Pa. 96. Instead of an intent to merge his interest in the mortgage with his estate in the land all the writings plainly indicate an intent not to merge them.\n\u2022 The learned judge of the court below properly held that there was no merger. \u2022 Therefore the judgment on the point reserved is affirmed.",

One of the sons agreed to purchase for a sum stated the interest of the widow and the other three children. A deed was then made to the son by the widow and the other three children. On the same day the son executed a mortgage to a trustee conditioned for the payment of an amount equal to one third the amount of the purchase money at the death of the widow to the trustee, with interest on the same to be paid annually to the widow. The trustee was the administrator of the intestate. Subsequently the son executed a second mortgage under which the farm was thereafter sold subject to the lien of the first mortgage. After the death of the widow the trustee of the first mortgage issued a scire facias. The purchaser finder the second mortgage claimed that the amount of the son\u2019s interest in the first mortgage had merged with his interest in the land as a purchaser, and that therefore the amount of the judgment should be reduced by the amount so merged. Held, that as the son had not pursued the statutory method by partition proceedings in acquiring his father\u2019s land, but had taken a direct deed from the other parties in interest, there was no merger of his interest in the first mortgage with his interest in the land.\nArgued Feb. 11, 1904.\nAppeal, No. 298, Jan.
