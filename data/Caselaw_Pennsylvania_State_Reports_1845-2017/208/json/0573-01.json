But in addition to this, it appears that the primary cause of the accident was the slipping of the pipe out of the deceased\u2019s hands, thus throwing the weight on him and knocking him into the vat. If this was not the result of his own carelessness in handling the pipe, it certainly did not show any negligence on the part of defendants.\nJudgment affirmed.",
