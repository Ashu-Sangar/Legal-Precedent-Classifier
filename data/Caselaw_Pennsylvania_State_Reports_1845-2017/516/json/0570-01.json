Appellee was apprehended in the process of stealing four cans of sardines and one bottle of hot sauce. The trial judge carefully considered the \u201cminor\u201d nature of the offense and appellee\u2019s record of repeated offenses when he sentenced appellee to a term of 2V2 to 5 years imprisonment, well within the minimum sentencing guideline range. In supporting his decision, the trial judge emphasized that the nature of the crime was not important in light of appellee\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct and his seeming inability to conduct his life beyond the confines of prison without violating the law.\nSuperior Court, in remanding for imposition of a lighter sentence, was of the opinion that this was not a serious crime and that it did not constitute a danger to the public. Substituting its own discretion for that of the trial court, Superior Court determined that the nature of the crime outweighed appellee\u2019s extensive record. As I stated previously:\nWhere the sentence is within the legislative guidelines, appellate courts may not vacate sentences as being manifestly excessive merely because the trial judge imposed a tough sentence where the appellate judges would have given a lenient one.\nCommonwealth v. Parrish, 515 Pa. 297, 303, 528 A.2d 151, 154 (1987) (Larsen, J., dissenting). It is clear that Superior Court exceeded its scope of appellate review and that this Court has the authority to correct this manifest error. Id.\nAccordingly, I would reverse the order of Superior Court and reinstate the judgment of sentence imposed by the trial court.\nMcDERMOTT, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. Appellee pleaded guilty to retail theft. Because this was a fifth offense of this nature, it was graded as a felony of the third degree. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3929(b)(1), (2). His offense gravity score was 5. Under the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time the offense was committed, the applicable minimum range was twenty-four to thirty-six months.",
