        "text": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThis is an appeal by a trust beneficiary and its trustees seeking public funds for interim care under Section 507 of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, Act of October 20, 1966, Spec. Sess. No. 3, P.L. 96, 50 P.S. \u00a7 4507. The local agency charged with providing such funds under Section 301(d)(8) of the Act, 50 P.S. \u00a7 4301(d)(8), has informed appellant beneficiary they are not available to her. As persons aggrieved by a local agency\u2019s adjudication, appellants had a right to appeal to Common Pleas. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 752; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 933(a)(2). The petition for review she and the trustees filed to Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction seeking mandamus was not proper.\nAccordingly, Commonwealth Court\u2019s order, 520 A.2d 1223, is vacated and the record is transferred, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103 and Pa.R.A.P. 751, to the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County for consideration on the merits in a manner consistent with the relevant statutory provisions and our recent decision in Lang v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Public Welfare, 515 Pa. 428, 528 A.2d 1335 (1987). See, e.g., Philadelphia Electric Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Resources No. 101 E.D. Appeal Dkt. 1987; filed October 5, 1987.",
