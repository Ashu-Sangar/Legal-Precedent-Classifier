Dalton. Mr. Dalton died at Taylor Hospital on October 20, 1979, some ten hours after admission for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Appellee instituted suit against Appellants in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County on November 6, 1981, two years and seventeen days after Mr. Dalton’s death. Appellee sought to recover damages, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Wrongful Death and Survival Statutes, for the alleged negligent treatment and wrongful death of the decedent. Defendants in the suit, Appellants herein, included four doctors, Emergency Medical Associates, and Taylor Hospital. Defendant-Appellants all responded to the Complaints filed against them by raising as New Matter, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1030, the defense of the current two-year statute of limitations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellee’s Reply asserted that the reason the action was not filed within two years from the date of death was that Taylor Hospital “refused” to make the records of decedent’s treatment available even after “repeated” requests (R. 44a). Defendant-Appellants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations, but the trial judge, the Honorable <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>Dominic D. Jerome, initially declined to dismiss the Complaints since there were factual issues in dispute.</p>
    <p id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[194,418,1154,1071]]]'>Counsel for each party stipulated that the trial judge alone would determine the applicability of the statute of limitations as to all of the defendants (R. 149a). A hearing was held before Judge Jerome on March 19, 1984, at which the testimony of two sworn witnesses (both testifying for Appellee) was taken in open court on the disputed factual issues (R. 148a-216a). At the conclusion of this hearing, Judge Jerome dismissed the action and entered judgment in favor of all defendants on the grounds that the action was time-barred (R. 233a-225a). Judge Jerome subsequently filed a Memorandum Opinion confirming his decision of March 19, 1984, <a href="/citations/?q=346%20Pa.%20Super.%20639" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="346 Pa. Super. 639">346 Pa.Super. 639</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=499%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="499 A.2d 404">499 A.2d 404</a>, to dismiss the Complaints. Appellee argues (and Superior Court agreed) that the hearing Judge Jerome conducted was on the motions for summary judgment, and that Judge Jerome, in fact, granted summary judgment to Defendant-Appellants. Defendant-Appellants contend that the hearing was, in essence, a bench trial; that Judge Jerome made determinations of a factfinder weighing the evidence; and that he entered judgment pursuant thereto.</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.6",485,[189,1509,1154,855]],["BL_486.1",486,[257,305,1154,255]]]'>After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the latter interpretation of what happened is entirely accurate. Pa.R.C.P. 1035 dealing with the “motion for summary judgment” makes no provision for a factual hearing. At most, it provides for the use of affidavits in resolving the motion. What Judge Jerome did here, with the obvious consent of all parties, was to bifurcate the case, and hold a full hearing or bench trial on the statute of limitations question, a subsidiary issue. He then decided the statute of limitations question on the disputed facts. <em>See, Schaffer v. Batyko, </em><a href="/pa-super/227/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="227 Pa.

Judge Jerome’s Opinion clearly indicates that this was <em>his </em>view of what was done, and it is the only conclusion consistent with Rule 1035 which provides, in subsection (6), for the rendering of summary judgment only where “... there is no genuine issue as to any material fact____” A hearing to take the <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>testimony of witnesses, where any party is free to call witnesses, takes the matter beyond the realm of summary judgment because the factfinder has now been given the opportunity to weigh evidence and determine credibility, if necessary.</p>
    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[256,580,1154,575]]]'>The trial court summarily rejected applicability of the so called discovery rule as a possible means of extending the two year statute of limitations, relying on this Court’s decision in <em>Anthony v.

In that case, we held that the so called discovery rule, which provides that a statute of limitations commences to run from the time an injury or cause of action becomes known, or from the time that one using all due diligence should have discovered the injury or cause of action, did not function so as to extend the period for filing wrongful death or survival actions.</p>
    <p id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[252,1179,1154,634]]]'>At the trial or hearing, Appellee attempted to show that Defendant-Appellants were estopped from asserting the defense of the statute of limitations because they allegedly lulled Appellee and her attorney into a false sense of security causing them to rely (to their detriment) on promises to send hospital records, which promises it took over nine months to fulfill. This alleged fraud or concealment was only chargeable, of course, to Defendant-Appellant Taylor Hospital. The other Defendant-Appellants could not, therefore, be properly held to be estopped to raise the statute of limitations defense because of Taylor Hospital’s conduct, and the trial court summarily concluded the same.</p>

    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[169,852,1155,996]]]'>The evidence as found by Judge Jerome indicates that counsel for Appellee first requested her decedent’s records from Taylor Hospital by letter dated March 21, 1980. Enclosed in the letter was an authorization for the release of records. In June, 1980, Appellee’s counsel’s associate attorney called Taylor Hospital to ascertain why the records had not been sent. A representative of the Hospital said the records would be forthcoming shortly. A month later, another inquiry was made to the Hospital regarding the whereabouts of the records. On December 4, 1980, a letter was sent to the billing department at Taylor Hospital again requesting the records. A week after this letter was sent, a spokeswoman from the medical records office at Taylor Hospital called and informed counsel’s associate that the records would not be sent out until they received a “short certificate.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Counsel’s associate attorney sent out another letter of request on December 18, 1980, with the appropriate short certificate.

When this document was finally sent, the Hospital responded immediately and sent the records. The trial court therefore dismissed the action as to Taylor Hospital, as well as to the other defendants. Judge Jerome’s Opinion also notes that although there had been a delay of approximately ten months by the Hospital in providing the records, there was still ample time for Appellee’s counsel to determine whether or not there was a cause of action against Taylor Hospital. Counsel did not institute a timely action even though counsel received and reviewed the hospital records,ten months before the statute of limitations ran.

While conceding that it was possible to conclude that Taylor Hospital’s delay in sending the records was due to mere mistake or misunderstanding, Superior Court thought that it was equally possible to infer that the delay here was occasioned by fraud or concealment. Since conflicting inferences could be drawn from these facts, Superior Court determined that the supposed <em>grant of summary judgment </em>in favor of Taylor Hospital had been improper. Superior Court also found that summary judgment had been improperly granted because the trial court’s conclusion that <em>Anthony v. Koppers Company, Inc., <a href="/pa/496/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="496 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1772960" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0119-01">supra,</a> </em>precluded application of the discovery rule to wrongful death and survival actions was erroneous.

Koppers Company, Inc. </em>had been based on the language of the previous statutes of limitation for wrongful death and survival actions, but that the discovery rule <em>would </em>apply to wrongful death and survival actions under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(2).

Koppers Company, Inc., supra, </em>on October 29, 1981. Appellee herein filed suit on November 6, 1981, seventeen days beyond the running of the two year statute of limitations. The claim is made, albeit summarily, that Appellee was entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule as promulgated by Superior Court in its decision which was the law of Pennsylvania during much of the crucial period in question until later reversed by this Court. The argument is troubling but ultimately unpersuasive. It may be harsh to expect practicing attorneys to know which Superior Court opinions are on appeal to this Court and hence not finally dispositive of the questions at issue. Nevertheless, there is nothing in the record or briefs in this case which persuades us that Appellee's attorneys were reasonably entitled to rely on Superior Court’s decision in <em>Anthony v. Koppers Company, Inc. </em>(See, R. 215a). That decision essentially established by judicial decree a grace period which had the effect of extending the limitations period for wrongful death and survival actions beyond the fixed one year clearly mandated by statute. We do not think Appellee's attorneys were entitled to rely on Superior Court's creation of such a grace period, directly contrary to the precise wording of the statute, unless and until this Court gave its approval (which we ultimately did not). Appellee’s attorneys cannot legitimately claim that alleged mistaken reliance on the Superior Court opinion results in any fundamental unfairness because they had over ten months from the receipt of the hospital records to act with diligence, and they failed to do so.</p>
