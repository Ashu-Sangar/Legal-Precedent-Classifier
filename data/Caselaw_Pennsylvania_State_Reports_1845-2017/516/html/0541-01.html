In accordance with provisions of this Compact, a requisition had been filed in North Carolina by the father of the runaway child requesting that the child, C.P., be returned from Pennsylvania to North. Carolina.</p>

The mother of C.P. had relinquished primary custody to the father. Born on July 26, 1971, C.P. was merely twelve years of age when she became pregnant via her mother’s lover, twenty-four year old Gregory Kline. As a result, on December 2, 1984, C.P. gave birth to a son, J.P. Gregory Kline was accordingly charged in North Carolina with statutory rape. Following the birth of J.P., C.P. resided with her infant son at her father’s home until, in February of 1985, she took J.P. and ran away to Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, C.P. and J.P. took up residence with Mrs. Katherine Kline, the mother of Gregory Kline, and C.P. resumed a limited and somewhat supervised romantic relationship with Gregory Kline, seeing him several times per week. Authorities in Pennsylvania subsequently received a requisition from North Carolina <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>pursuant to the Interstate Compact on Juveniles seeking the return of C.P.</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[190,426,1153,1286]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County held a hearing to determine whether it would be in the child’s best interests to be returned, and, because C.P. testified that she had been abused by her father, determined that the child’s interests would best be served by remaining in Pennsylvania. It is to be noted that, although the parents of C.P. were provided legal notice of the hearing in Pennsylvania, they were not in attendance. Also, a social services agency in North Carolina had furnished Children and Youth Services of Allegheny County with a letter stating that, immediately upon C.P.’s return to North Carolina, C.P. would be picked up by a social worker who would investigate the case in the event that C.P. expressed serious reservations about her safety. Nevertheless, based upon its assessment of the child’s best interests, the Court of Common Pleas declined to honor the requisition for the return of C.P. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court, whereupon C.P. and J.P. were ordered to go back to North Carolina. <em>In re C.P., </em><a href="/pa-super/354/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="354 Pa.

Clearly, this provision, by its use of the language “shall deliver,” makes delivery of the juvenile mandatory whenever the requisition is found to be “in order.” A requisition must be regarded as meeting that requirement when its contents are in compliance with the specified form for requisition orders set forth in 62 P.S. § 731, Art. IV(a), supra, provided that the issuing court has made the findings specified in that section relating to custody rights, the child’s best interests, etc.</p>

It is not asserted in this appeal that the requisition contained defects in its form, or that findings were not made by the court in North Carolina. Rather, C.P. seeks to challenge the substantive findings of that court by means of a hearing in Pennsylvania directed at relitigating the issue of whether C.P.’s best interests would be served by returning to North Carolina. In short, C.P. contends that 62 P.S. § 731, Art. IV(a), supra, requires the asylum state, to wit, Pennsylvania, to determine the runaway child’s best interests before complying with a requisition order.

Where the Interstate Compact expressly requires the determination in question to be made in the requisitioning state, but does not specify that a similar determination is to be made in the asylum state, it can only be concluded that the intent was that the requisitioning state, alone, should be charged with the duty of making findings regarding the juvenile’s best interests.</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[248,789,1154,1013]]]'>Such a conclusion comports with the logical notion that, in the usual case, it will be the requisitioning state that has the more significant, established, and longer-term contacts with the runaway child, thus placing it in a better position to bring evidence to bear on the question of the juvenile’s best interests. Further, the need to make two separate best-interests determinations in every case where a runaway child is to be returned to a home state would be an onerous burden on the parties concerned, especially considering the potential distances involved in interstate travel for parents and others who would perceive the need to travel to an asylum state to rebut a child’s foreseeable assertions that life in the home state was undesirable. (“A runaway monk never speaks well of his monastery.” — Italian Proverb). The Interstate Compact was designed to expedite the return, across state lines, of runaway children, and the need for inconvenient and duplicitous determinations of the best-interests issue was one of the obstacles that the Interstate Compact was no doubt designed to eliminate.</p>

    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[228,446,1151,582]]]'>The salient goal of the Interstate Compact is, therefore, to promote interests in reciprocity and cooperation among the participating states. The furtherance of those interests is dependent upon each participating state recognizing that sister sovereign states display no less jurisprudential excellence in dealing with issues involving the interests of runaway children. Deference to the best-interests determination of the requisitioning state is, therefore, an integral part of the scheme, and is a reason for having made mandatory an asylum state’s return of juveniles that are subject to valid requisition orders.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.6",631,[226,1047,1153,1177]]]'>We find no merit in the contention that juveniles are, by the procedures for returning them to a requisitioning state, denied due process. The provision governing action by asylum states, 62 P.S. § 781, Art IV(a), supra, expressly provides that an asylum state’s court “may” allow a reasonable time for the “legality of the proceeding” to be tested prior to the juvenile being delivered to the officer designated by the requisitioning court. This provision must, in light of considerations of due process, be construed as allowing challenges to the legality of the proceeding as a matter of right. In addition to the procedures, if any, that may be available in the requisitioning state to challenge the legality of the proceeding and thereby seek withdrawal of the requisition, it is clear that, in the asylum state, the question of whether the requisition is “in order” may be duly litigated. While such litigation may address matters of whether the form and contents of the requisition are in compliance with the Interstate Compact, and whether the issuing court made the findings required, it does not encompass relitigation of the best-interests issue that is properly in the realm of the requisitioning forum. See <em>Matter of Edwards, </em><a href="/or-app/15/0677-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="15 Or.

Ultimate issues which may permanently affect the juvenile’s best interests can be resolved upon return to the home state, including questions of custody, dependency, etc. Granted, the procedures of the Interstate Compact will not result, in the usual case, in a child having an opportunity in the asylum state to testify regarding conditions that motivated a departure from home. Nevertheless, transporting the child to the requisitioning jurisdiction is a measure that may precede more permanent and substantive adjudications pertaining to the child’s best interests, such being adjudications in which the child will no doubt have ample opportunities to testify.</p>

Citing this provision, the Court of Common Pleas found support for exercising jurisdiction over C.P. in Pennsylvania, and for refusing to honor the North Carolina requisition on grounds it believed C.P.'s interests would be best served by remaining in Pennsylvania. It is to be noted, however, that no petition had been filed seeking an adjudication of legal custody with respect to C.P., and, further, the requisition to return to North Carolina presented no “emergency,” particularly in view of the fact that a social services agency in North Carolina had furnished an assurance that, upon C.P.’s return to North Carolina, C.P. would be picked up by a social worker who would investigate the case if C.P. expressed serious reservations about her safety. See also 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5344(a)(4) (subordination of jurisdiction).

    <p id="b633-9" data-blocks='[["BL_633.10",633,[200,1087,1154,801]]]'>In addition, I would note that C.P. has not sought to <em>re </em>litigate the issue of whether her best interests would be served by returning to North Carolina, <em>see </em>maj. op. at 1003 and 1004, in that C.P.’s best interests had not been <em>litigated </em>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> in any forum prior to the hearing before the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Juvenile Division. The requisition order was issued solely on the basis of an affidavit filed by C.P.’s father. C.P. was not heard by the court in North Carolina, nor was she given an opportunity to be heard. There is no provision in the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, 62 P.S. §§ 731-735, guaranteeing that C.P. will be heard in court prior to being returned to her father. Thus, the Compact, as interpreted by the majority, unconstitutionally deprives minors of their right to due process.</p>
