Each is an essential part of the crime. None is merely incidental. In the instant case, the <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>first two occurred in Crawford County. We conclude that under such circumstances, venue and jurisdiction to try the crimes of omission involved here are properly vested in the court of the county in which performance of the acts was due. Logically, this would be in Crawford County where all of the acts giving rise to the obligation to file returns and remit taxes were performed.</p>
