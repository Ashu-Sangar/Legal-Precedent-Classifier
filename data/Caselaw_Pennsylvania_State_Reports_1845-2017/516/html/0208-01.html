Judge Bodley wrote to the State Court Administrator concerning this proceeding and stated that Respondent was “cruel and sadistic,” “offensive,” and that he had acted “consciously” and “abominably.” This complaint was directed to the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board (hereinafter “the Board”), which, by August of 1984 had received other complaints alleging misbehavior of Respondent.</p>

Thereafter, on April 16, 17, and 18, 1986 the Board conducted an Investigative Hearing before a panel of two Board members. Respondent was present at these hearings, was represented by counsel, and was permitted to testify, although he was not permitted to cross-examine witnesses.</p>

On March 2, 1987 the Board issued a Report in which it adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to six counts.

    <p id="A18" data-blocks='[["BL_295.7",295,[176,851,1152,587]],["BL_296.1",296,[275,315,1151,368]]]'>In an attempt to set forth a framework in which the charges, findings and conclusions of the Board may be understood, we preface our summary of the Board’s findings with a short synopsis of the case. Although there were isolated instances of conflict between Respondent and various local attorneys — the complainants in this case — before 1984, the primary event which seems to have precipitated the judicial conduct complained of was the decision of the Potter County District Attorney to prosecute two members of the Potter County bar for tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution when they withheld evidence found at <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>the crime scene in a murder trial. This matter will be discussed more fully at Section III C, infra, but for now it will suffice to point out that the attorneys prosecuted, Walter and George Stenhach, were Respondent’s friends, that he attempted to discourage their prosecution, and that he became angry with those whom he perceived as causing the prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[268,705,1156,962]]]'>When it became apparent that the Stenhach prosecution would proceed in spite of Respondent’s efforts to abort it, there developed a tension between Respondent and the district attorney, discussed infra, which had an effect on Respondent’s treatment of legal matters involving the district attorney, and which became known to other members of the bar. The bar of Potter County is small, consisting only of eleven members, and there apparently developed a cleavage between those who increasingly saw Respondent’s behavior as injudicious and those who did not. By August of 1984, the relationship between Respondent and the District Attorney of Potter County deteriorated to the point that the district attorney requested a Judicial Inquiry and Review Board investigation of Respondent, and on October 18, 1984 the Potter County Bar Association passed a resolution, by a vote of 7 to 4, calling for the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board to conduct an investigation of Respondent’s judicial conduct.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[529,1730,631,36]]]'>II. THE MYSTERY WITNESS</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.7",296,[266,1791,1154,586]],["BL_297.1",297,[193,278,1150,91]]]'>As a second preliminary matter, we address Respondent’s claim that the Board erred in determining Respondent and his counsel attempted to deceive the Board when they failed to disclose their full knowledge of the truthfulness of a witness whose testimony they proposed to offer. The majority of the Board found that Respondent and his counsel engaged in an effort to deceive the Board by proposing to offer the testimony of an unidentified person, a “mystery witness,” who would testify that some of the complainants who had testified against Respondent were involved with illegal drug use. The “mystery witness” was unidentified <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>because allegedly he was cooperating with police agencies and there had been threats on his life.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[193,394,1152,851]]]'>The gravamen of the “mystery witness’s” testimony would have been that the complainants who had testified against Respondent were users of illegal drugs and were falsely testifying against Respondent in an attempt to remove him from office because he was known to oppose illegal drug use. Respondent proposed, therefore, inter alia, that the “mystery witness’s” identity remain secret and that he not be cross-examined by the special prosecutor. The Board was unwilling to accede to these conditions for the appearance of the “mystery witness,” and the “mystery witness” never testified. It later was revealed that Respondent, his counsel, and counsel for the “mystery witness” knew at the time these proposals were made to the Board that the “mystery witness” had failed polygraph tests administered by the FBI and had admitted to the FBI that his testimony was a lie.</p>
    <p id="b297-6" data-blocks='[["BL_297.6",297,[193,1262,1153,532]]]'>The majority found that Respondent, his attorney and an attorney representing the “mystery witness” conspired to perpetrate a fraud on the Board by failing to tell the Board that the “mystery witness” had failed the polygraph test and had admitted to the FBI that he was lying. The majority also found that the Respondent, his attorney and the attorney for the “mystery witness” attempted to place unreasonable restrictions on the calling of the “mystery witness” so that Respondent could later claim that he was denied the right to call a critical witness.</p>
    <p id="b297-7" data-blocks='[["BL_297.7",297,[193,1811,1152,531]],["BL_298.1",298,[286,286,1155,908]]]'>Two members of the Board dissented to these findings on the grounds that the evidence did not indicate that there was any attempt at fraud. Although a majority of the Board determined that information concerning the witness’s truthfulness should have been forthcoming when counsel made his offer of proof, the minority concluded that counsel’s failure to do this did not amount to fraud because counsel believed that it was not proper to address the truthfulness question when making an offer of proof, and because counsel intended to elicit the polygraph and admis<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>sion of lying evidence on direct examination. The minority analyzed this dispute as one which concerns whether the polygraph evidence and admission of lying goes to the weight of the evidence or to its admissibility, a matter on which reasonable minds can disagree. Further, the minority observed that counsel for the “mystery witness” consistently asserted his belief in the truth of his client’s testimony, the polygraph examinations notwithstanding. Finally, because counsel for the “mystery witness” communicated his concerns for his client’s safety to Respondent and his counsel, all three may well have been acting to protect the “mystery witness” from a perceived threat of death, not to lay the groundwork for future claims of error in the proceedings. For all these reasons, the minority concluded that counsel for respondent was doing no more than zealously defending his client and that in any event, counsel’s behavior did not constitute an attempted fraud.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[283,1215,1156,640]]]'>We do not address or consider the Board’s findings that Respondent attempted to deceive the Board concerning the proffered testimony of the “mystery witness” because those findings do not concern formal charges made against the Respondent. If the Board wishes to initiate action against the parties involved in the “mystery witness” episode, then formal proceedings should be commenced, those charged should be notified of the charges against them, and they should be given an opportunity to prepare a defense and respond to the charges. For purposes of the adjudication of this case, the “mystery witness” matter has no bearing and forms no part of our consideration or rationale.</p>

The facts and conclusions of law on which the Board unanimously agreed, which are either undisputed or based upon the Board's determination of the Respondent's credibility, are as follows:</p>

In June of 1979 Martin <em>&amp; </em>Hess Real Estate, Inc. brought an action against the Potter County Planning Commission (No 410 of 1979, C.P. Potter County) to adjudicate the question of whether the Commission’s failure to act on a proposed real estate development plan was tantamount to approval of the plan. The case was listed before Respondent. The Commission’s attorney advised his client that since the Commission had not acted within its statutorily allotted time, the plaintiff would prevail, and he recommended that the Commission allow the plaintiff to take a default judgment.</p>
    <p id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.6",299,[221,1260,1151,747]]]'>When Respondent learned that the plaintiff was about to fake a default judgment, he contacted the Executive Director of the Commission directly, without notice to the plaintiff that he was doing so, and suggested to the Executive Director that the Commission had a defense which had not been raised and that the Commission’s lawyer should petition to file an answer <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Respondent then met <em>ex parte </em>with the Commission’s lawyer and gave him the same advice. The Commission filed the suggested motion. Respondent then denied plaintiff’s motion for default judgment and granted the Commission’s petition to file a late answer. Respondent also denied plaintiffs motion for judgment on the pleadings and certified the question for appeal. The matter was finally settled on appeal.</p>

Having undermined the attorney-client relationship, he then attempted to use the son to impose a solution to the case which the judge favored and which was contrary to the relief requested by the father and the disfavored attorney.

In the first week of July, another prisoner, James Thomas, told jail authorities that he had heard McCaslin make certain statements about the Cornish murder which he, Thomas, wished to communicate to authorities.
