The appellant Gershom Sessoms was found guilty of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime. He was sentenced to <em>2lk </em>to 8 years imprisonment on the assault charge and a consecutive term of 5 years probation on the weapons charge. Sessoms unsuccessfully argued to the courts below that the method by which the Sentencing Guidelines were established violated either or both of our Constitution’s requirements of bicameral consideration and presentment for gubernatorial approval. We allowed this appeal to address these important questions on which Superior Court was unable to develop a consensus rationale. <em>See Commonwealth v.

This resolution was not presented to the governor for his review. Thereafter the Commission did adopt a second set of guidelines, “rewritten ... in accordance with the legislative resolution,” and published these in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on January 23, 1982, 12 Pa.Admin.Bull. 431-40.

Thus, to the extent that a statute establishes <em>governmental </em>policy, the legislature may not further control the execution of that policy except through legislation. To the extent that a statute establishes only <em>legislative </em>structures, the legislature may further control the actions of such structures through means other than legislation, but the powers assigned to those structures may not exceed the legislative and become executive.

We accept this designation, adopted long after the commencement of the present litigation raising uncertainty as to the guidelines, as only some evidence, not determinative, of the nature of the Commission.

The Commission is composed of four judges from the courts of common pleas appointed by the Chief Justice, four members of the General Assembly appointed by the leaders of the respective Houses and representing different political parties, and three appointees of the governor — a district attorney, a defense attorney, and a law professor or criminologist. <em>Amicus curiae </em>Defender Association of Philadelphia rightly observes that the inclusion of legislators and/or judges on an agency administering the laws is itself likely violative of the separation of powers doctrine. No clearer concentration of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers in one body can be imagined, <em>if </em>that body purports to have authority to carry the laws into effect. While <em>amicus </em>makes this point in pursuit of a different line of reasoning, because we are obliged to presume that the General Assembly does not intend to violate the Constitution, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3), we take it as indicating that the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing is not an administrative agency, that is, an agency charged with administer<a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>ing the laws.

A review of 42 Pa.C.S. § 2153 reveals that the legislative powers that the Commission shares are essentially those of investigation, classification,. and evaluation. Such tasks are commonly undertaken by special or standing committees and subcommittees composed entirely of members of the respective Houses of the General Assembly.

Such a result can be obtained only by way of enactment of a law or administration of a law duly enacted. However, to the extent that the rights of the defendant and the prosecution, the duties of the sentencing court, and the relations between them have been altered by the requirement that the court <em>consider </em>the guidelines, this has been accomplished by the enabling act — legislative action conforming to constitutional requirements. So long as the judiciary has ultimate control over the application of the guidelines to a particular case, as one factor among the many enumerated in the Sentencing Code as a whole, there has been no substantive change in the judicial prerogative <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>in sentencing discretion that has not been accomplished by duly enacted legislation. The defendant has no “right” to have other factors take pre-eminence or be exclusive; therefore, to have the guidelines considered, whatever they may provide, does not change his rights. Likewise, the prosecutor has no “right” to have a particular sentence imposed. Most important, the court has no “duty” to impose a sentence considered appropriate by the Commission. The guidelines must only be “considered” and, to ensure that such consideration is more than mere fluff, the court must explain its reasons for departure from them. Viewed in this manner, the guidelines are essentially a sophisticated compilation and distillation of a vast range of factors affecting the sentencing process in the abstract, accomplished by persons of expertise representing a broad spectrum of interests. The legislature with the governor’s approval has deemed it proper that the findings of such a body, assembled to assist it in developing and overseeing a sound sentencing system, be given practical application in individual cases as well. We may say that in directing courts to consider these guidelines, just as they must consider a number of listed though non-exclusive factors in imposing probation, the legislature has done no more than direct that the courts take notice of the Commission’s work. Only in this limited way can the work-product of the Commission, a legislative agency, be given effect beyond the confines of the General Assembly and at the same time avoid invalidation on constitutional grounds.</p>

Because the rejection resolution here was not presented to the Governor, it should not have taken effect to block the implementation of the guidelines as initially approved by the Commission.

Under the rewritten guidelines, although the “base” minimum sentence would have been substantially unchanged (8 to 12 months), a new section, applicable to Sessoms was added. Section 303.4(a) provides that “at least 12 months and up to 24 months confinement shall be added to the guideline sentence which would otherwise have been imposed” for possession of a deadly weapon in the commission of a crime. As the trial court indicated that it was following the guidelines, the sentence of <em>2lk </em>years (30 months) must have been derived from these two provisions; had the rejection resolution not “prevented” the effectiveness of the initial guidelines, a sentence under them would have been 8 to IIV2 months.</p>

Legislative oversight of an administrative agency may take place through the enactment of statutory guidelines and standards, establishment of rules of administrative procedure, use of legislative committees and sub-committees both in the annual appropriation process and for the purpose of considering whether further guidance through legislation may be needed, through constituent casework engaged in by individual legislators who informally investigate constituent grievances, or some combination of all of these.

I believe that the concurrent resolution rejecting the Commission’s guidelines as originally published is not such an exercise. “An ‘exercise of legislative power’ is an act that is legislative in purpose and effect.” <em>Commonwealth v. Kuphal, </em><a href="/pa-super/347/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="347 Pa.

The act of the General Assembly in adopting a resolution rejecting the guidelines lacks the requisite legis<a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>lative purpose or effect. The resolution neither enacts or repeals a law.</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[259,432,1151,475]]]'>After the Commission’s adopted guidelines are published, no action on the part of either House of the Legislature is required for the guidelines to become effective. Until the specified statutory period of time goes by without rejection, the published guidelines are nothing more than potential guidelines. A resolution of the General Assembly rejecting the guidelines eliminates their potential to become effective and maintains the continued viability of the then existing sentencing criteria.</p>
