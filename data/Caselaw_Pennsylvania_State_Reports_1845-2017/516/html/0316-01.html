    <p id="b401-9" data-blocks='[["BL_401.10",401,[203,1043,1152,369]]]'>This is the appeal of the City of Philadelphia (Appellant) from the Opinion and Order of the Commonwealth Court reversing the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County granting Appellant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and remanding the matter to the trial court with leave for John F. Chevalier and Anita Chevalier, Appellees, to amend their Complaint.</p>
    <p id="b401-10" data-blocks='[["BL_401.11",401,[203,1433,1152,584]]]'>On May 31, 1983, Appellees filed a Complaint against Appellant and Frederic R. Mann Music Center and alleged that on July 19, 1982, while on the music center’s parking lot, Mr. Chevalier was the victim of torturous acts of unknown third persons which were facilitated by the lack of proper security at the center and parking lot. Appellees further alleged that the City and center owned, operated, maintained, possessed and controlled the parking lot and that both the City and center knew that a dangerous condition existed at the parking lot and that because no lighting existed on the lot, Appellee’s injuries occurred.</p>
    <p id="b401-11" data-blocks='[["BL_401.12",401,[203,2037,1151,313]],["BL_402.1",402,[289,289,1150,97]]]'>In its Answer, the City denied any negligence and invoked the City’s governmental immunity conferred by the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8541, et seq., and moved for summary judgment. Appellees argued that the City was not immune from the injuries sustained by Mr. Chevalier by virtue of exception four of the Tort <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>Claims Act, which deals with trees, traffic controls and street lighting. 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(4).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[281,415,1157,1071]]]'>The Honorable Alfred J. DiBona, Jr. rejected Appellees’ arguments and concluded that the Complaint failed to allege that the City knew, or should have known, of any “dangerous condition” existing because of the poor lighting, or that the City had sufficient time prior to the crime to take preventive measures to protect against the “dangerous condition” as required by the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(4). Since the Complaint failed to allege notice in time to protect, the trial court ruled the Complaint insufficient to support a cause of action. For this traditional reason alone, the trial judge held that exception four of the Tort Claims Act was held to be unavailable to Appellees. The City's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings was granted, and Appellees’ Complaint dismissed as to the City. Appellees appealed to the Commonwealth Court which concluded that Appellees should have been given the opportunity to amend their Complaint. They, accordingly, reversed and remanded with leave to file an Amended Complaint. <em>Chevalier v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa-commw/91/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="91 Pa.
