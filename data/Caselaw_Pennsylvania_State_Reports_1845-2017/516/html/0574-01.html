The lawsuits against the Gilberts <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> arise out of a mishap involving a visitor’s automobile unwittingly set in motion by Erin Gilbert, the 3V2 year old son of the Gilberts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Allegheny County Common Pleas Court held that the appellant, Erie, was solely responsible for coverage under the provisions of the automobile liability policy issued to the Gilberts.

The runaway vehicle struck two children as it travelled down the hill. One of the children (Ronald Craighead, Jr.) was injured by the vehicle; the other child (Kevin J. Robinson) was killed.

Erie further argues that the gist of the underlying actions against the Gilberts is the Gilberts’ failure to control their child. The appellee, Transamerica counters Erie’s argument by citing the lower court decision and arguing that the word “use” has a broad enough meaning to cover the actions of young Erin Gilbert in setting the Robinson vehicle in motion. Transamerica also contends that the underlying complaints filed against the Gilberts allege causes of action founded on negligent entrustment. Transamerica’s argument continues that since an essential element of negligent entrustment is use of the automobile as the proximate cause of the injury, and since it is impossible to separate negligent entrustment from use, coverage for the accident in this case is provided under the Erie automobile policy and excluded under the homeowner’s policy.</p>
