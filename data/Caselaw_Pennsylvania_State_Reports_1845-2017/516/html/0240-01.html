The employer denied that Mr. Kachinski had injured <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>his back. Furthermore, on September 24, 1981, employer filed a petition to modify the compensation payments, alleging that as of June 30, 1981 claimant had sufficiently recovered from his original work-related injury as to be capable of returning to gainful employment which was then presently available in the market place.</p>

The latter conclusion was based on the referee’s determination that the employer had introduced sufficient evidence to establish the existence of “available work” which claimant was capable of performing. Accordingly, the referee reduced Mr. Kachinski’s benefits from those appropriate for total disability to a level appropriate for a partial disability. This decision was affirmed by the Board.</p>

Although the employer is not personally responsible for an employee’s injury, the employer, as the owner of the production process, nonetheless bears a responsibility to those who are injured while operating it. That responsibility, though not without its limits, requires at a minimum some effort on the part of the employer to make the injured employee whole. To impose on the injured party the duty to find alternative work under pain of foregoing the compensation to which he has become entitled is to condition one’s receipt of compensation on something other than the injury itself: a concept far removed from the salutary purpose of workmen’s compensation to provide relief due to injuries caused in the workplace.

However, in applying this definition to the facts of this case the court went beyond its terms and basically imposed on the employer the duty to specify every aspect of every job in question: a cumbersome burden which seems unreasonable in light of the fact that only so much can be known about a job in advance. It is enough that the employer produce medical evidence describing the claimant’s capabilities, and vocational evidence classifying the job, <em>e.g., </em>whether it is light work, sedentary work, etc., along with a basic description of the job in question.

    <p id="b336-9" data-blocks='[["BL_336.9",336,[253,1106,1155,846]]]'>Obviously, the viability of this system depends on the good faith of the participants. The referrals by the employer must be tailored to the claimant’s abilities, <em>Unora, supra., </em>and be made in a good faith attempt to return the injured employee to productive employment, rather than a mere attempt to avoid paying compensation. By the same token, employees must make a good faith effort to return to the work force when they are able, and their benefits can be modified for failure to follow up on referrals or for willfully sabotaging referrals. If an employee refuses a valid job offer his benefits can also be modified if it is found he had no basis upon which to do so. Of course medical evidence which rebuts the employer’s evidence of a change in condition, or indicates the unacceptability of the offered employment, can be a basis for a determination that claimant had a valid reason for refusing a job offer.</p>
    <p id="b336-10" data-blocks='[["BL_336.10",336,[250,1970,1153,366]],["BL_337.1",337,[219,283,1149,206]]]'>Though we seem to have almost moved to a point where the employer must produce a job offer, that is not quite true since the refusal of the employee to pursue a valid job referral can provide a reason for altering benefits. Nonetheless, to require an injured employee to receive no less than a job referral is consonant with the purposes of the Workmen’s Compensation Act and this Court’s prior com<a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>ments on the issue. <em>Barrett, supra; Petrone, supra; Unora, supra. </em>One injured at work, stranded into partial disability, deserves more than a generic list describing where he might find some suitable work.</p>
    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[218,507,1152,1665]]]'>Turning to the facts of this case, the employer presented evidence of eleven positions which were purportedly available to the claimant. Of these, three jobs were listed as being available in 1981 which was almost two years prior to the employer’s medical evidence that claimant was fit to return to work. Therefore these jobs are excluded. Of the remaining eight, two were never called to claimant’s attention, and these are also excluded; and two were not found by the referee to be suitable, a determination that has not been challenged on appeal. Of the remaining four jobs there was evidence that when these jobs became available general inquiries were sent to claimant’s counsel. To these inquiries there was no response, and apparently the information about possible work was never conveyed to the claimant. Hence, there was no evidence that claimant himself was ever apprised of available work generally, and it is undisputed that he was never advised of the specific jobs here in issue. However, after the employer’s vocational expert testified at the hearing claimant’s counsel sought a continuance to investigate the job openings. Employer’s counsel objected as to the jobs about which inquiries had been sent, but offered no objection to a recess for the claimant to pursue the two job openings, of which he had not been given prior notice. Somewhat inexplicably the referee refused the continuance as to all job referrals. Although we understand the referee’s ruling as to the first group of job openings, it seems to have been an abuse of discretion to refuse a continuance as to the second group: an action which may have resulted in Mr. Kachinski returning to the work force and obviating the need for this continuing litigation.</p>

Such actions can be grounds for modifying a claimant’s benefits, in which case the claimant may have a malpractice action against his attorney. However, under the facts of this case, and given the unclear status of the law at the time regarding claimant’s duty, it would be onerous to punish this claimant for the dereliction of his attorney where no actual job referral was made. It would be especially harsh since when claimant was presented with the actual information regarding the job he offered to pursue them and was refused permission by the referee.</p>
