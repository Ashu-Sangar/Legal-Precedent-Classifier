    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[168,515,1156,1122]]]'>Taxpayer, a multi-state construction contractor, is a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey, and has its principal office in that state. Taxpayer’s primary business activity consists of constructing sewage and water systems throughout New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. During the three audit periods in question, this type of construction work was performed in Pennsylvania under contracts with a number of municipalities and municipal authorities, whereby Taxpayer installed approximately fifteen sanitary sewer systems, one water system, and one or two storm sewer systems. The work consisted of excavating trenches, placing beds of crushed stone therein, laying pipe, refilling the trenches, and restoring ground surfaces to their original condition by either repaving, planting grass seed, or restoring sidewalks and curbs. Some of the work also involved installation of metering or pumping stations as integral parts of the systems. Equipment that was used, but not installed, in these construction activities was stored at a vehicle park/repair facility in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, and such equipment included cranes, excavators, an office trailer, etc.</p>

I, § 101, et seq., 72 P.S. § 7101, et seq. Taxpayer did not file use tax returns for the first audit period. Returns were filed for the second and third audit periods, however, but no tax was paid. The Department of Revenue determined, based upon the audits conducted, that taxes and penalties were owed in the amount of approximately $356,000.00, plus interest. As of April, 1985, the interest due on this balance amounted to more than $244,000.00. Taxpayer contests nearly the entire use tax assessment, but concedes that a small portion of the tax, under $10,000.00, is due, though this amount has not been paid.</p>

Some of these items had been purchased in Pennsylvania, and others had not, but to the extent that sales taxes were shown by the Taxpayer to have been paid to other states for the items, credit was accorded in computing the tax due. It is the contention of Taxpayer that, because all of the contracts which it performed in Pennsylvania involved installation of municipal utility facilities and equipment, the items assessed were exempt from the use tax by reason of the public utility exclusion set forth in 72 P.S. § 7201(o )(4), which, during the audit periods in question, provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>

Implicit in this view, perhaps, is the notion that items not assessed were in fact directly used in public utility service. It is curious, therefore, for the Commonwealth to argue as it does elsewhere in its brief that the municipal entities for which the utility systems were installed did not constitute public utilities, for if such were the case then none of the materials would have been subject to the public utility exclusion, and the Commonwealth has not taken the position that materials were improperly excluded from taxation by the Department of Revenue.</p>

The items assessed were <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>those deemed not directly used in public utility service, to wit, primarily materials used to embed and cover the pipelines and to restore surface conditions, including crushed stone, sand, gravel, asphalt paving, concrete sidewalks, grass seed, etc.</p>

Further, at the evidentiary hearing below, Taxpayer presented unrebutted testimony that it installed facilities for public utilities, as well as unrebutted testimony that it performed no other construction work in Pennsylvania during the relevant time periods.</p>

    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[231,405,1157,1290]]]'>The next contention raised by Taxpayer is that the Department of Revenue erred in determining which items of equipment were subject to the use tax when it assessed equipment used at Taxpayer’s construction sites in Pennsylvania, as well as equipment stored at the Lehigh County vehicle park/repair facility. It is claimed that deficiencies were assessed against equipment purchased and used outside of Pennsylvania, rather than against only such equipment as was used in Pennsylvania. It is also claimed that equipment purchased outside of Pennsylvania and brought into this state should have been excluded from taxation under 72 P.S. § 7204(3), which provides an exclusion for tangible personal property brought into Pennsylvania in connection with establishment of a permanent business, where the property was purchased more than six months prior, where the Taxpayer at the time of purchase was a business entity not engaged in business in Pennsylvania, and where the property is not merely being temporarily brought into the state for real estate construction and repair work. Both of these claims may be characterized at this stage as raising problems of proof, for, as noted supra, the Taxpayer as the party seeking reassessment of its tax deficiency bears the burden of proof. An examination of the instant record does not show that the burden has been met.</p>

In short, this is the result of Taxpayer having maintained records as to equipment purchases, but not as to equipment <em>usage. </em>See generally 72 P.S. § 7271 (“Keeping of records”).

    <p id="b421-7" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[193,658,1156,813]]]'>Although no records were maintained as to equipment usage, Taxpayer did utilize a magnetic board in its operations to display <em>current </em>locations and serial numbers for equipment. The auditor took note of this board and the information displayed on it, but, because the location of equipment at the time of the audit was not dispositive as to where such equipment had until then been used, assessments were made against not only equipment shown by the display board to be currently in Pennsylvania but also against equipment that could not be traced to definite locations as well as certain equipment located in the state where Taxpayer was incorporated and maintained its principal office, New Jersey. Credit was afforded, however, for sales taxes paid to all states, to the extent that equipment purchase records indicated payment of such taxes.</p>

As discussed supra, however, Taxpayer failed to show that the assessed equipment was never used in Pennsylvania. It is also claimed that the election requirement is inapplicable where Taxpayer in good faith believed the public utility exclusion rendered equipment non-taxable. It is sufficient to note that the language of the statute contains no provision making the election optional in cases where good faith is alleged, and there <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>appears no basis in the facts presented upon which the taxing authorities should be estopped from enforcing the election requirement. Taxpayer further argues that the election requirement should pertain only to real estate construction contractors, and that Taxpayer is not a real estate construction contractor. We fail to perceive any statutory basis for such an assertion, for nothing in the language of the election provision coincides with Taxpayer’s argument.

Specifically, Taxpayer asserts that the burden of proof, which normally rests upon the one seeking review of a tax assessment, see discussion of 72 P.S. § 7236, supra, should have been shifted to the Commonwealth by virtue of the Taxpayer having submitted into evidence certain “exemption certificates” provided by some of the municipalities for which utility systems were installed. It is provided in 72 P.S. § 7237(c) that tax-exempt purchasers of certain property are to furnish vendors with exemption certificates indicating that transactions are not subject to tax, that the certificates “shall be in substantially such form as the [Department of Revenue] may, by regulation, prescribe,” and that “An exemption certificate, <em>which is complete and regular </em>and on its face discloses a valid basis of exemption if taken in good faith, shall relieve the vendor from the liability imposed by this section.” (Emphasis added). The Department of Revenue regulation promulgated pursuant to this provision states, with regard to the form that an exemption certificate must take when obtained by a contractor who has performed work for an exempt public utility, that “Attached to the ‘Certification’ will be a listing of the specific items of equipment, machinery or parts upon which the exempt customer claims an exemption.” 61 Pa.Code § 31.13(c)(3). Examination of the certificates submitted by Taxpayer reveals that none include listings of the specific items of property for which exemption is sought, and, hence, none fulfill the statutory requirement that they be <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>“complete and regular” in their form. We need not address, therefore, the effect of <em>properly </em>completed exemption certificates, since none are present in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b424-4" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[253,479,1152,971]]]'>Taxpayer’s final contention is that penalties assessed against it, under 72 P.S. § 7266, should be abated pursuant to 72 P.S. § 7269, which provides that penalties “may be waived or abated, in whole or in part, where the petitioner has established that he has acted in good faith, without negligence and with no intent to defraud.” Although adjustments in the penalties assessed may be required in view of our holding that certain items held taxable by the court below were properly subject to the public utility exclusion, a complete waiver of the penalties is not required. Taxpayer, a large multi-state construction contractor experienced in doing work for public utilities, failed to file the required tax returns, see 72 P.S. § 7266(a) (penalty for failure to file return), failed to pay tax on portions of the assessments that it conceded to be valid, failed to keep records of appropriate thoroughness to aid in determining tax liabilities, etc. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the assessment of penalties was improper.</p>
