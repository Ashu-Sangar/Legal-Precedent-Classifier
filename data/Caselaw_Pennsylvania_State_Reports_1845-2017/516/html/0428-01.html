Rothman were married on February 13, 1969. On April 28, 1983, Mrs. Rothman instituted an action in divorce against her husband seeking, in addition to a decree in divorce, an equitable distribution of marital property. The complaint also contained a request for counsel fees. Mr. Rothman filed a timely answer and interposed a counterclaim. During the course of discovery proceedings, various orders were entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County including an order directing Mr. Rothman to make support payments of $2,000.00 per month and to advance to Mrs. Rothman the sum of $10,000.00 on account of her distributive share to which she would be entitled following the issuance of a decree in divorce.</p>

    <p id="b522-9" data-blocks='[["BL_522.10",522,[271,1264,1153,368]]]'>I agree with the majority that the Slayer’s Act, 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 8801-8815, applies, and a proceeding for equitable distribution must continue if the slayer would, in fact, otherwise obtain a benefit. However, I believe non-abatement is better reached on the alternate, general ground that equitable distribution does not end upon the death of one party to a divorce action.</p>
    <p id="b522-10" data-blocks='[["BL_522.11",522,[268,1653,1153,691]],["BL_523.1",523,[210,288,1149,147]]]'>The majority’s rationale implies a case by case inquiry as to who will benefit from a continuation of equitable distribution when one spouse slays another during divorce. Under this analysis, equitable distribution will sometimes abate and sometimes continue, even when one spouse kills the other. To solve the abatement puzzle the equitable distribution factfinder will have to decide .who benefits, the slayer or his victim. The alternate ground avoids this difficulty. It also avoids any later inquiry into the parties’ relative fault if the action is abated. Such an inquiry is possible not only when there is a slayer who would have benefited from a continuance, but whenever a death occurs during a divorce action. That inquiry into fault would <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>violate the major premise of our Divorce Code, Act of April 2, 1980, P.L. 63, No. 26, <em>as amended, </em>23 P.S. §§ 101-801 (Supp.1987).</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.5",523,[208,453,1151,778]]]'>Under the Code, property is to be distributed upon dissolution of a marriage in a fair and equitable manner, without regard to fault. Abating an equitable distribution claim on one party’s death throws the survivor back into the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code for economic protection. It involves notions of fault. <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 2106(a) (spouse who has “willfully and maliciously deserted the other spouse” has no right or interest in that spouse’s real or personal estate for purposes of intestate succession); 20 Pa.C.S. § 2208 (surviving spouse who would not be entitled to a share of an intestate decedent’s estate under 20 Pa.C.S. § 2106 has no right of election). This is contrary to the policies in our Divorce Code; it involves fault and neither fosters economic justice nor considers the welfare of the family.</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.6",523,[205,1250,1151,558]]]'>Under our Divorce Code, whether the marital relationship has in fact dissolved, and thus whether the marital bond should be severed and property equitably distributed, is solemnly answered at the outset by the party beginning the action, subject only to formal recognition by the court at its conclusion. On the death of a party, we should recognize the acknowledgment that dissolution of the relationship had already occurred, and divide the marital property equitably. If we, instead, abate equitable distribution, we may deprive the surviving spouse of property by the very inquiry which our Divorce Code was meant to avoid.</p>
    <p id="b523-6" data-blocks='[["BL_523.7",523,[203,1835,1151,514]],["BL_524.1",524,[252,283,1149,201]]]'>I recognize the Divorce Code fails to speak expressly on abatement. In favor of abatement is a lingering common law notion that personal actions do not survive and that death resolves all questions of status. If marriage is to be treated as a partnership, as I believe the Divorce Code implies, equitable distribution of the couple’s marital property when one dies is no less needed than equitable distribution of partnership property on the death of a partner.

The issue in this case is not whether the estate of Mrs. Rothman will have any remedies against her alleged slayer, or even whether the provisions of the Slayer’s Act will apply. Rather, the question presented is how shall these claims be presented and to which forum?</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.7",524,[246,970,1152,356]]]'>The majority’s view is <em>not </em>that the estate of Mrs. Roth-man is entitled to <em>additional </em>remedies because she was allegedly slain by her husband during the pendency of a divorce action, but rather, that in order for her estate to prevent the alleged slayer from profiting from his act, the divorce action must be allowed to continue after the deaths of the parties. I disagree.</p>
    <p id="b524-7" data-blocks='[["BL_524.8",524,[242,1344,1154,663]]]'>The estate of a murdered spouse, under our longstanding rule, would not be permitted to continue the divorce action or to claim an equitable distribution of marital property after the deaths of the parties. But if the wife died of natural causes during the pendency of the divorce action, her estate also would not be permitted to continue the divorce action. The majority’s reason for wanting to extend the right to continue a divorce action after the deaths of the parties, therefore, does not stem from a perception that divorce actions in general should survive the deaths of the parties, but instead relates to the narrow facts of this case. Slayers must be prevented from profiting from the deaths of their victims.</p>
    <p id="b524-8" data-blocks='[["BL_524.9",524,[240,2033,1151,308]],["BL_525.1",525,[221,291,1152,625]]]'>Even under a traditional approach to this case, however, a slayer would not benefit from his act. The purpose of the Slayer’s Act — to prevent a slayer from benefiting from the death of his victim — may be effected by the decedent’s survivors bringing a wrongful death action and by challenges presented during the administration of the victim’s <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>estate. Should it be established then that the husband in this case murdered the wife, he would not, by operation of the Slayer’s Act, be permitted to inherit anything from the victim. And should it be established in a wrongful death action that the husband in fact murdered the wife, presumably the wife’s estate would be permitted a recovery against the husband’s estate for that wrongful act. The wife’s estate, therefore, even under a traditional approach has all of the remedies that are usually accorded to the survivors of a murder victim, and where this is true, I can see no need to alter well-established rules concerning the termination of divorce proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[220,934,1152,571]]]'>Additionally, although the exception mandated today by the majority would seem to be a narrow one, experience has shown that it is not likely to remain so. One can only imagine the future cases in which it will be argued that although certain legal relationships and rights formerly terminated with death, they should no longer so terminate. The camel’s nose is under the tent, as it were. In sum, since there is no need for this new rule and since its creation can lead only to a clamoring for yet more extensions of a rule which should not have been extended in the first place, I would affirm the order of Superior Court.</p>
