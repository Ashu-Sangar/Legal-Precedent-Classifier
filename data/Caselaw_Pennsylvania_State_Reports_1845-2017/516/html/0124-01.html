The Human Relations Commission found that Faith Hodge was discharged from her employment because of her sex. It awarded back pay and interest, entered a “cease and desist” order, imposed various notice requirements designed to apprise Hodge and other potential female applicants of positions, and instituted a reporting system to monitor hiring practices. Commonwealth Court held that the Commission’s finding of discrimination was supported by substantial evidence and affirmed the order, 88 Pa.Cmwlth. 443, <a href="/citations/?q=489%20A.2d%201001" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="489 A.2d 1001">489 A.2d 1001</a>.

She had lived at Second East Hills until May of that year, when she left her employment as a City of Pittsburgh police officer in order to move to California. After her return, Hodge inquired of the resident manager of Second East Hills about a job as a security officer at the development. Hodge had known the manager from work with several community organizations around Pittsburgh. The resident manager, an employee of the defendant/appellant Allegheny Housing Rehabilitation Corporation, hired Hodge as a security officer in mid-August of 1978. Within a month he had assigned her additional duties and told her she was being designated “security manager” at Second East Hills. By letter dated November 2, 1978, slightly more than two months after Hodge had been hired, Allegheny Housing’s Director of Management, the resident manager’s superior, advised Hodge that her “services as Security Manager [had] been terminated due to the realignment of our security force.”</p>

In August of 1977, Allegheny Housing was hired as management agent of Second East Hills by the owner, Action Housing, which was at the time attempting to arrange a sale of the development. In 1978, Action Housing defaulted on its mortgage, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development assumed operation of the development as mortgagee in possession. Allegheny Housing was retained as the management agent by HUD. Pursuant to regulations governing developments where HUD was mortgagee in possession, in the summer of 1978 Allegheny Housing undertook the task of providing security services for Second East Hills within a budget amount imposed by HUD. Bids from several security firms were rejected as too high.

If such evidence is presented, the question for the Commission is whether, on <em>all </em>the evidence produced, the plaintiff has persuaded it by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer intentionally discriminated against her. Whether the plaintiff must eliminate a certain non-discriminatory reason as part of making a <em>prima facie </em>case, or discredit the evidence of that same reason produced by the employer after plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case has been made, the result is the same; the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[255,1191,1156,1151]]]'>There is bound to be confusion where, as here, part of the employer’s explanation attacks the plaintiff’s qualifications for the job. If a plaintiff must <em>prove </em>a <em>prima facie </em>case by producing the evidence of her qualifications before the defendant is obligated to proceed with a defense, there will almost of necessity be, at the close of the plaintiff’s case in chief, evidence that she was qualified sufficient to avoid dismissal. At that point no evidence has been admitted on the other side. When the employer then produces evidence of disqualification, this could be understood either as an attack on the elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case, or as an attempt to meet the employer’s burden of offering a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. Regardless of its characterization, however, its impact is the same. The employer, understandably, would prefer not to have to offer a defense at all until a more substantial case had been presented against it. Nevertheless, in the interest of having the ultimate question of discrimination resolved on the merits rather than for procedural failings such as lack of specificity, given the importance of circumstantial proof in such cases, it is appropriate to the remedial purpose of the Act that the prima facie case not be an onerous one.</p>

      <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>It was never intended, however, that the previously described analytical method would immunize members of “protected classes” from adverse employment decisions simply by dint of their class membership. Nothing about the Human Relations Act removes its operation from the bedrock concept of our jurisprudence that one who alleges wrongdoing must supply the proof. The stated analysis is no more than an aid to evaluating the proof. If the plaintiff produces sufficient evidence that, if believed and otherwise unexplained, indicates that more likely than not discrimination has occurred, the defendant must be heard in response. Absent a response, the “presumption” of discrimination arising from the plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case stands determinative of the factual issue of the case. In other words, if the employer rests without producing evidence, the plaintiff must prevail if he or she has produced sufficient evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case. If, however, the defendant offers a non-discriminatory explanation for the dismissal, the presumption drops from the case. As in any other civil litigation, the issue is joined, and the entire body of evidence produced by each side stands before the tribunal to be evaluated according to the preponderance standard: Has the plaintiff proven discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence? Stated otherwise, once the defendant offers evidence from which the trier of fact could rationally conclude that the decision was not discriminatorily motivated, the trier of fact must then “decide which party’s explanation of the employer’s motivation it believes.” <em>Aikens, </em><a href="/us/460/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="460 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="6198755" data-case-paths="/us/460/0711-01">460 U.S. at 716</a>, <a href="/us/460/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="460 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="6198755" data-case-paths="/us/460/0711-01">103 S.Ct. at 1482</a>. The plaintiff is, of course, free to present evidence and argument that the explanation offered by the employer is not worthy of belief or is otherwise inadequate in order to persuade the tribunal that her evidence does preponderate to prove discrimination.

C.P.U. 644 is a non-profit organization that functions as a hiring hall for individual security guards. Its members are all certified to carry firearms and have passed a psychological test administered by the state police. Unable to contract with a commercial security firm because of the HUD budget constraints, Allegheny Housing entered into an agreement with C.P.U. 644.

This approach is apparent in Conclusion of Law No. 8, where the Commission stated, “Respondent has failed to demonstrate that its conduct in terminating the Complainant did not violate the Act.

The same document contains an express statement that the employment criteria for security guards at Second East Hills were that they be “certified by the Pennsylvania State Police to carry a firearm, and have passed the psychological test administered by State Police.” By her own testimony, Hodge met neither of these criteria at the time she was hired at Second East Hills, although she had weapons certification while she was a police officer.

In response to AHRCO's [the employer’s] assertion that it was compelled to discharge Complainant from her position as Security Manager because there was no such position under the rules and regulations provided to AHRCO by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, the HRC stated that such explanation ignores the plain language of Complainant’s letter of termination which advised she was being terminated from the position of Security Manager and was mere pretext. Similarly, it rejected AHRCO's assertion that the "realignment” which it offered as explanation to Complainant in its letter to her informing her of her discharge was prompted by economic necessity as the “realignment” resulted in more rather than fewer security officers working at Second East Hills Park. Finally, it rejected, also as pretext, AHRCO's assertion that it was obligated to discharge Complainant because she was not a member of Certified Police Unit 644 (CPU 644) with whom AHRCO allegedly had an exclusive "hiring hall” arrangement with regard to its security staff. The HRC found as fact that Complainant had never been informed, either prior or subsequent to hire that membership in CPU 644 was a condition of employment and that if, indeed, there was such an exclusive relationship, no documentary evidence to support the assertion had been produced.</blockquote>

The majority seems to believe that, simply because the "presumption drops from the case" when an employer offers "legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons" for its actions, the mere articulation of non-discriminatory reasons (even if not believed) nullifies any <em>inference </em>of discrimination that could be raised by the evidence offered to demonstrate a prima facie case. It seems clear that, even though a complainant may not be entitled to rely on a "presumption" of discrimination once an employer advances <em>legitimate, </em>non-discriminatory reasons, nevertheless the evidence which complainant has offered to <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>support a prima facie case may still support an <em>inference </em>of discrimination to be weighed along with all of the evidence.</p>
