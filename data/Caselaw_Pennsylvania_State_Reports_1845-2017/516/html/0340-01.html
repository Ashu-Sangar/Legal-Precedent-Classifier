    <p id="b426-10" data-blocks='[["BL_426.8",426,[269,928,1156,745]]]'>The lengthy procedural history of appellee’s case is as follows. Appellee was convicted of murder of the first degree on April 4, 1973, in connection with the stabbing death of one Walter Yingling, in Harrisburg. His direct appeal which was filed with this Court was quashed because of noncompliance with our rules relating to the service of the notice of appeal; however, the appeal was later reinstated. In that appeal, appellee challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the adequacy of the charge regarding accomplice testimony, and trial counsel’s effectiveness for inadequately requesting an accomplice charge. The challenge failed, and we affirmed the judgment of sentence, per curiam, <em>Commonwealth v.

Failure to raise all claims that might have been raised in the first PCHA petition constitutes a waiver which will only be avoided by “extraordinary circumstances,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9544(b). Extraordinary circumstances have been variously defined by members of this Court, see, e.g., this author’s dissenting opinion in <em>Commonwealth v.
