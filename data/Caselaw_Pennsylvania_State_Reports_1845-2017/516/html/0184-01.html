On February 11, 1982 the trial court granted Hatchard’s discovery request for the production of “outtakes” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> but expressly excluded from discovery “any material where another source is revealed or where the material contains information which could reasonably lead to the disclosure of another source by the primary source____”</p>

That issue is especially significant because the “constitutionalization” of defamation law since <em>In re Taylor </em>has made it unmistakably clear that an affirmative answer to the question will immunize many individuals who maliciously or negligently publish false and defamatory statements about others from any legal responsibility for the serious harm caused to the reputation of the targeted individuals.</p>

That rule struck a balance between First Amendment concerns and the “strong and legitimate state interest in compensating private individuals for injury to reputation,” <em><a href="/us/418/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="418 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="6173012" data-case-paths="/us/418/0323-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/418/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="418 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="6173012" data-case-paths="/us/418/0323-01">at 348</a>, <a href="/us/418/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="418 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="6173012" data-case-paths="/us/418/0323-01">94 S.Ct. at 3011</a>, by requiring a lesser showing than actual malice in the case of a private individual and at the same time shielding the media from the rigors of strict liability. In one of the most recent developments in the constitutionalization process, the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment precludes a state from imposing on a media defendant the burden of proving the truth of a defamatory statement; proof of falsity thus became an additional element of the plaintiffs case. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v.

Thus, in attempting to shoulder the heavy burden of demonstrating “actual malice,” the plaintiff was entitled to discovery of the information available to the media defendant at the time of the defamatory publication to permit a meaningful inquiry into whether the statement was maliciously or recklessly made. If we were to embrace the broad interpretation of the Shield Law urged by appellees, even the <em>Herbert </em>Court’s rare concession to the defamation plaintiff would be negated. If unpublished information which would not reveal confidential sources could be withheld by the media defendant, it would be virtually impossible for the plaintiff to arrive at those facts of which the defendant was aware at the time of publication other than the defamatory information actually disseminated to the public.</p>
    <p id="b275-4" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[205,1338,1152,630]]]'>The immediate question before the court is whether the legislature has evidenced an intention to go so far as to preclude disclosure of all information in the possession of a media defendant in order to encourage a free flow of information to the news media. In light of the barriers to recovery already imposed by the First Amendment, if that question is answered in the affirmative, we must then face the issue of whether such an extreme exercise of legislative power to protect freedom of expression is compatible with the protection of other fundamental values protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution such as an individual’s reputation.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.6",275,[204,1994,1152,367]],["BL_276.1",276,[268,307,1150,414]]]'>It is obvious that in some instances documentary information can be disclosed to a plaintiff in a libel action without revealing the identity of the person who conveyed the information to the defendant in confidence.

Our task in ascertaining the legislative intent in the Shield Law is to determine how broad a shield the legislature intended to erect between an alleged defamer and its victim. We must therefore determine whether the legislature intended to shield from scrutiny <em>all </em>information that an alleged defamer had available to it prior to the publication of the defamatory statement, or only that information that could reveal a confidential informant.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[260,747,1157,1275]]]'>Since the legislature’s intent in this regard cannot be ascertained from a plain reading of the words in the Shield Law, we look to statutory purpose for guidance. The obvious purpose of the Shield Law is to maintain a free flow of information to members of the news media. <em>See, e.g., In re Taylor, supra </em><a href="/pa/412/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="412 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1887190" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0032-01">412 Pa. at 41</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.2d%20181" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="193 A.2d 181">193 A.2d at 185</a>. We fail to see how this purpose is promoted by protecting from discovery documentary information that was in the possession of the publisher of the defamatory statement where disclosure of this information would not reveal the identity of a confidential media-informant. While there may be some who would only share information with the media if the media enjoyed an absolute shield from any discovery in civil proceedings, providing an absolute shield could hardly be said to be necessary to effectuate the purpose of the Shield Law in light of the information that flows freely in states that have enacted more carefully-tailored shield laws and the considerable burden of proof imposed on a defamation plaintiff by the requirements of the First Amendment. We see no apparent reason why the objective of promoting the free flow of information to the media would be defeated so long as any documentary information that could lead to the discovery of the identity of a confidential informant is shielded frdm disclosure.</p>

Since the presumption of falsity may no longer be invoked in a defamation action in light of the United States Supreme Court’s reversal of our decision in <em>Hepps, </em>were we to interpret the Shield Law as broadly as the Superior Court we would face serious questions regarding the compatibility of the Shield Law and Article 1, Sections 1 and 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.6",278,[261,1607,1153,745]],["BL_279.1",279,[225,290,1152,1452]]]'>Under standards mandated by the federal constitution, a plaintiff who claims harm to a fundamental interest protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution would face the burden of proving that a defamatory statement was maliciously or negligently published and that the statement was false. On the other hand, the media defendant who is alleged to be a malicious or negligent defamer would have carte blanche to withhold from judicial scrutiny any documentary information in his possession that it did not voluntarily publish. It is difficult to see how any “fundamental interest” protected by our State Constitution could survive such a legal scheme. Citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would in effect hold a fundamental right protected by the State Constitution; yet when the fundamental right was seriously <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>damaged the courts could offer a meaningful remedy in only the rarest of cases. We decline to impute such an intention to the legislature. We therefore conclude that, to the extent that language in <em>In re Taylor </em>may be read as interpreting the Shield Law to protect from discovery, in defamation actions, documentary material that could not reasonably lead to the discovery of the identity of a confidential media-informant, that decision interpreted the Shield Law much too broadly. Given the present state of First Amendment jurisprudence, such an interpretation would not adequately protect the fundamental right of reputation guaranteed to the citizens of this Commonwealth. We therefore hold that unpublished documentary information gathered by a television station is discoverable by a plaintiff in a libel action to the extent that the documentary information does not reveal the identity of a personal source of information or may be redacted to eliminate the revelation of a personal source of information. Since the trial court order allowing discovery in <em>Hatchard </em>was limited to information that could not reasonably lead to the discovery of the identity of personal sources of information, the Superior Court’s order disallowing such discovery must be reversed. Since the trial court’s order in <em>Lefkoski </em>was not limited expressly in this manner, the Superior Court’s order disallowing all of the requested discovery must be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for the entry of an order consistent with this opinion.</p>
