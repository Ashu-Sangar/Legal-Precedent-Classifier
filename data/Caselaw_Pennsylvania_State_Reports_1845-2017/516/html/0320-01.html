    <p id="b406-4" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[281,869,1156,1077]]]'>After an evidentiary hearing regarding the corporations’ tax liability was conducted, and during the pendency of the decision on the merits, the Commonwealth secured a writ of execution and attempted to execute on its lien for unpaid taxes. The property subject to execution is a twenty-seven acre tract of land in Lehigh County. The corporations sought relief in Commonwealth Court, requesting a stay of execution, reduction of the bond amount prescribed by Pa.R.A.P. 1782 and substitution of a letter of credit for the Rule 1782 bond. In opposition, the Commonwealth asserted, without further elucidation, that delay in collection of the deficiency “may result in no assets or insufficient assets to satisfy the tax assessments, plus penalty and interest.” A hearing on the petition was scheduled, however, no evidence was presented. Because the corporations neither complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1782 to secure an automatic stay of the execution sale, nor presented evidence warranting the grant of other relief, the court below denied the stay, 92 Pa.Cmwlth. 427, <a href="/citations/?q=499%20A.2d%20406" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="499 A.2d 406">499 A.2d 406</a>.

Nahill, </em><a href="/pa/484/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="484 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1753738" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0441-01">484 Pa. 441</a>, 447, <a href="/pa/484/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="484 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1753738" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0441-01">399 A.2d 374</a>, 377 (1979). This principle takes on special significance when the property involved is realty. Realty has long been considered unique, for, unlike cash or other types of liquid assets, realty, if improperly disposed of at a tax sale, may be forever lost. Thus, faced with the loss of real property which the corporations used in their business to store and repair equipment, they sought a stay of execution in Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[221,994,1153,1003]]]'>The corporations did not seek a stay according to the prescriptions of <em>PA. Public Utility Commission v.

These requirements were not met. For instance, as for the first requirement, the corporations averred simply that, in the opinion of their legal counsel, they would prevail on the merits of their tax deficiency assessment case. Such hardly amounts to a <em>strong showing of the likelihood of success. </em>Neither did the corporations comply with the third and fourth requirements enumerated above.
