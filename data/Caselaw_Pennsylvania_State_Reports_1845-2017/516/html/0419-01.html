    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[193,417,1150,420]]]'>C.A.E. is a very small child, suffering from retarded physical development and many respiratory problems. He requires compulsive medical care, which a layperson may be trained to give with long-term, rigorous training. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 51). His condition is such that any lower respiratory tract disease could be lethal. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 50). Also, the child’s condition will continue to be critical for at least several years of his life. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 50).</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[193,855,1151,628]]]'>The doctor who treated C.A.E. when he was born testified concerning the child’s condition and about Appellee’s capacity to care for the child. He opined that Appellee is incapable of caring for C.A.E., mainly because she was uncommitted to the fact that medical care would save the baby’s life. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 53). Appellee’s psychotherapist also testified that he did not think Appellee was capable of giving the kind of care necessary for C.A.E.’s survival. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 70). He thought that Appellee’s current pregnancy and the fact that she was soon going to regain custody of another child would put considerable stress on her and be too much for her to handle with C.A.E.</p>

(N.T. 1/31/84, pp. 11, 28-9). A physician testified that Appellee had placed a pyramid shaped object with an eye in the center on the baby’s crib, instructed the hospital to use eucalyptus leaves in treating the baby, and brought faith healers to the hospital to cure the child.

She stated that her long absences from visiting the child were caused by her unstable emotional state, use of excessive medicine and trouble in her personal life. (N.T. 2/23/84, pp. 43, 45, 47-50).

Since these conclusions were supported by the record, they should not have been disturbed.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.6",508,[259,805,1157,1225]]]'>Superior Court injected another factor into its decision by overturning a credibility determination of the lower court.

It is clear, however, that the trial court found that history indicates that Appellee does not have the capacity to ever care for C.A.E.

Once a child has been placed in foster care, a parent has an “affirmative duty to work towards the return of the child.” <em>In re Adoption of J.J., </em><a href="/pa/511/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="511 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="1798682" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0590-01">511 Pa. 590</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="511 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="1798682" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0590-01">515 A.2d 883</a>, 890 (1986) (quoting <em>In re: William L., </em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">477 Pa. 322</a>, 333, <a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">383 A.2d 1228</a>, 1233 (1978)). Appellee has done nothing to work toward that goal, other than to petition the court for custody, and make sporadic visits to the child. The only evidence presented that indicated that Appellee would be capable of caring for C.A.E. was Appellee’s own testimony, which the trial court obviously regarded as incredible. To make a conclusion that Appellee would be capable of caring for the child, then, Superior Court erroneously disregarded the trial court’s finding that Appellee’s testimony was not credible.</p>

In an action for the termination of the rights of a natural parent or parents, the court must exercise the circumspection that the gravity of that action deserves. Once a proper environment is secured for the infant, the urgency of the situation is removed and the immediate well being of the child is secure. Where the incapacity of the parent is asserted as the basis for the severance of a parental relationship, termination of parental rights should not be sustained until it is absolutely certain that no meaningful relationship can be maintained with the natural parent or parents. Experience has shown that the natural bond is stronger than any economic advantages an adoption can provide.</p>

Her inability to spend sufficient time at the hospital with her child to learn all that was necessary for his care was due to her work at some distance from the hospital in addition to emotional stress due to the premature birth of this child and his two siblings, the death of those siblings, the presence of two other small children, another pregnancy and other influences. The mother has, however, made improvements in her condition through psychotherapy! In addition, she has received training in Child and Infant Life Support Systems (infant CPR), cared for her other children, and maintained a new residence. She has also professed an intention to learn to give this child the medical attention he requires. All these facts were accepted by the Orphans’ Court.</p>
    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.7",510,[291,1544,1154,580]]]'>The critical basis for the Orphans’ Court’s decision to terminate this mother’s parental rights is that her “professed good intentions for the future to the contrary notwithstanding, the history indicates that such neglect and incapacity will not be remedied.” In other words, because the mother failed in the first instance to get the training she needed to properly administer the medical attention required by the child, the court concluded that she will again fail to get this training. In view of the mother’s accomplishments in improving her living conditions, the wisdom of the Orphans’ Court’s ruling is questionable.</p>

Superior Court interpreted this language as prospective and reversed the lower court on the ground that the mother should yet be afforded a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate her professed interest in attending to her child’s medical needs. Absent such an opportunity, in light of the remarkable improvements already implemented by the mother, Superior Court reasoned that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that she will again fail to learn the techniques required by her child’s medical condition. In my view, Superior Court’s interpretation of the statutory language as prospective is correct; and the error in the Orphans’ Court’s disregard of the mother’s accomplishments in favor of an assumption that, simply because she failed in the first instance to learn whatever is required to attend to her child’s medical needs, she will again fail is, to me, inescapable.</p>

The question here is whether, without affording the mother an opportunity to learn to provide the medical attention this child requires, her parental rights should be terminated over her opposition.
