Cohen understood that Stolker wanted to meet someone who could help smooth out the feathers of union officials which Stolker had ruffled because he was hiring non-union workers on his construction jobs. Stolker, on the other hand, claims that he wanted to hire a security guard/night watchman and/or occasional bill collector, and in return for performing these services, this person would be furnished a unit in the rental properties he was building as his residence. The mutual acquaintance suggested Cohen to Stolker and arranged a meeting between the two, after which some sort of understanding was reached which is the basis of the instant action.</p>

Cohen died prior to trial, and his deposition, together with the live testimony of Mrs. Cohen and Mr. and Mrs. Stolker, was received by the Chancellor, along with a few others, in an attempt to establish whether an enforceable oral contract for the sale of land existed between Cohen and Stolker. The Chancellor, the former Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, Bernard Snyder, ruled in favor of Mrs. Cohen and directed that Stolker convey Unit 1 to her and pay her an additional $33,350.00 in damages and entered a final decree to that effect on May 9, 1984. Stolker took an appeal from that decree to the Superior Court which, as <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>previously noted, affirmed the Chancellor by per curiam order.</p>

Cohen attempted to demonstrate that he paid the purchase price by alleging that he paid $125.00 weekly to Stolker, that Stolker had him on his payroll at $100.00 per week for four years, and that Jimmy Hoffa gave Cohen $10,000.00 which, in turn, was given to Stolker, and that all these payments were to be credited to the $37,500.00 purchase price. Receipts were not produced for any of these cash payments. Cohen also asserted that he spent over $21,000.00 on the three units in maintenance and improvements.

Stolker had receipts in the form of W-2 forms for the years 1973 to 1976, inclusive, showing that payments had been made to Cohen and also introduced into evidence his rental log for the years in question which listed Cohen as a tenant.</p>
