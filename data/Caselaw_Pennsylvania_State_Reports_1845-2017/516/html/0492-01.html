Mr. Geyer soon expressed his interest in marriage, but the appellant was reluctant to marry a third time. Nevertheless she eventually consented to the union and the couple married on January 9, 1977.</p>
    <p id="b579-10" data-blocks='[["BL_579.11",579,[227,1483,1152,532]]]'>In January of 1977, George Geyer was 68 years old. He had one adult son residing in California, five grandchildren, and six great grandchildren. By all accounts Mr. Geyer was an astute businessman who successfully operated and expanded the family enterprises. His net estate at the time of his marriage to Rosalie Werner was approximately 594,-000 dollars. A substantial portion of this wealth was composed of the family business, but the decedent also had extensive real estate holdings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> He was established in the community and enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle.</p>

After selling their marital home in Illinois she moved to Pennsylvania in order to be nearer her sister. Thus when she met George Geyer in October, 1976, she was relatively new to the locale, having resided there only since the previous August. Though she possessed no substantial business experience the appellant realized a modest income from her skills as a pianist.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Additionally, she received a Navy pension as a result of her second husband’s military service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Rosalie Werner’s net estate was worth approximately 39,000 dollars in January of 1977.</p>

Those terms indicate that in return for appellant’s agreement to surrender her right to elect approximately 300,000 dollars the decedent agreed to convey 20,000 dollars, title to the marital residence, and unspecified household furnishings subject to decedent’s option to make unlimited exceptions.

An antenuptial agreement, like any other agreement, must be construed in light of general principles of contract law. Thus, if the parties do not negotiate at arms length, the validity of any resulting contract is at issue. In <em>In re Hillegass Estate, </em><a href="/pa/431/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="431 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1917381" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0144-01">431 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20672" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="244 A.2d 672">244 A.2d 672</a> (1968), we held that as a matter of public policy antenuptial agreements must be given special consideration because of the relationship between the parties. However, this does not mean that we can ignore traditional contract principles in evaluating a prenuptial agreement. Thus, in disposing of this appeal, we must first look to the agreement itself to determine whether there has been a full disclosure as set forth in paragraph 7 of the agreement. A presumption arises that full disclosure has been made if the agreement so provides. However, this presumption can be rebutted upon a showing of fraud or misrepresentation. In this case, the trial court determined that the decedent misrepresented to the Appellant Ms ownership interest in Geyer Kraft Korner. This is a material omission which is sufficient to rebut the plain language of paragraph 7 of the agreement. Accordingly, I join in the Court’s disposition and would hold that the decedent did not comply with the terms of the agreement, i.e. give the Appellant full disclosure of all his property.</p>

Under present law, full and fair disclosure is not required until it is first determined by a reviewing court that the provision for the surviving spouse under the ante-nuptial agreement was not adequate. It is only after a finding that the provision for the surviving spouse was not sufficient to enable him or her to live “comfortably” after the death of the other partner to the marriage, in substantially the same way as that spouse had previously lived, that the issue of disclosure can be raised to save the validity of the agreement.

Appellant was 56 years of age and had three children from a previous marriage; decedent was 68 years of age with one son from his first marriage, five grandchildren and six great grandchildren. Shortly thereafter decedent expressed interest in marriage. Appellant was initially reluctant because remarriage would cause her to lose a Navy pension, based upon her second husband’s military service. She also expressed her desire to own her own home. An agreement dated December 30, 1976, was signed by the parties in which decedent agreed to give or bequeath a sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) to replace the Navy pension and to give his residence, free of encumbrances, plus the furnishings therein (less those specifically designated for his child or grandchildren) to appellant if appellant survived him.

Quite frequently both spouses are wage earners and there are instances where the wife’s income or earning capacity exceeds that of the husband. Although, unfortunately, we have as yet to reach sexual equality in the market place, there are compelling forces moving in that direction and hopefully the objective will be obtained in the near future. Additionally, there is now a strong public policy of constitutional dimension in this Commonwealth prohibiting any sexual discrimination in our laws. Pa. Const, art. 1, § 28; <em>DiFlorido v.

However, we do not serve the cause of true equality by creating legal fictions, even when those fictions are designed to protect against some of these inequities.

Numerous societal changes have impacted upon family units in recent times, and the law has advanced accordingly to recognize the equal status of men and women in our society. No longer are women regarded as the “weaker” party in a marriage, or in society generally. Accordingly, the law has discarded presumptions and protections that arose to protect women from the inferiorities and incapacities which they were perceived as having in earlier times.</p>

Certainly, it is not surprising that persons may attempt to reap the benefits of being “equal,” while asserting the need for special protections in areas where it would be self-serving to assert certain limited inequalities. To enjoy the benefits of being equal, however, without sharing in the burdens thereof, would be unsupportable. In recognition of this, the law has accorded equal rights to all spouses, without reference to gender. In the context of the instant case, where the validity of an ante-nuptial agreement is at issue, there is no basis for allowing to stand an implicit presumption that spouses are of unequal status or not knowledgeable enough to understand the nature of the contracts they enter. If, in fact, there is fraud, misrepresentation, or overreaching, then traditional principles of contract law provide an adequate remedy.</p>
