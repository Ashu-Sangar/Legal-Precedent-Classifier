These charges arose from appellee shooting Gerald Colwell in the back on August 9, 1983. Appellee’s post-trial motions were denied on June 18, 1984, and appellee was sentenced on September 17, 1984 to a term of imprisonment of 5 to 10 years on the conviction for aggravated assault, and a consecutive term of probation of 5 years for the firearms conviction. On direct appeal in Superior Court appellee raised the following claims of error:</p>

Appellee pursued the victim a short distance to a group of women working at an outdoor refreshment stand for a local church benefit. The victim used one of the women at the refreshment stand to shield himself from appellee. Eventually, the victim pushed his human shield aside and attempted to run from appellee. Appellee then shot the victim once in the back from a distance of 5 to 6 feet. Appellee returned to his car, which his friend was now driving, and left the scene. At the time of trial, the victim was paralyzed from the waist down due to the wound inflicted by appellee. This evidence was presented through the testimony of the victim which was corroborated in all material aspects by the testimony of two women who had been working at the refreshment stand, and one other eyewitness to the shooting.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
