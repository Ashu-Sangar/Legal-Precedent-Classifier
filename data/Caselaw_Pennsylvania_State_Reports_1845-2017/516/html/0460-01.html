Appellant and his mother, the victim, were the sole residents of his mother’s house in Mechanicsburg. By late 1984 the relationship between the two had become so strained that Mrs. Jermyn revoked a will, drafted in 1981, which had named appellant as her sole heir and executor, and had her attorney draft a new will devising her Mechanicsburg property and the residue of her estate to a niece. Appellant was to receive half the proceeds of the sale of the real estate only if the niece declined to live in the Jermyn home, with the further condition that appellant would be entitled to those funds only if Mrs. Jermyn died of natural or accidental causes. Simultaneously with the execution of the new will, Mrs. Jermyn had her attorney draft a letter notifying appellant of his eviction in sixty days, <em>i.e., </em>on or about January 1, 1985. Appellant was aware of the terms of the new will and received his eviction notice, which angered him. Appellant told Eugene Gramm, a former employee of appellant’s leather business, Fast Fred’s Motorcycle Accessories, that he was going to kill Mrs. Jermyn. Appellant made no preparations to move out.</p>

He then attempted to ignite her mattress by placing cigarettes under her sheets; Mrs. Jermyn reputedly smoked in bed. When this failed, appellant lit the mattress in three separate locations with an open flame, and left the house. The fire filled the room with soot and produced sufficient carbon monoxide to cause Mrs. Jermyn’s death by asphyxiation. After visiting several bars, appellant returned home at about 4:00 a.m. on January 1,1985, and went to bed. At approximately 1:39 p.m. the following afternoon, appellent called an emergency telephone number and told the dispatcher: “Yeah, there’s a funny stink cornin’ out of my mom’s bed room [sic] and she won’t answer the door.” R.R. 896a. Appellant further stated that the door to his mother’s room was locked and he couldn’t get in, a statement he repeated to the chief of police when he responded to appellant’s emergency call. The police chief used a screwdriver to open the door and <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>discovered Mrs. Jermyn’s body on the floor just inside. An autopsy subsequently revealed that among the injuries sustained by Mrs. Jermyn were bruises which could have been produced by a studded armband appellant was seen wearing at a bar on the evening of December 31, 1984. A similar armband was recovered during a search of appellant’s automobile.</p>

Appellant asked Gramm to drive him to New York but Gramm refused. Gramm reported this conversation to the police the following day. While incarcerated in the Cumberland County Prison after his arrest on January 4, 1985, appellant told Dean Barnes, a fellow inmate, he was glad he “torched the bitch.” RR 623a, 624a. Appellant also informed Barnes that, in support of his insanity defense, he was going to tell the jury that he had done the world a favor, and that “his mother had come from Satan and he had sent her back to Satan.” RR 623a.</p>

Appellant’s first argument is that he was denied his constitutional right to be heard by the rulings of the trial court, or alternatively, that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to implement a strategy that would have permitted the exercise of that right. In our view, the true nature of this objection is misstated. The right of an accused to testify in his own behalf is a fundamental tenet of American jurisprudence and is explicitly guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Constitution. Pa. Const. Art. I, § 9. The decision as to whether to exercise that right is personal to the accused. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Such evidence “is offered as a response to environment, not to prove anything that may be asserted, and is not hearsay.” C. McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>§ 294, at 846 (3d ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). The poem in question would arguably have been admissible for such a purpose and made the subject of expert testimony as to the abnormality of the responses to environment expressed therein. The issue, however, is not the admissibility of the poem <em>as a writing; </em>the poem had already been admitted as a Commonwealth exhibit. Rather, the argument being advanced is that appellant’s right to be heard encompassed the right to <em>read </em>the poem to the jury in open court, “with his own emphasis of meaning placed upon it [,]” Brief for Appellant at 14, as a means of establishing that the poem was not, as the Commonwealth had attempted to establish, merely a contrivance designed to support an insanity defense. In other words, the recital of the poem was intended to establish that the delusions portrayed therein were genuine through the manner in which the poem was read. While such a demonstration might have had a significant impact upon the jury, we are constrained to conclude that it was properly excluded as evidence.</p>

      <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>In our adversary system of criminal justice, the defendant, like any other witness, is called to the stand to testify under oath by answering questions designed to elicit relevant facts. Appellant elected to take the witness stand, not to testify as to either the circumstances surrounding the crime or his mental condition during the commission of the crime, but to read a prepared statement, in verse form, directed at the jury. The obvious purpose of this statement was to dramatize appellant’s purported delusions and display his demeanor, thus inducing a subjective response in the minds of the jurors as to his mental condition. Such a demonstration would have been subject to no evidentiary constraints and would have insulated the underlying testimonial assertion, i.e., that appellant was legally insane at the time of the crime, from meaningful cross-examination. Defense counsel had already been successful in presenting such “direct” evidence of insanity by placing appellant on the witness stand, albeit reluctantly, and eliciting testimony as to appellant’s abnormal responses to being prosecuted for a capital offense. The Commonwealth was unable to cross-examine appellant as to his involvement in the crime. While the jury was ultimately instructed to decide the case as if appellant had not exercised his right to be heard, RR. 797a, 849a, the jury’s reactions to appellant’s answers and demeanor undoubtedly were somewhat successful in creating the desired impression. Any further attempt to demonstrate appellant’s alleged mental illness would have taken the proceedings out of the realm of the factfinding process and into that of inflammation and speculation, if not that of theater, and it was within the discretion of the trial court to limit such a display on evidentiary grounds. <em>See Williams v.

Appellant nevertheless maintains that his psychiatric records were admitted into evidence <em>in toto </em>without objection. It is true that the psychiatric records were admitted as a defense exhibit. RR 778a-774a. However, the trial court withheld its ruling on whether the exhibit could be examined by the jury during deliberations and subsequently ruled that the opinions in the exhibit were hearsay and not independently admissible. RR 791a. Thus it is obvious that the records were admitted solely for the purpose for which they had already been used, namely, as a source of information on which the defense phsychiatrist testified that he relied upon in forming his opinion as to appellant’s mental condition at the time of the crime, not as independent substantive evidence on the issue of legal insanity. As such, it was appropriate for the trial court to limit defense counsel’s comments on the opinions contained in the exhibit to those which formed a part of the expert’s testimony.</p>

That principle does not extend to instances in which the defendant does not remain silent but instead volunteers equivocal responses to police questioning. <em>Commonwealth v.

He elected to respond to the police officer’s accusations in an equivocal fashion, neither admitting nor <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>denying guilt but implicitly challenging the police to prove their charge.

Arson, as pertinent here, is defined by § 3301(a) (1973), as the intentional starting of a fire ... thereby recklessly placing another person in danger of death or bodily injury. Criminal attempt (murder of the first degree) is defined in §§ 901 and 2502 of the Crimes Code. Under § 901(a), a person commits an attempt when with intent to commit a specific crime he does any act which consti<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>tutes a substantial step toward the commission of that crime. Under § 2502(a), a criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when committed by an intentional killing. Here, the Appellee intended to, and did, accomplish the crime of arson, and he also intended, and attempted but failed, to accomplish three killings in the perpetration of arson. Obviously, the crime of attempted murder is of a class separate from the crime of arson and each class involves proof of one or more factual elements not common to the other. In order to prove attempted first degree murder, the Commonwealth had to prove a specific intent to kill. Mere evidence of the intentional setting of a fire does not prove intent to kill. Appellee’s intent to kill was proven by evidence of his state of mind just prior to setting the fire. Thus, the crimes involve separate essential elements for which additional evidence was necessary. Intent to endanger persons is not a necessary element of arson endangering persons; the intentional setting of a fire must merely result in recklessly placing another in danger of death or bodily injury. Thus, the state of mind evidence that Appellee intended to kill the occupants was not necessary to prove the arson, but was necessary to prove the attempted first degree murder. There is no reason in law or logic to conclude that a criminal who deliberately chose to commit both arson and murder by the same incendiary course of conduct necessarily and as a matter of law committed but one crime which can only be subjected to one punishment.</blockquote>

Thus, in order to prevail on the instant issue it would be incumbent upon appellant to demonstrate that trial counsel’s failure to sepcifically ask prospective jurors if they would automatically vote to impose the death penalty resulted in the impanelling of a jury on which one or more jurors were so predisposed. However, this issue is raised purely in the abstract, in that no challenge has been raised as to the overall performance of trial counsel in conducting <em>voir dire. </em>In this context it is to be noted that the proceedings have not even been made a part of the record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This alone would justify rejecting the instant argument.</p>

In addition, those venirepersons thought to be unfavorably disposed to the positions of the respective parties may be removed through the exercise of peremptory challenges. The mere fact that counsel may not have posed the specific question as to whether a prospective juror would vote for a sentence of life imprisonment in an appropriate case does not justify the conclusion that counsel failed to assure that a fair and impartial jury was selected.

The theoretical underpinning of this bifurcation argüment is, of course, that death-qualified juries are “prosecution-prone,” a contention that has been consistently rejected by this Court on state as well as federal constitutional grounds. <em>See Commonwealth v.
