The latter court had reversed the grant of a variance by the Harmony Township Zoning Hearing Board. The variance would have permitted appellants to construct a two-story addition to their residence, consisting of a two-car garage on the ground level, and two rooms and a bath on the upper floor. Their plan of construction did not conform to the requirements of the township zoning ordinance in that it did not allow a thirty foot setback from the front property line.</p>

They next applied to the Township Zoning Hearing Board (Board) for a variance from the ordinance requirement.

On October 6, 1981, the construction all but completed, appellants’ next-door neighbors, Samuel and Georgia Leopardi, timely filed an appeal of the Board’s action in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County.

    <blockquote id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[255,516,1109,262]]]'>An appellate court <em>may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any order brought before it for review </em>and may remand the matter and direct the entry of such appropriate order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.</blockquote>

This section limits the power of an appellate court to an award of relief which could have been entered by the tribunal from which the appeal was taken. Thus an appellate court has the power to do what the lower tribunal ought to have done; but that court has no power to create or manufacture a remedy which would have been outside the capabilities of that lower tribunal. This is so because the power of the appellate court to modify a judgment is limited by the jurisdictional powers of the tribunal below. It can give no judgment on appeal which the lower court was incompetent to render. 5B C.J.S. § 1874(b). <em>See Fry’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/270/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="270 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1066055" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0024-01">270 Pa. 24</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%20757" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="112 A. 757">112 A. 757</a> (1921). In many cases this may seem but a technical delay of the inevitable, and but a wait before the consequences to follow the holding of the Court. However clear that may appear it is less important than an improper exercise of powers not given.</p>

As has been shown the zoning hearing board did not possess the power to order the destruction of an offending structure. As a consequence the common pleas court, on appeal, had no such power. Therefore, so much of its order as required the removal of the garage was beyond its power as an appellate tribunal.</p>

As the Commonwealth Court did in this case, courts have used the characterization <em>"de novo" to </em>describe the posture of a zoning appeal when the trial court takes additional evidence; yet that terminology does not appear in the statute itself. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 11010. We note that the phrase does appear in other places in the laws of the Commonwealth. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 6006(a)(1). Our comments today are not specifically directed toward the meaning of <em>de novo </em>review <em>per se, </em>but only to the meaning of the phrase as it has evolved in Pennsylvania zoning law.</p>
