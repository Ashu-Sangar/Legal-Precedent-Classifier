The problem in this prosecution arose when the Commonwealth failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case at the original preliminary hearing. As noted above the Superior Court reversed, construing Rule 130(d) as establishing “a time limit within which the Commonwealth must file <em>supportable </em>charges,” <a href="/pa-super/345/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="345 Pa. Super. 481" data-case-ids="639119" data-case-paths="/pa-super/345/0481-01">345 Pa.Super. at 486-87</a>, <a href="/pa-super/345/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="345 Pa.

    <p id="b158-7" data-blocks='[["BL_158.7",158,[272,1166,1160,1178]]]'>The Superior Court’s interpretation of Rule 130(d) is itself without support, and is effectively a rewriting of the rule to include a significant element which the drafters did not deem warranted. It is a fundamental rule of construction that the letter of the law is “not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). In this case the Superior Court, under the guise of pursuing the spirit of this law, deemed to change the clear letter of the law. This we cannot allow. Since Rule 130(d) contains no express requirement that “supportable” charges be filed within five days we will not read that element into it. Instead, we believe Mr. Hatcher stands in the same position as all other criminal defendants who are subjected to re-arrest after a favorable preliminary hearing determination. <em>See Commonwealth v. Genovese, </em><a href="/pa/493/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="493 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="8731543" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0065-01">493 Pa. 65</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="493 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="8731543" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0065-01">425 A.2d 367</a> (1981). Thus, a defendant can be re-arrested after a favorable preliminary hearing determination “provided that it is done within the period prescribed by the statute of limitations for the charges in question.” <em>Commonwealth v. Hetherington, </em><a href="/pa/460/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="460 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="482849" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0017-01">460 Pa. 17</a>, 23, <a href="/pa/460/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="460 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="482849" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0017-01">331 A.2d 205</a>, 208 (1975). Where the arrest is for a crime which falls under Rule 130, the Rule will apply from the date of the re-arrest.</p>
