The evidence presented by the objectors consisted of testimony of various residents of the Soho/Bluff area of Pittsburgh. The testimony showed that many of the residents perceived that the addition of the center to the neighborhood would ruin the neighborhood for various reasons. R. 26a-28a. For example, there were statements made concerning the high crime rate in the area, the number of bars in the area, and the existence of a house of prostitution in the area. There was also concern voiced about the numerous elderly and female residents in the area. Finally, concern over the effect on property values which would be caused by the center was expressed. The testimony of the neighborhood’s residents, however, was not substantiated by facts but was no more than their bald assertions, personal opinions, and perceptions of the pre-release center and the area. They did not present any studies, police records, property valuations or any type of substantive evidence upon which their fears were based, which would lead a reasonable mind to conclude that the facility would be detrimental to the community’s general welfare. Although it had ample opportunity to do so at prior stages of these proceedings, the City, for whatever reason, failed to introduce any evidence to bolster the claims voiced by the objectors.</p>

The City Council of the City of Pittsburgh, <em>in considering applications for conditional uses, </em>is required to comply with the formalities of the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 553,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> and enter an adjudication in compliance with § 555<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>
      <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>of said law. The Local Agency Law is applicable in such a case because, when the City Council acts on a conditional use application, Council is acting in an administrative, not a legislative, capacity. It has been held that the act of approving or disapproving a conditional use application establishes no rule of general application, as the passage of an ordinance does, and that City Council essentially is only approving or rejecting the issuance of a permit, nothing more. <em>See, North Point Breeze Coalition v.

      <em>North Point Breeze, supra. </em>There is little question that Pittsburgh’s City Council, like its Zoning Board of Adjustment, is a local agency when it acts administratively, and that a resolution disposing of a conditional use application is an “adjudica<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>tion” within the meaning of the Local Agency Law. 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 101.</p>

The adjudication is not accompanied, however, by any findings of fact or reasons or even a record which <em>Council </em>compiled or adopted as its own at a hearing before it. At each level of review, an <em>assumption </em>has been made that City Council has acted based upon the recommendation of the City Planning Commission, but nowhere in the record is it indicated that City Council read this record, adopted the record and recommendations for its own, or that it relied on other reasons for denying the application.
