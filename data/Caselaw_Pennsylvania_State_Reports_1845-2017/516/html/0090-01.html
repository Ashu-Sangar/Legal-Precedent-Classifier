The investigation was carried out by undercover FBI men posing as agents of a fictitious Arab sheik who was interested supposedly in immigrating to the United States and building a multi-million dollar hotel in Philadelphia. In order to facilitate these interests, the agents of the sheik were willing to pay money in exchange for the votes and/or friendly intercession of government officials on the sheik’s behalf.</p>

Hughes filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia objecting to the Jannotti nomination on the grounds that Jannotti had been convicted of an “infamous crime” and that under the Pennsylvania Constitution he was barred from holding public office. The Common Pleas Court held that Jannotti’s conviction was not for an “infamous crime,” dismissed the Hughes petition with prejudice, and ordered that Jannotti’s name be placed on the primary ballot. On appeal, Commonwealth Court reversed and held that Jannotti’s conviction was for a crime “involving the receipt of payments relating to his performance of the duties and powers of his public office,” and thus, that the conviction was for a crime which was tantamount to bribery, which has been defined as “infamous.”</p>

This is so because although the term “infamous crime” is not self-defining, when the language of Article II, Section 7 enumerates the crimes of bribery, embezzlement of public moneys, and perjury, followed by the words “or <em>other </em>infamous crime,” the necessary implication is that the three enumerated crimes are “infamous.” Therefore, if the facts underlying Jannotti’s conviction would support a conviction for bribery under Pennsylvania law, then Jannotti’s federal conviction, however it may be named in federal law, would be for an “infamous” crime.</p>

Under Greco-Roman Law, the term “crimen falsi” embraces such crimes as perjury, subornation of perjury, barratry, conspiracy, swindling, cheating, and other similar acts. Roman law, defined infamy by the nature of the act. Definition by punishment entered Anglo-American jurisprudence at the time when the concept of felony was developed, and both Sir Matthew Hale, Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench and Sir William Blackstone of Common Pleas embodied this interpretation into seventeenth and eighteenth century English common law. After the adoption of the Federal Constitution, the two forms existed side-by-side, although the punishment thesis has been ascendant. Contempory American jurisprudence, nevertheless, has rediscovered the ancient Greco-Roman form of infamy which derived from acts of fraud and dishonesty affecting the public confidence.
