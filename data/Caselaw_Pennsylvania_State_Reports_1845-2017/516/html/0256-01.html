Though at the time of the referee’s decision he was not required to make a finding that Ms. Farkaly was referred to these jobs, the testimony in the record is undisputed that the information about these jobs was effectively conveyed to the claimant. In this regard employer’s vocational expert, after describing the jobs, testified that “[a]ll these jobs were made known to [her] attorney.” Deposition, Lawrence Thayer, March 18, 1982. Unlike <em>Kachinski, </em>where only general overtures were made to claimant's counsel, here the employer did everything possible to convey the information to the claimant, and thus we think the employer fulfilled its burden of referring the claimant to available work.</p>

However, in our decision in <em>Kachinski </em>we held that the threshold burden of an employer is to show that he referred the claimant to a job within the category for which the claimant received medical clearance. <em>Kachinski v.
