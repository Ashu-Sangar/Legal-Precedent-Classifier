During the summer of 1981, Appellant was contemplating the purchase of real estate located in Allegheny County. Prior to entering into an agreement with the vendor of the property, Ms. Helen Hulbert, Appellant sought to determine whether any judgments had been entered against the vendor or her property which would impair his ownership interest in the realty. Appellant went to the Prothonotary’s Office and asked the Deputy Prothonotary to make a search of the records of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for any judgment that may have been on record against Ms. Hulbert or the property. The Deputy Prothonotary made a search, collected a fee of $15.00, and issued a certificate which stated:</p>

Further, he was advised that he was required to pay off the lien or the property would be subjected to foreclosure proceedings by the holders of the lien. This judgment had been entered against the property in the official records of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County on December 18, 1978, which date was within the period covered by the certificate.</p>

Appellee filed preliminary objections alleging that the complaint was not specific and that it failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted. On October 2, 1984, the Court of Common Pleas issued an Order sustaining Appellee’s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and dismissing Appellant’s complaint. The basis of this decision was the court’s determination that “the Prothonotary is liable for the negligent acts of the servants, agents, and employees of his office only if he directed that the acts be done ... [and] that the Prothonotary is authorized to issue certified judgment or lien searches only for the purposes referred to by statute____”</p>

Subsequent to plaintiff’s purchase of the property, it was discovered that there was <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>another judgment which had not been reported in the certificate, and which he was required to pay.

The common law of Pennsylvania has always been that the Prothonotary has the power to make searches and issue certifications and exemplifications of the documents and records in his office without regard to the purpose for which such certification is obtained. Superior Court’s determination that the Prothonotary is authorized to issue a no-lien certificate only in a change-of-name context is contrary to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 2737 and the historic interpretation of the common law duties of the Prothonotary.</p>

Appellant merely requested that the Prothonotary conduct a search of his records concerning judgments or liens against the property in question and issue a certificate under the seal of the court certifying that there were no such judgments or liens in their records. This is by no means considered a title search, nor is it a request for title insurance.

The Prothonotary is also required to post an official bond which “shall be conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the county officer, his deputies, clerks, assistants and appointees, of all trusts confided in him by virtue of his office, upon the faithful execution of all duties required of him by virtue of his office, ...” 16 Pa.C.S. § 3421.</p>

Under the Superior Court’s interpretation, the Prothonotary would have no liability for any of the acts performed by his office.

The underlying statutory provision in effect at that time was the General County Law, Act of May 2,1929, P.L. 1278, Art. Ill, Section 224, which authorized the Prothonotary to “appoint one first deputy, to act in the case of the death or resignation of his principal or when the office shall become vacant from other causes.” By contrast, 42 Pa.C.S. § 2734(a), which was in effect at the time the events in the instant case occurred, authorizes the Prothonotary to appoint deputies who shall “exercise the powers and perform the duties by law vested in and imposed upon the prothonotary----” The General County Law authorized a deputy to act only in the absence of the Prothonotary. <em>Roberts </em>involved a clerk who was not clothed with statutory authority to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Prothonotary. It did not involve a deputy who <em>was </em>statutorily authorized to perform the duties of the Prothonotary or the office of the prothonotary. Further, it did not involve a certification under the personal signature of the Prothonotary and under the authority of his office, but merely the recording of a judgment by a clerk.

In this case a deputy, acting at the request of the appellant, issued a certificate of the prothonotary certifying that an examination of the public records of the office had been made, and that for the period from January 2, 1976 to July 30, 1981 there were no open or unsatisified judgments of record against Helen Hulbert, 1300 1/2 Nobles Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The deputy issued the certification on prothonotary’s form No. 33 under the signatures of the prothonotary and the deputy, and under the seal of the prothonotary.

An <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>examination of the judgment docket in the prothonotary’s office revealed that the lien was recorded on December 18, 1978, squarely within the period certified to be free of unsatisfied and open judgments.</p>

In order to find liability on the part of the prothonotary, traditional principles of <em>respondeat superior </em>must be applied to render the prothonotary responsible for the negligent acts of the deputy. We have held, however, that in the ordinary course of official business, the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>does not apply to the prothonotary, a public official. “The rule in Pennsylvania, as well as in other jurisdictions, is that a public officer is not liable for the negligence of his official subordinates unless he commanded the negligent act to be done.” <em>Orris v.

This likelihood is made clear by the fact that the court opinion discusses the case in terms of the prothonotary making the search and issuing the certification. In addition, the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>was not mentioned by the court.</p>
