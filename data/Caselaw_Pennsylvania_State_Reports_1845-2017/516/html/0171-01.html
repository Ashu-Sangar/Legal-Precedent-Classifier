The issue, therefore, is the nature of the legal test to be utilized in determining whether the record, indeed, is sufficient as a matter of law or whether it amounts to “mere assertions” or “bare allegations” as maintained by the Appellee. In this appeal, the Commonwealth insists that the test can be met and a “finding” established by employing the simple mechanism of having a trial court take judicial notice of its own docket in those instances where the record falls short of fulfilling statutory requirements.

Clearfield County is a one-judge County in which all matters, criminal, civil, domestic, estate, etc. are handled by one judge, with help, from time to time, from visiting and/or senior judges. In 1983, the year in which the events pertinent to this appeal occurred, the single judge disposed of 461 criminal cases, 100 civil cases, 585 domestic relations cases, 323 divorce cases, 143 juvenile cases, and 116 custody and adoption cases. All of these cases were handled by one judge in one courtroom facility (see Table 10, Common Pleas Case Volume by County, 1983 Annual Report AOPC). The purpose of listing this statistical information is to demonstrate the intense familiarity of this judge with all of the case load activities of his own courtroom.</p>

There is no support provided by the language of this rule for such distinctions and the creation of these distinctions is not necessary for the disposition of any case.
