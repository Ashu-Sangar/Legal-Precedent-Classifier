We granted review to consider a question of first impression in this Court. The issue to be addressed is whether the possibility of the refiling of criminal charges against an individual forecloses the individual’s ability to voluntarily consent to a request by law enforcement authorities for a wiretap interception made pursuant to section 5704 of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act of 1978,18 Pa. G.S. § 5701 <em>et seq. </em>(“Act”).</p>
    <p id="b685-6" data-blocks='[["BL_685.7",685,[222,1103,1151,424]]]'>The pertinent facts in this appeal are as follows. On May 16, 1983, appellee Sherman Ross Clark was charged with criminal conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, criminal solicitation and various other offenses concerning stolen vehicles. The evidence to support these charges was substantially obtained through the cooperation of Richard McCullogh with the Pennsylvania State Police and the Erie County District Attorney.</p>
    <p id="b685-7" data-blocks='[["BL_685.8",685,[221,1547,1152,693]]]'>Richard McCullogh was charged in October 1982 with receiving stolen property and receiving or falsifying vehicle registration numbers. Shortly thereafter, McCullogh and his attorney negotiated an agreement with the Erie County District Attorney, pursuant to which pending charges against McCullogh would be dropped in exchange for McCullogh providing information and cooperation to the Commonwealth which would lead to the apprehension of individuals who were dealing in stolen vehicles. The agreement further provided that McCullogh would not be charged for any other offenses to which he confessed; however, the agreement permitted the refiling of charges in the event McCullogh failed to fully cooperate with the authorities.</p>

The Supe<a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>rior Court, in affirming the lower court’s holding on this point, reasoned that because McCullogh’s assistance for the wiretap and surveillance operation was solicited <em>after </em>he provided a statement admitting guilt, McCullogh essentially was given no real choice as regards his participation in the electronic surveillance. According to the Superior Court, McCullogh, aware both of the District Attorney’s prerogative pursuant to their agreement to refile charges and the inculpatory statement he had recently offered, “had no viable alternative but to cooperate, and give his consent.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The existence of the inculpatory statement does not, in our view, negate McCullogh’s ability to voluntarily consent to the wiretap. Even if the District Attorney might be precluded from using the statement in a prosecution of McCullogh, the Commonwealth evidently had sufficiently attenuated, independent evidence to support the charges against him. Obviously, this reality motivated McCullogh to seek an agreement with the District Attorney in the first place. As long as there was some basis for concluding that a lawful prosecution could be instituted, the inducement to the consent was the same as in the first agreement and had not changed in character. The avoidance of a lawful prosecution was not an improper inducement. <em>See United States v.
