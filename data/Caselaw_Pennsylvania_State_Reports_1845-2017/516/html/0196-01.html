With the onset of darkness, the men resorted to flashlights to augment the illumination in the parking lot. At approximately 10:00 p.m., a man approached Avery, put a gun to his neck, and demanded $45. Mr. Avery pleaded with his companion to give the gunman $15. That sum was unsatisfactory to the robber, but he would not let Avery’s compan<a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>ion go to his apartment for more money. In the meanwhile, the disturbance had been heard by Mr. Avery’s wife, Theodorsha Johnson. From the window of their kitchen, about fifteen feet from the men, she inquired as to what was transpiring. Her sister, Sandra Terrell, also viewed the events from the same window. The armed man told Ms. Johnson that if she moved or spoke he would hurt her. The gunman then shot Mr. Avery in the neck, killing him.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[185,743,1153,695]]]'>Two days after the murder of Avery, a police detective showed Ms. Johnson a dozen photographs, from which she identified Kenneth Saxton as the man who shot her husband. Based solely on that identification, Saxton was arrested and charged with murder, involuntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime. The case was subsequently tried in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, before a judge sitting without a jury. Sax-ton was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree and possessing an instrument of crime. Following the denial of post-trial motions, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and to a concurrent prison term of two-to-five years for the additional offense.</p>

The Superior Court, by an order dated June 29, 1984, remanded the matter to the trial court to supplement the record so that the assertions of ineffectiveness could be addressed. Upon complying with the mandate, the trial court determined that the claims of ineffective assistance were meritless. When the Superior Court reviewed the case, it agreed with the appellant’s contention that he had been ineffectively represented in certain instances during the trial. Specifically, the Superior Court concluded that trial counsel had failed to provide effective assistance at two points: First, after the completion of the defense’s case-in-chief, defense counsel entered into a stipulation that the appellant had a prior conviction for violating the Uniform Firearms Act (“UFA”). Second, counsel failed to object when a police witness, during the <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>Commonwealth’s case in rebuttal, referred to Saxton’s “fingerprint number” and testified to the fact that the police had a previous photograph of the appellant in their files, thus allowing the prosecution to indicate that the appellant had a prior police record. Notwithstanding the conclusion that those actions constituted ineffective assistance, the Superior Court affirmed the judgments of sentence, theorizing that the instances of ineffective assistance by trial counsel were harmless error. As noted, we allowed further review by this Court for the narrow purpose mentioned.</p>

Properly applied the <em>Washington </em>test requires an examination of the <em>entire record </em>to determine whether the attorney’s ineptness deprived the client of a fair trial. An attempt to assess counsel’s performance by applying the “reasonable basis” test to isolated judgments made in the heat of trial distorts the analysis and produces results that are unwarranted. The Court in <em>Washington, </em>as is clear from its opinion, never intended to remove prejudice as an element necessary to a finding of ineffectiveness. To properly determine whether a client has been prejudiced by the quality of counsel’s representation, it is necessary to focus on the overall trial strategy and to view the lawyer’s performance <em>in toto.</em>

The inference which the defense sought to promote was that, at least at the outset of the investigation, the appellant was not a suspect.

Therefore, under the “reasonable basis” test as outlined herein, it was appropriate for defense counsel to refrain from objecting to the detective’s reference. Counsel is not ineffective for declining to make a meritless objection. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[206,1400,1151,678]]]'>In the trial of the instant case, defense counsel adopted the only strategy reasonably available. Counsel sought to put the Commonwealth to its burden of proving that the appellant was in fact the person who murdered McKinley Avery. To that end, counsel attacked and sought to discredit the prosecution’s evidence relating to the identity of the appellant as the killer. Counsel also put his client on the witness stand to deny that he was the murderer. It is clear to us that counsel’s strategy was designed to serve the best interests of the accused. Furthermore, an assessment of counsel’s efforts in pursuing the strategy does not support a finding of inadequacy, incompetence or prejudice that would justify a determination of ineffective assistance.</p>
