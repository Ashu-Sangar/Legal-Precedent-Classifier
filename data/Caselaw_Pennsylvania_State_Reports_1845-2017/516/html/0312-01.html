DiBona, Jr. of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County granted the City’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in a concise statement that “failure to supervise or provide adequate police protection is outside the waiver of immunity found at 53 P.S. § 5311.202 or 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8542(b).” (Trial Court Opinion p. 1). Appellees filed an appeal to the Commonwealth Court which, by its opinion and order of September 11, 1985, reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the record to the trial court for further proceedings. <em>Johnson v.
