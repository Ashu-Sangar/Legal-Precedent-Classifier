We are called upon to decide whether section 1315 of the Public Utility Code (“Code”), 66 Pa.C.S. § 1315, bars an electric utility from amortizing costs incurred in connection with plant-construction projects which were can-celled prior to completion, and whether, if the statute must be so read, it violates constitutional safeguards.

By 1977, despite considerable public opposition, CAPCO had forged ahead with the construction projects. In 1979 the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (“Commission”), on its own motion, began an investigation of the CAPCO program because of delays and other construction problems that were afflicting the projects. In January of 1980, about six months after the Commission had begun its investigation, CAPCO announced that construction would be can-celled on four of the seven nuclear plants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The reasons assigned for that decision included: growing political and regulatory uncertainties arising from the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, serious financial constraints of various CAPCO members, and a reduced need for additional future generating capacity.</p>

Duquesne’s share of the construction costs of the four cancelled plants was $34,697,389. In 1980, after the cancellation, Duquesne instituted rate proceedings before the Commission; and thereby sought the right to amortize, over a ten-year period, the construction costs it had borne with respect to the four plants. The same request was made in 1981. However, in each of those rate proceedings the Commission deferred ruling on the request until it received a report relative to its ordered investigation of CAPCO’s construction problems.</p>

This time the company filed a tariff which proposed a change in its rates to increase its annual electric revenues by more than $165,000,000.

In light of these findings or conclusions, AU Matuschak recommended that the Commission allow Duquesne to amortize, in rate proceedings over a period of ten years, its share of the construction costs of the four cancelled units.

The Commission’s order thus meant that in the rate proceeding then before it, and for nine additional years, Duquesne could include in its reported operating expenses a one-tenth amortization charge of <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>$3,469,739.

The Commission granted reconsideration, but proceeded to affirm its order after concluding that section 1315 did not prohibit its treatment of the costs in question. In the Commission’s view, the statute was not intended to prevent “the recovery of prudent investment in a plant which is prematurely retired or one which is cancelled by reason of a change in economic circumstances.” According to the Commission, section 1315 of the Code only barred adding the costs of incomplete construction to an electric utility’s <em>rate base, </em>and did not disallow passing those costs on to ratepayers through <em>amortization. </em>Regarding the express dictate in section 1315 that such costs “shall not be made part of the rate base <em>nor otherwise included in the rates charged” </em>(emphasis added), the Commission opined that the foregoing statutory language was intended solely to prevent the regulatory agency from giving a utility dual benefits of the costs, <em>i.e., </em>including the costs in the rate base <em>and </em>in some other rate making process. The Commission further concluded that the proscription in section 1315 was but a mirror of the agency’s historic regulatory approach to the costs of construction work in progress.</p>

In connection with that request Penn Power sought to amortize over a span of ten years the sum of $9,569,665, which represented its share of the costs of the four terminated construction projects. As a further matter, Penn Power sought to add $824,074 to its rate base because of certain investments denominated “land held for future use.” This latter item referred to interests in unimproved land held by the utility purportedly for future use as the sites electric substations and transmission wires. According to the utility’s projections, the land would be devoted to such uses within the next ten years. Another request made by Penn Power was that it be allowed to normalize the income-tax consequences of a change in depreciation methodology. Each of the foregoing requests was opposed by the OCA.</p>

To justify that part of its decision, the Commission pointed to what was described as its traditional policy of allowing such investments to be included in a utility’s rate base if the property is held pursuant to a definite plan for its use within a “reasonable time.” The agency determined that the land interests in question, though conceivably to remain unused for up to ten years, met that requirement. In this regard, the Commission observed that “historically” land or facilities held by a utility for future use in the public service have been a subject “separate and distinct from that of construction work in progress.” In the agency’s perception, the legislature did not intend to abrogate that policy in enacting section 1315 of the Code. Penn Power also prevailed on its tax normalization claim.</p>

Opining that section 1315 is ambiguous, the Commonwealth Court majority looked first to the title of Act No. 335 as a construction aid. The title declares that the Act provides “a <em>limitation </em>on the consideration of certain costs in the <em>rate base </em>for electric public utilities.” (Emphasis added.) Of the preceding quoted phrase, the court said that it relates exclusively to the rate base “and not a legislative intent to exclude the costs of cancelled facilities from the revenue or expense factors of ratemaking.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=494%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="494 A.2d 58">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=494%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="494 A.2d 58">at 105</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=494%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="494 A.2d 58">494 A.2d at 61</a>.</p>

As further support of that conclusion the majority opinion cited other, pre-existent provisions of the Code, namely sections 1307 and 1310, 66 Pa.C.S. §§ 1307, 1310. Those two sections, according to the court’s reading of their significance to ratemaking, evince a long-standing legislative intention to restrict only the elements of a utility’s rate base, not the items that can be allowed as operating expenses. As for the part of section 1315 upon which the OCA relied, <em>i.e., </em>the disjunctive phrase <em>“nor otherwise included in the rates </em>charged,” the Commonwealth Court agreed with the Commission’s view that the phrase was meant only to prevent a utility from gaining dual benefits from the challenged costs.</p>

The intervenors also contend that, since section 1315 of the Code applies only to electric utilities, it violates the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, and the prohibition against special legislation set forth in Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The utilities advance two other constitutional arguments: that section 1315 denies them due process of law because the legislature made it retroactive; and that Act No. 335, which added section 1315 to the Code, violates the state constitution because the title of the Act does not suggest that the <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>legislation emcompasses anything other than rate base considerations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The Commission asserts that section 1315 suffers from an ambiguity: perceived by the agency as arising from the title of Act No. 335, which describes the legislation as “providing a limitation on the consideration of certain costs in the rate base of public utilities.” To the Commission, it is significant that the preceding language mentions only <em>“the rate </em>base,” and does not include the more encompassing phrase <em>“nor otherwise included in the rates charged.” </em>With that perception of an ambiguity the Commission argues that section 1315 requires interpretation; and further argues, along lines we have already mentioned, that the legislature’s actual intent is reflected by the more limited terms of the title of Act No. 335.</p>

See WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY. Of the two statutory phrases respectively championed by the opposing parties, as expressing the legislative intent underlying section 1315, neither of those two word-sets is of itself facially ambiguous. On its face, there is nothing vague or uncertain about the language of the title. The phrase “limitation on the consideration of certain costs in the rate base” clearly describes a specific subject of concern: the impact of certain costs on an electric utility’s <em>rate base. </em>If this phrase is <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>read as the controlling expression of legislative intent, it could only mean that the legislature’s sole purpose in enacting section 1315 was to exclude the costs of uncompleted construction projects from the utility’s rate base.

On the other hand, there is nothing facially vague, uncertain or indefinite about the substantive proscription in section 1315 itself.

To solve that problem we need look no further than the rule of statutory interpretation set forth in section 1934 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972,1 Pa.C.S. § 1934. This rule mandates that: “[ejxcept as provided in section 1933 of this title (relating to particular controls general), <em>whenever, in the same statute, several clauses are irreconcilable, the clause last in order of date or position shall </em>prevail.” (Emphasis added.) Since, in our view, the disjunctive proscription in section 1315 is of itself unambiguous, and since it is positioned after the title of the statute by which it was enacted, the terms of that proscription must prevail over the language of the title as being the expression of legislative intention.

The Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the agency’s order as to the amortization, holding that to allow the utility to amortize its investment in the terminated projects, and thus permit its recovery from ratepayers as operating expenses, violated state law.

This assumption is palpably erroneous. Given what we have already said about the fundamental principles of this state’s public-utility jurisprudence, it should be clear that no utility of any type is permitted, without express and valid legislative authorization, to charge ratepayers for property which is not used and useful in the production of current utility service.

Indeed, the very last sentence in section 2 of the Act expressly states: “Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to modify or change <em>existing law </em>with regard to the rate making treatment of investment in facilities of <em>fixed utilities other than electric utilities.” </em>(Emphasis added.) We read this proviso to mean that, although the Act focusses on electric utilities, such does not mean that other type utilities are relieved of the proscriptions of pre-existing law concerning the recovery of costs. Thus, Act No. 335 has no disparate impact on electric utilities; and, for that reason, we conclude that the statute does not deny the intervenors the equal protection of the laws. <em>See Califano v.

We also conclude that the Commission erred likewise in permitting Penn Power to add to its rate base the cost of its investments in the vacant land here involved. It is clear, beyond any need for citation, that the function of ratemaking for public utilities is legislative in nature. The Commission is but an instrumentality of the state legislature for the performance of that function; and the agency has only such powers as are expressly conferred upon it by statute or exist by necessary implication. <em>E.g., City of Philadelphia v.
