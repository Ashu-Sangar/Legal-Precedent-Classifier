    <p id="b385-12" data-blocks='[["BL_385.11",385,[203,1776,1153,586]]]'>Dale Samuels was found guilty by a Bucks County jury of statutory rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure, and corruption of a minor. The court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment from 38 months to 15 years. Superior Court affirmed the guilty verdicts but vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded for resentencing, <a href="/pa-super/354/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="354 Pa.

The court held that the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing exceeded its statutory grant of authority by adopting guidelines that increased the severity of sentences on the basis of prior convictions for misdemeanors not involving deadly weapons. We reverse.</p>

      <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>As an aid in computing the sentence to be imposed for the four offenses,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the court used a Guideline Sentence Form published by the Commission. The court calculated a prior record score of 5 based on Samuels's history of one burgla-. ry conviction (2 points), one misdemeanor involving a weapon (1 point), and four or more other misdemeanors (2 points). According to the Guidelines, the statutory rape charge, a second degree felony, rated 5 on the offense gravity scale. Such an offense, with a prior record score of 5, carried recommended prison terms of 16 to 21 months in the mitigated range, 21 to 30 months in the “minimum” range, and 30-38 months in the aggravated range. The corruption charge, a first degree misdemeanor with an offense gravity score of 3, carried guideline suggested sentences of nonconfinement, 0 to twelve months, and 12 to 18 months in the mitigated, “minimum”, and aggravated ranges respectively, the prior record score not being applied again to increase the ranges.</p>

    <p id="b387-9" data-blocks='[["BL_387.9",387,[195,951,1151,365]]]'>Superior Court began its analysis with the premise that the Commission’s enabling statute, of which this section is a part, is a penal provision and therefore subject to strict construction. Given this perspective, the court determined that paragraph (2) stated the only area in which the Commission was authorized to provide increased severity on account of prior convictions.</p>
    <p id="b387-10" data-blocks='[["BL_387.10",387,[192,1335,1152,415]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that this portion of the statute, though a mandatory direction, is not an exclusive direction; that is, the legislature insisted that the Commission treat a person with prior weapons misdemeanors more severely, but left it to the Commission, in the exercise of its broad grant of general authority, to determine what other conditions, including non-weapons misdemeanors, might also justify increased severity.</p>

We need not pass upon the Superior Court’s questionable judgment that the enabling statute (as distinguished from the actual guidelines produced by the Commission) is subject to strict construction as a penal provision. Notwithstanding that court’s determination that the meaning it attributed to § 2154(2) was “plate glass clear”, we are convinced that whether the statute is “strictly” or “liberally” construed, it in no way follows that the mandatory term “shall” is also an exclusive. The General Assembly gave the Commission a broad grant of authority to analyze the impact that <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>various factors should have on the sentencing decision and to promulgate a set of recommended sentences in accordance with its analysis. Certain factors (prior felonies, prior offenses of any grade involving deadly weapons) were so important to the legislature that it required the Commission to provide for them. This statement of an affirmative duty of inclusion of certain items carries no prohibition, express or implied, on the authority to include others.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Although Samuels was found guilty on four charges, the court completed the form only as to two of them, statutory rape and corrupting of minors. Even as between these two offenses, the court failed to specify which portion of the total sentence was attributable to each, stating in its sentencing order simply a period of incarceration from 38 months to 5 years. Samuels, however, preserved no allegations of error in this regard.</p>

The only allegations of error preserved for this Court's review in Samuels’s cross-petition for allowance of appeal relate to the constitutionality of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5945.1, providing a privilege for sexual assault counselors "not to be examined as a witness in any civil or criminal proceeding without the prior written consent of the victim being counseled____” Upon full examination of the record we find that Superior Court adequately addressed this issue and no purpose would be served by restating that court’s analysis.</p>
