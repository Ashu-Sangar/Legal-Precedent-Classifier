        "text": "OPINION\nJUSTICE SAYLOR.\nThis is a direct appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court invalidating an amendment to Pennsylvania\u2019s Educational Empowerment Act which would allow the mayors of certain medium-sized cities within the Commonwealth to assume control of failing school districts. The primary issue presented is whether the amendment in question constitutes special legislation in violation of Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nI.\nIn May of 2000, the General Assembly enacted the Education Empowerment Act (the \u201cEEA\u201d). The act establishes an Education Empowerment List (the \u201cList\u201d) to be maintained by the Department of Education (the \u201cDepartment\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the statute, the Department must place any school district having a history of low test performance on the List. After the Department thus \u201clists\u201d a school district, it notifies the district of its status and establishes an \u201cacademic advisory team\u201d for the district. The district, for its part, appoints an \u201cempowerment team\u201d to work with the Department\u2019s academic advisory team in developing a school district improvement plan which sets forth specific \u201cmethods and goals\u201d for improving the performance of each under-performing school within the district. The plan is then submitted to the Department for modification and approval. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1703-B. In implementing the plan, the school board may, inter alia, replace district administrative personnel (including the superintendent), establish charter schools or privately-run schools, permit schools to operate under independent governance, employ professional staff within schools, and reallocate resources within the district. Thereafter, the school board must submit to the Department annual reports including a list of all contracts entered into by the board and any other implementation data as required by Department guidelines. See 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 17-1704-B, 17-1708-B.\nIf the school district improves sufficiently, such that it reaches the goals in the improvement plan and no longer has a history of low test performance, the Department removes it from the List and returns control to the school board. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1710-B. If, however, the school district fails to meet its goals for educational improvement and maintains a history of low test performance for three years, the Commonwealth assumes control of the district. The Department certifies it as an \u201ceducation empowerment district\u201d and establishes a three-member board of control to govern it. The board of control is comprised of the Secretary of Education (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) or the Secretary\u2019s designee, as chairman, as well as two residents of the county where the school district is located, who are appointed by the Secretary and serve at his or her pleasure. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1705-B. The board of control develops a revised improvement plan and submits it to the Department for amendment and approval. Except for the power to levy taxes, the board of control may exercise all other powers that were previously exercised by the school board \u2014 including those set forth above pursuant to Section 17-1704-B \u2014 and is additionally authorized to close a school within the district. Once the school district no longer has a history of low test performance and meets its revised improvement plan goals, it is decertified and authority reverts to the local school board. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1706-B.\nUnder the EEA, failing urban school districts that meet certain criteria are subjected to an expedited recovery plan whereby the Secretary waives the inclusion of the school district on the List and immediately certifies it as an empowerment district. In these cases, the mayor of the city in which the district is located, rather than the Secretary, appoints the board of control. This mayor-selected board consists of five members of the community who serve at the mayor\u2019s pleasure, and exercises essentially the same powers as a board of control appointed by the Secretary. The mayor also appoints a school district empowerment team to develop a district improvement plan, which is ultimately submitted to the Department for modification and approval. A district certified under this special provision is governed by the mayor\u2019s board of control for at least five years. Thereafter, when it no longer has a history of low test performance and reaches the goals contained in the improvement plan, it is decertified and authority reverts to the local school board. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1707-B('b).\nThe General Assembly codified the following legislative findings in support of this expedited scheme:\n(1) In addition to the operation of failing school districts by a state, other jurisdictions across the nation are utilizing other models to reform failing urban school districts in which the chief executive of the city government is empowered to control the governance of the public schools serving the city. For example, Chicago has implemented a reform model operated by the mayor.\n(2) In this Commonwealth, the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, a city of the first class coterminous with a school district of the first class, recently was empowered by amendments to the home rule charter immediately to appoint all members of the Board of Education of the School District of Philadelphia to serve at his pleasure. In no other school district of the Commonwealth is the mayor or chief executive of a municipality empowered to control or affect the governance of school districts. Under the home rule charter amendments, the Mayor of Philadelphia will have significant input into development and implementation of any school district improvement plan adopted under [24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1703-B] and the school district generally.\n(3) In order to assess the effectiveness of a mayor-led system of school governance in other large city school districts in this Commonwealth which have a history of extraordinarily low test performance, a pilot program under this section shall be established for certain school districts ....\n24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1707-B(a).\nAs noted, only a certain, defined class of urban school districts is eligible for the expedited, mayor-led program described above. Under the original version of the EEA, a school district was eligible for such treatment only if it was \u201ca school district of the second class with a history of low test performance which is coterminous with the city of the third class which contains the permanent seat of government.\u201d Due to the permanent-seat-of-government criterion, this class could only consist of a single member, the Harrisburg School District. For this reason, the qualifying language was commonly referred to as the \u201cReed Amendment\u201d after Harrisburg\u2019s mayor, the Honorable Stephen R. Reed. Shortly after passage of the EEA, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the Reed Amendment was unconstitutional special legislation as defined by Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and preliminarily enjoined its implementation. This Court affirmed the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order and declared the Reed Amendment invalid as violative of Section 32. See Harrisburg Sch. Dist. v. Hickok (Hickok I), 563 Pa. 391, 398, 761 A.2d 1132, 1136 (2000).\nOne week before this Court\u2019s Hickok I decision was announced, the General Assembly amended Section 1707-B, 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1707-B, in an apparent response to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s preliminary injunction order. See Act of Nov. 22, 2000, P.L. 672, No. 91, \u00a7 9 (\u201cAct 91\u201d). Act 91 altered the Reed Amendment so that the class of school districts eligible for mayoral control is now defined as follows:\nFor a school district of the second class which has a history of extraordinarily low test performance, which is coterminous with a city of the third class that has opted under the \u201cOptional Third Class City Charter Law\u201d or 53 Pa.C.S. Pt. Ill Subpt. E to be governed by a mayor-council form of government and which has a population in excess of forty-five thousand (45,000), the secretary shall waive the inclusion of the school district on the education empowerment list under [24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1703-B(a)] and immediately certify the school district as an education empowerment district. No school district shall be certified under this section later than December 31, 2005.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1707-B(a.l). This provision, which applies to the Harrisburg School District, is the subject of the present appeal.\nOn December 4, 2000, the Harrisburg School District, the Harrisburg School Board, several individuals residing within the Harrisburg School District, and \u201cCitizens Concerned for Children First,\u201d an unincorporated association of such residents (collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d), filed a petition for review in the nature of a complaint in equity and declaratory judgment in the Commonwealth Court, challenging the constitutionality of Act 91. They also requested special relief in the nature of a preliminary injunction. The named respondents were Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Eugene W. Hickock, Mayor Reed of Harrisburg, and five John/Jane Doe\u2019s, representing the potential members of the board of control for the Harrisburg School District (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d). Appellees alleged in their complaint that, like the Reed Amendment, Act 91 constitutes special legislation and violates federal equal protection principles, and that it additionally impermissibly changes the form of government of the City of Harrisburg. They admitted that the class created by Act 91 is open to more than one member \u2014 and named the Erie School District as another potential member \u2014 but asserted that it \u201cwas drafted without regard for any rational, meaningful criteria of classification.\u201d They also averred that the shift in power to the board of control in effect: delegates tax-levying power to a special commission in contravention of Article II, Section 31 of the state Constitution; and removes the school board members from office in violation of Article VI, Section 7 of the state Constitution. In opposing the application for special relief, the Secretary maintained, inter alia, that, in addition to Harrisburg, the school districts of Erie, Reading, and York are eligible for inclusion within the classification created by Act 91.\nAfter the Commonwealth Court denied preliminary injunctive relief, Appellants filed preliminary objections, which the Commonwealth Court sustained with respect to Counts IV and V, finding that the school board retained tax-levying power and that its members retained their offices although their powers were affected. The court overruled the preliminary objections, however, as to Counts I, II, and III, that is, the counts alleging that the amendment amounts to unconstitutional special legislation, violates the Equal Protection Clause, and improperly changes the form of Harrisburg\u2019s government. See Harrisburg Sch. Dist. v. Hickok (\u201cHickok II\u201d), 781 A.2d 221 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) (en banc). In so ruling, the court found that, with respect to the special legislation claim, no apparent reason existed \u201cat this stage in the proceeding\u201d for the criteria used in creating the class, and that such criteria appeared to be designed to avoid the special legislation prohibition. See id. at 230. In this regard, the court indicated:\nThe number and oddness of the distinctions that mix and match a class of school with a particular subclass of a third class city that itself is a particular subclass of a home rule municipality that is further narrowed by a population classification that itself is a subclass of population classification used to determine classes of city indicates that the object of the legislation was to winnow down the number of school districts so that it would apply to a very, very, very small number. While that, in and of itself, does not make the legislation violative of Article III, Section 32\u2019s prohibition against special legislation, the absence of any apparent \u201crhyme or reason\u201d for the factors used indicates that they were artificial and irrelevant to remedying the situation in districts with \u201cextraordinarily low [Pennsylvania System of State Assessment] scores.\u201d\nId. at 228.\nConcerning the equal protection challenge, the Commonwealth Court concluded that there was no \u201crational reason why the citizens of some extraordinarily failing school districts are not [sic] given the opportunity to create their own Improvement Plan and school board members of those school districts are divested of their duties while other school boards of extraordinary [sic] failing school districts are not.\u201d Id. at 281. Finally, with regard to the change in the form of Harrisburg\u2019s government, the court noted that Harrisburg had adopted a home rule charter with a mayor-council form of government pursuant to Article IX, Section 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which permits municipalities to choose optional forms of government subject to approval by the electorate, and the Optional Third Class City Charter Law (the \u201cCharter Law\u201d), which prescribes the powers of an optional charter plan for a city of the third class. The Charter Law, however, does not specify that the mayor may appoint a board of control. The court thus reasoned that if the General Assembly wishes to change the form of government to give a mayor or council more powers, it must modify the optional form of government provided by the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Charter Law so that it governs all municipalities that have chosen that optional plan. See Hickok II, 781 A.2d at 234. In other words, according to the Commonwealth Court, the General Assembly may not afford mayors of third class cities powers that are not enumerated in the optional plan that was selected by the city\u2019s voters. See id. at 233-34.\nJudge Leadbetter dissented and indicated that she would have sustained Appellants\u2019 preliminary objections as to all counts of the complaint. Initially, she observed that a separate constitutional provision, Article III, \u00a7 14, affirmatively requires the Legislature to provide a \u201cthorough and efficient system of public education\u201d for the Commonwealth. In this respect, she indicated that \u201cthe General Assembly enacted the EEA in response to a significant pattern of failure among the Commonwealth\u2019s public schools,\u201d and opined that Act 91\u2014 which is specifically designated as a pilot program and modeled after proven programs from other states \u2014 provides a remedy for the Harrisburg School District that is closely tailored to the form of government employed by the city and its public school system. Therefore, she concluded that the act represents a \u201crational legislative response\u201d to the high rate of educational failure in the Commonwealth, and accordingly, violates neither Article III, Section 32 of the state Constitution nor the Equal Protection Clause. As for the claim that Act 91 impermissibly alters the city\u2019s form of government, Judge Leadbetter agreed with Appellants\u2019 argument that Article IX, Section 3 \u201cspeaks only to a wholesale change of municipal government, not to amendments of municipal powers which may be made from time to time by the General Assembly.\u201d Hickok II, 781 A.2d at 239 (Leadbetter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAppellees subsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings against the Secretary, raising the three issues on which implementation of Act 91 had been preliminarily enjoined, namely, that the statute violates Article III, Section 32 and the Equal Protection Clause, and that it violates Article IX, Section 3 by granting powers to the mayor of Harrisburg absent approval of Harrisburg\u2019s voters. Appellants filed answers with new matter, asserting that the class is open to more than one member and that several unresolved factual issues remained, and requested an opportunity to present expert testimony concerning the reasonableness of the classification drawn by Act 91.\nOn January 3, 2002, the Commonwealth Court granted Appellees\u2019 motion, stating that it had \u201cfully explored each and every one of these arguments in our prior decision regarding the preliminary objections and our answers remain the same.\u201d Harrisburg Sch. Dist. v. Zogby, 789 A.2d 797, 801 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2002) (en banc). Thus, based upon its earlier reasoning, the court declared Act 91 unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from \u201ccarrying out or acting in any way pursuant to\u201d Section 1707-B, 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1707-B. In so doing, the court rejected the Secretary\u2019s contention that the motion should be denied pending resolution of asserted issues of fact, stating that the motion only presented a question of law as to whether Act 91 was special legislation, regardless of the reasonableness of the classification created. See id. at 802 n. 5. Judge Leadbetter dissented without opinion.\nAppellants argue that the purpose of Act 91 is to explore ways to \u201cfix broken school districts,\u201d specifically urban ones, and that it extends to school districts in medium-sized cities a tool already available in Philadelphia, the Commonwealth\u2019s largest city: putting the school district under the control of a board appointed by the mayor. They contend that Act 91 therefore represents a rational response to the problem of failing urban school districts, and state further that it cannot constitute special legislation because the classification it ereates may contain multiple school districts. In particular, they aver that if the school districts of the cities of Erie, Allentown, and Reading perform poorly enough, they will be subject to immediate certification as empowerment districts under Act 91. Appellants also assert that, contrary to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s statement that there was no \u201crhyme or reason\u201d to the set of qualifiers contained in the definition of the class at issue, the General Assembly could reasonably have arrived at that particular classification. Specifically, they posit that the General Assembly could rationally have opted to: treat urban school districts differently from rural ones; establish a \u201cpilot program\u201d for a relatively small number of cities in an effort to assess the results before making immediate certification more widely available to other cities; and include within the eligible class only municipalities in which there is a single executive official (i.e., a mayor) who is directly accountable to the same local electorate which makes up the school district. Finally, Appellants argue that the act does not effect any change in the \u201cform\u201d of a city government within the meaning of Article IX, Section 3, because it does not alter the governmental structure of any city \u2014 that is, it does not change the manner in which any municipal official is elected or shift power from one branch of government to another. In this regard, Appellants submit that the Charter Law does not purport to provide an exhaustive list of mayoral duties, and that statutes authorizing a mayor to serve on, or appoint members to, commissions or agencies are commonplace in Pennsylvania.\nAmici, the Honorable Robert C. Jubelirer, President pro tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate, and the late Honorable Matthew J. Ryan, add that the burden of proof in a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute rests upon the challengers, and the Commonwealth Court erroneously shifted such burden to Appellants to prove that the statute was valid. They argue that Appellees failed to meet their burden to prove that there was no rational basis upon which the Legislature could have chosen to classify school districts along the lines established by Act 91.\nAppellees respond there can be no rational reason to treat some third-class cities differently than others. They contend, moreover, that the disputed classification is in reality aimed only at Harrisburg, and that it therefore constitutes special legislation regardless of any asserted rational basis, and unfairly stigmatizes the Harrisburg School District as being the \u201cworst in Pennsylvania.\u201d Appellees state further that there is no \u201cpilot program\u201d exception to Article III, Section 32\u2019s proscription on special legislation, as otherwise the Reed Amendment would have been upheld. Finally, Appellees submit that the \u201cform\u201d of government, for purposes of Article IX, Section 3, includes the duties of governmental officials, and that, accordingly, giving Harrisburg\u2019s mayor additional powers violates Section 3 and additionally alters to the type of city government selected by Harrisburg voters and runs contrary to the Public School Code\u2019s mandate that elected school boards, and not local governmental officials, govern public schools within the Commonwealth.\nII.\nA statute duly enacted by the General Assembly is presumed valid and will not be declared unconstitutional unless it \u201cclearly, palpably and plainly violates the Constitution.\u201d Purple Orchid, Inc. v. Pennsylvania State Police, 572 Pa. 171, 178, 813 A.2d 801, 805 (2002). The party seeking to overcome the presumption of validity bears a heavy burden of persuasion. See Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. McCafferty, 563 Pa. 146, 155, 758 A.2d 1155, 1160 (2000). Our examination and interpretation of the statute, on this facial challenge, is undertaken with due regard to the codified legislative findings set forth above. See Leventhal v. City of Phila., 518 Pa. 233, 246, 542 A.2d 1328, 1335 (1988) (indicating that codified legislative findings are entitled to \u201cgreat weight\u201d in deciding whether an enactment violates the Constitution). As the present matter involves a question of law, our review is plenary. See Penn sylvania Sch. Bds. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Commonwealth Ass\u2019n of Sch. Adm\u2019rs., 569 Pa. 436, 442, 805 A.2d 476, 479 (2002).\nA. Special Legislation and Equal Protection\nIn the seven years before the Constitution of 1874 was adopted, the General Assembly enacted 8,755 local or special acts and only 475 general laws. See Robert E. Woodside, Pennsylvania Constitutional Law 321 (1985). Against this backdrop, the citizens of Pennsylvania chose to include within the Constitution of 1874 a proscription on special laws \u201cfor a very simple and understandable purpose-to put an end to the flood of privileged legislation for particular localities and for private purposes which was common in 1873.... It was aimed at laws that were in the proper sense local and special.\u201d Haverford Township v. Siegle, 346 Pa. 1, 6, 28 A.2d 786, 789 (1942) (citation omitted). Thus, the underlying purpose of Section 32\u2019s prohibition on special legislation was not so much to prohibit the General Assembly from undertaking limited, remedial measures as part of a long-term strategy to fulfill its duties connected with the public interest, but to end the practice of favoritism.\nOver the years, this prohibition, as well as other state constitutional provisions such as the Uniformity Clause, see Pa. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 1 (prescribing uniformity in taxation), have been understood to include principles of equal protection under the law. See Tool Sales & Serv. Co. v. Commonwealth, 536 Pa. 10, 26, 637 A.2d 607, 615 (1993); Leventhal, 518 Pa. at 239, 542 A.2d at 1331. Indeed, it is now generally accepted that the meaning and purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, see U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, and the state Constitution\u2019s prohibition against special laws, see Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 32, are sufficiently similar to warrant like treatment, and that contentions concerning the two provisions may be reviewed simultaneously. See DeFazio v. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n of Allegheny County, 562 Pa. 431, 436, 756 A.2d 1103, 1105 (2000); Laudenberger v. Port Auth. of Allegheny County, 496 Pa. 52, 67 n. 13, 436 A.2d 147,155 n. 13 (1981). In particular, Article III, Section 32 and the Equal Protection Clause both reflect the principle that like persons in like circumstances must be treated similarly. See Commonwealth v. Albert, 563 Pa. 133, 138, 758 A.2d 1149, 1151 (2000).\nEqual protection principles do not, however, vitiate the Legislature\u2019s power to classify, which necessarily flows from its general power to enact regulations for the health, safety, and welfare of the community. See Harris v. State Bd. of Optometrical Exam\u2019rs., 287 Pa. 531, 538, 135 A. 237, 240 (1926). Nor do they prohibit differential treatment of persons having different needs, see Curtis v. Kline, 542 Pa. 249, 255, 666 A.2d 265, 267 (1995), provided the classifications at issue bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state purpose. See Tosto v. Pennsylvania Nursing Home Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1,14, 331 A.2d 198, 204 (1975); Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Labor and Indus., 461 Pa. 68, 83, 334 A.2d 636, 643 (1975). In this regard, a classification, though discriminatory, will be deemed reasonable if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived to sustain it. See Curtis, 542 Pa. at 255, 666 A.2d at 268. However, a classification will be struck down if it is based upon artificial or irrelevant distinctions used for the purpose of evading the constitutional prohibition. See Hickok I, 563 Pa. at 397, 761 A.2d at 1136 (citing Freezer Storage, Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Co., 476 Pa. 270, 275, 382 A.2d 715, 718 (1978)). In undertaking its analysis, a reviewing court is free to hypothesize reasons the Legislature might have had for the classification. See id.; see also Baltimore & Ohio R.R., 461 Pa. at 84, 334 A.2d at 644 (hypothesizing reasons that the Legislature could have determined that railroad employees had a greater need for mandatory weekly payment than employees of other common carriers); Geary v. Retirement Bd. of Allegheny County, 426 Pa. 254, 259-60, 231 A.2d 743, 746 (1967) (suggesting reasons that the Legislature could have determined that police officers were more in need of early retirement than other county employees).\nThe history of the present dispute, as related above, leaves little doubt that the General Assembly sought initially to prescribe an aggressive course of action to ameliorate the systemically failing school district located in the state capital. Under this procedure, the school district would be immediately certified as an empowerment district and placed under the mayor\u2019s control rather than having to wait three years and then being taken over by the state. Although this effort may have been salutary in purpose and effect, this Court held in Hickok I that the General Assembly could not, consistent with Article III, Section 32 and the Equal Protection Clause, prescribe such strong measures for Harrisburg only. Thus, the General Assembly sought to cure the defect identified by the Hickok I Court by extending immediate certification and mayoral control to other cities. Recognizing, however, that these measures were to some degree experimental in nature, the General Assembly apparently sought, as well, to limit the number of municipalities affected by the new provision by extending the class only to a small group of other medium-sized cities which were, in its view, similarly situated to Harrisburg. This group consists of cities that have opted for a mayor-council form of government under the Charter Law, have a population between 45,000 and 250,000, and have a mayor who is accountable to the same electorate as that which makes up the school district.\nWe note initially that the Legislature is permitted to treat cities of different sizes differently, particularly as classifications of cities and school districts based upon population are deemed general legislation and are specifically authorized by our state Constitution. See Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 20; DeFazio, 562 Pa. at 436, 756 A.2d at 1105. Here, the Legislature found that some urban municipalities in Pennsylvania and elsewhere are attempting to solve the seemingly intractable problems facing their school districts by adopting mayor-led models of control and remediation. In our view, the Legislature could reasonably have believed that social issues interrelated with education, such as crime, poverty, and a weak tax base, are more severe in urban school districts than in rural ones, and sufficiently so to warrant special treatment under the EEA. See generally Danson v. Casey, 33 Pa.Cmwlth. 614, 624 & n. 13, 382 A.2d 1238, 1243 & n. 13 (1978) (recognizing the financial plight of urban school districts and the fact that municipal services in such areas cost more than in rural areas (citing Comment, Pennsylvania\u2019s State Aid to Education Formula: A Goal of Uniform Equalized Education, 30 Pitt. L.Rev. 41 (1968-69))), affd 484 Pa. 415, 399 A.2d 360 (1979); Abbott v. Burke, 119 N.J. 287, 575 A.2d 359, 363, 394-408 (1990) (cataloguing the special educational problems and needs of students in poorer urban school districts, and observing that, even apart from increased funding, \u201cnew approach[es]\u201d are needed to ensure that the students in such districts receive a good education).\nAdditionally, we agree with Appellants that the Legislature could reasonably have sought to limit the program initially to cities with a mayor-led government in which the mayor is accountable to the same local electorate that makes up the school district. This condition has the benefit of providing the individual who retains ultimate authority over the board of control (i.e., the mayor) with the greatest political incentive to ensure that effective means are implemented to improve the performance of the school district involved. Accord Hickok II, 781 A.2d at 229 (indicating that \u201cit may be rational to have a Mayor whose municipality is coterminous ... with a school district to appoint the Board of Control to ensure continuing local control and increased local support\u201d).\nFurthermore, while other third-class cities may have a mayor, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 35701, the increased local control inherent in cities governed under a home rule paradigm constitutes a sufficient basis for the General Assembly to have concluded that Act 91\u2019s provisions should be limited, at least- initially, to cities with a home-rule, mayor-council form of government under the Charter Law. In particular, the General Assembly could reasonably have concluded that, as with Philadelphia, such conditions would lend themselves to the mayor \u201chav[ing] significant input into the development and implementation of any school district improvement plan adopted.\u201d 24 P.S. \u00a7 17-1707-B(a)(2).\nFinally, although, as noted by the Commonwealth Court, these restrictions collectively narrow the class of school districts eligible for expedited treatment under Act 91 to a small number, we believe that it was rational for the General Assembly to seek to limit the program\u2019s initial reach to a small group of districts before prescribing the same procedures more generally throughout the state. Such is consistent with the codified legislative findings, which indicate that the effectiveness of a mayor-led system of school governance should be assessed under the act\u2019s \u201cpilot program\u201d before being made more generally available. Moreover, there is nothing improper about this method of attacking social problems of statewide dimension, as the Legislature is free, for reasons of necessity or otherwise, to address such issues incrementally. See Maurer v. Boardman, 336 Pa. 17, 27, 7 A.2d 466, 473 (1939) (\u201cAn act designed to remedy an existing ill may not be declared invalid because it leaves other ills unremedied.\u201d). Even to the extent that the Harrisburg School District is the only member of the class so far to be automatically certified as an empowerment district, the Secretary contends, and Appellees concede, that it is possible for other school districts to be subject to automatic certification in the future. Hence the class is not \u201cclosed,\u201d but open for other members to come in. See Harristown Dev. Corp. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Gen. Servs., 532 Pa. 45, 53 n. 9, 614 A.2d 1128, 1134 n. 9 (1992) (indicating that \u201ca classification of one member is not unconstitutional so long other members might come into that class\u201d (citing Haverford Township v. Siegle, 346 Pa. 1, 6, 28 A.2d 786, 789 (1942))).\nUnder these circumstances, we do not believe that the class defined by Act 91 is based upon artificial or irrelevant distinctions utilized merely to evade the constitutional prohibition on special legislation; we hold, rather, that it is a classification which is reasonably related to the Commonwealth\u2019s legitimate interest in, and the General Assembly\u2019s constitutional duty to ensure, the existence of a \u201cthorough and efficient system of public education.\u201d Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 14. Consequently, we conclude that Act 91 is consistent with both Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\nB. Form of Government\nThe Commonwealth Court struck down Act 91 upon the alternative ground that, in its view, the statute improperly vests powers in the mayor of Harrisburg without approval of the Harrisburg voters. As discussed, the court viewed this as inconsistent with the Charter Law, in that the mayor-council plan of government does not grant the mayor authority to appoint a board of control for the school district. Appellees likewise contend that giving the mayor power to appoint such a board violates Article IX, Section 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, see supra note 8, in that it effects a modification in the \u201cform\u201d of Harrisburg\u2019s government after the voters had already made a selection of governmental structure pursuant to the Charter Law.\nWhile there is some appeal to the proposition that giving the mayor any duties or responsibilities which are not specifically enumerated in the Charter Law effects a change in the form of government because the voters did not opt for a plan in which the mayor possessed such responsibilities, see Hickok II, 781 A.2d at 234, it should also be recognized that the Charter Law specifically imbues the mayor with general enforcement authority over \u201call general laws applicable thereto.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 41412; see also 53 P.S. \u00a7 41301 (specifying that, once a city chooses its optional plan, the city is thereafter governed by the plan as well as \u201cby all applicable provisions of general law\u201d). Any city that adopts a mayor-council form of government under the Charter Law thus implicitly endorses the principle that, in addition to local ordinances, the city will be bound by applicable general laws subsequently enacted by the Legislature. As we have already determined that Act 91 is not a special law, it is a general law that is \u201capplicable thereto,\u201d that is, to Harrisburg and any other city in the class defined by its terms. See Hickok I, 563 Pa. at 397, 761 A.2d at 1136 (observing that legislation for a class is general, not special); Seabolt v. Commissioners of Northumberland County, 187 Pa. 318, 323, 41 A. 22, 23 (1898) (same). The act is therefore consistent in principle with the general grant of mayoral powers contained in the Charter Law.\nThe question, then, distills to whether, as Appellees contend, Act 91 violates Article IX, Section 3 by somehow altering the \u201cform\u201d of government selected by the voters of Harrisburg or other cities in the relevant class. This is the central inquiry because the constitutional provision at issue pertains specifically to the selection by municipalities of an optional \u201cform\u201d of government. See Pa. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3.\n\u201cForm\u201d is defined variously, and most relevantly, as \u201cthe organization, placement, or relationship of basic elements,\u201d and \u201cthe structure, organization, or essential character of something, as opposed to its matter.\u201d Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 515 (2d rev\u2019d & updated Random House ed.2000). In this respect, we agree with Judge Leadbetter that Section 3 of Article IX does not per se preclude a legislative grant of particularized powers and duties to the mayor of a city that has opted for a mayor-council form of government, but refers instead to a wholesale change of municipal government. See Hickok II, 781 A.2d at 239 (Lead-better, J., dissenting). So long as the addition of such duties is not inconsistent with the basic existence, structure, and powers of the office of mayor or the other branches of city government, it does not alter its form.\nThis reading is also consistent with the provisions of the Charter Law itself. Those applicable to all optional plans tend to focus upon such things as the size of the city council, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41213, and the manner in which city officials are elected, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41241, while the provisions pertaining specifically to the mayor-council plan deal with: identifying the city\u2019s elected officials (i.e., the mayor, the city council, the treasurer and the controller), see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41402; the length of terms of office, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41403; the size of the city council, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41404; the manner in which vacancies are filled, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41405; the separation of powers between branches of government, see 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 41407, 41411; the manner in which local ordinances are enacted, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41413; whether and how a department of administrator is established, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41416; and the preparation of a city budget, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41418. None of these provisions purport to identify an exhaustive list of mayoral duties, and we decline to adopt an interpretation of the Charter Law under which the mayor\u2019s responsibilities as enumerated in that statute can never be augmented because they define the governmental structure. Accordingly, as Act 91\u2019s grant of authority to the mayor to appoint a board of control for the school district does not interfere with the existence, structure, or powers of the mayor or any other branch or function of city government prescribed by the mayor-council optional form of government under the Charter Law, we hold that it does not change the form of such government in violation of Article IX, Section 3.\nC. Conclusion\nSince preliminary objections were sustained as to Counts IV and V, and our analysis is dispositive with respect to Counts I, II, and III, relief is unavailable on the complaint and further proceedings in this matter are unnecessary. See Bensalem Township Sch. Dist. v. Commonwealth, 518 Pa. 581, 586-87, 544 A.2d 1318, 1321 (1988) (explaining that, where relief is unavailable to the party who moves for judgment on the pleadings, entry of judgment for the non-moving party is appropriate).\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of Appellants.\nJustice LAMB files a dissenting opinion.\n.

However, the Secretary\u2019s appeal operated as an automatic supersedeas of the January 3, 2002, order. See Pa.R.A.P. 1736(b). Appellees\u2019 request to vacate the supersedeas was denied.\nAdditionally, although the January 3, 2002, order did not technically resolve Appellees' claims against the Mayor or the Board of Control, the Commonwealth Court subsequently declared its order final, see Pa. R.A.P. 341(c), after which the Mayor and Board of Control filed notices of appeal.\n. Mr. Ryan was Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives at the time he and Senator Jubelirer filed their amicus brief. He continued in that office until his death on March 29, 2003.\n. See also Gary E. French, Home Rule in Pennsylvania, 81 Dick. L.Rev. 265, 267 n. 20 (1977) (\"Special legislation is that which affects exclusively a specifically named municipality. In Pennsylvania [during the post-Civil War period], the General Assembly was so occupied with dispensing special favors that there was little time left to deal with problems of state-wide concern.\u201d (citation omitted)).\n. Appellees claim that education is a fundamental right, and that the Court should therefore apply a standard that is more stringent than the \u201crational basis\u201d test. We need not resolve here the parties\u2019 dispute concerning whether education is a fundamental right for purposes of equal protection analysis, since Appellees do not argue, nor does it appear from the record, that Act 91 infringes anyone\u2019s ability to receive an education.\n. Although Act 91 specifies that the city must be a city of the third class which is coterminous with a school district of the second class, it should be noted that a school district of the second class by definition has a population of between 30,000 and 250,000, see 24 P.S. \u00a7 2-202, and third class cities are those with a population of less than 250,000, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 101. In light of the coterminality requirement and the criterion that the city has over 45,000 residents. Act 91's requirement that the school district be of the second class is superfluous. Furthermore, the criterion that the school district has a history of severe failure is not, strictly speaking, part of the class definition; rather, it is the condition triggering immediate certification as an empowerment district.\n. Appellees are correct in stating that Article III, Section 32 does not have a \"pilot program exception.\u201d The relevant inquiry, however, is not whether such an exception exists, but whether the particular pilot program here at issue constitutes special legislation. For the reasons stated, we believe that it does not.\n. As noted, Appellees admitted in their complaint, and Appellants alleged in their answer, that the class is presently open to more than one member. We note additionally that other factors may operate to broaden the class. For example, a school district can enter the class if it grows to more than 45,000 residents.\n. Appellees suggest that the existence of a rational basis is not determinative. They argue in particular that the Legislature\u2019s true purpose was simply to \u201cfigure[] out another way to say 'Harrisburg,'\u201d and complain that Appellants \u201cjump directly to rational basis\u201d without acknowledging the prohibition on evading constitutional constraints through artificial, irrelevant distinctions. See Brief at 14. This Court has clarified, however, that the existence of real and relevant distinctions in the subjects classified is the touchstone of the inquiry under both Section 32 and the Equal Protection Clause. See Hickok 1, 563 Pa. at 397, 761 A.2d at 1136. While Appellees' focus upon intent may be reflected to some degree in the Hickok I Court's admonition that the General Assembly may not rely upon artificial distinctions in order to evade the constitutional prohibition, see id., ultimately this factor and the question of a rational basis are two sides of the same coin: if the court finds that real and rational distinctions in the subjects classified are present, it will not assume an evasive intent on the part of the Legislature.",

        "text": "Justice LAMB\nDissenting.\nBecause I believe that Act 91 is special legislation passed in violation of Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, I respectfully dissent. In promulgating Act 91, the Legislature has singled out the Harrisburg School District for special treatment, under the pretext of testing the efficacy of a \u201cpilot program\u201d for distressed systems of education. The amended Section 1707-B targets Harrisburg in a less obvious way than the Reed Amendment, and as drafted, could theoretically apply to both Harrisburg and Erie, as they are the only two cities meeting the form of government and population criteria. However, I do not agree that the mere possibility that the Erie School District might find itself distressed before December of 2005 mandates against a finding that Act 91 is special legislation.\nAct 91\u2019s classification is no less effective in singling out the Harrisburg School District for special treatment than the Reed Amendment. It is, in my view, nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt by the Legislature to promulgate special legislation under the guise of a general law. Were the purpose of this legislation really the remediation of failing urban school districts, such could have been achieved through the passage of general laws. The only possible purpose of Act 91 is the evasion of the constitutional limitation ran afoul of in Harrisburg Sch. Dist. v. Hickok (Hickok I), 563 Pa.391, 761 A.2d 1132 (2000). As such, it must fail.\nBy its opinion today, the majority has placed its imprimatur on legislation passed in disregard of the constitutional limitation contained in Article III, Section 32. Because I can not abide the Legislature\u2019s evasion of the constitutional limitation contained therein, I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.\n. Act of November 22, 2000, P.L. 672, No. 91, \u00a7 9.\n.
