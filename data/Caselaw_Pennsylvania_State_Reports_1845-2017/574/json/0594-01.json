        "text": "OPINION\nJUSTICE CASTILLE.\nOn November 27, 2000, following a jury trial, appellant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of possession of an instrument of crime (PIC), and one count of criminal conspiracy. At the penalty phase, the jury found one aggravating circumstance and two mitigating circumstances. The jury found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and accordingly, imposed a sentence of death for each of appellant\u2019s first-degree murder convictions. The trial court formally imposed the death sentences and, in addition, imposed consecutive sentences of five to ten years\u2019 incarceration for appellant\u2019s PIC and criminal conspiracy convictions. Appellant filed a Motion in Arrest of Judgment and for a New Trial on December 7, 2000, which the trial court denied on March 30, 2001. This direct appeal followed. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nAlthough appellant does not specifically challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his convictions for first-degree murder, we begin, as we do in all death penalty direct appeals, by independently reviewing the evidence to ensure that it is sufficient to support the first-degree murder convictions. Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 937, 942 n. 3 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983), reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1236, 104 S.Ct. 31, 77 L.Ed.2d 1452 (1983). When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court must determine whether the evidence at trial, and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to establish all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Bridges, 563 Pa. 1, 757 A.2d 859, 864 (2000). A person is guilty of first-degree murder where the Commonwealth proves that (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused is responsible for the killing; and (3) the accused acted with specific intent to kill. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(d); Commonwealth v. Spotz, 563 Pa. 269, 759 A.2d 1280, 1283 (2000). An intentional killing is a \u201cMilling by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(d). Specific intent to kill can be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 561 Pa. 266, 750 A.2d 261, 267 (2000).\nThe evidence adduced at trial established that at approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 13, 1998, Kendrick Haskell and John Ford parked their car across the street from a group of people sitting on the steps of a Chinese food restaurant located at the corner of Germantown Avenue and Tioga Street in Philadelphia. The group of people included appellant and his co-defendant, Richard Mitchell, as well as Braheem (also known as Brahma) Jackson, Donta Dawson, Kattery Franklin, and a woman identified only as Michelle. After parking, Haskell exited the car and walked toward the restaurant while Ford remained in the car. As Haskell walked toward the restaurant, he bumped into appellant\u2019s aunt, Kattery Franklin. Haskell then entered the restaurant and placed his order. After Haskell exited the restaurant, appellant\u2019s group of friends exchanged words with Haskell. An argument ensued and, ultimately, a physical altercation broke out between Haskell and appellant. A few minutes into the altercation, Dawson stepped in and began fighting with Haskell as well. Then, while Dawson and Haskell fought, appellant stepped back and asked Mitchell for Mitchell\u2019s gun, a .32 caliber revolver. Mitchell handed appellant his gun, whereupon appellant shot Haskell twice in the chest and once in the head. Appellant then turned around and shot Ford once in the head as he stood by the passenger side of the parked car. Both Haskell and Ford died as a result of their gunshot wounds.\nMultiple witnesses testified at appellant\u2019s trial that they saw appellant, or someone resembling appellant, commit the murders. Harold James, who recognized appellant from the neighborhood, positively identified appellant as the shooter of both men. N.T. 11/16/00, at 217-230; 11/17/00, at 10-67. Two other eyewitnesses, Father Angelo Hernandez and Celeste Cline, could not positively identify appellant as the shooter, but did state that they saw an African American male wearing a white T-shirt, blue or black shorts, and a baseball cap, shoot one victim in front of the Chinese food restaurant and then turn and shoot a second victim as he stood next to a car. N.T. 11/16/00, at 141-189, 190-213. In addition, Veronica Jenkins, another witness who knew appellant from the neighborhood, testified that she heard gunshots and saw appellant soon thereafter as he walked down the street carrying a handgun and muttering to himself \u201cfuck that shit, fuck that cat, he don\u2019t know who the fuck he was fucking with.\u201d N.T. 11/17/00, at 89-118. Jenkins also described appellant as wearing a white T-shirt, blue jean shorts, and a baseball cap. Id. at 100-101.\nAppellant, for his part, admitted at trial that he shot Haskell, but denied killing Ford. N.T. 11/20/00, at 194-199. Appellant testified that he and Haskell \u201cgot into a fight\u201d after Haskell insulted appellant and appellant\u2019s aunt. Id. at 192. Appellant claimed that Braheem Jackson, not co-defendant Mitchell, passed a gun to him as they fought. Id. at 196. He further testified that the confrontation culminated less than a minute later when appellant fired three shots at Haskell. Id. at 197. Then, according to appellant, he passed the gun back to Jackson and walked away from the scene. Id. at 198-201.\nThis evidence, and all reasonable inferences deductible therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, overwhelmingly supports appellant\u2019s first-degree murder convictions. The victims, Haskell and Ford, were unlawfully killed, as there is nothing on this record to support that the use of deadly force against them was legally justified. The eyewitness testimony, and appellant\u2019s own partial admission, identified appellant as the shooter and supports the conclusion that appellant was the person who deliberately shot both men. The evidence that appellant, while in the midst of a fistfight with Haskell, asked Mitchell for his gun establishes that the killings were deliberate. Finally, the fact that appellant shot the victims in vital parts of their bodies warranted the jury finding of a specific intent to kill. Having found that the evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s two first-degree murder convictions, we now proceed to address appellant\u2019s specific allegations of error.\nAppellant was tried jointly with co-defendant Richard Mitchell. Both of appellant\u2019s claims of error relate to the trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony of eyewitness Braheem Jackson at the preliminary hearing of co-defendant Mitchell. At Mitchell\u2019s preliminary hearing on October 1, 1998, Jackson testified, among other things, that he saw Mitchell hand appellant the gun which appellant then used to shoot Haskell and Ford. Appellant, who was not arrested until January 12, 1999, was not present at Mitchell\u2019s preliminary hearing. Appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing was held on February 9, 1999, and Jackson did not testify at this hearing.\nOn the second day of jury selection, the Commonwealth apprised the trial court that Jackson had become unavailable and sought to introduce his prior testimony at Mitchell\u2019s preliminary hearing into evidence against Mitchell. Upon hearing testimony regarding the circumstances of Jackson\u2019s prior testimony and his absence from trial, the trial court determined that Jackson was unavailable and that Mitchell had had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Jackson at his preliminary hearing. Accordingly, the trial court ruled that Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was admissible against Mitchell pursuant to the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. The trial court further ordered that the testimony be redacted to eliminate any specific reference to appellant and noted that it would instruct the jury that the testimony was to be considered as evidence against Mitchell only. The Commonwealth thereafter redacted Jackson\u2019s testimony omitting certain irrelevant portions of it and, in addition, replacing all specific references to appellant by name with the neutral term, \u201cthis guy.\u201d\nThe next day, appellant objected to the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed redaction of Jackson\u2019s prior testimony. The trial court conducted a line-by-line examination of the testimony out of the presence of the jury, admitting some portions, and excluding others. All references to appellant were replaced with the phrase, \u201cthis guy.\u201d As the trial court conducted this examination, appellant raised several general objections to specific portions of the redacted testimony. When the trial court concluded its review of Jackson\u2019s testimony, appellant raised no further objections, but Mitchell objected to the redaction on the basis that \u201ccautionary instructions [were not] sufficient to protect the interests of [appellant].\u201d N.T. 11/17/00, at 232. The trial court then ordered the jury to return. Before Jackson\u2019s testimony was admitted into evidence against Mitchell, the trial court instructed the jury on its relevance and limited admissibility. The court first explained the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule, and then continued:\nIn this case I have made a determination that Brahma Jackson, a Commonwealth witness is not available to testify at this hearing, this trial. As a result, I am going to permit the prior recorded testimony of Brahma Jackson that was given at a preliminary hearing of the defendant Richard Mitchell on October 1, 1998 to be admitted into evidence for your consideration.\nNow, this prior recorded testimony will be admitted at trial as evidence in the case of Commonwealth versus Richard Mitchell only and is to be considered by you solely as evidence being offered in the case of Commonwealth versus Richard Mitchell.\nThis prior recorded testimony is not admissible in the case of Commonwealth versus Steven McCrae and is not under any circumstances to be considered as evidence in his case by this jury during your deliberations.\nThis is because the defendant Steven McCrae was not present during the hearing that took place on October 1, 1998 when the witness Brahma Jackson testified, and as such, the defendant Steven McCrae did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Brahma Jackson concerning his testimony.\nSo to repeat, the prior recorded testimony of Brahma Jackson is admissible as evidence in the case of Commonwealth versus Richard Mitchell only. It is not to be considered by this jury in the case of Commonwealth versus Steven McCrae.\nId. at 236-239. The prosecutor who had represented the Commonwealth at Mitchell\u2019s preliminary hearing then read Jackson\u2019s testimony, as redacted by the trial court, into the record. Id. at 236-279. Without further objection to the admission of the testimony or to the trial judge\u2019s cautionary charges, the court adjourned for the day. The next day of trial, appellant moved for a mistrial \u201cbased on the admission of the redacted notes of testimony.\u201d N.T. 11/20/00, at 2. The motion was denied. Id.\nAppellant first claims that Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was so unreliable that its admission violated the hearsay rule and his right of confrontation under the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions. Appellant maintains that there were a number of inconsistencies between Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony and an earlier statement that Jackson had given to the police regarding the shootings. For example, appellant contends that Jackson initially told the police that appellant shot both victims, but then testified at Mitchell\u2019s preliminary hearing that he did not see who fired the shots that killed the second victim. In addition, appellant asserts that Jackson told police that appellant asked Mitchell for the gun and Mitchell gave him the weapon, whereas he testified at the preliminary hearing that he only told the police that Mitchell gave appellant the gun because the police told him to say this. Appellant also contends that Jackson initially told the police that Mitchell told him that he had thrown the gun away, but he testified at the preliminary hearing that he did not know what happened to the gun after the shootings. Appellant alleges that the multiple discrepancies between Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony and his earlier statement to police render the admitted testimony inherently unreliable and thus inadmissible under the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause.\nThis claim first fails for the fundamental reason that Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was not admitted against appellant. As we have described, Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was introduced solely against Mitchell. All specific references to appellant in the testimony were replaced with the neutral phrase, \u201cthis guy.\u201d In addition, the trial court twice issued comprehensive instructions to the jury that Jackson\u2019s testimony was to be considered in deciding the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of Mitchell only, and not as evidence against appellant. It is an \u201calmost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions.\u201d Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). See also Commonwealth v. Bridges, 563 Pa. 1, 757 A.2d 859, 883 (2000) (\u201c[A] jury is presumed to have followed the instructions of the trial court.\u201d).\nPennsylvania has long permitted the limited admission of evidence only as to one party or for one purpose. See Pa.R.E. 105 (\u201cWhen evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court upon request shall, or on its own initiative may, restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Updegrove, 413 Pa. 599, 198 A.2d 534, 537 (1964) (evidence that \u201cis admissible for one purpose ... is not inadmissible because it does not satisfy the rules applicable to some other capacity or even because the jury might consider it in the latter capacity\u201d) (citation omitted); Commonwealth v. Wright, 227 Pa.Super. 134, 323 A.2d 349, 351-52 (1974) (\u201cEvidence which is admissible for one purpose does not become inadmissible merely because it would be inadmissible if offered for another purpose.\u201d) (citation omitted). In fact, it is \u201ccommon\u201d in joint trials that \u201cevidence is admissible against one co-defendant but inadmissible against another.\u201d Commonwealth v. Travers, 564 Pa. 362, 768 A.2d 845, 847 (2001). See also Commonwealth v. Patterson, 519 Pa. 190, 546 A.2d 596, 601 (1988) (possible prejudicial effect of introduction of evidence against only one of two defendants in joint trial was no \u201cmore harmful than the prejudicial effect ... habitually tolerate[d] in joint trials where evidence is introduced against only one of the defendants\u201d). A party generally cannot vicariously litigate the claims of another party. Because Jackson\u2019s testimony was introduced against Mitchell only, appellant\u2019s complaints fail.\nMoreover, even if it is assumed that appellant may vicariously litigate an evidentiary claim belonging to Mitchell because of the prospect of spillover prejudice, appellant has not shown that the evidence was improperly admitted against Mitchell. The admissibility of evidence is a matter addressed to the discretion of the trial court and the trial court\u2019s ruling may be reversed only upon a showing that the court abused its discretion. Commonwealth v. Richter, 551 Pa. 507, 711 A.2d 464, 466 (1998). Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Pa.R.E. 801(c). Hearsay evidence is not admissible except as provided by the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, this Court, or by statute. Pa.R.E. 802. The former testimony exception to the hearsay rule provides that the testimony of a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding may be introduced into evidence if the witness is unavailable and the party against whom the evidence is to be introduced had an adequate opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or a redirect examination. Pa.R.E. 804(b)(1). See also 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5917 (\u201cWhenever any person has been examined as a witness, either for the Commonwealth or for the defense, in any criminal proceeding conducted in or before a court of record, and the defendant has been present and has had an opportunity to examine or cross-examine, if such witness afterwards dies, or is out of the jurisdiction so that he cannot be effectively served with a subpoena, or if he cannot be found, or if he becomes incompetent to testify for any legally sufficient reason properly proven, notes of his examination shall be competent evidence upon a subsequent trial of the same criminal issue\u201d). Here, the trial court found that Jackson was unavailable and appellant does not dispute that finding.\nUnder both the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions, a criminal defendant has a right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. Commonwealth v. Bazemore, 581 Pa. 582, 614 A.2d 684, 685 (1992) (citing Commonwealth v. McGrogan, 523 Pa. 614, 568 A.2d 924, 927 (1990)). It is well-established, however, that the introduction of an unavailable witness\u2019s prior recorded testimony from a preliminary hearing is admissible at trial and will not offend the right of confrontation, provided the defendant had counsel and a full opportunity to cross-examine that witness at the hearing. Commonwealth v. Paddy, 569 Pa. 47, 800 A.2d 294, 312-13 (2002); Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 558 Pa. 478, 738 A.2d 406, 417-18 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1131, 120 S.Ct. 970,145 L.Ed.2d 841 (2000); Commonwealth v. Rizzo, 556 Pa. 10, 726 A.2d 378, 380 n. 2 (1999); Bazemore, 614 A.2d at 687; Commonwealth v. Chestnut, 511 Pa. 169, 512 A.2d 603, 605 (1986); Commonwealth v. Duncan, 473 Pa. 62, 373 A.2d 1051, 1054 (1977); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 758 A.2d 166, 169 (Pa.Super.2000). The trial court found that Mitchell had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Jackson at his preliminary hearing.\nAppellant has not shown that Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was improperly admitted against Mitchell. Appellant\u2019s complaint that this evidence lacked sufficient indicia of reliability misses the mark. For purposes of the hearsay rule, inquiry into the reliability of the statement is not necessary where, as here, the statement in question falls squarely within a well-established hearsay exception. Because statements within established hearsay exceptions possess the imprimatur of \u201clongstanding judicial and legislative experience,\u201d their reliability is presumed. Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 817, 110 S.Ct. 8139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). Similarly, although a statement admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule may nonetheless be inadmissible under the state and federal confrontation clauses if it does not bear \u201cadequate indicia of reliability!,] ... reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d Id. at 815, 110 S.Ct. 3139. Alleged prior inconsistencies \u2014 such as appellant identifies \u2014 are classic points affecting evidentiary weight and not admissibility. The weight to be accorded the testimony, of course, is for the jury.\nAppellant next argues that a series of comments by the prosecutor, which went uncorrected by the trial court, effectively undid the redaction made to Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony and thereby violated his confrontation rights under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and its progeny. Specifically, appellant claims that on ten separate occasions during the prosecutor\u2019s opening and closing arguments, he \u201cpierced the veil created by the redactions and told the jury that [appellant] was, in fact, \u2018this guy\u2019 \u201d referred to in Jackson\u2019s redacted testimony. Brief of Appellant at 30-31. For example, appellant cites a portion of the opening argument in which the prosecutor stated that appellant armed himself with a gun that was given to him by Richard Mitchell:\nSteven McCrae turned to Richard Mitchell and said, \u201cgive me your gun.\u201d ... Mitchell immediately gave it to him and ... Steven McCrae armed himself with a gun that was given him by Richard Mitchell. McCrae then shot Kendrick Haskell in the chest.\nN.T. 11/16/00, at 91. Appellant identifies other statements in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, including remarks in which the prosecutor first characterized and then commented upon the credibility of appellant\u2019s testimony, testimony which identified the absent Jackson and not co-defendant Mitchell as the man who provided the gun:\nThe guy who was a member of our group, our friend, our gang, who hung on our corner, who grew up with us, who saw us every day, who known [sic] us for the last ten years, who should have known better than to give the police that statement and give us up ...\n* * *\nBut it was payback time for Braheem Jackson and the best way to pay him back would be to come in there on the day they arrest you and say I shot the first guy but I have an explanation for that and ... well, first of all, it was Braheem that handed me the gun ...\n* * *\n... after I shot the first guy I gave [the gun] to Braheem so I guess Braheem must have turned around and shot John Ford.\nN.T. 11/21/00, at 124-26.\nThe remaining contested statements occurred during a part of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in which he made clear that he was specifically addressing the evidence against co-defendant Mitchell, and not appellant. Id. at 152-190. The prosecutor began by stating, \u201cLet me talk about Richard Mitchell now....\u201d Id. at 152. The Commonwealth\u2019s case against co-defendant Mitchell was premised upon his supplying the murder weapon. Part of Mitchell\u2019s defense was appellant\u2019s own trial testimony that it was Jackson, not Mitchell, who provided the murder weapon. In arguing the case against Mitchell to the jury, the prosecutor, of course, adverted to Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony. Appellant nevertheless complains that that argument undid the redaction of the testimony to the extent the prosecutor argued that Mitchell gave the gun to appellant, rather than saying Mitchell gave it to the other guy. Appellant argues, in essence, that references to Mitchell as providing the gun to him specifically were improper and violated Bruton. No relief is due.\nAppellant failed to raise and preserve this claim in the trial court. Appellant lodged no objection whatsoever to the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument. Following the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, appellant objected that the prosecutor mistakenly stated during his summation that the jury had heard a 911 emergency telephone call made by an eyewitness to the murder. In addition, appellant objected to the prosecutor reading Jackson\u2019s redacted testimony during his closing argument. See id. at 194-96. Appellant never alleged in the trial court, as he does now, that the prosecutor\u2019s statements in his opening and closing arguments effectively undid the redaction of Jackson\u2019s testimony in contravention of the Bruton rule.\nBecause appellant failed to raise his Bruton claim in the trial court, the issue would ordinarily be deemed waived on appeal. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Nevertheless, under the relaxed waiver rule applicable to direct capital appeals, we will address the merits. Commonwealth v. Miller, 541 Pa. 531, 664 A.2d 1310, 1322 (1995).\nAs we have noted above, it is common in joint trials of multiple defendants that evidence is admitted solely against one defendant. Travers, 768 A.2d at 847. The general rule in such a circumstance is that an instruction to the jury that it is to consider the evidence only with respect to the defendant against whom it has been properly introduced is sufficient to remove any potential spillover prejudice to the defendant against whom the evidence was not admitted. Id. See also Commonwealth v. Bridges, 568 Pa. 1, 757 A.2d 859, 883 (2000) (\u201c[A] jury is presumed to have followed the instructions of the trial court.\u201d) (citation omitted); Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 661 A.2d 352, 361 (1995) (\u201cThe presumption in our law is that the jury follows instructions.\u201d).\n\u201cIn Bruton, however, the [United States] Supreme Court recognized a narrow exception to the general rule that cautionary instructions are sufficient to eradicate any potential prejudice in joint trials.\u201d Travers, 768 A.2d at 847. In Bruton, the trial court had admitted into evidence at a joint trial the confession of Bruton\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant, which actually named and incriminated Bruton in the crime on trial. The trial court instructed the jury that the confession \u201cif used, can only be used against [Bruton\u2019s co-defendant],\u201d and could not be considered as evidence against Bruton. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 126 n. 2, 88 S.Ct. 1620. The Supreme Court acknowledged that, as a general matter, the presumption in the law is that the jury will follow the court\u2019s instruction. The Court reasoned, however, that, in some contexts, \u201cthe risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow the judge\u2019s instructions is so great, and the consequences of such a failure so substantial for the defendant, that the practical and human limitations on the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d Id. The Court continued that:\nSuch a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial. Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their testimony carefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others. The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination. It was against such threats to a fair trial that the Confrontation Clause was directed.\nId. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620. Accordingly, the Court held that the admission of the powerfully incriminating statement by the non-testifying co-defendant violated Bruton\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, notwithstanding the jury charge.\nFollowing Bruton, the Supreme Court approved redaction and a limiting instruction as a means of eliminating possible prejudice arising from the admission of a co-defendant\u2019s confession at a joint trial in Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (no Bruton violation where co-defendant\u2019s confession was redacted to remove all reference to defendant and jury was instructed to consider confession as evidence against co-defendant only). See also Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998) (\u201cUnless the prosecutor wishes to hold separate trials or to use separate juries or to abandon use of the confession, he must redact the confession to reduce significantly or to eliminate the special prejudice that the Bruton Court found.\u201d). This Court has also endorsed the practice. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 474 Pa. 410, 378 A.2d 859, 860 (1977) (\u201cThe basic theory of redaction seems sound. If a confession can be edited so that it retains its narrative integrity and yet in no way refers to defendant, then use of it does not violate the principles of Bruton.\u201d).\nBruton applies, however, only in the context that gave rise to the decision, i.e., the introduction of a powerfully incriminating statement made by a non-testifying co-defendant at a joint trial. See Richardson, 481 U.S. at 207, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (Bruton applies to statements that expressly implicate defendant and are therefore powerfully incriminating); Commonwealth v. Gribble, 550 Pa. 62, 703 A.2d 426, 437 (1997) (\u201cWhen the non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s statement does not inculpate the other defendant, there is no violation of the right of confrontation.\u201d). Bruton is inapplicable to statements made by an individual other than a non-testifying co-defendant at a joint trial of co-defendants. See Commonwealth v. Robins, 571 Pa. 248, 812 A.2d 514, 521 (2002) (opinion announcing judgment of court); United States v. Artis, 917 F.Supp. 347, 349 (E.D.Pa.1996) (Bruton does not apply to incriminating statement by co-defendant\u2019s wife because she was not defendant at joint trial).\nHere, appellant asserts that the trial court erred because the prosecutor\u2019s comments during his opening and closing statements undid the redaction of Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony in violation of Bruton. Appellant\u2019s claim, however, pivots on the faulty presumption that the Bruton rule applies to Jackson\u2019s testimony. It does not. The statement here was not made by co-defendant Mitchell. Moreover, Jackson was never charged in relation to the criminal incident, let alone tried jointly with appellant. It is the particularly \u201cdevastating\u201d prejudicial effect and inherent \u201cunreliability\u201d of a directly incriminating statement made by a non-testifying co-defendant that powered Bruton\u2019s exception to the general rule that cautionary charges are enough to avoid spillover prejudice in joint trials. 391 U.S. at 136, 88 S.Ct. 1620. These concerns are simply not present in the instant context involving the statement of a non-party eyewitness to the crime.\nBecause Bruton is inapplicable to Jackson\u2019s statement, there was no requirement, at least under Bruton, to redact it. This was one of the \u201cmany circumstances\u201d in which an instruction to the jury to consider this evidence only against the defendant against whom it was offered presumably would have been adequate to safeguard against the potential of spillover prejudice. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620. We note that we are not suggesting that the trial court erred in redacting the statement. To the contrary, the court here acted cautiously in taking Bruton-like measures to further ensure the absence of spillover prejudice in a joint trial. But the point is that, in response to the belated Bruton claim raised by appellant, there was no Bruton-based trial court error in allegedly permitting the prosecutor to undo the redaction in his opening and closing arguments.\nAlthough Bruton is inapplicable, we note that a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation may nonetheless be implicated where the prior testimony of an unavailable witness is introduced against a co-defendant at a joint trial, if the defendant did not have the opportunity to cross-examine that witness. See generally 5 WIGMORE ON EVIDENCE \u00a7 1398 (Chadbourn rev. 1974 & Supp. 2002). For example, in Commonwealth v. LaRosa, 533 Pa. 479, 626 A.2d 103 (1993), this Court determined that, under the circumstances of that case, the judge\u2019s instructions were insufficient to protect the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights where the prosecution introduced against a co-defendant the preliminary hearing testimony of an unavailable witness. Id. at 108. Because the unavailable witness\u2019s prior testimony was actually exculpatory of the co-defendant and extremely inculpatory of the defendant, this Court concluded that, in light of the other evidence, the only logical explanation for the jury\u2019s verdict convicting the defendant of third degree murder and the co-defendant of only voluntary manslaughter was that the jury disregarded the court\u2019s limiting instruction regarding the prior testimony. Id. The LaRosa Court noted that the trial court had failed to repeat its limiting instruction when the jury asked to have the prior testimony read back to it during deliberations, thus increasing the risk that the jury improperly considered the prior testimony.\nHere, by contrast, a disregard of the court\u2019s repeated instructions is not the only logical explanation for the jury\u2019s verdict. Although Braheem Jackson\u2019s prior testimony provided crucial evidence linking Mitchell to the crime, it was insignificant to the case against appellant. In fact, except for the question of who passed the murder weapon to appellant, Jackson\u2019s testimony was entirely consistent with appellant\u2019s own testimony that he shot Haskell, but did not shoot Ford. Moreover, unlike LaRosa, the trial court here redacted Jackson\u2019s prior testimony so that any references to appellant were replaced with the neutral term, \u201cthis guy,\u201d and the judge twice thoroughly instructed the jury that the testimony was admissible against Mitchell only. In any event, we do not read LaRosa as inconsistent with the usual presumption that a jury will follow a judge\u2019s limiting instructions. Thus, we are satisfied that the judge\u2019s limiting instructions in the case sub judice were sufficient to protect appellant\u2019s confrontation rights, notwithstanding the allegedly prejudicial but unobjected to comments of the prosecutor.\nIn addition, we find any error in the prosecutor\u2019s comments to be harmless. See Commonwealth v. Stallworth, 566 Pa. 349, 781 A.2d 110, 120 (2001); Commonwealth v. Samuels, 566 Pa. 109, 778 A.2d 638, 641 (2001). The prosecutor\u2019s references to Jackson\u2019s prior testimony were de mini-mus, since overwhelming independent evidence existed to prove that appellant shot Haskell first and then Ford. As detailed above, multiple witnesses to the crime testified that they saw appellant, or someone who looked like appellant, shoot two people. Appellant himself admitted that he shot Haskell three times. Except as to the identity of the person who gave the murder weapon to appellant \u2014 an issue primarily in the case against Mitchell \u2014 Jackson\u2019s prior testimony was consistent with appellant\u2019s own testimony at trial, ie., both men testified that appellant and his friends exchanged words with Haskell, after which appellant shot him. Although the identity of the person who gave the murder weapon to appellant was critical to the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Mitchell, it was relatively insignificant to the case against appellant. The trial court\u2019s jury instructions concerning the proper limited use of Jackson\u2019s prior testimony, see N.T. 11/21/00, at 212-214, then further rendered any error harmless. See Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155, 165 n. 18 (1978).\nFinally, this Court must conduct a statutory review of the death sentences. Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3), this Court must affirm the sentences of death unless we determine that:\n(i) the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; or (ii) the evidence fails to support the findings of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d).\nId. After careful review of the record below, we conclude that the sentence imposed was not the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor. We also conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish the aggravating circumstance found by the jury: that appellant was convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue. Since the jury found that that aggravating factor outweighed the two mitigating factors, it was statutorily required to impose the sentences of death. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv). We see no record-based reason to negate that determination.\nAccordingly, we affirm the verdict and sentences of death imposed upon appellant by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion in which Chief Justice CAPPY and Justice NIGRO join.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.\n. The aggravating circumstance found by the jury was that appellant was convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(ll). The two mitigating circumstances were that appellant had no significant history of criminal convictions, id. \u00a7 9711(e)(1), and appellant\u2019s age, id. \u00a7 9711(e)(4).\n. Appellant, who is African-American, testified that he was wearing a white T-shirt, dark blue jeans, and a baseball cap on the evening of the shootings. N.T. 11/20/00, at 201.\n. The trial court included a similar comprehensive instruction in its final charge to the jury, stating no less than four times that Jackson's preliminary hearing testimony was not evidence against appellant:\nNow, in this case, members of the jury, the Commonwealth introduced the preliminary hearing testimony of the witness Braheem Jackson ...\nThis prior recorded testimony is admissible only in the case of the defendant who was present at that prior hearing. In this case it was Mr. Milchell who was present represented by an attorney and who had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness when he testified.\nThe prior recorded testimony of Mr. Jackson was admitted as evidence in the case of Commonwealth versus Richard Mitchell only and is to be considered by you solely as evidence being offered in the case of Commonwealth versus Richard Mitchell.\nThe prior recorded testimony is not at all admissible in the case of Commonwealth versus Steven McCrae and is not to be considered as evidence in his case by you in your deliberations. This is because Mr. McCrae was not present during the hearing that took place on October 1, 1998 wherein the witness Braheem Jackson testified and as such, Mr. McCrae did not have any opportunity to cross-examine this witness concerning his testimony.\nTo repeat the prior recorded testimony of Braheem Jackson is admissible as evidence only in the case of Commonwealth versus Richard Mitchell. It is to be considered by you only in deciding the case of Commonwealth versus Richard Mitchell. It is not to be considered by you in deciding the case of Commonwealth versus Steven McCrae.\nN.T. 11/21/00, at 211-214.\n. The prosecutor responded that he had read Jackson\u2019s statements as they were redacted by the trial court. The prosecutor added that he read them in the context of his discussion of the evidence against Mitchell and made clear that ihey were to be considered as evidence only against Mitchell. The trial court ruled that it would repeat the instruction directing the jury to consider Jackson\u2019s prior testimony only against appellant\u2019s co-defendant Mitchell, not appellant, in its final charge to the jury. Appellant lodged no further objection, nor did he contend that he was entitled to greater relief than the trial court gave him. See id. at 196-97.\n. This Court abrogated the relaxed waiver rule in Commonwealth v. Freeman, 827 A.2d 385 (Pa.2003). We adopted a new general rule providing that claims that were not properly preserved and raised in the trial court are waived and unreviewable in capital direct appeals. Id. at 402. This new rule, however, applies prospectively only. Id. The relaxed waiver doctrine continues to apply to direct appeals such as the instant one in which the appellant\u2019s brief was filed prior to, or was due to be filed within the 30 days of, this Court's decision in Freeman. Id. at 403.\n. Viewed in context, it is not entirely clear that the prosecutor's comments were improper. Again, appellant admitted that a gun was passed to him and that he shot Haskell. To the extent that the prosecutor\u2019s argument identified appellant as the person to whom the gun was passed, it was based upon evidence independent of Jackson\u2019s redacted testimony. The prosecutor relied upon Jackson\u2019s testimony primarily for the proper purpose of identifying Mitchell, rather than Jackson, as the man who provided the gun.\n. The Prothonotary of this Court is directed to transmit to the Governor's office a full and complete record of the trial, sentencing hearing, imposition of sentence and review by the Supreme Court in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 971 l(i).",

        "text": "JUSTICE SAYLOR\nCONCURRING.\nRespectfully, I take issue with the majority\u2019s assertion that it is not clear that challenged commentary by the district attorney during his closing speech concerning the preliminary hearing testimony of Braheem Jackson was improper. See Majority Opinion at 1039 n. 9. Certainly a prosecutor is not always bound to ignore contextual implications of an out-of-court statement arising in light of other trial evidence, see generally Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), and therefore, in this case for example, to disavow that the evidence demonstrated that Appellant was the person to whom Jackson was referring in accusatory references couched (before the jury) in terms of \u201cthis guy.\u201d A prosecutor may not, however, after a trial court has assiduously redacted accusatory references, directly attribute the accusation to the redacted witness statement. Yet this is precisely what occurred here, when the district attorney, in various permutations during his closing argument, indicated that \u201cBraheem Jackson said, Richard Mitchell had a gun, he gave it to McCrae.\u201d N.T., Nov. 21, 2000, at 177; see also id. at 125, 156, 163-64. Whether this breach was intentional or not, it violated both the letter and the spirit of the trial court\u2019s directive and therefore should be recognized as improper. This is particularly the case where admission of Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony containing the statements was secured, inter alia, on the district attorney\u2019s representation to the trial court that \u201cI submit to the Court that the redactions that I have ... undertaken in this case are sufficient to protect the defendant^ i.e., Appellant].\u201d N.T., Nov. 17, 2000, at 180.\nWhile the above reference to Jackson\u2019s testimony occurred during summation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Appellant\u2019s co-defendant, it should be noted that the district attorney also disregarded the trial court\u2019s instructions to the effect that Jackson\u2019s testimony was not to be used against Appellant in his summation of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against\nAppellant. Specifically, this occurred in the district attorney\u2019s rebuttal of Appellant\u2019s claim to a lesser degree of culpability than first degree murder. In this regard, the district attorney stated that Appellant should be judged by his actions, including that, immediately prior to the killings, he\nturned and asked for a gun, a lethal weapon, the one weapon in this country responsible for probably killing more people than any other, a weapon which he even himself admitted he knows is capable, oh, yes, quite capable of killing.\nHe asked for a loaded operable gun....\nN.T., Nov. 21, 2000, at 147. Since the only evidence of record suggesting that Appellant affirmatively asked for a firearm just before the killings derived from Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony, see N.T., Nov. 17, 2000, at 244-267, this line of argumentation had no place in the district attorney\u2019s closing vis-\u00e1-vis Appellant, in light of the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions.\nOn the broader legal points involved, while I agree with the majority that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s specific holding in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), is not controlling here, I would not apply as categorical an approach to the Sixth Amendment principles underlying Bruton as the majority seems to apply. In particular, I would not exclude the possibility that such principles might render cautionary instructions insufficient to prevent the possibility of spillover prejudice in some larger set of circumstances analogous to, but not overlapping with, those before the United States Supreme Court in Bruton.\nConcerning the disposition of this case, ultimately I agree with majority that the district attorney\u2019s transgressions of trial court directives do not entitle Appellant to a new trial, as the general incriminatory aspect of Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was cumulative of the overwhelming evidence demonstrating Appellant\u2019s participation in the killings. It is a closer case, in my view, with respect to the district attorney\u2019s argument related to Jackson\u2019s reference to Appellant\u2019s request for a gun immediately prior to the killings in terms of its potential effect on the jury\u2019s determination concerning the degree of Appellant\u2019s culpability. However, in light of the strength of the inference of Appellant\u2019s intent arising from the use to which overwhelming evidence demonstrated that he put the firearm, as well as the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions, I agree with the majority\u2019s ultimate finding of harmlessness.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice NIGRO join this concurring opinion.",
