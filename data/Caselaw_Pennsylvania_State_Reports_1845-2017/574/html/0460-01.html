In support of this argument, appellee hypothesizes a number of fanciful scenarios in which § 3124.2 would trap the unwitting.

In pertinent part, § 3124.2 provides, “[A] person who is an employee or agent of ... a county correctional authority ... commits a felony of the third degree when that person engages in sexual intercourse ... or indecent contact with an inmate[.]” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3124.2(a). The statute’s plain language reveals the intent of the General Assembly: to prohibit sexual contact between correctional staff and inmates. It is sufficiently definite “that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited,” <em>Mikulan, </em>at 1342, and is not “so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application^]” <em>Heinbaugh, </em>at 246. The statute provides reasonable standards for correctional personnel to gauge their conduct — namely, sexual contact with inmates is forbidden. Whatever latent ambiguities may lurk in the terms “inmate” or “employee” are not implicated here. Appellee was a county corrections officer; she was unquestionably an “employee” of a county correctional facility. The persons with whom she allegedly had sexual contact were indisputably “inmates” at that facility. Appellee’s alleged conduct is precisely what the General Assembly intended to proscribe when it enacted § 3124.2, which is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>

Without question, the statute’s status as a third degree felony is inconsistent with a public welfare or regulatory offense. The court’s suggestion, however, that the statute “implicates legal activity” is questionable. Unlike possession of a rifle, which implicates a fundamental right, sex between correctional staff and inmates <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>is something a reasonable person- — to say nothing of a reasonable corrections officer-would know is highly inappropriate, if not illegal. There is no trap in § 3124.2 for the well-intentioned corrections officer.</p>
    <p id="b687-5" data-blocks='[["BL_687.4",687,[217,530,1159,949]]]'>Furthermore, the trial court overlooked the critical threshold issue in <em>Staples: </em>an inquiry into the authorized punishment and the character of the prohibited conduct is warranted only where the legislature’s intent as to <em>mens rea </em>is unclear. “[T]he definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.” <em>Staples, </em>at 604, <a href="/us/511/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="511 U.S. 600" data-case-ids="1147026" data-case-paths="/us/511/0600-01">114 S.Ct. 1793</a> (quoting <em>Liparota v.

The rale in this Commonwealth is no different: “Whether a given statute is to be construed as requiring criminal intent is to be determined by the court, by considering the subject matter of the prohibition as well as the language of the statute, and thus ascertaining the intention of the legislature.” <em>Commonwealth v. Black, </em><a href="/pa-super/251/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="251 Pa.

Although the statute is silent as to <em>mens rea, </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 302 provides for such situations: “CULPABILITY REQUIRED UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED. — When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(c). Once the trial court determined the General Assembly did not intend § 3124.2 to be a strict liability crime, it need have done nothing more than advert to § 302(c) and require the Commonwealth to prove at least recklessness. Thus, to be convicted under § 3124.2, a corrections officer would have to be at least reckless as to the status of their sexual partner as an “inmate, detainee, patient or resident.” 18 Pa.C.S. <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>§ 3124.2(a).

The court stated, “[B]ecause the statute is constitutionally deficient in so many aspects, it cannot be fixed merely by court clarification[.]” Id., at 8.
