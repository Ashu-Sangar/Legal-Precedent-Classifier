SEPTA applied for a real estate tax exemption with the Board on the basis that the property was immune and exempt from taxation for the years 1994 and thereafter. The Board granted a partial real estate tax exemption for the portions of the property used by SEPTA and other government and non-profit entities and exempted eighty-five percent of the property’s assessed value for 1994 and subsequent years.

According to SEPTA, in <em>Delaware, </em>this court announced that an agency is immune from taxation when the agency was acting within its authorized governmental purposes and powers. Thus, Appellees<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> must show that the agency is acting outside of its authorized purpose and powers in order to tax SEPTA’s property. In this case, Appellees cannot make this showing since the Legislature has given SEPTA the express authority to lease its real property in order to raise revenue, 74 Pa.C.S. § 1741(a)(12) and (a)(24). Thus, SEPTA concludes that the Commonwealth Court erred in determining that the excess property was not immune from taxation.</p>

Instead, after <em>Delaware County, </em>the test continues to be whether the agency actually uses the property for a public purpose. Appellees argue that <em>Delaware County </em>made this clear by relying on the decision in <em>West View Borough Municipal Authority Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/381/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="381 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1258819" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0416-01">381 Pa. 416</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="113 A.2d 307">113 A.2d 307</a> (1955).

In addition to the direct authorization of SEPTA's leasing activities, it is also worth noting the General Assembly's general prohibition of local taxation of SEPTA, even though that prohibition appears to be applicable only in the exemption context. <em>See </em>74 Pa.C.S. § 1781 (“such an authority shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments of any kind or nature whatsoever, now in existence or to be enacted in the future, whether imposed by the Commonwealth or by any government agency upon any property or the income therefrom acquired or used or permitted to be used by an authority...."); <em>cf.

Moreover, even assuming for the sake of argument that there is some sort of “public purpose" inquiry in the immunity analysis, I would find that SEPTA's leasing of real estate falls within its statutory purpose because the General Assembly has specifically included leasing within SEPTA’s purpose and has broadly defined that purpose to include activities beyond SEPTA's core transit function. <em>See </em>74 Pa.C.S. § 1711(a) ("An authority shall exist for the purpose of planning, acquiring, holding, constructing, improving, maintaining, operating, <em>leasing, either as lessor or lessee, and otherwise functioning with respect to a transportation system </em>in the metropolitan area and outside of such area, whether within or beyond the boundaries of this Commonwealth, to the extent necessary for the operation of an integrated transportation system....” (emphasis added)).</p>
