Further, the Department addressed the requirement of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure that it certify a record in connection with the appeal, <em>see </em>Pa.R.A.P.1952, via an affidavit from the Adjutant General indicating that relevant documents were of a federal character and subject to corresponding national retention directives. The Adjutant General attested that he had asked the responsible federal officials to provide such documentation as could be made available to the court within the bounds of the applicable federal laws and regulations. Various documents were then provided by the PAARNG human relations officer, including the report' of investigation, Rise’s rebuttal, documentation reflecting various official reviews and recommendations, and a record of the Adjutant General’s approval of Rise’s separation.</p>

In this respect, the Commonwealth Court cited, <em>inter alia, </em>the salient Army regulation, <em>see </em>AR 135-18, ch. 3-l.c (June 19, 1996) (“Personnel of the ARNGUS serving an AGR tour under the provisions of <a href="/citations/?q=32%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="32 U.S.C. § 502">32 U.S.C. § 502</a>(f)(2) ... serve in a State status.”), and commentary associated with relevant legislative amendments, <em>see </em>H.R.Rep.

The majority also determined that the Adjutant General acted in a state capacity in separating Rise from the AGR program, based on the Adjutant General’s position as a Commonwealth official. Although acknowledging the Adjutant General’s responsibility to administer federal laws and regulations, the majority nonetheless deemed it controlling that this is accomplished pursuant to state law authorization. <em>See Kise, </em><a href="/a2d/784/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="784 A.2d 253" data-case-ids="9462154" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0253-01">784 A.2d at 258-59</a>.</p>

The majority also determined that Rise’s constitutional rights were implicated by his separation from the AGR.

There is tension, however, between the components of this review process and the procedures set forth in NGR 600-5 since, for example and as discussed, state court review for constitutional violations must be carefully limited to exclude challenges to the federal, military regulations. Further incongruity with traditional administrative review results from: the regulations’ use of broad, open-ended concepts specific to military discipline such as “separation for cause,” “inappropriate professional conduct,” and “moral dere<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>liction;” the lack of a requirement for a hearing or the creation of a record in the conventional sense; and the absence of any requirement for the Adjutant General to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of a separation action. These characteristics, which we have determined are not subject to challenge in the state forum, further insulate the decision of the military establishment from state judicial review, since their consequence is to render unavailable various of the mechanisms by which state judicial review may be accomplished. The net effect is that the Commonwealth Court’s review of a separation action involving an AGR soldier, where separation is accomplished in reliance on federal, military regulations and no supplemental state procedures are required or invoked, is effectively limited to the determination whether the Adjutant General adhered to the federally mandated procedures.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Griffith, Jr., Commander, Headquarters 28th Infantry Division (Mechanized), based on an investigation under Army Regulation 15-6. After interviews with Kise and other witnesses, the investigating officer found that Kise, a non-commissioned officer, engaged in extramarital, intra-service sexual encounters with females in his unit serving in ranks lower than his own; that this occurred while Kise was on and off duty; and that Kise made knowingly false statements during the course of the investigation of his conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> The <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>Commonwealth Court’s opinion aptly summarizes the path of the investigative report through PAARNG’s chain of command. <em>See Kise, </em><a href="/a2d/784/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="784 A.2d 253" data-case-ids="9462154" data-case-paths="/a2d/784/0253-01">784 A.2d at 260</a>. At various stages in this process, it was acknowledged that Kise is a capable non-commissioned officer, but the conclusion was nonetheless maintained that the effect of his conduct on his unit’s morale and ethical climate was too great to support his retention in a position of supervisory responsibility in the AGR. Pursuant to the regulations, Kise was provided with the report of the investigation and permitted to comment <em>on it </em>and LTC Griffith’s recommendation.</p>

This is belied, however, by the report of investigation, which reflects the investigating officer’s interviews with him, and the written rebuttal that Kise was permitted to submit; moreover, the regulations do not establish any further, general participatory right. We also disagree with the Commonwealth Court’s determination that the record must be supplemented by the Department to explain the reasoning supporting the decision to forego counseling, to identify applicable regulations and policies of which Kise was in violation, and to define the controlling standards of unprofessional conduct and moral dereliction. Rather, we hold that, in view of the character of the conduct adjudged by the military establishment to have occurred, the military’s assessment of the impact of such conduct on unit readiness, Kise’s position as a non-commissioned officer in an organization that is to be comprised of the most highly qualified and exemplary soldiers, and the procedures that were afforded in accordance with the military directives, the Adjutant General acted within the ambit of his discretion in this matter.

The Commonwealth then controls and funds their activities, pursuant to 51 Pa.C.S. § 508; (2) special state active duty — the Governor may place or delegate authority to the AG to order volunteer members of the National Guard on special state duty “to respond to community needs, support Commonwealth functions, support federal, state and local drug eradication and interdiction operations and perform other necessary military duties to the extent funds are available.” This is state funded status authorized by 71 P.S. § 391e; (3) Title 10 (federal) status — this is when the President activates the National Guard for call-up, such as Operation Desert Shield. This duty is subject to the exclusive control of the federal government. This duty preempts any. state duty; (4) Title 32 status — this is a drilling member of the National Guard, who is compensated by the federal government as a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States. It is subject to the control of the AG and the Governor, but it is federal status pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=32%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="32 U.S.C. § 502">32 U.S.C. § 502</a>; (5) AGR status — full-time active duty by a member of the National Guard; subject to day-today control of the AG but federal in status, federally reimbursed and regulated, and authorized by <a href="/citations/?q=32%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="32 U.S.C. § 502">32 U.S.C. § 502</a>.
