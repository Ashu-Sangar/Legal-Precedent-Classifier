At the hearing, the offender was presumed to be a sexually violent predator and bore the burden of rebutting such presumption by clear and convincing evidence.

The determination of an individual’s status as such is only undertaken if the individual is convicted of a predicate offense. In this respect, the Act differs from the civil commitment statute at issue in <em>Hendricks, </em>under which a person could be deemed a sexually violent predator even if he had been acquitted by reason of insanity or found incompetent to stand trial. <em>See Hendricks, </em><a href="/us/521/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="521 U.S. 346" data-case-ids="916116" data-case-paths="/us/521/0346-01">521 U.S. at 352</a>, <a href="/us/521/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="521 U.S. 346" data-case-ids="916116" data-case-paths="/us/521/0346-01">117 S.Ct. at 2077</a>. Still, not all of Megan’s Law II’s predicate offenses require a finding of scienter for conviction; some can be committed whether or not the defendant is aware of certain facts that make his conduct criminal. For example, a defendant who creates a visual record or depiction of sexual acts by a minor child can be convicted of sexual abuse of children pursuant to Section 6312(b) of the Crimes Code, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6312(b), even where he has a good faith belief that the child is over eighteen years of age. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6312(e.l).

Such interpretation, however, is unwarranted by the statutory text. Although the information is made available to the general public, by the terms of the statute it is provided only “upon request.” Hence, the most natural interpretation of this provision is that, if any member of the public specifically requests the information, it will be made available to that person. Notably, much of the data involved is a matter of public record. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9798(a) (specifying the registration information subject to disclosure). It is difficult to see how disseminating it to a member of the public upon specific request is constitutionally problematic, particularly in light of the legislative findings and in the absence of evidence and judicial findings to the contrary. Moreover, because the data is made available primarily for the benefit of those having an interest in guarding themselves, or those under their care, against a risk of predation, any additional disclosure should be regarded as ancillary to the main remedial purpose sought to be accomplished by community notification.</p>

Although Megan’s Law II does not contain a severability provision, unless otherwise specified the individual provisions of all statutes are presumptively severable. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1925. Severance is precluded only where, after the void provisions are excised, the remainder of the statute is incapable of execution in accordance with legislative intent. <em>See <a href="/us/467/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="467 U.S. 253" data-case-ids="6198853" data-case-paths="/us/467/0253-01">id.</a> </em>Furthermore, the fact that an unconstitutional provision is found within an otherwise valid section does not preclude its severance. <em>See Rieck-McJunkin Dairy Co. v.

They do so by erecting an enormous disincentive for failing to comply. Conceptually, however, they constitute an “add-on” to the integrated legislative scheme as set out in the remainder of the statute. Those requirements, and the system under which they operate, form a distinct program. Moreover, even absent the penalty provisions, enforcement is possible. Because registration and verification are statutorily required, the district attorney could implicate the judicial process through an enforcement proceeding in which failure to comply with the resulting order would be punishable by the court’s contempt powers. Under these circumstances, it cannot reasonably be contended that the valid provisions of Megan’s Law II are so dependent upon the penalty provisions that the General Assembly would not have enacted the former without the latter. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1925.

New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/306/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="179" data-cite="306 U.S. 451" data-case-ids="6140919" data-case-paths="/us/306/0451-01">306 U.S. 451</a>, <a href="/us/306/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="180" data-cite="306 U.S. 451" data-case-ids="6140919" data-case-paths="/us/306/0451-01">59 S.Ct. 618</a>, <a href="/us/306/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="181" data-cite="306 U.S. 451" data-case-ids="6140919" data-case-paths="/us/306/0451-01">83 L.Ed. 888</a> (1939), compels a finding that any assessment under the Act is unconstitutional. In <em>Lametta, </em>the Supreme Court struck down a state law which made it a crime to be a "gangster.” The legislation thus created a criminal offense based upon certain conduct, but failed to define the prohibited conduct in a sufficiently specific manner. <em>See <a href="/us/306/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="306 U.S. 451" data-case-ids="6140919" data-case-paths="/us/306/0451-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/306/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="306 U.S. 451" data-case-ids="6140919" data-case-paths="/us/306/0451-01">at 453</a>, <a href="/us/306/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="306 U.S. 451" data-case-ids="6140919" data-case-paths="/us/306/0451-01">59 S.Ct. at 619</a>. Megan's Law II, by contrast, does not criminalize any conduct, and, as noted, provides a specific list of offenses that trigger a predator status assessment. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9792, 9795.1.</p>

Section (d)(1) states, “An individual subject to registration under section 9795.1(a) who fails to register with the Pennsylvania State Police as required in this section commits a felony of the third degree.’’ 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.2(d)(1). Section 9795.1(a), however, does not pertain to sexually violent predators. As this appeal only concerns the Act's mandatory sanctions applicable to sexually violent predators, no challenge to the penalty imposed by Section 9795.2(d)(1) is presently before the Court.</p>

Like the first penalty section, this provision has a counterpart, stating, “Any individual subject to registration under section 9795.1(a) who fails to verify his residence or be photographed as required in this section commits a felony of the third degree.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9796(e)(1). Because sexually violent predators are not covered by Section 9795.1(a), no challenge to this provision is before the Court.</p>

In addition to claiming that Megan’s Law is punitive, Appellees assert that it is void for vagueness and violative of substantive due process guarantees and the separation of powers doctrine. Appellees also maintain that the statute contains more than one subject in contravention of Article III, Section 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
