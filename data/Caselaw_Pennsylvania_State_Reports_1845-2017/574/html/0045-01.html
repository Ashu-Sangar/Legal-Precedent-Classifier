Testimony adduced before the Zoning Board indicated that the building was initially constructed as a stable; that in about 1936 it was converted in use to a garage; and sometime thereafter to an automobile dealership and repair facility called Fifth Avenue Motor Cars. The Zoning Board's Zone Case No. 448- A of 1990, on remand from the court of common pleas following an appeal from the Zoning Board’s denial of an application to construct a one-story, vertical addition and to convert the use of the building from that of a "major garage” to a medical office building resulted in a revision of ihe proposal to eliminate the addition and to change the proposed use of the building to offices generally. As so amended, the application was approved and, apparently, implemented. In Zone Case No. 186 of 1999 the Zoning Board, in a decision dated September 17, 1999, denied Landowners’ application for variance and special exception relief needed to erect a two-story vertical addition and to increase the number of basement parking spaces in order to expand the office use. Since offices are not a permitted use in RM zoning districts (See Code § 911.02: Use Table; R.R. page 115a), the application refused in Zone Case No. 186 of 1999, unlike that here presented, involved the expansion of a nonconforming <em>use. </em>On September 21, 1999 the zoning administrator granted Landowners’ application for an occupancy/building permit pursuant to Code § 922.02A for a two-story vertical addition to be used as five (5) dwelling units; that is, a use permitted by right in the RM-3 zoning district. Protestants’ appeal to the Zoning Board from the issuance of the permit was docketed by the agency as Zone Case No. 286 of 1999.</p>

      <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>The nonconformity requested in <em>Yocum </em>was minimal, the extension of one end of an existing second story (which was conforming, set back 25'; the ordinance required 20’), to the edge of the nonconforming front of the first floor (which was set back only 17’). The nonconformity at issue was an extra 105 square feet, 3' on the second floor of a 35' wide row home. This Court stated: “[t]he proposed construction does not violate the zoning ordinance by a vertical or upward extension of the building nor does the extension frontward and horizontally of the second floor <em>substantially </em>violate the front yard ‘set back’ provision of the ordinance.” <em>Yocum, </em>at 605 (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[203,949,1158,508]]]'>According to the record, the present nonconformity is certainly substantial. The lot is about 106' by 97' and the building is not set back at all; the setbacks otherwise required are 25' on three sides, and 10' on the other. Each story without setbacks would comprise about 10,282 square feet; if set back according to the ordinance, the dimensions would be about 56' by 62', and each story’s area would be 3,472 square feet, only one-third the footprint of the existing building. We are involved with 13,620 square feet, not the 105 square feet of <em>Yocum.</em>

Any other <em>conforming </em>owner is told: “Sony. We know your neighbor can build upwards without regard to the setbacks, but you, having a footprint that conforms to the zoning law, will not be excused from setbacks on any vertical expansion. He can ignore them because he’s not in conformance — because you are conforming, you must continue to conform.”</p>

It seems counterintuitive to permit the expansion of nonconformity when a goal of zoning is to reduce nonconformity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> This is “two wrongs make a right,” and is manifestly unfair to owners whose properties conform in the first place.</p>

      <em>Yocum, </em>as interpreted by the majority, also raises equal protection problems; how can the law give this owner’s building an advantage over another’s conforming building? Excusing the existing nonconformity is one thing, but does that justify creating a right to ignore setbacks when building vertically that extends to the nonconforming property only? Allowing such disparate treatment does not flow from the reasons allowing the original nonconformity, nor does it flow from any apparent need unique to nonconforming properties. If application of the ordinance creates disparate treatment without reason or justification, the constitution is compromised.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[285,1296,1158,539]]]'>I can find no reason in logic for a rule that gives nonconforming properties advantageous treatment. I find logic only in treating nonconforming properties the same as conforming ones, not better than conforming ones. I question not only the logic but the constitutionality of such disparate application of the zoning laws. I agree with the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that <em>Yocum </em>permits only <em>de minimis </em>extension of nonconforming structures, and tripling the size of this building is not <em>de minimis. </em>Accordingly, I must offer this respectful dissent from the thoughtful analysis of my colleagues.</p>

The purpose of setbacks is to promote access to light and air, enhance aesthetics, maintain privacy, insulate improvements from street activities such as noise, traffic, and exhaust fumes, influence the population density, and improve fire safety by limiting the potential of fire spread to other structures and ensuring access of fire apparatus. <em>See </em>Zoning and Planning Deskbook, Second Edition, § 3:6.
