    <p id="b444-6" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[284,455,1160,474]]]'>This capital case, currently on review under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546 (the “PCRA”), was previously remanded to the PCRA court for a written opinion providing adequate reasons for dismissal without an evidentiary hearing, per Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a). <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P.1925(a). Due to the retirement from the bench of the judge who presided over the post-conviction proceedings, the common pleas court (per another judge) was unable to comply, but instead, provided the following explanation:</p>
    <blockquote id="b444-7" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[326,957,1115,364]]]'>This Court has thoroughly reviewed the entire post conviction record, including all petitions and responses. Beyond quoting the Commonwealth’s Motion to Dismiss, this Court cannot glean the reasons for [the prior judge’s] dismissing an initial Post Conviction Relief Act Petition, in a death case, without an evidentiary hearing where the issues raised by present counsel do not appear frivolous.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b444-8" data-blocks='[["BL_444.7",444,[323,1348,1118,527]]]'>Moreover, this court is without jurisdiction to make any rulings as the case is presently on appeal. This court can only guess at why [the prior judge] did what he did again by examining the Commonwealth’s Motion to Dismiss. This court’s conjectured or speculative rationale for [the prior judge’s] dismissal cannot and would not advance the cause of justice. To the contrary, to compel this Court to answer for another’s inexplicable act, in a capital case where the trial judge and defense counsel’s personal animus is apparent from the record, would be improper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b444-9" data-blocks='[["BL_444.8",444,[325,1904,1118,142]]]'>For these reasons, this Court cannot offer a statement of reasons but does urge the Court to use its plenary powers to review the dismissal.</blockquote>
