      <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>On January 15, 2001, Appellant filed a three-count complaint in the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas, naming as defendants her employer the Pennsylvania State Police, State Police Commissioner Colonel Paul J. Evanko, and Deputy Commissioner Lieutenant Colonel Thomas K. Coury (collectively, Appellees), and demanding a jury trial. Appellant’s action stemmed from an internal investigation undertaken by the State Police in connection with Appellant’s application for a job promotion. Appellant maintained in her complaint that certain State Police employees involved in conducting the investigation were permitted to delve improperly into her personal affairs, including her private, inter-personal relationships. While Appellant did not contend that Commissioner Evanko or Deputy Commissioner Coury personally inquired into such private matters or instructed others to do so, she asserted that those officials failed to ensure that the individuals conducting the investigation were properly trained to inquire only into areas which were appropriate and relevant to the subject of the investigation. She also alleged that, even after she made Commissioner Evanko aware of the nature of the ongoing investigative activities, he failed to take any corrective action.</p>
    <p id="b772-4" data-blocks='[["BL_772.4",772,[283,1501,1159,731]]]'>In Count I of the complaint, Appellant sought relief against the State Police, as well as Commissioners Evanko and Coury in their official capacities, in the form of a declaration that her privacy and reputational interests were harmed during the internal investigation. She also sought an injunction restraining these same parties from using the private information obtained about her for any purpose, or from subjecting her to a similar investigative process in the future. In Counts II and III of the complaint, Appellant sought an award of monetary damages and attorneys’ fees from Commissioner Evanko for alleged constitutional deprivations undertaken outside the scope of his authority as Commissioner of State Police, which resulted in emotional distress and injury to Appellant’s reputation.</p>

Appellant filed a timely response in which she stated, <em>inter </em>alia, that because Counts II and III were brought against Commissioner Evanko in his individual capacity, jurisdiction properly lay in the court of common pleas as to those counts. Thereafter, the common pleas court determined that exclusive jurisdiction lay with the Commonwealth Court and, on August 17, 2001, entered an order granting Appellees’ objection to jurisdiction and transferring the action to the Commonwealth Court.</p>

The present matter is distinguishable. Here, Appellant does not seek to preclude enforcement of an allegedly invalid administrative regulation, or a judicial declaration concerning its validity. Rather, her request for judicial redress stems from a series of events specific to a single departmental inquiry, and is explicitly predicated upon the lack of any regulatory or other legal foundation for such actions. Thus, while couched in constitutional terms, Appellant’s cause of action as stated in Count I rests upon the same allegations of defamation and invasion of privacy as asserted in Counts II and III. The sum and substance of Appellant’s complaint, then, is that her privacy and reputational interests were invaded when state police officials unlawfully delved into her intimate inter-personal relationships during an internal affairs investigation, and that she is entitled to compensation accordingly. In these circumstances, we do not believe the inclusion of a count for declaratory or injunctive relief premised upon the same events can properly be understood to transform the complaint from one sounding in trespass into the type of matter contemplated by <em>Fawber, </em>or by the Legislature, as belonging within the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
