The affidavit averred that a reliable confidential informant (hereinafter “Cl”) informed Sgt. Black that he could arrange a purchase of cocaine. The affidavit noted that the Cl had given information in the past to both the Elizabeth Township Police Department and the McKeesport Police Department that had led to the arrests of other drug law offenders. In the middle part of February, the affidavit continued, the Cl, working under the direction of Sgt. Black, was given $100 in “official funds” after a strip search revealed that he had nothing on his person. The Cl then met a person identified in the affidavit only as an “unwitting informant” (hereinafter “UI”), who took the Cl to a residence in North Versailles where the UI indicated he could purchase cocaine for the Cl.</p>

The UI returned a short time later with cocaine in powder form. The Cl and the UI proceeded together to another location, still under the supervision of Sgt. Black. The Cl and UI then parted company, at which point the Cl met immediately with Sgt. Black, delivering to him the cocaine the UI had purchased from a person in appellee’s residence. The powder field-tested positive for cocaine. The transaction took place between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.</p>

The affidavit noted that Det. Comunale had received numerous tips concerning a high volume of traffic at appellee’s residence, especially in the late night and early morning hours. This traffic involved vehicles arriving at appellee’s residence, the drivers and/or passengers going into the residence, exiting a short time later, and driving away. Det. Comunale also recounted a traffic stop of appellee in the late 1980s during which he had smelled the odor of burnt marijuana and appellee admitted he had been smoking a marijuana cigarette.</p>

The Cl then attempted -without success to contact the UI by telephone. At that point, the Cl offered to approach appellee’s residence and attempt to make the controlled buy on his own and police approved of that procedure. Accordingly, at approximately 1:15 a.m. on the morning of March 1, 1995, police supervised a transaction during which the Cl, after having both his car and person searched, entered appellee’s <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>residence with the recorded buy money and returned four to five minutes later with cocaine.

In an opinion filed pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), the trial court explained its reasons for denying suppression. The court noted that an anticipatory search warrant “presupposes” that the evidence to be searched for is not then present on the premises. In the trial court’s view, such a warrant is proper if the factual averments support a belief that the evidence “will arrive at the place to be searched upon the happening of a particular event.” The court noted that law enforcement officers are not obliged to wait until a criminal scheme is brought to fruition before seeking a war<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>rant; rather, so long as the issuing authority is presented with sufficient information to support a reasonable belief that there is a fair probability that evidence of past or present criminal activity will be on the premises when searched, the warrant may lawfully issue. Turning to the averments in this case, the court reasoned that the warrant affidavit established both that there was ongoing criminal activity at appellee’s residence and a fair probability that there would be evidence of that activity present in the residence on March 1,1995. The court deemed the evidence concerning the first drug transaction to be sufficient in itself to support a warrant, while the second transaction, “which had to take place before the warrant became valid for execution,” “only served to bolster the degree of probable cause already established and to eliminate any staleness problems because the date of the first transaction was as long as two weeks” prior to the warrant application. These averments, as well as the averments concerning the reliability of the Cl and other suspicious nighttime activity taking place at appellee’s residence, led the court to conclude that the district justice properly issued the warrant.

In the <em>Reviera </em>case, a man suspected of selling drugs from the house told an undercover officer, who had attempted to purchase cocaine, that a cocaine shipment would arrive at 10 p.m. that night. In <em>DiGiovanni </em>police had assumed control of a United Parcel Service (UPS) shipment of marijuana to the targeted premises after the UPS had informed authorities that it discovered the contraband in the package. <a href="/a2d/769/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="769 A.2d 462" data-case-ids="11110898" data-case-paths="/a2d/769/0462-01">769 A.2d at 465-66</a>.

The panel discounted the evidence concerning the prior drug sale because of the time lapse (from mid-February until the warrant request on February 28) and because the information gleaned from the previous sale did not reveal the quantity of illegal drugs present at appellee’s residence. While the panel deemed the prior sale “probative,” it reasoned that the prior sale alone did not establish a fair probability that contraband would be present on March 1. The panel then concluded that the averments concerning the anticipated drug transaction on March 1 likewise were insufficient in themselves to support the warrant. In this analysis, the panel quoted from its previous decision in <em>Coleman I, </em>where it had opined that there was “ ‘no information ... to indicate that the March 1st transaction would ever occur.’ ” <em>Coleman II, </em><a href="/a2d/769/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="769 A.2d 462" data-case-ids="11110898" data-case-paths="/a2d/769/0462-01">769 A.2d at 467</a>, <em>quoting Coleman I, </em><a href="/a2d/743/0983-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="743 A.2d 983" data-case-ids="11493619" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0983-01">743 A.2d at 989</a>.

The Commonwealth contends that the proper approach in the anticipatory warrant context should examine whether there is a fair probability that the evidence to be searched for will be present if the described future event occurs, since the warrant’s execution is conditioned upon the ripening of that circumstance. In the Commonwealth’s view, identification of the “triggering event” in the body of the warrant, and the conditioning of execution upon the occurrence of that event, ensure antecedent judicial control over proposed searches. The Commonwealth also argues that here, as in <em>DiGiovanni </em>and <em>Glass, </em>the police controlled the delivery of the evidence (the recorded buy money) which was the subject of the anticipatory warrant and thus, under the Superior Court’s own analysis, the affidavit should be deemed sufficient. In the Commonwealth’s view, the triggering event here was no more inherently speculative than in any other case involving an anticipatory warrant, <em>i.e., </em>there is always a chance that nobody will be home or will respond when the police or a police agent arrives with the evidence, or that the person who answers the door will refuse to accept the goods or evidence or that, for some other reason, the event will not unfold as anticipated.</p>

Appellee also argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>Glass </em>and <em>DiGiovanni </em>because police here did not participate in the controlled delivery of contraband to the premises, but instead controlled the buy money and were relying upon the Cl to arrange a drug transaction at the premises.

The police interest in appellee’s home was bottomed upon specific information from a reliable confidential informant that was then corroborated by an actual, controlled purchase of cocaine earlier that month. In addition, other tips Detective Comunale had received, relating that there was a high volume of late-night and early-morning activity at the residence — activity which was consistent with the very type of controlled drug buy police had supervised here — suggested that the controlled buy was not an isolated or one-time incident. Thus, contrary to the Superior Court panel’s expressed concern, when the affiants detailed their intention to attempt another controlled buy in the same manner here, it was not a case of police “conjur[ing] up [a] scenario[ ] that would give rise to probable cause.” Rather, police targeted a location they believed to be housing an ongoing retail drug enterprise, detailed their intention to engage in a buy similar to the previous one and similar to the nature of the enterprise, and then requested approval to search if, and only if, the anticipated drug buy succeeded.</p>

As the Superior Court noted, the informant/buyer could have been turned away from the residence “for any number of reasons.” But, as the Commonwealth correctly responds, that is a possibility in all cases of anticipatory warrants. Thus, in <em>Reviera, </em>the expected shipment of cocaine could have been delayed; or it may never have arrived because the supplier reneged or noticed police in the area; or the man revealing the anticipated delivery may have been <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>lying. Similarly, in both <em>Glass </em>and <em>DiGiovanni </em>where the police controlled the delivery of contraband, the designated recipient may not have been home, or could have refused delivery, etc. These uncertainties inherent in any human enterprise do not act to negate what is fairly probable. Here, police proposed to make the buy at a time and in a manner that was likely to succeed, given the nature of the enterprise they uncovered. Moreover, by making the warrant’s execution contingent upon the anticipated buy materializing, both the police and the district justice made sure that no intrusion would occur absent probable cause.</p>

Moreover, because of the contingent nature of the warrant, there was an overwhelming probability that, at the time police would actually enter the residence under authority of this warrant, evidence of a crime — specifically, the marked buy money — would be found there. To disapprove of this anticipatory search warrant would force police to await the actual occurrence of the anticipated event, proceed to a police station to type up a warrant affidavit, find a magistrate in the middle of the night, and seek approval, all the while risking that the evidence would disappear and permitting additional sales of narcotics to occur. The purpose of the warrant protection is not to pointlessly hinder the conscientious efforts of law enforcement to discover and address criminal activity: it is to ensure that, before intrusions are made, neutral judicial officers pass upon the question of the basis for a belief that evidence of a crime will be found at the place to be searched. In negating the warrant, the Superior Court panel committed an error similar to the one it committed in <em>Coleman I: </em>it categorically refused to consider a specific type of forward-looking circumstance — here the execution contingency — and thus failed to consider the totality of the circumstances.</p>

The Second Circuit’s approach articulates a workable standard for what should be included in an affidavit of probable cause seeking an anticipatory search warrant. This case thus reveals the importance of law enforcement officers including all pertinent historical information in the affidavit of probable cause. Police here did not randomly target appellee’s residence for a controlled drug buy in the hope of generating probable cause, but instead explained in the affidavit the specific basis for their belief that drugs were being sold from this particular residence. Viewing the totality of the averments, including the execution contingency, we conclude that the anticipatory search warrant was properly issued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

From this explanation, it seems apparent that the purpose of anticipatory search warrants is to respond to “ongoing criminality” which is moving at such a pace that failure to act expeditiously upon the occurrence of an anticipated event will pose an unacceptable risk of losing critical evidence. Thus, the classic anticipatory warrant case is one in which a delivery of contraband is in transit from one location to another, and the police seek a warrant to search the delivery destination immediately upon the contraband’s arrival, before the contraband is further dispersed. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Reviera, </em><a href="/pa-super/387/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="387 Pa.

    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[202,1220,1151,571]]]'>The instant case is far from that classic example. Here, according to the Commonwealth, Appellee had been selling drugs out of his house for an extended period of time. There is no allegation that a particularly large drug delivery was in transit to Appellee’s home, much less that a large delivery was expected to arrive and depart in short order. To the contrary, the police in this case, on their own independent timetable, simply planned to attempt a second controlled drug buy and then sought an anticipatory warrant, purportedly to protect against their own marked buy money leaving the premises before a warrant could be obtained and executed.</p>

However, I view this justification as mere artifice. If, in fact, Appellee’s residence housed an ongoing drug operation, a search after completion of the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>second controlled drug buy and acquisition of a traditional warrant would surely turn up an abundance of physical evidence, which, combined with the evidence of the two controlled drug buys, would render recovery of the marked money of negligible importance. I therefore do not believe that the purported need to recover that money justifies departure from our traditional requirement that warrants be issued based on established facts. I also reject the majority’s assertion that the police here could not spare the time to get a traditional search warrant, because to do so would permit “additional sales of narcotics to occur.” Not only could the same argument be made with respect to <em>any </em>ongoing drug operation, but here, the police were obviously not overly troubled by the fact that additional sales were occurring, as they had harbored suspicions of an ongoing drug operation for weeks and had nevertheless let significant time pass between the first controlled drug buy and the second.</p>
