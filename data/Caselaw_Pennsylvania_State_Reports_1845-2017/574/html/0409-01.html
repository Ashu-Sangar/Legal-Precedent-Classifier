The third degree murder and aggravated assault convictions merged with first degree murder for sentencing. This direct appeal arises pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 742, 9711(h)(1).

Decandido testified appellant ordered him to help drag the battered but still alive Riddick to the basement. While there, appellant duct-taped Riddick’s mouth, hands, and legs, secured a plastic trash bag over his head, and wrapped him in a comforter.</p>

Decandido testified that during the final taping of Riddick in the basement, appellant confessed to killing 10 to 12 other people and told him, “[wjelcome to [my] world.” <em>Id., </em>at 161. The attack was in response to a prior argument between appellant and Riddick over a drug debt, which culminated in a shot fired at appellant months before the murder.

Appellant and Decandido then dumped Riddick’s body near the Delaware River in Monroe County. Appellant confessed to Stacy Miller, telling her Riddick had struggled, but was hampered by the cast on his leg, and fell to the floor during the attack. Appellant told Miller he used his fists while Riddick was asleep, and then hit him in the back of the head with a baseball bat after Riddick fell to the floor.

Four days later, Green reported Riddick’s disappearance to police, and authorized a search of the residence. On December 23, 1999, Riddick’s body was found.

At the time of the killing, appellant had the mental dexterity to secure the aid of an accomplice, tape the victim’s arms, hands, legs, and face, dispose of the bloody couch, clean the floor and walls, quarantine the basement from other residents, and dispose of the body. In light of this evidence, the lack of expert testimony, the choice to present an innocence defense, and because appellant failed to notify the Commonwealth of his intent to argue diminished capacity, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to charge on such a defense. <em>Id.; </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 573(c)(1)(b).</p>
