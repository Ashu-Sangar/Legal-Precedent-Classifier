For this reason, the qualifying language was commonly referred to as the “Reed Amendment” after Harrisburg’s mayor, the Honorable Stephen R. Reed. Shortly after passage of the EEA, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the Reed Amendment was unconstitutional special legislation as defined by Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and preliminarily enjoined its implementation.

In this respect, she indicated that “the General Assembly enacted the EEA in response to a significant pattern of failure among the Commonwealth’s public schools,” and opined that Act 91— which is specifically designated as a pilot program and modeled after proven programs from other states — provides a remedy for the Harrisburg School District that is closely tailored to the form of government employed by the city and its public school system. Therefore, she concluded that the act represents a “rational legislative response” to the high rate of educational failure in the Commonwealth, and accordingly, violates neither Article III, Section 32 of the state Constitution nor the Equal Protection Clause. As for the claim that Act 91 impermissibly alters the city’s form of government, Judge Leadbetter agreed with Appellants’ argument that Article IX, Section 3 “speaks only to a wholesale change of municipal government, not to amendments of municipal powers which may be made from time to time by the General Assembly.” <em>Hickok II, </em><a href="/a2d/781/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="781 A.2d 221" data-case-ids="9477485" data-case-paths="/a2d/781/0221-01">781 A.2d at 239</a> (Leadbetter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

They contend that Act 91 therefore represents a rational response to the problem of failing urban school districts, and state further that it cannot constitute special legislation because the classification it ere<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>ates may contain multiple school districts. In particular, they aver that if the school districts of the cities of Erie, Allentown, and Reading perform poorly enough, they will be subject to immediate certification as empowerment districts under Act 91. Appellants also assert that, contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s statement that there was no “rhyme or reason” to the set of qualifiers contained in the definition of the class at issue, the General Assembly could reasonably have arrived at that particular classification. Specifically, they posit that the General Assembly could rationally have opted to: treat urban school districts differently from rural ones; establish a “pilot program” for a relatively small number of cities in an effort to assess the results before making immediate certification more widely available to other cities; and include within the eligible class only municipalities in which there is a single executive official (i.e., a mayor) who is directly accountable to the same local electorate which makes up the school district. Finally, Appellants argue that the act does not effect any change in the “form” of a city government within the meaning of Article IX, Section 3, because it does not alter the governmental structure of any city — that is, it does not change the manner in which any municipal official is elected or shift power from one branch of government to another. In this regard, Appellants submit that the Charter Law does not purport to provide an exhaustive list of mayoral duties, and that statutes authorizing a mayor to serve on, or appoint members to, commissions or agencies are commonplace in Pennsylvania.</p>

Under this procedure, the school district would be immediately certified as an empowerment district and placed under the mayor’s control rather than having to wait three years and then being taken over by the state. Although this effort may have been salutary in purpose and effect, this Court held in <em>Hickok I </em>that the General Assembly could not, consistent with Article III, Section 32 and the Equal Protection Clause, prescribe such strong measures for Harrisburg only. Thus, the General Assembly sought to cure the defect identified by the <em>Hickok I </em>Court by extending immediate certification and mayoral control to other cities. Recognizing, however, that these measures were to some degree experimental in nature, the General Assembly apparently sought, as well, to limit the number of municipalities affected by the new provision by extending the class only to a small group of other medium-sized cities which were, in its view, similarly situated to Harrisburg. This group consists of cities that have opted for a mayor-council form of government under the Charter Law, have a population between 45,000 and 250,000, and have a mayor who is accountable to the same electorate as that which makes up the school district.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

Appellees claim that education is a fundamental right, and that the Court should therefore apply a standard that is more stringent than the “rational basis” test. We need not resolve here the parties’ dispute concerning whether education is a fundamental right for purposes of equal protection analysis, since Appellees do not argue, nor does it appear from the record, that Act 91 infringes anyone’s ability to receive an education.</p>

In light of the coterminality requirement and the criterion that the city has over 45,000 residents. Act 91's requirement that the school district be of the second class is superfluous. Furthermore, the criterion that the school district has a history of severe failure is not, strictly speaking, part of the class definition; rather, it is the condition triggering immediate certification as an empowerment district.</p>

They argue in particular that the Legislature’s true purpose was simply to “figure[] out another way to say 'Harrisburg,'” and complain that Appellants “jump directly to rational basis” without acknowledging the prohibition on evading constitutional constraints through artificial, irrelevant distinctions. <em>See </em>Brief at 14. This Court has clarified, however, that the existence of real and relevant distinctions in the subjects classified is the touchstone of the inquiry under both Section 32 and the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See Hickok 1, </em>563 Pa. <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>at 397, <a href="/a2d/761/1132-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="761 A.2d 1132" data-case-ids="11162777,1366928" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/1132-01,/pa/563/0391-01">761 A.2d at 1136</a>. While Appellees' focus upon intent may be reflected to some degree in the <em>Hickok I </em>Court's admonition that the General Assembly may not rely upon artificial distinctions in order to evade the constitutional prohibition, <em>see <a href="/a2d/761/1132-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="761 A.2d 1132" data-case-ids="11162777,1366928" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/1132-01,/pa/563/0391-01">id.,</a> </em>ultimately this factor and the question of a rational basis are two sides of the same coin: if the court finds that real and rational distinctions in the subjects classified are present, it will not assume an evasive intent on the part of the Legislature.</p>

In promulgating Act 91, the Legislature has singled out the Harrisburg School District for special treatment, under the pretext of testing the efficacy of a “pilot program” for distressed systems of education. The amended Section 1707-B <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> targets Harrisburg in a less obvious way than the Reed Amendment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> and as drafted, could theoretically apply to both Harrisburg and Erie, as they are the only two cities meeting the form of government and population criteria. However, I do not agree that the mere possibility that the Erie School District might find itself distressed before December of 2005 mandates against a finding that Act 91 is special legislation.</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[210,1106,1153,566]]]'>Act 91’s classification is no less effective in singling out the Harrisburg School District for special treatment than the Reed Amendment. It is, in my view, nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt by the Legislature to promulgate special legislation under the guise of a general law. Were the purpose of this legislation really the remediation of failing urban school districts, such could have been achieved through the passage of general laws. The only possible purpose of Act 91 is the evasion of the constitutional limitation ran afoul of in <em>Harrisburg Sch. Dist. v.
