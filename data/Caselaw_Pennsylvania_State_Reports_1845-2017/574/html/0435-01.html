The evidence, which included appellant’s admissions to others, showed that Bensinger’s wife, Beth Bensinger, hired appellant to kill her husband and agreed to pay appellant from the proceeds of her husband’s life insurance policy. David Blickley, a prosecution witness, testified that appellant told him that he killed Roy Bensinger because Beth Bensinger hired him to do so. Blickley also stated that appellant took him to the place where the killing had occurred and demonstrated how he had killed the victim. Appellant also told Blickley that he took weapons and ammunition from the victim’s home: appellant’s account to Blickley of items that he stole matched the items missing from the victim’s home. One of the victim’s neighbors testified that he heard a gunshot between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. on the day of the murder, and the pathologist placed the victim’s time of death at between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. Appellant presented alibi witnesses, none of whom were able to account for appellant’s whereabouts before nearly sunset, which occurred at 8:31 p.m. on the day of the murder.</p>

Appellant petitioned this Court to reopen the trial court record on the ground that he had discovered new evidence confirming the existence of an undisclosed arrangement between Blickley and the Commonwealth related to his testimony at appellant’s trial. On January 22, 2002, we remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on appellant’s after-discovered evidence claim. The trial court held the evidentiary hearing on April 8, 2003. The parties then briefed the question in the trial court and the trial court has since filed a supplemental opinion addressing and rejecting the claim.

Blickley testified at appellant’s trial that appellant had admitted to him that he committed the murder; Blickley also claimed that he did not solicit appellant to commit the murder. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth knew that this testimony was perjured because the Commonwealth’s pre-trial evidence, including evidence presented at appellant’s preliminary hearing, suggested that David Blickley had hired appellant to shoot the victim. Thus, Brian Blickley, David’s brother, testified at the preliminary hearing that appellant had told him that David Blickley hired appellant to kill Roy Bensinger. Further, the affidavit of probable cause submitted in support of appellant’s arrest warrant included statements from Brian Blickley, Michael Setlock and Leroy Long, all to the effect that appellant admitted that he committed the murder, while claiming that David Blickley had hired him to do so. Meanwhile, David Blickley, acting on the advice of counsel, asserted his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer any questions at the preliminary hearing.</p>

During the investigation of this murder, Blickley gave a statement to investigators indicating that appellant had admitted to him that he committed the murder and that Beth Bensinger had hired appellant to kill her husband. Blickley’s trial testimony was consistent with this statement. To the extent that other witnesses, including Brian Blickley, told police that it was David Blickley, rather than Beth Bensinger, who hired appellant to kill the victim, they were not relating their own first-hand knowledge but, rather, were merely repeating what appellant (not David Blickley) had told them. All this proved was that appellant had given inconsistent statements to a number of individuals as to who had hired him to commit the murder. Notably, however, his statements were consistent on the seminal issue — that he was the man who fired the fatal bullet that killed Roy Bensinger. Appellant’s varying accounts regarding the person who hired him, however, do not establish that David Blickley’s testimony was false or that the Commonwealth knew the testimony was untrue but presented it anyway.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Because this aspect of appellant’s claim that his conviction was based on the Commonwealth’s knowing presentation of perjured testimony is meritless, the claim fails.</p>

Hinshaw, who employed appellant as a truck driver in North Carolina after the murder, testified that appellant bragged to her and two other employees that he had “popped” a man in his driveway in Pennsylvania and that the killing was a “hit” for which he would be paid when his partner got out of jail.

That “inconsistency,” appellant avers, requires that his confessions to these witnesses should have been excluded. That appellant gave differing accounts as to who hired him to kill the victim does not make his admissions to various people that he killed the victim inadmissible — especially given that appellant consistently admitted in these statements the crucial fact that he was the murderer.
