The Claudios alleged that, on January 24,1996, Luis was operating a coil slitter machine in the course of his employment at Williams <em>&amp; </em>Co., located in Exton, Pennsylvania, when the machine malfunctioned, causing severe injuries to his hand, which led doctors to amputate four fingers.

On June 8, 2000, the trial court held oral argument on the motion to amend the caption, where the Claudios and DMC debated the issue of successor liability. The trial court grant<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>ed a continuance to allow the parties to present evidence on this issue, during which period counsel for the Claudios traveled to Rhode Island to depose Albert Saunders, Esq. (Saunders), former counsel to DMC, and Maynard, one of the principals of DMI. On July 19, 2000, the trial court concluded the argument, granted the motion of the Claudios to substitute DMI for DMC as the “proper defendant,” and molded the verdict to impose liability on DMI. The court reasoned that “the amendment does not add a new party because [DMI] is the successor corporation of [DMC].
