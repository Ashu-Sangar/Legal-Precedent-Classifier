An alternate way of applying the method used by the County is to subtract $80,000, the exempt construction cost, from the total construction cost of $200,000, and then to apply the common level ratio to arrive at an assessed value of $24,000 ($200,000-$80,000 = $120,000 X .20 = $24,000).

Ordinance 59 § 3(b) originally set that ceiling at $50,000, but it is adjusted each year using a cost of living index; the maximum eligible cost rose to $76,861 for 1996, $78,297 for 1997, and $80,964 for 1998, the three years at issue. However, the ordinance used the phrase: “The maximum cost per dwelling unit eligible for exemption shall be ... $50,000.00 per dwelling unit <em>on the assessment attributable to the actual cost </em>of new construction.... ” Erie County Ordinance No. 59, 1980, § 3(b) (emphasis added).

Citadel’s contention is based on the second part of this phrase, which it contends means, “the maximum exemption shall be $50,000”. This interpretation does not explain the words preceding the establishment of the maximum. The Ordinance does not say the maximum exemption shall be $50,000; it says the maximum <em>cost </em>eligible for exemption shall be $50,000. The words following the amount, which mirror the enabling language of § 4711-30S(b), may muddy the issue, but they do not undermine this purposeful language. We also note subsequent language in the Ordinance: “No tax exemption shall be granted under the provisions of this article for any improvements to any dwelling unit in excess of the maximum cost specified above.” Erie County Ordinance No. 59, 1980, § 3(b).

These enactments do nothing to affect how the assessments are calculated — indeed, that methodology will invariably change with time and circumstance. These enactments establish the calculation of the exempted portion of the assessment, i.e., what fraction or percentage of the assessment is exempt; calculation of that percentage or fraction stays the same no matter how the total assessment itself is determined. If the total cost is less than the ceiling in Ordinance 59 § 3(b), the entire additional assessment is attributable to it (the percentage is 100%), and is exempt. Where the total cost exceeds that ceiling, the portion of the total cost that the ceiling represents is exempt.

The left half of this equation is the County's methodology for determining the non-exempt assessed value; the right half shows application of the CLR as in the Commonwealth Court’s example. Whether the CLR is a factor before or after the subtraction, the result must be identical.

The problem with this methodology, however, is that, irrespective of the characterization of the $50,000.00 figure, it utilizes the CLR in calculating the exemption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> This could not have been intended by the legislators who enacted the IDRPA or those who voted for Ordinance 59, because, at the time both were ratified, the CLR did not apply in the county assessment process.

Unquestionably, the tax-break attracted Citadel to develop the Presque Isle Bay waterfront and, hence, Erie County achieved far more than it ever hoped to accomplish by way of Ordinance 59. Presently, in limiting the tax benefit set forth in Ordinance 59, Erie County is seeking to exploit this success to increase its own tax revenue.

The method advocated by the Assessment Board, for example, in the year 1996, for a property worth $350,000.00 with a CLR of 20% would generate $54,340.60 of property value subject to taxation.
