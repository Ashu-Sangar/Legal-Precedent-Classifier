Though deference to the PUC’s discretionary interpretation does not preclude judicial review, courts may not disturb the commission’s interpretation regarding a certificate of public convenience unless the result is clearly erroneous, arbitrary, and unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Peoples Natural Gas Co. v. Pa. PUC, </em><a href="/pa/523/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="523 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1820297" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0370-01">523 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="523 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1820297" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0370-01">567 A.2d 642</a>, 644 (1989). When interpreting provisions of the Public Utility Code, and the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, a court need go no further to discern the legislature’s intent. <em>See City of Philadelphia v. Board of Finance and Revenue, </em><a href="/pa/569/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="569 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="312832" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0381-01">569 Pa. 381</a>, <a href="/a2d/803/1262-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="803 A.2d 1262" data-case-ids="11452428,312832" data-case-paths="/a2d/803/1262-01,/pa/569/0381-01">803 A.2d 1262</a>, 1267 (2002). Further, the plain words of the statute may not be ignored, and each word should be given effect. <em>See Barasch, </em>at 331. Clearly, the Commonwealth Court ignored the PUC’s statutory mandate set out in § 1103(a) and instead substituted its discretion for that of the PUC when it concluded the applicant had to demonstrate public need. In doing so, the court focused only on the word “necessary” rather than on the phrase “necessary or proper.” However, the conjunction “or” must be given its ordinarily disjunctive meaning unless such a construction would lead to an absurd result. <em>Forty Fort Borough v. Kozich, </em><a href="/a2d/669/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="669 A.2d 469" data-case-ids="11317074" data-case-paths="/a2d/669/0469-01">669 A.2d 469</a>, 471 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995), <em>affirmed, </em><a href="/citations/?q=701%20A.2d%201009" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="701 A.2d 1009">701 A.2d 1009</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1997).</p>

      <em>Rohrbaugh, </em>at 1085 (citations omitted). Thus, an agency may revise its policies and amend its regulations in interpreting its statutory mandates. Further, past interpretation of a statute, though approved by the judiciary, does not bind the PUC to that particular interpretation. <em>See also Seaboard Tank Lines v.

It is true, as discussed above, that courts have consistently articulated the “inadequacy” requirement as an element of a utility’s application for authority. Nevertheless, it is evident that the policy of the <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>legislature pursuant to which the original criteria were established does not show an intention that expanded service be allowed only when existing service is inadequate. Rather, we believe that that policy consists of the more broad intention that utilities not be allowed to engage in unrestrained and destructive competition, which activity was thought to be, by its very nature, at odds with the public interest.</blockquote>

Thus, the court acknowledged the PUC’s prior interpretations of its statutory mandates are not binding upon it simply because those interpretations received judicial approval in the past. Of import to the court’s reasoning was the fact the inadequacy requirement was not statutorily created, but a regulation. <em><a href="/citations/?q=502%20A.2d%20762" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="502 A.2d 762">Id., </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=502%20A.2d%20762" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="502 A.2d 762">at 766-67</a>.</p>
