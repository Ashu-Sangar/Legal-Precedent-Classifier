Both S.P. and A.B. consumed significant amounts of alcohol, and A.B. became intoxicated. At some point, A.B., in the course of walking from the kitchen into the living room area, missed a step and fell to the floor. The events that followed are in dispute, with Appellant and A.B. offering conflicting versions. A.B. claimed that, as she was lying face down on the floor in a semiconscious state, she felt Appellant reach down and touch her vaginal area. Thereafter, A.B. asserted, Appellant lifted her up, carried her to a nearby chair, began rubbing his penis against her, and then placed his penis into her mouth. Appellant provided differing versions of the events, ultimately denying that he committed any sexual acts, and maintaining that when he found A.B., she was lying on the living room floor without any clothing, that he asked S.P. to help him with A.B., and that S.P. refused. Appellant contended that A.B. thereafter attempted to initiate oral sex with him, and that he pulled away, leaving her alone.</p>

Appellant testified in his own defense, relating his version of the events. The jury acquitted Appellant of the rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse charges, found him guilty of disseminating obscene materials to minors, furnishing liquor to minors, and corruption of minors, and was unable to reach a verdict with respect to the sexual assault charge. As a result, the trial court declared a mistrial respecting the sexual assault offense.

Rather, Appellant contends that sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse is an element of each offense, and that an absence of consent is similarly common. Relying upon the language of Rule 648(D) indicating that an acquittal of a greater offense operates as an acquittal of lesser-included offenses that the jury was unable to agree upon, Appellant argues that the trial court properly dismissed the lesser-included sexual assault charge. The Commonwealth, by contrast, explains that Rule 648(D) reflects collater<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>al estoppel principles, which are not implicated where the greater offenses require proof of additional elements beyond those necessary for a conviction of the lesser-included offense. As sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse accompanied by evidence of forcible compulsion or unconscious or unaware victims, involves proof of additional elements and implicates a higher degree of culpability than the lack of consent contemplated by the sexual assault statute, the Commonwealth contends, the acquittal of the rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse offenses does not, perforce, operate as an acquittal of sexual assault.</p>
