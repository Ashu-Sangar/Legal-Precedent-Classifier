On that date, eleven days before her scheduled retirement, the Commission received a letter from Shaulis requesting that the Commission delineate the restrictions imposed by the Ethics Act when attorneys retire from the Department of Revenue. Specifically, Shaulis questioned whether Section 1103(g) of the Ethics Act barred her from publishing articles or books on Pennsylvania state taxes during the first year after her retirement. In the letter, Shaulis articulated her understanding that it is this Court, not the General Assembly, which can issue rules regulating the manner in which an attorney practices law. Shaulis stated that she believed that the Ethics Act could not be applied to restrict an attorney’s conduct to the extent that it would constitute the practice of law. The next day, the Commission advised Shaulis that it had received her letter and would issue an Advice of Counsel in response to her query.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Commission claims that the determination of the Commonwealth Court that Section 1103(g) is unconstitutional conflicts with our decision in <em>P.J.S. </em>It argues that <em>P.J.S. </em>permits regulation of groups that happen to include attorneys, provided that the group is not comprised of attorneys exclusively. The Commission posits that because Section 1103(g) regulates all employees similarly, it is not unconstitutional. Shaulis refers us to our decision in <em>Wajert v.

The City Solicitor in <em>P.J.S. </em>argued that attorneys should be exempt from generally applicable ethical rules for current government employees promulgated by the General Assembly. In contrast, the issue in <em>Wajert, </em>like the issue in the instant matter, related to the conduct of an attorney who was no longer a public employee. Shaulis and the judge in <em>Wajert </em>have simply asserted their right, absent a prohibition from this Court, to practice their profession. The connection between <em>Wajert </em>and <em>P.J.S. </em>reveals that this Court retains exclusive authority over the conduct of attorneys generally, but that an employer, in this case the Commonwealth government, can proscribe conduct of its current employees, including attorneys, provided that the proscription is not targeted specifically at attorneys.</p>

First, it purports to regulate the conduct of former employees. As the Commonwealth Court majority in the present case cogently notes, in <em>P.J.S. </em>we relied on <em>Maunus </em>and did not even mention <em>Wajert. </em>In <em>Maunus, </em>we explained that it is “ludicrous to suggest that employers are constitutionally precluded from imposing ethical and professional requirements on their employees, some or all of whom may be attorneys.” <em>Maunus, </em><a href="/pa/518/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="518 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1811675" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0592-01">544 A.2d at 1326</a>.

    <p id="b907-4" data-blocks='[["BL_907.4",907,[208,555,1157,1124]]]'>Second, the prohibitions contained in Section 1103(g) of the Ethics Act are unconstitutional because they specifically target attorneys. The provision seeks to prevent a former government employee from representing any person before his or her government employer for one year after the termination of their employment relationship. The Ethics Act defines “represent” as “[t]o act on behalf of any other person in any activity which includes, but is not limited to, the following: personal appearances, negotiations, lobbying and submitting bid or contract proposals which are signed by or contain the name of a former public official or public employee.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 1102. While it is conceivable that a non-attorney could engage in such “representation” and, therefore, Section 1103(g) is not strictly limited in scope to attorneys, it nonetheless targets the practice of law. <em>Cf.

I write separately, however, to express disagreement with the discussion in the Section I of the majority opinion, denominated “Standing”, and having to do with the issue of the appealability of the Commission’s advices issued, as these advices were, pursuant to the authority invested in the Commission by 65 Pa.C.S. §§ 1107(10)-1107(11), to issue opinions and written advice on request of persons who inquire as to their duties under the Act. I would not permit an appeal from such opinions or written advices as they are not, in my view, an “adjudication” as that term is defined in the Administrative Agency Law. <em>See 2 </em>Pa.C.S. § 101. They are <a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>not a final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling of the Commission, but are properly categorized, in the terms of the Act, as opinions and written advice.</p>

Under these circumstances, while a remand to the Commonwealth Court for the purpose of exercising its authority under Pa.R.A.P. 1504 would be procedurally appropriate, such action would accomplish only additional delay before the eventual return of the identical issue to this Court for resolution. Therefore, in the interest of deciding this important issue with all possible dispatch, I would treat the matter as having been decided below under Pa.R.A.P. 1504, thereby reaching the issue of the validity of Section 1103(g) of the Act without the necessity of categorizing the Commission’s opinions and written advices as appealable adjudications.</p>

With regard to the argument that the Court has already addressed the mischief to be remedied by Section 1103(g), as applied to attorneys, by promulgating Rule 1.11 of Professional Responsibility, I would follow the view of other courts which would regard revolving door legislation as supplemental to such rules, and not as conflicting. <em>See, e.g., Howard v.

I also disagree with the majority's assessment that Appellee’s status as a former (as opposed to present) employee should control in determining the constitutionality of Section 1103(g), and that this establishes a material basis on which the Court’s reasoning from the <em>PJ.S. </em>case may be distinguished. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 132.
