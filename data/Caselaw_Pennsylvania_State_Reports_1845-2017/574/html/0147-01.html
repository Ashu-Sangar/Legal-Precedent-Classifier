The Association took the position that only Mr. Campbell or his personal representative was a claimant under the PPCIGA Act, thus limiting its potential liability to $300,000; Keystone, on the other hand, maintained that each of the Campbells was a proper claimant, thereby increasing the Association’s potential liability to 1.5 million dollars ($300,000 for each of the five surviving Campbells). Ultimately, Keystone settled the Texas action by committing to pay 1.5 million dollars, in exchange for release from liability on the underlying claims, -with $300,000 of the settlement fund allocated to each of the surviving Campbells, as reflected in a final judgment to which the settlement was reduced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Keystone <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>also agreed to cooperate with the Campbells in determining the amount of insurance coverage available from PPCIGA.</p>

Since it concluded that, had the action arisen in Pennsylvania, PPCIGA’s liability would have been limited to $300,000, the court was disinclined to afford greater recovery on claims accruing in Texas, thus effectively discriminating against those whose claims arise locally. Additionally, the common pleas court observed that the more constrained interpretation of the statutory limitation had a salutary effect in the administration of PPCIGA assets. <em>See Keystone Aerial Surveys, Inc. v. PPCIGA, </em>No. 1484, <em>slip op. </em>at 4 (C.P.Phila.Sep.14, 2000) (“Public policy demands that we both maintain .. . consistency [in the treatment of in-state and out-of-state claimants], and that we support the PPCIGA statute’s intent to conserve the funds so that all aggrieved <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>insureds may have a source of coverage to which they may turn.”). Reading the PPCIGA Act’s limitation in light of the Pennsylvania wrongful death statute, the common pleas court thus agreed with the Association that the PPCIGA Act recognizes only a single claim for wrongful death of a person, regardless of the number of potential wrongful death beneficiaries.</p>

The Superior Court also considered the problem identified by the common pleas court, namely, that differences arising out of the choice of forum may affect the entitlement to assert a direct claim against an insurer in wrongful death/survival proceedings.

The Superior Court deemed the <em>Tulewicz </em>decision, cited by the common pleas court, distinguishable, since Act 1978-152’s limitation functioned as a “per plaintiff’ cap, in contrast to the PPCIGA Act’s approach of limiting the Association’s obligations “per claimant.” <em>See Keystone, <a href="/a2d/777/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="777 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="11077710" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0084-01">777 </a></em><a href="/a2d/777/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="777 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="11077710" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0084-01">A.2d at 93-94</a>. The court also observed that the purposes of Act 1978-152 differed substantially from those of the PPCIGA Act: whereas the former concerned limitations on damages in actions against the Commonwealth, the PPCIGA Act is designed to protect claimants and policyholders, and not for the guiding purpose of limiting recovery. <em>See Keystone, <a href="/a2d/777/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="777 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="11077710" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0084-01">777 </a></em><a href="/a2d/777/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="777 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="11077710" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0084-01">A.2d at 94</a>.</p>

Further, the decision implemented a broad understanding of the character and effect of the “arising] out of and ... within the coverages” phrase of the statutory language defining “covered claims.” 40 P.S. § 991.1802.

Thus, although the statute recognizes multiple potential beneficiaries, it speaks of a single wrongful death action. Moreover, Section 71.003 of the Code limits when such an action may be filed: “This subchapter applies only if the individual injured would have been entitled to bring an action for the injury if he had lived.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code § 71.003. The Texas Court of Appeals has recognized that the statutory language demonstrates the derivative nature of a wrongful death claim: “the Wrongful Death Statute and Survival Statute expressly state that any action brought under either are derivative of the decedent’s rights.” <em>Zacharie v. U.S. Natural Resources, Inc., </em><a href="/sw3d/94/0748-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="94 S.W.3d 748" data-case-ids="9331521" data-case-paths="/sw3d/94/0748-01">94 S.W.3d 748</a>, 757-58 (Tex.Ct.App.2002). Accordingly, while the Camp-bells are all potential beneficiaries under the Texas wrongful death statute, their “claim” (here brought by one for the <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>benefit of all) is a single claim derivative of the decedent’s claim.

    <p id="AGG" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[206,535,1154,1095]]]'>The very nature of insurance policies also commands a finding of a single claimant here. Insurance policies of all types, be they automobile, commercial or general liability policies, designate limits of exposure. These limits on liability are typically stated in terms of the limit per claimant and per occurrence. For example, an automobile insurance policy may limit liability to $15,000 per individual claimant and $30,000 per occurrence. If the insured on that automobile policy is involved in an accident where a third party is fatally injured, the third party’s estate would recover the $15,000 policy limit per individual, regardless of the number of dependents/heirs/beneficiaries the third party decedent left. The fortuity that the decedent left four heirs would not increase the insurer’s exposure fourfold to $60,000. The exposure, in every case, would properly be the policy limit of $15,000 because the true claimant against the policy is the decedent, not the arbitrary and unpredictable number of heirs or survivors who try to squeeze into his single pair of shoes. The survivors’ right of recovery is capped by their decedent’s right; and the insurer’s limit of exposure is commensurately ascertainable and assured.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The policy limit sets the absolute limit of liability; the unpredictable number of dependents, heirs or beneficiaries a deceased claimant leaves behind does not arbitrarily multiply the exposure. Insurance policies are deliberately structured with foreseeable limits in order to provide insurers with a basis upon which to calculate their risk, ie., the amount they will need to pay covered claims. To inject an unknowable and, indeed, exponential variable such as the number of beneficiaries or dependents of an injured person would skew actuarial computations and potentially leave insurers with insufficient funds -with which to pay claims, resulting in the prospect of insurer insolvency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

Those provisions set a cap on the amount recoverable per claimant, a cap that is tantamount to an insurer’s limit of liability. Here, the now-insolvent insurer, American Eagle, insured Keystone Aerial Surveys under a policy covering accidental harm to aircraft and passengers. Thomas Campbell was tragically killed when an airplane owned by Keystone crashed with him aboard. But, that single decedent, and not his surviving wife or their four children, was a passenger in the doomed aircraft. Had the decedent survived with injury he would have had a single claim against the insurer; the circumstance of his demise, while tragic, does not change the nature of that unitary claim. Rather, common sense and standard insurance practices should dictate that he is the true claimant for purposes of the Act and that the <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>claims of his family survivors are merely derivative of the single insured claim arising out of the plane crash.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

The cap helps ensure that the amount the Association will pay out in a given year will not exceed the tightly-controlled amounts paid into it by insurers writing policies in Pennsylvania. The Association is funded by assessments against solvent insurers. The Association calculates the total amount needed to meet its obligations and then assesses each solvent insurer its share of that total “in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year ... bears to the aggregate net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year.” 40 P.S. § 991.1808(b). The maximum assessment against any solvent insurer, however, is limited: no insurer can be assessed “an amount greater than two per centum (2%) of that member insurer’s net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year.” <em><a href="/sw3d/94/0748-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="94 S.W.3d 748" data-case-ids="9331521" data-case-paths="/sw3d/94/0748-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 991.1808(d).
