The group of people included appellant and his co-defendant, Richard Mitchell, as well as Braheem (also known as Brahma) Jackson, Donta Dawson, Kattery Franklin, and a woman identified only as Michelle. After parking, Haskell exited the car and walked toward the restaurant while Ford remained in the car. As Haskell walked toward the restaurant, he bumped into appellant’s aunt, Kattery Franklin. Haskell then entered the restaurant and placed his order. After Haskell exited the restaurant, appellant’s group of friends exchanged words with Haskell. An argument ensued and, ultimately, a physical altercation broke out between Haskell and appellant. A few minutes into the altercation, Dawson stepped in and began fighting with Haskell as well. Then, while Dawson and Haskell fought, appellant stepped back and asked Mitchell for Mitchell’s gun, a .32 caliber revolver. Mitchell handed appellant his gun, whereupon appellant shot Haskell twice in the chest and once in the head. Appellant then turned around and shot Ford once in the head as he stood by the passenger side of the parked car. Both Haskell and Ford died as a result of their gunshot wounds.</p>

The victims, Haskell and Ford, were unlawfully killed, as there is nothing on this record to support that the use of deadly force against them was legally justified. The eyewitness testimony, and appellant’s own partial admission, identified appellant as the shooter and supports the conclusion that appellant was the person who deliberately shot both men. The evidence that appellant, while in the midst of a fistfight with Haskell, asked Mitchell for his gun establishes that the killings were deliberate. Finally, the fact that appellant shot the victims in vital parts of their bodies warranted the jury finding of a specific <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>intent to kill.

Appellant, who was not arrested until January 12, 1999, was not present at Mitchell’s preliminary hearing. Appellant’s preliminary hearing was held on February 9, 1999, and Jackson did not testify at this hearing.</p>

Upon hearing testimony regarding the circumstances of Jackson’s prior testimony and his absence from trial, the trial court determined that Jackson was unavailable and that Mitchell had had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Jackson at his preliminary hearing. Accordingly, the trial court ruled that Jackson’s preliminary hearing testimony was admissible against Mitchell pursuant to the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. The trial court further ordered that the testimony be redacted to eliminate any specific reference to appellant and noted that it would instruct the jury that the testimony was to be considered as evidence against Mitchell only.

For example, appellant contends that Jackson initially told the police that appellant shot both victims, but then testified at Mitchell’s preliminary hearing that he did not see who fired the shots that killed the second victim. In addition, appellant asserts that Jackson told police that appellant asked Mitchell for the gun and Mitchell gave him the weapon, whereas he testified at the preliminary hearing that he only told the police that Mitchell gave appellant the gun because the police told him to say this. Appellant also contends that Jackson initially told the police that Mitchell told him that he had thrown the gun away, but he testified at the preliminary hearing that he did not know what happened to the gun after the shootings.

    <p id="b830-4" data-blocks='[["BL_830.6",830,[283,377,1165,1532]]]'>Respectfully, I take issue with the majority’s assertion that it is not clear that challenged commentary by the district attorney during his closing speech concerning the preliminary hearing testimony of Braheem Jackson was improper. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 1039 n. 9. Certainly a prosecutor is not always bound to ignore contextual implications of an out-of-court statement arising in light of other trial evidence, <em>see generally Richardson v. Marsh, </em><a href="/us/481/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="481 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="6212712" data-case-paths="/us/481/0200-01">481 U.S. 200</a>, 208, <a href="/us/481/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="481 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="6212712" data-case-paths="/us/481/0200-01">107 S.Ct. 1702</a>, 1708, <a href="/us/481/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="481 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="6212712" data-case-paths="/us/481/0200-01">95 L.Ed.2d 176</a> (1987), and therefore, in this case for example, to disavow that the evidence demonstrated that Appellant was the person to whom Jackson was referring in accusatory references couched (before the jury) in terms of “this guy.” A prosecutor may not, however, after a trial court has assiduously redacted accusatory references, directly attribute the accusation to the redacted witness statement. Yet this is precisely what occurred here, when the district attorney, in various permutations during his closing argument, indicated that “Braheem Jackson said, Richard Mitchell had a gun, he gave it to McCrae.” N.T., Nov. 21, 2000, at 177; <em>see also id. </em>at 125, 156, 163-64. Whether this breach was intentional or not, it violated both the letter and the spirit of the trial court’s directive and therefore should be recognized as improper. This is particularly the case where admission of Jackson’s preliminary hearing testimony containing the statements was secured, <em>inter alia, </em>on the district attorney’s representation to the trial court that “I submit to the Court that the redactions that I have ... undertaken in this case are sufficient to protect the defendant^ i.e., Appellant].” N.T., Nov. 17, 2000, at 180.</p>
