Sullivan stopped her car to say hello. After a brief conversation, appellant asked Sullivan for a ride up the street. Sullivan allowed appellant to ride on the hood of her car, with his back toward her, for the short distance she was taking him. As she proceeded up the street, Sullivan saw a police car coming toward her. At the same time, Sullivan heard one or two gunshots. Sullivan testified that she did not see who fired the gunshots and that she was not looking at appellant when the shots were fired. Sullivan then saw appellant jump from the hood of her car, flee on foot, and disappear over a fence as a police officer chased him. After <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>appellant cleared the fence and was beyond her view, Sullivan heard one or two more shots.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[281,426,1162,724]]]'>Sergeant Mark Haltzman of the McKeesport Police Department testified that, at approximately 4:05 p.m. on April 29, 1996, he was in a marked police cruiser and responding to a radio broadcast of a man pointing a gun out of a car window. When Haltzman approached the intersection of Flagler and Grant Streets, he saw appellant sitting on the hood of Sullivan’s car. Haltzman saw appellant fire three gunshots down Flagler Street. These shots were not fired toward Haltzman. Haltzman stopped his patrol car and made eye contact with appellant, whom he knew. As Haltzman exited his cruiser, appellant jumped from Sullivan’s car and began to run. As appellant fled, he fired two more shots, this time in the direction of Haltzman, who was a mere 60-70 feet away. The officer was not struck.</p>
    <p id="b450-6" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[280,1180,1165,415]]]'>Haltzman took cover, radioed a description of appellant to other officers, and then began to pursue appellant. Shortly thereafter, police officers found appellant hiding between two houses, wearing only one shoe, his right. No weapon was found on appellant, but a search revealed a .25 caliber semiautomatic handgun in the grass near the fence appellant had jumped. Appellant’s left shoe was found on the other side of the fence. Appellant had no license to carry the handgun.</p>

He also admitted that he fired the two sets of gunshots witnessed by Sullivan and Haltzman. In attempting to explain the shootings, appellant claimed that, earlier that day, a man named Ivan Wocoward, with whom appellant had argued months before, had fired two shots at him. Appellant stated that he retrieved a handgun he had stashed in an alley and began searching for Wocoward, intending to shoot him. At this point, he encountered Sullivan. Appellant further claimed that, as he was riding on Sullivan’s car hood, he spotted Wocoward on Flagler Street, aimed his gun at him, and fired at him three times. Appellant then fled when he saw the police cruiser coming towards him, his thought being, “How <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>am I going to run and get away, which way should I run?” According to appellant, as he fled his finger was still on the trigger and the gun went off accidentally — twice—as he was climbing the fence. Appellant denied that he intended to shoot Sergeant Haltzman or that he was aiming the gun at him. Appellant was impeached with, <em>inter alia, </em>evidence of his four prior juvenile adjudications of delinquency for <em>crimen falsi </em>offenses, as well as his admission that he had lied in his statement to police.</p>

    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[285,491,1162,799]]]'>The questions for review are related. Since Sergeant Haltzman was not struck by the gunshots and was not otherwise injured, the Commonwealth was required to prove that appellant attempted to cause the officer serious bodily injury, in order to sustain the conviction for aggravated assault as a felony of the first-degree. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(2). Section 2702 of the Crimes Code does not further define what is required to prove criminal attempt, but Chapter 9 of the Code, which sets forth inchoate crimes, and is part of the Code’s Preliminary Provisions, does: “A person commits an attempt when, with intent to commit a specific crime, he does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that crime.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 901(a). Section 302 of the Code, which addresses “General requirements of culpability,” defines “intentionally” as follows:</p>

Since the sufficiency claim, if it had merit, would require the greater <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>relief (discharge as opposed to a new trial) and would obviate the necessity of considering the claim concerning the constitutionality of the jury charge, we will consider that claim first. <em>See Wertz v.

Appellant also emphasizes what he views as deficiencies in the Commonwealth’s evidence on intent, having to do with the <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>distance from which the officer observed him, the physical evidence, etc. The Commonwealth responds by emphasizing Sergeant Haltzman’s testimony that, as he exited his police cruiser, appellant fired “two shots at me,” and his further testimony that, “I do know that it was a weapon pointed in my direction, two shots fired directly at me.” N.T. 73. The officer repeated this basic account numerous times. <em>See id. </em>at 75 (“I saw two shots fired in my direction from a weapon;” the gun “was pointed in my direction”); <em>id. </em>at 89 (when appellant fired gun at sergeant, gun was not pointed up in air, or to side of officer, but “was pointed in my general direction”). The Commonwealth notes that the jury could also rely upon the inference authorized by 18 Pa.C.S. § 6104, and thus the fact of non-licensure was further circumstantial proof that appellant intended to commit the crime of aggravated assault.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Commonwealth further notes that, in attacking Sergeant Haltzman’s testimony, appellant confuses a weight of the evidence claim with a sufficiency claim. The Commonwealth concludes that the evidence amply proved appellant’s intent to cause the officer serious bodily injury.</p>

Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was more than adequate circumstantial evidence that appellant intended to inflict serious bodily injury or worse upon the officer. A gun is a lethal weapon; pointing it toward a person, and then <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>discharging it, speaks volumes as to one’s intention. <em>Meredith, supra. </em>The officer testified in no uncertain terms that appellant indeed pointed the gun in his direction — not up in the air, or off to the side, or at himself. Appellant then fired two shots — which the jury could view as evidencing a more settled intent to injure the officer than a single shot — and from a distance (60-70 feet) which obviously increased the danger of serious bodily injury or death. In addition, appellant fired the shots at the officer immediately after realizing that he had been observed by the sergeant firing his gun multiple times at another man. Appellant admitted that his purpose upon seeing the officer approach was to elude capture. Since shooting the officer certainly would facilitate that escape, the jury could reasonably infer that the shots were intended to strike the officer.</p>
    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[203,1123,1158,1228]],["BL_456.1",456,[283,303,1156,148]]]'>It is also notable that appellant admitted on cross-examination that he realized, as he was fleeing, that it was Sergeant Haltzman, whom he knew, who was in the police cruiser. N.T. 137. Since this particular police officer knew appellant, the jury could infer that appellant intended to seriously injure or kill the officer to better ensure an effective escape. Furthermore, appellant also admitted that the very reason he retrieved his unlicensed firearm from its hiding place in the alley that day was because he intended to shoot someone with it, namely, Ivan Wocoward. He also admitted that he acted upon that premeditated intention: <em>i.e., </em>he admitted that the first three shots witnessed by Sergeant Haltzman and Sullivan were fired deliberately, not accidentally, at Wocoward. Appellant’s admitted willingness to shoot another human being that day, and his admitted acting upon that decision, was further evidence tending to prove that he intended to injure or kill the officer when he twice fired the gun at him while attempting to escape. Finally, the fact that appellant had no license for the gun, combined with the court’s permissive inference instruction, provided the jury with further reason to reject appellant’s claim of accidental shooting. The fortuity that Sergeant Haltzman was not struck does not alter the fact that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Common<a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>wealth, strongly demonstrated that appellant’s conscious purpose in firing at the officer was to inflict serious bodily injury (or worse).

The former are banned absolutely because criminal usage is conclusively presumed, while the latter are allowed, if licensed. The obtaining of a license is tantamount to an acknowledgment that the possession is for lawful purposes; the failure to obtain a license suggests the opposite. One who envisions no criminal purpose for the firearm is unlikely to refuse, if required, to declare his ownership of that weapon to the proper authorities, while one who harbors criminal intentions will. This is not to say that in every instance the lack of a license suggests criminal intent, but rather that a lack of required license is simply another piece of circumstantial evidence from which the true intent of the user of a firearm might be ascertained in a given situation.</blockquote>

Appellant was not simply detected in possession of an unlicensed firearm; he was caught in the act of firing it at another man. Appellant testified that he bought the gun “off the street,” did not generally carry it on him, but instead kept it “stashed” in the alley behind Flagler Avenue, and used it “for protection.” N.T. 118-19, 126. On April 29, 1996, he testified, he retrieved the gun from its hiding place after Ivan Wocoward had shot at him, with the intention of finding and shooting Wocoward. He acted upon that intention by firing three shots at Wocoward and then firing two more shots at Sergeant Haltzman in an attempt to escape after he was caught in the act. The trial evidence thus suggested a person unwilling to trust the police or other law enforcement authorities in resolving his alleged street disputes, but willing and prepared to take matters into his own hands including, if necessary, seeking out and shooting others. The fact that the gun was not lawfully purchased or licensed rationally supported an inference that it was intended to be used precisely as it was, <em>i.e., </em>unlawfully against other people, including being used to inflict serious bodily injury.

Among those present at the time were Susan Sullivan, on whose car Hall was riding, and Sergeant Mark Haltzman of the McKeesport Police Department (Officer Haltzman).

Generally speaking, a presumption is an evidentiary device that enables the trier of fact to determine the existence of an element of the crime from the presence of one or more evidentiary facts. Establishment of presumptions favorable to the Commonwealth in criminal cases raises delicate issues of due process through the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The threshold inquiry in ascertaining the constitutional analysis applicable to this kind of jury instruction is to determine the nature of the presumption it describes. That determination requires careful attention to the words actually spoken to the jury, for whether a defendant has been accorded his constitutional rights depends upon the way in which a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction. Here, the issue is whether, in a case in which intent is an element of the crime charged, the Commonwealth is relieved of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt when the jury is instructed that it may presume intent to commit aggravated assault from the fact <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>that the defendant had an unlicensed firearm in his possession.</p>

In the instant matter, the fact proved was that Hall owned the firearm and did not possess a license to carry it. Yet, not all owners of firearms are required to obtain a weapons license. Rifles and shotguns used in hunting may be carried without a license (although the hunter requires a license to kill), nor is the starter firing a gun that starts a race required to have a license. Guns of any type that are in transit from point A to point B whether destined for a dealer or a hobbyist or an individual do not require that licenses be obtained by those briefly in possession. Section 6106, 18 Pa.C.S. § 6106, enumerates thirteen different categories of individuals who are not required to have a license to carry a gun. Hence, it does not follow that failure to hold a valid license to carry a concealed weapon leads inexorably to a presumption, even a permissive one, that the gun owner intended to commit aggravated assault.</p>
