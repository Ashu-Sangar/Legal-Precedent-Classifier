The amendment provided for grading of that same conduct as a misdemeanor of the first degree in certain circumstances — specifically, in circumstances where the person was “otherwise eligible” for licensure and the person had not “committed any other criminal violation.” <em>Id. </em>§ 6106(a). The issue here is whether the General Assembly intended that amendment to create (1) an additional, negative element of the existing felony offense of carrying a firearm without a license (the new element being license ineligibility or other criminal violations); (2) an affirmative defense to a felony grading; or (3) sentencing factors affecting the grading of the offense.

Upon investigation, appellant told the officers that he was licensed to carry the handgun, but a police radio check proved that assertion to be false.

After the Commonwealth presented its case-in-chief, the trial court asked whether the Commonwealth would be presenting evidence regarding appellant’s eligibility to carry a firearm. The Commonwealth argued that license ineligibility and commission of other criminal violations are sentencing factors, consideration of which is properly deferred pending a verdict. The Commonwealth rested and appellant presented his defense, which consisted of admitting that he carried the handgun without a license, but denying that it was concealed. Appellant did not contest his criminal liability under Section 6108, which lacks a concealment element, nor does he presently challenge that conviction. Appellant further argued that license ineligibility or commission of another criminal violation were factors establishing an additional material element of a Section 6106(a)(1) felony offense, which the Commonwealth was required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant averred that the Commonwealth had failed to prove either disqualifying factor.</p>

The Commonwealth, consistently with its position that license ineligibility and commission of other criminal violations are sentencing factors, invoked Section 6109 of the Uniform Firearms Act, 18 Pa.C.S. § 6109, the section governing firearms license eligibility. The Commonwealth argued that appellant was ineligible for a license under Section 6109(e)(l)(viii), which generally forbids the issuance of a license to carry firearms to a person charged with, or who has been convicted of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term greater than one year. In support of its argument, the Commonwealth produced a criminal abstract reflecting appellant’s 1974 conviction for driving without lights to avoid identification, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3734, and his 1975 probation without verdict under Section 17 of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. § 780-117.

The panel also noted that the factors delineated in subsection (a)(2) (license eligibility and non-commission of other criminal violations), which would permit a misdemean- or grading, are not “self-contained.” This is so because one must turn to other provisions of the Uniform Firearms Act— provisions not even mentioned in subsection (a)(2) — to determine eligibility for a firearms license.

Although appellant concedes that the determination of license eligibility requires reference to other provisions of the Uniform Firearms Act, he argues that such incorporation by reference should be regarded as a space-saving device and not as an indicator of substantive legislative intent, emphasizing that the Crimes Code often employs the incorporation technique in establishing the elements of other offenses. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2710 (ethnic intimidation).

The Commonwealth answers appellant’s claim that the 1997 amendment establishes a new element of the Section 6106(a)(1) felony offense by emphasizing that the conduct proscribed by Section 6106(a)(1) — the unlicensed carrying of a concealed weapon outside of home or work — is fully described in subsection (a)(1) independently of <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>the introductory “except clause” added in 1997. The Commonwealth further argues that the structure and wording of the 1997 amendment does not portray a new and separate offense with discrete elements, but rather depicts a grading provision lessening the severity of punishment for the <em>existing </em>offense for the benefit of certain offenders with certain personal characteristics and backgrounds that arguably make their conduct less serious, while not affecting the core conduct of carrying a firearm without a license. Since the amendment affects only the grading of the unchanged core offense, and does not provide for acquittal of the underlying conduct, the Commonwealth argues that the amendment should be construed as a grading provision affecting sentencing.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that an elements construction of the 1997 amendment would be absurd since it would require the Commonwealth to <em>disprove </em>the subsection (a)(2) misdemeanor in order to prove the subsection (a)(1) felony, in a circumstance where the core elements (concealed firearm, no license, territorial restriction) are identical. The Commonwealth also argues that an elements construction is absurd from the standpoint of the accused since it would require introduction of prejudicial information, such as the defendant’s prior convictions and bad reputation, in the Commonwealth’s case-in-chief. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that appellant’s constitutional arguments are both waived, since they were not raised in the trial court, and are meritless.</p>

Prior to the amendment of Section 6106(a) in 1997, the statute simply <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>proscribed the following conduct: carrying a firearm in a vehicle or concealed upon one’s person, anywhere except in one’s place of abode or fixed place of business, without a valid license. All violations of the statute were graded as felonies. The 1997 amendment did not change the operative, “forbidden conduct,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 103(1), condemned by subsection (a)(1). Rather, the amendment provides for a lesser gradation of an unlicensed firearm offense where the offender possesses certain personal attributes that the General Assembly obviously deemed relevant in mitigation: <em>i.e., </em>license eligibility and never having committed any other crime. It is not difficult to imagine why the General Assembly might statutorily draw this distinction for purposes of punishment: It is one thing to be unlicensed as a result of negligence, ignorance, or indifference, but it is quite another to be absolutely disqualified from licensure and possessing a firearm. Personal status factors such as those set forth in subsection (a)(2) — prior offenses, prior disentitlements — while always relevant for sentencing purposes, have nothing to do with the proscribed conduct covered by Section 6106 generally, and thus it is difficult to discern a legislative intention to treat such status factors as elements of some separate crime.</p>

Rather, we read the amendment as establishing sentencing factors which govern the proper grading of a Section 6106(a) offense.

Appellant argues that the General Assembly’s intent in drafting the “other offense” clause was to require felony gradation for offenders who possess a gun while committing additional non-weapons offenses. But, no such limitation is included within or suggested by the statute. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) (directing enforcement of clear statutory provisions according to their terms). Further, while the Section 6108 offense is based upon the same incident and general conduct as the Section 6106 offense, the statutes contain distinct and different material elements with respect to concealment and the geographic location of the conduct: <em>i.e., </em>concealment is an element of Section 6106(a) but not of Section 6108, while location in Philadelphia is an element of Section 6108 but not of Section 6106(a). <em>See Commonwealth v.

Such is the controlling situation here. With respect to license ehgibility/ineligibility, however, the potential disqualifying factors are more numerous and more difficult of proof.

Many of the license-disqualifying factors are very personal to the defendant and he certainly is in the better position to produce evidence on the subjects.

    <p id="b866-4" data-blocks='[["BL_866.4",866,[282,701,1164,1487]]]'>Applying these principles here, I would find that Section 6106 and Section 6108 merge for sentencing purposes. As stated above, Section 6106(a) provides that “any person who carries a firearm concealed on or about his person, except in his place of abode or fixed place of business, without a valid and lawfully issued license ... commits a felony of the third degree,” subject to the exceptions provided in subsection (a)(2). 18 Pa.C.S. § 6106(a)(1). Section 6108 provides that “[n]o person shall carry a firearm, rifle or shotgun at any time upon the public streets or upon any public property in a city of the first class unless: (1) such person is licensed to carry a firearm; or (2) such person is exempt from licensing under Section 6106.” <em><a href="/a2d/650/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="650 A.2d 20" data-case-ids="11311697,475550" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0020-01,/pa/538/0574-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 6108. Thus, a conviction for a violation of Section 6106 is established when a defendant carries a concealed firearm on or about his person without a license in any public place. At the same time, a conviction for a violation of Section 6108 is established when a defendant commits the very same offense, as long as he does so while in Philadelphia (the only city of the first class in this Commonwealth). As a case in point, Appellant was found guilty of violating Section 6106 for carrying a concealed gun while unlicensed, and found guilty of violating Section 6108 simply because he was doing so in Philadelphia. While Sections 6106 and 6108 may address different circumstances in which a person can unlawfully possess a gun, the essence of each is the same — unlawful possession of a gun. As such, the only difference that I can ascertain between the two offenses is with regard to the location of the offense. •</p>

Thus, as a practical matter, the majority creates a disparate rule whereby violations of Section 6106 constitute a misdemeanor of the first degree, unless the violation occurs in Philadelphia, in which case the offense becomes a felony in the third degree.</p>
