For the following reasons, we vacate and remand to the WCJ for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

He filed a claim petition for workers’ compensation benefits alleging injury to his lumbosacral spine and continuing lower back pain with <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>radiation into his lower extremities. On August 10, 1991 the WCJ found that appellant had sustained a work-related injury and awarded benefits at the rate of $200 per week as of December 14, 1990. On January 9, 1992 Employer filed a termination petition, alleging that as of November 7, 1991 appellant’s disability had ceased and he was able to return to work without restrictions. On February 19, 1992 appellant filed an answer denying Employer’s allegations and claiming that he remained temporarily totally disabled.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[288,805,1160,575]]]'>The medical expert evidence concerning the status of appellant’s work injury was disputed. Employer submitted the deposition testimony of John T. Williams, M.D., a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, who had examined appellant on November 7, 1991. Dr. Williams opined that appellant had sustained an acute lumbosacral strain and sprain that had since resolved and, thus, appellant was able to return to work without restrictions. In reaching his diagnosis, Dr. Williams did not review the x-rays, CAT scan, and nerve conduction tests which had been previously performed on appellant sometime between mid-December 1990 and November 7, 1991.</p>

During this examination, Dr. Fabian determined that appellant suffered from spasms in the paraspinal muscles of the cervical and lumbar regions, and that appellant had a 45% limitation of motion in his cervical spine and a 50% limitation of flexion, extension, and rotation in the lumbar region of his back. After nine months of physical therapy, Dr. Fabian found that appellant had hit a plateau of a 20-25% limitation of motion. Dr. Fabian had last examined appellant on October 16, 1992, at which time appellant complained of pain in his lumbar spine and legs. Based upon that examination Dr. Fabian opined that appellant’s limitation of cervical flexion, extension, and rotation had improved substantially, <em>ie., </em>it was now at 15%. Dr. Fabian also opined that appellant suffered from post-traumatic cervical and lumbar sprain with a protruding disc at L-4-5 level. Dr. Fabian <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>reviewed the CAT scan, which revealed a mildly concentrically protruding disc at level L-4-5 and a normal EMG. Dr. Fabian opined that appellant could not return to his duties as an ambulance driver with Employer, or to any other employment at that time, as he still experienced pain which was exacerbated by physical activity. Dr. Fabian also noted that appellant had limited mobility in his back which precluded him from doing any active physical work, sitting for periods of more than fifteen to twenty minutes, or walking more than short distances.</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[197,865,1153,745]]]'>Appellant testified before the WCJ on December 10, 1992 and claimed that his lower back and legs had continued to bother him since the work injury. Appellant stated that he still could not stand or sit for more than one hour; he experienced pain in his lower back when he walked; and he could lift only twenty pounds. Due to his continued pain and limited mobility, appellant testified, he did not think he could return to work with Employer in his pre-injury capacity as an ambulance driver, a job which required him to lift patients and equip ambulances with items such as oxygen tanks weighing up to one hundred pounds. Appellant further testified that he was receiving physical therapy three times a week, that he sees Dr. Fabian once a week, and that he takes Tylenol with codeine for pain.</p>

In such an instance, there often is not much to say, nor is there a need to say much, in order for a reviewing body to determine that the decision was reasoned. Such a credibility determination may involve nothing more than the fact-finder’s on-the-spot, and oftentimes instinctive, determination that one witness is more credible than another. The basis for the conclusion that certain testimony has the “ring of truth,” while other testimony does not, may be difficult or impossible to articulate — but that does not make such judgments invalid or unworthy of deference. To the contrary, people routinely undertake affairs of consequence based upon their judgment of the credibility and reliability of others, or their assessment of the mettle and character of the persons with whom they are dealing. Accordingly, in a case where the fact-finder has had the advantage of seeing the witnesses testify and assessing their demeanor, a mere conclusion as to which witness was deemed credible, in the absence of some special circumstance, could be sufficient to render the decision adequately “reasoned.” <em>See Story, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">supra.</a> </em>We do not believe that the statute, as amended, was intended to mandate that adjudicative officers explain inherently subjective credibility decisions according to some formulaic rubric or detailed to the “nth degree.”</p>

Since the WCJ did not observe the respective demeanors of the experts, her resolution of the conflicting evidence cannot be supported by a mere announcement that she deemed one expert more “credible and persuasive” than another. This is not to say that the WCJ must actually observe competing witnesses on the stand in order to assess.their relative credibility. To the contrary, as the cases that we have canvassed above demonstrate, there are countless objective factors which may support the decision to accept certain evidence while “rejecting or discrediting competent [conflicting] evidence.” For example, an expert witness’s opinion may be based upon erroneous factual assumptions, <em>see Supervalu, supra; </em>or an expert may have had less interaction with the subject, <em>see PEC Contracting, supra; </em>or the interaction was in a less timely fashion, <em>see Roccuzzo, <a href="/a2d/721/1171-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="721 A.2d 1171" data-case-ids="11800699" data-case-paths="/a2d/721/1171-01">supra;</a> </em>or the expert may betray a bias or interest in the matter. <em>See PEC Contracting, supra. </em>In addition, an expert witness may be unqualified or less qualified than the opposing party’s expert; or may be impeached with inconsistencies or contradictions in his or her testimony or reports; or may be impeached in some other convincing fashion. But these are relevant factors which are readily capable of identification and easy articulation by the WCJ. The point is that, absent the circumstance where a credibility assessment may be said to have been tied to the inherently subjective circumstance of witness demeanor, some articulation of the actual objective basis for the credibility determination must be offered for the decision to be a “reasoned” one which facilitates effective appellate review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

In any event, although the WCJ’s summarization of the witnesses’ testimony demonstrates her grasp of the whole evidentiary record, the WCJ articulated no objective basis for deeming the deposition opinions of Dr. Williams to be “more credible and persuasive” than those of Dr. Fabian. Although we can imagine reasons why the WCJ might have been more convinced by Dr. Williams’ opinions, there are arguments to be made in favor of Dr. Fabian’s opinions as well; more importantly, the reasons we might identify are not necessarily those which were in the mind of the WCJ upon rendering her decision.

Where such factors are present, an appellate court is permitted to find clear error, even in a finding purportedly based on a credibility determination. But where such factors are not present, there is little to review if no rationale is provided for the credibility determinations of the fact finder. Further, a reviewing court is unable to subsequently ascertain whether the Board properly performed its review function if it is unable to understand the rationale underpinning the decision of the WCJ.</p>

In my view, a WCJ may not make credibility determinations solely on “instinct.” An explanation from the WCJ, at a minimum, to explain those portions of the testimony found to be credible and/or those aspects of demeanor that formed the basis for a credibility finding is required so that a reviewing court can determine whether the reasons for acceptance or rejection were improper. It is beyond cavil that a simple credibility determination does not satisfy the substantive purposes of the fact-finding requirement. A statement that the WCJ finds a witness credible is no more enlightening than a statement that a claimant is not permanently disabled. Specific findings of fact are essential to an effective system of administrative law. “The practical reasons for requiring administrative findings are so powerful that the requirement has been imposed with remarkable uniformity by virtually all federal and state courts. The reasons have to do with facilitating judicial review, avoiding judicial usurpation of adminis<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>trative functions, assuring more careful administrative consideration, helping parties plan their cases for rehearings and judicial review, and keeping agencies within their jurisdiction.” <em>Perez v.

    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.4",295,[206,538,1157,510]]]'>Both a claimant and the employer have a legal right to know the evidentiary bases upon which the ultimate finding rests. That responsibility initially lies with the administrative agency, which must enter specific findings of basic fact to support its findings of ultimate fact and the resulting conclusions of law. The statutory requirement of a reasoned decision serves to protect against careless or arbitrary administrative action. The requirement that findings of basic fact be entered ensures that a careful examination of the evidence, rather than visceral inclinations, will control an agency’s decision.</p>

They include these: (i) the Administrative Agency Law requires it; (ii) failure to provide an adequate explanation for a [WCJ’s] decision leaves the loser with an impression of arbitrariness and unfairness and a legacy of bitterness and alienation; (iii) if such failure becomes routine, it will alienate the Bureau Of Workers’ Compensation from the community of interest which it was created to serve; (iv) a statement of reasons by the [WCJ], who is the fact finder, will aid the appellate reviewer to do his/her job; (v) clear reasons for decisions which deliver required but unjust results can focus disapproval on the law’s folly and promote its reform; (vi) fully reasoned decisions will enable parties to understand the issues they must confront, to appreciate the kind of evidence that the tribunal will want to hear and, by permitting litigants to make informed judgments as to chances of success, discourage inappropriate applications or appeals; (vii) adequate reasons provide future litigants with the means for invoking the principle of relative fairness[,] which holds that like cases should lead to like results; (viii) decision writing with reasons has an important role in the decision-making process by causing the adjudicator to think more clearly and to analyze more carefully; (ix) full written reasons provide a means of reviewing the decision-making <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>process at a later date and give substantive content to the right of appeal.</blockquote>

    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[287,589,1160,880]]]'>When the fact finder does not reveal the factual basis for his or her ultimate determination, which is the quintessential purpose of the requirement that administrative agencies enter specific findings of fact as part of their orders, the statutory Workers’ Compensation scheme is frustrated and the parties are dealt a disservice. I would hold that, if the factual basis for the decision includes a determination based substantially on the credibility of a witness, the WCJ must identify whether reliance was placed on observational credibility and/or substantive credibility and provide any specific evidence of the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness, or any perceived inconsistencies or lack thereof. I would also find that a reviewing court should only accord great weight to a determination of credibility that identifies the factors that support it. Accordingly, I dissent from that portion of the Majority Opinion that permits a WCJ to simply set forth credibility determinations without accompanying rationale.</p>
