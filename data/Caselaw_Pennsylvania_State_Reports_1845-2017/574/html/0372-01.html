For the following reasons, we hold that it can.</p>
    <p id="b588-7" data-blocks='[["BL_588.6",588,[281,843,1157,529]]]'>Both Appellee George Szparagowski and Appellant Joseph Milici (collectively, “Claimants”) were working as firefighters for the City of Philadelphia when they sustained work-related injuries that rendered them temporarily totally disabled. In Mr. Szparagowski’s case, he suffered a lower back injury on February 2,1989, when he slipped off a ladder in the course of his employment. Mr. Milici, on the other hand, was diagnosed in August of 1990 with coronary artery disease and obstructive lung disease, which were allegedly caused by work-related stress and inhalation of toxic irritants.</p>
    <p id="b588-8" data-blocks='[["BL_588.7",588,[281,1418,1158,371]]]'>As a result of their respective injuries, Claimants both began receiving temporary total indemnity benefits under the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act (the “Act”). In addition, shortly after each of their injuries, both retired under vested pensions and began collecting pension benefits in addition to their disability benefits. For several years, each received both types of compensation simultaneously.</p>
    <p id="b588-9" data-blocks='[["BL_588.8",588,[281,1829,1159,524]]]'>On June 6, 1995, the City requested that Mr. Szparagowski undergo an examination with Gabriel Rosales, M.D., a board-certified surgeon. Dr. Rosales concluded that Mr. Szparagowski had recovered to the point of being capable of performing sedentary or light-duty work that did not require heavy lifting or repetitive bending. Thereafter, in early 1996, the City had a job opening for a fire communications dispatcher, a position that was within Mr. Szparagowski’s physical limitations. The City offered the position to Mr. Szparagowski, who nevertheless refused it.</p>

The City asserted in the petition that Mr. Szparagowski had sufficiently recovered from his work-related injury to be capable of returning to gainful employment, that the City had offered him an available position within his physical limitations, and that he had refused the position in bad faith. Mr. Szparagowski responded that he had turned down the position because accepting it would result in a suspension of his pension payments. Mr. Szparagowski also claimed that he would be further disadvantaged by accepting the position because he could not retire with a vested pension under the dispatcher position’s pension plan until he reached age fifty-five, whereas his current pension plan had vested at age forty-five.</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[205,1072,1150,577]]]'>The Workers’ Compensation Judge ruled in favor of the City and reduced Mr. Szparagowski’s benefits, concluding that the City had properly offered Mr. Szparagowski an available position and that his expected loss of pension payments was not a valid reason for refusing it. The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board, however, reversed, holding that the dispatcher position did not qualify as an “available position” because it required Mr. Szparagowski to forfeit a “qualitative benefit.” The Commonwealth Court affirmed. <em>City of Philadelphia v.

In 1996, the City requested that Mr. Milici’s physical condition be evaluated by Subrahmanyam Chivukula, M.D., a physician board-certified in internal medicine and cardiology. Dr. Chivukula determined that Mr. Milici was medically capable of performing a light-duty or sedentary position. Later that same year, the City requested that Mr. Milici attend a second medical evaluation, this time with Alan Goldberg, M.D., F.C.C.P., a physician board-certified in internal and pulmonary medicine. Dr. Goldberg determined that Mr. Milici had no active lung disease, and from a pulmonary standpoint, was capable of returning to work without any restrictions. As it had with Mr. Szparagowski, the <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>City subsequently offered Mr. Milici a position as a fire communications dispatcher, which was within his physical limitations as defined by Dr. Chivukula and Dr. Goldberg. Mr. Milici, however, like Mr. Szparagowski, refused the position.</p>

Mr. Milici countered that he was not required to accept the position because accepting it would disqualify him from receiving his current pension payments. Mr. Milici further claimed that he was not required to accept the position because he suffers from irreversible diseases, and benefits for irreversible diseases may not be modified.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[278,1263,1163,952]]]'>The Workers’ Compensation Judge granted the City’s petition, reducing Mr. Milici’s benefits, and Mr. Milici subsequently appealed.

The Commonwealth Court distinguished Mr. Milici’s case from that of Mr. Szparagowski, noting that the loss of pension benefits did not amount to the loss of a qualitative benefit in Mr. Milici’s case because Mr. Milici, unlike Mr. Szparagowski, had reached the age of fifty-five and, therefore, could immediately re-retire from the dispatcher position with a new pension plan. <em><a href="/a2d/778/1282-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="778 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="9498294" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/1282-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/778/1282-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="778 A.2d 1282" data-case-ids="9498294" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/1282-01">at 1290</a>.

We granted both petitions to consider the common question of whether a temporary suspension of pension benefits constitutes a loss of a “qualitative benefit” which justifies a claimant’s refusal to accept employment that is within his physical limitations. We also agreed to consider the separate issue present only in Mr. Milici’s case of whether benefits can ever be modified in cases involving “irreversible diseases.” As stated above, we hold that the mere suspension of pension benefits does not justify a claimant’s refusal to accept employment within his physical limitations. We also hold that the benefits of a claimant diagnosed with an irreversible disease can be modified provided that his medical condition associated with that irreversible disease has changed. We therefore reverse the Commonwealth Court’s order in <em>City of Philadelphia v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Szparagowski) </em>and affirm its order in <em>Milici v.

In recognition of the fact that over the course of their public careers, employees may serve the City in more than one capacity, the pension system permits employees to move from one plan to another and provides for accumulation of benefits under more than one plan. According to the City Pension Program Administrator, if a former firefighter, who is receiving a pension under Plan X, decides to return to work in a civilian position, his pension benefits will be suspended and he will be re-enrolled in Plan J. The new Plan J benefits will accumulate while the former firefighter is employed in his new civilian position.

Finally, if the former firefighter remains in the civilian position for more than three years, the pension department will perform a new Plan J benefit calculation based on the total credited pension service, taking into account the former firefighter’s prior years of service in Plan X and adding this to the time in Plan J.

As the City Pension Benefits Administrator explained, whenever Claimants choose to retire, they will, at a minimum, collect the same monthly pension benefits that they do now. Indeed, if they spend more than one year in the dispatcher position and thereby accumulate additional benefits under Plan J, they will actually be entitled to receive more benefits per month than they receive now based on their firefighter service alone. Moreover, contrary to Mr. Szparagowski’s contention that he will be forced to work another ten years before retirement because firefighters may begin collecting on their pensions at age forty-five while those in civilian positions cannot collect benefits until age fifty-five, the record reveals that even if Mr. Szparagowski left the dispatcher position before age fifty-five, he would still be entitled to receive pension payments under his original Plan X pension.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

We do not, however, find this argument to be persuasive. Under our <em>St. Joe Container </em>analysis, it is only those “qualitative benefits” that are <em>“associated ivith [the] claimant’s former position ” </em>that an “available” job may not cause a claimant to relinquish. <a href="/pa/534/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="633 A.2d 128" data-case-ids="1839679" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0347-01">633 A.2d at 130</a> (emphasis added). Here, Claimants are not seeking to <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>protect benefits associated with their former positions, but rather, are seeking to secure for themselves <em>greater </em>benefits than that which they possessed prior to their injuries. By being offered jobs as fire communications dispatchers, Claimants are simply being asked to choose between working for the City and collecting their pensions. If they choose to resume work for the City, they will receive compensation for their work, but will forego present pension payments. If, on the other hand, they desire to continue collecting their pension benefits, they must officially retire from the City’s employ and forego further City paychecks. This choice is no different than that which any non-injured City employee with a vested pension faces and thus, is the very choice Claimants would have had if they had never suffered a work-related injury. Accordingly, we find no merit in Claimants’ assertion that accepting the dispatcher positions would require them to relinquish “qualitative benefits associated with [their] former position[s]” because they would not be permitted to collect pensions during the period of their re-employment with the City. <a href="/pa/534/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="633 A.2d 128" data-case-ids="1839679" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0347-01">633 A.2d at 130</a>.</p>

However, we reject Claimants’ suggestion that we should therefore require the City to locate and refer Claimants to positions in the private sector, particularly where, as here, neither Claimant expressed any particular interest in employment in the private sector or introduced any evidence that they had ever pursued employment with an employer other than the City. That the City is offering Claimants City jobs within their physical limitations that permit Claimants to both retain their vested pensions and accumulate additional pension benefits is more than sufficient to satisfy the City’s obligation to offer Claimants “available” jobs that do not deprive them of “qualitative benefits” associated with their pensions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>In the second issue before this Court, Mr. Milici argues that his workers’ compensation benefits cannot be modified because he suffers from two irreversible occupational diseases, <em>i.e., </em>coronary artery disease and obstructive lung disease. Specifically, he contends that under this Court’s decision in <em>Hebden v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Bethenergy Mines, Inc.), </em>534 Pa.327, <a href="/pa/534/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="632 A.2d 1302" data-case-ids="1839682,1839705" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0326-01,/pa/534/0327-01">632 A.2d 1302</a> (1993), employers are prohibited from modifying the benefits of a claimant who suffers from an irreversible disease. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[200,863,1157,1060]]]'>In <em>Hebden, </em>a coal miner was awarded partial disability benefits based on a specific finding that he was suffering from pulmonary lung disease that he had acquired in the course of his employment. Two years later, his employer sought to terminate his benefits, asserting that the claimant was not suffering from pulmonary lung disease. At hearings before a referee on the petition for termination, however, the undisputed evidence showed that pulmonary lung disease is irreversible. Thus, the employer’s assertion that the claimant was not currently suffering from the disease necessarily hinged upon a finding that he had, in fact, never suffered from it. However, as stated above, the initial award of partial disability benefits had been based on a finding that the claimant <em>was </em>suffering from the disease. As such, the Court considered the employer’s petition for termination to be a direct attack on the prior judicial finding that the claimant suffered from an irreversible disease. Under those circumstances, this Court held that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>barred the employer from relitigating the original medical diagnosis and thus required the denial of the employer’s termination petition.</p>

Where, as here, the employer is not asserting that the claimant is no longer suffering from the irreversible disease that provided the basis for the initial award of benefits, but rather is merely asserting that the claimant is now physically able to return to work in spite of his continuing illness, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>does not come into play and <em>Hebden </em>is simply inapplicable.</p>

Rather, given the goal of modification to respond to changes in earning power, it is only logical to interpret a “change in condition” as <em>any </em>change in the claimant’s physical well being that affects his ability to work and earn compensation for that work. As such, a “change in condition” can be a total recovery from a reversible illness, but it can also be the subsiding of symptoms from an ongoing medical problem, which reduces the claimant’s level of disability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus, in a case such as this, when a claimant <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>suffers from an irreversible disease, <em>Kachinski </em>merely requires that the employer produce medical evidence that the physical ramifications of the condition have changed such that the claimant can now obtain medical clearance to return to a job that he could not previously perform.</p>
