In its accompanying opinion, the court explained that escape requires the defendant to remove himself from official detention as that term is statutorily defined. The court noted that escape has historically been limited to situations closely resembling incarceration, and that the definition of the offense specifically excludes probationary and parole supervision. Observing that the precise issue is one of first impression, the trial court looked to precedent in the context of sentencing and credit for time served, which has excluded house arrest from the concepts of custody, imprison<a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>ment, or partial confinement, and also examined precedent from other jurisdictions, ultimately concluding that Wegley was not in detention for purposes of the escape statute. Finally, the court noted that the Commonwealth was not without a remedy, as Wegleys intermediate punishment sentence could again be revoked and he could receive the maximum allowable sentence. The court also indicated that Wegleys conduct could adversely affect his ability to obtain an early release on parole.</p>

Centrally, the court indicated that, because home confinement effects a restraint on liberty whereby a persons ability to come and go freely and to engage in activities outside the confines of a designated place are limited, flight from such confinement constitutes removal from official detention notwithstanding that the means of ensuring detention are electronic rather than physical. Finally, the Superior Court examined cases from other jurisdictions pertaining to escape from home monitoring, and found that the case involving statutory language most similar to Pennsylvanias escape statute presented persuasive justification for holding that the offense of escape can occur in the context of home confinement. <em>See Wegley, </em><a href="/a2d/791/1223-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="791 A.2d 1223" data-case-ids="9477655" data-case-paths="/a2d/791/1223-01">791 A.2d at </a>1226 (citing <em>State v.
