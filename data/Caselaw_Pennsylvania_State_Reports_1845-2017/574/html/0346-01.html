In 1949, wife gave birth to a child and, shortly thereafter, she filed a divorce complaint against husband. In January of 1951, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County directed husband to pay wife $140.00 per month as alimony pendente lite. Six months later he executed a will in which he left his residuary estate to his parents and another individual. On July 15,1952, husband wrote a letter to counsel for wife stating that he would pay wife $100.00 per month for the support of the parties’ son.

When a support order is in place at the time of the death of a parent, it must be enforceable against an estate. A support order is a judicially imposed obligation to provide a specific amount of support calculated pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure, which are promulgated to effectuate the goals of the Domestic Relations Code. Once a support order is entered, I believe that it should be treated like any other obligation, and the minor child should be able to make a claim against the estate of the payor as would any other creditor. Confronted with the option of analogizing a support order to a support agreement, <em>see Estate of Fessman; Huffman, </em>and <em>Stumpfs Appeal, </em>or to a situation where there is no support agreement, <em>see Garney, </em>the former is the wiser and more equitable choice.

This is in marked contrast to Section 3707 of the Domestic Relations Code, 23 Pa.C.S. § 3707, which provides that an obligation to pay alimony shall cease upon the death of the payor “unless otherwise indicated in an agreement between the parties or an order of court.” In the absence of specific direction regarding the effect of the death of the child support obligor, we look to the Statutory Construction Act, which directs us to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a).

As Judge Del Sole, now President Judge Del Sole, noted in his dissenting opinion in <em>Carney, </em>various sections of the support law allow us to infer that the legislature intends for the estate of parents to serve as a source of support for minor children:</p>
    <blockquote id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[328,998,1117,1189]]]'>While courts always had the power to direct wage attachments, current law makes attachment of income routine, rather than elective. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4348. In addition to regular support payments, a parent may also be ordered to pay a portion of the child’s medical expenses. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4326. The legislature has provided for the collection of support payments from a parent who resides outside of the Commonwealth by enacting The Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act which provides for the extradition of a parent back to the state where that parent has been charged criminally for failing to comply with a child support order. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4501 et seq. Also, a recently enacted statute directs licensing agencies or authorities, upon a court’s Order, to deny the issuance, or renewal of a license to engage in a “profession, trade or business” where a parent has failed to make support payments. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4355. Most interestingly for our purposes, entireties property can be used to enforce a support obligation against a spouse. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4361 et seq. Even lottery winnings are subject to use for payment of support orders. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4308. These statutes establish that the law has become increasingly forceful in its efforts to provide for the support of minor children.</blockquote>

      <em>Id. </em>at 22-23 (Del Sole, J., dissenting). As further evidence of legislative intent, Appellants note that support obligations constitute a judgment against the obligor with the full force, <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>effect and attributes of a judgment of court. 23 Pa.C.S. § 4352(d). In addition, support arrearages operate as a lien on an obligor’s real property. 23 Pa.C.S. § 4352(d.l). Viewed in its entirety, the aforementioned statutes indicate a decided legislative intent to require parents to fulfill their financial obligations toward their children. Accordingly, I disagree with the Majority that legislative silence evinces intent not to permit children to make a claim for support against the estate of a deceased parent.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[199,784,1158,1453]]]'>If the analogy between a support order and an agreement is insufficient to distinguish the instant matter from <em>Garney, </em>then a more comprehensive approach may be required. We recognize that, in dicta, this Court stated in <em>Estate of Fess-man, </em><a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20676" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="126 A.2d 676">126 A.2d at 678</a>, “[w]e have not overlooked the principles of law advanced by Petitioner that a father, in the absence of a contract, has no legal obligation to support his children after his death, and is under no legal obligation to leave his children anything by will.” Pursuant to the common law, death terminates the responsibility to support one’s children. Appellants argue that much has changed since the development of such rule, noting that at early common law, children were under the complete control of their father, and that in the rare case of divorce, children were placed in their father’s custody. In this situation it was highly unlikely that a father would disinherit his minor child. However, once it became common for children to be placed in the custody of their mother following divorce, the possibility that a father would disinherit his children became more likely. The prevalence of divorce and the number of families with unwed parents living in separate households also increased the possibility of parents failing to provide for their minor children in the event of a parent’s death. Importantly, Appellants do not seek to impinge on the testamentary freedom of the decedent. Rather, they seek recognition of the right of minor children to obtain support from the estate of a deceased parent, thus placing minor children on the same footing as any other creditor. Such recognition would require that we change the common law.</p>

In support of this position, they rely upon <em>Hack v.

      <em>Id. </em>at 867. <em>Hack </em>relied upon numerous decisions where this Court changed the common law, including <em>Soffer v. Beech, </em><a href="/pa/487/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="487 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1759077" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0255-01">487 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="487 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1759077" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0255-01">409 A.2d 337</a> (1979) (abandoning common law rule that actual possession is prerequisite to an action in ejectment); <em>Estate of Grossman, </em><a href="/pa/486/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="486 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1757582" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0460-01">486 Pa. 460</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="486 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1757582" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0460-01">406 A.2d 726</a> (1979) (abandoning per se rule disqualifying testimony of the spouse of a surviving interested party to a transaction with a decedent); <em>Falco v.

Because I believe that the instant matter can be resolved by making an estate responsible for a support order that existed at the time of the obligor’s death, I would not use this case as the vehicle by which to impose a general obligation of child support on the estate of all parents of minor children. Nevertheless, presented with the appropriate set of facts, I would not summarily reject a call to this Court to abandon a rule of law that allows a parent to leave a minor child in a state of penury while bestowing his or her bounty upon others. Effecting such a change to the common law would overrule the decision of the Superior Court in <em>Garney, </em>which the majority relies on in this case. Because I have serious doubts regarding the soundness of <em>Garney, </em>where the court refused to find a support obligation in the absence of a specific legislative directive, I believe that a reexamination of this issue would be welcome. In light of the existing statutory <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>scheme that emphasizes the importance of providing basic support to children, I do not believe that <em>Blue v. Blue, </em><a href="/pa/532/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="532 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1835926" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0521-01">532 Pa. 521</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="532 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1835926" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0521-01">616 A.2d 628</a> (1992), in which this Court held that we would not create a parental obligation to pay for college expenses absent specific direction from the legislature, controls the instant matter. The distinctions between child support for minors and college expenses for children, who are usually at least eighteen years old, render <em>Blue </em>inapplicable to this case.</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[206,794,1158,517]]]'>Therefore, I would reverse the decision of the Superior Court and remand the matter to the Orphans’ Court to enter an appropriate award of support against the Estate of Wiley Stanley Patterson. I would direct the court’s attention to 20 Pa.C.S. § 3387, which provides that when a claim “is not due but is certain to become due,” the court may award “the present value of the claim, as agreed to by the claimant and the personal representative” or may order “the personal representative to retain or pay into the court sufficient assets to pay on maturity the claim of the whole amount then due____”</p>
