They approached Harold Michie (Michie) at a jitney station in the Hill District of Pittsburgh and asked Michie to transport them to a different part of the district. During the trip, James brandished a shotgun, pointed it at Michie, and ordered Michie to stop and exit the vehicle. After Michie refused to get into the trunk of the car, Taylor and Martin forced him into the trunk. Taylor, Martin, and James then drove the car to a gas station in the Oakland section of the city. At this location, James pulled out his shotgun again and pointed it at the gas station attendants while Taylor and Martin robbed the men of approximately sixty dollars. James and Martin then dropped Taylor off on Wylie Avenue and drove to a nearby baseball field, where they shot Michie at least six times in the head and body, killing him.</p>

By Order dated June 14, 2001, the PCRA court dismissed the petition without a hearing, prompting Taylor to appeal to the Superior Court. In a memorandum Opinion, the Superior Court affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief. We granted allowance of appeal to address a conflict in our jurisprudence regarding the prerequisites of the “closely related crimes exception” to the <em>carpus delicti </em>rule.</p>

It is not our intent to abandon a century-and-a-half of <em>corpus delicti </em>jurisprudence in this Commonwealth in order to adopt a trustworthiness approach, as that issue is not before us today. However, the trend towards a more flexible formulation of the requirements for admitting a confession is informative.</p>

However, Taylor’s interpretation could allow the Commonwealth to successfully prosecute a defendant who confessed to killing a pedestrian while driving drunk for both “DOT” and “homicide by vehicle while DOT,” occurring simultaneously, even if the Commonwealth only had results of field sobriety tests and could not present any evidence of a death or collision. <em>Verticelli </em>would not afford this hypothetical defendant sufficient protection from being convicted of a homicide that he or she did not commit. Accordingly, we cannot accept the common element requirement articulated in <em>Verticelli. </em>The purpose behind the <em>corpus delicti </em>rule is the ultimate consideration in determining whether two crimes are closely related so as to implicate the exception. Where the relationship between the crimes to which the defendant has confessed is close and the policy underlying the <em>corpus delicti </em>rule — to avoid convictions for crimes that did not occur — is not violated, the exception renders the confession admissible for all closely related crimes.</p>

We have explained that, to be entitled to relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCRA petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) the underlying substantive claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel whose effectiveness is being challenged did not have a reasonable basis for his or her actions or failure to act; and (3) the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result of that counsel’s deficient performance. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/567/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="567 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="404536" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0186-01">567 Pa. 186</a>, <a href="/pa/567/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="786 A.2d 203" data-case-ids="404536,404591,9454337,9454361" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0186-01,/pa/567/0185-01,/a2d/786/0203-01,/a2d/786/0203-02">786 A.2d 203</a>, 213 (2001). One can glean an inconsistency between <em>Verticelli </em>and <em>Bardo. </em>Therefore, the claim Taylor contends his appellate counsel should have raised, that the Commonwealth failed to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of kidnapping, robbery, and conspiracy, might have arguable merit. However, now that we have determined that <em>Bardo </em>is a proper articulation of the closely related crimes exception, Taylor cannot demonstrate that he suffered prejudice because the Commonwealth established that those crimes were closely related to the homicide, as discussed below. <em>See Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/567/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="786 A.2d 203" data-case-ids="404536,404591,9454337,9454361" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0186-01,/pa/567/0185-01,/a2d/786/0203-01,/a2d/786/0203-02">786 A.2d at 221</a> (“[ajbsent a demonstration of prejudice, [a PCRA petitioner] cannot prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel and no further inquiry is warranted”).</p>

The police had been looking for Michie, who had been reported missing, for more than a day. The coroner determined that the manner of Michie’s death was homicide. These facts provide, at the least, independent corroboration of a homicide and, possibly, kidnapping, the principal crimes in this heinous criminal episode. Additionally, the confession of James, Taylor’s co-conspirator, offered during the course of the trial of Taylor, was consistent with the confession of Taylor. The other crimes to which Taylor confessed (robbery and conspiracy) share a sufficiently close relationship with the other charges because, as the Superior Court and PCRA court determined, “there was one continuing incident occurring at <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>roughly the same time, and the victim of each crime [Michie] was the same.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Section 303.7(a) of the then-applicable Sentencing Guidelines, 204 Pa.Code § 303.7(a), provided that "when imposing sentences for convictions arising out of the same transaction, the prior record score is computed for the offense with the highest gravity score in such transaction." In the present case, the kidnapping charge carried a higher gravity score, so the trial court improperly computed a prior record score for involuntary manslaughter. The trial court also inappropriately applied the deadly weapon enhancement when determining the sentence for involuntary manslaughter; again, pursuant to the then-applicable Sentencing Guidelines, such enhancement only applies to the offense with the highest gravity score in the same transaction. <em>See Commonwealth v.
