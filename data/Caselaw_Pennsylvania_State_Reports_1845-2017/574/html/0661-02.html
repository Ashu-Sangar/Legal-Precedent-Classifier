    </p>
    <p id="Aj-" data-blocks='[["BL_877.7",877,[205,1030,1149,470]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are undisputed. An employee filed a civil complaint in federal district court against the Housing Authority alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Executive Director of the Housing Authority subjected her to gender discrimination and a hostile work environment. The insurer, the Housing And Redevelopment Insurance Exchange (HAR-IE), a reciprocal insurance exchange made up of subscribing housing authorities within the Commonwealth, defended the Housing Authority and its Executive Director.</p>

Not only did HARIE defend the authority, HARIE declined to collect the $1,000 deductible required by the policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Pursuant to the terms of the insurance policy, HARIE retained exclusive control of the defense. A settlement was brokered by HARIE that involved the payment of <a id="p666" href="#p666" data-label="666" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*666</a>an undisclosed sum of money to the complainant and the execution of a reciprocal non-disclosure agreement. No copy of the confidential settlement agreement has been provided to the Housing Authority or to its Executive Director. At the time of the lawsuit, the authority paid HARIE a premium of $3,150.00 per year for coverage of one million per loss. There is no evidence on the record that the premium was raised as a result of the lawsuit or settlement.</p>
    <p id="b878-4" data-blocks='[["BL_878.4",878,[279,755,1163,884]]]'>Following the settlement and dismissal of the suit, Tribune-Review requested that the Housing Authority make the documents related to the settlement available to it for inspection. The Housing Authority refused to comply with the request because it was of the opinion that the lawsuit settlement documents were: (1) governed by a confidentiality agreement; (2) in the possession and control of HARIE; (3) did not involve the expenditure of public funds; and (4) were not “public records” under the Act. The Housing Authority also argued that it should not be required to produce the settlement documents because the confidentiality provision contained within the agreement was material to the settlement and should not be abrogated. Essentially the Housing Authority argued that the public interest in promoting settlements, coupled with the need for efficiency in conducting government business, outweighs the public interest in disclosure.</p>
    <p id="b878-5" data-blocks='[["BL_878.5",878,[279,1669,1165,520]]]'>After the Housing Authority refused to supply a copy of the settlement agreement, Tribune-Review appealed the denial to the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas, which relied on <em>Morning Call, Inc. v.

As these issues are closely related, we will address them simultaneously.</p>

      <em>DISCUSSION</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b879-5" data-blocks='[["BL_879.5",879,[203,1158,1158,784]]]'>The question as to whether a municipality must disclose a particular document to the public has been resolved by the General Assembly in favor of the public by balancing the fundamental public interest in disclosure against the governmental interest in confidentiality. The common law right of a party to inspect public records was codified by the General Assembly in 1957 as the Right-to-Know Act. The intent of the Act is to ensure the availability of government information to citizens of the Commonwealth by permitting access to official information. 65 P.S. § 66.2. Thus, in recognition of the fundamental nature of the public right to know, Tribune-Review had the burden of establishing that the requested material was a public record. If successful, then the Housing Authority, as the public entity, had the burden of proving that the record should not be disclosed.</p>
    <p id="b879-6" data-blocks='[["BL_879.6",879,[201,1974,1156,256]]]'>In the instant matter, the Housing Authority was sued in federal court by one of its employees in a civil rights action in the Western District of Pennsylvania. The Housing Authority was represented by HARIE, which reached a settlement with the employee, prompting dismissal of the federal action.</p>
    <p id="b879-7" data-blocks='[["BL_879.7",879,[203,2255,1156,96]],["BL_880.1",880,[288,308,1157,1008]]]'>Section 2 of the Act provides that, “Every public record of an agency shall, at reasonable times, be open for examination <a id="p668" href="#p668" data-label="668" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*668</a>and inspection by any citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” 65 P.S. § 66.2. Further, Section 1 of the Act defines an agency as, “any State or municipal authority or similar organization created by or pursuant to a statute which declares in substance that such organization performs or has for its purpose the performance of an essential government function.” 65 P.S. § 66.1(1). There is no dispute that the Housing Authority is an agency within this Commonwealth as that term is defined in the Act. We also conclude, as did the Commonwealth Court, that HAR.IE is not an agency -within this Commonwealth pursuant to the Act. The Act goes on to define a “public record” with reference to receipt and disbursement of public funds, procurement of materials and services, and actions of the agency affecting substantive rights. 65 P.S. § 66.1(2). The only records expressly excluded from the Act’s definition of “public record” are only those that come within the purview of the “investigative records” and the “statutes, orders and decrees” exclusions. 65 P.S. § 66.1(2).</p>
    <p id="b880-4" data-blocks='[["BL_880.4",880,[287,1350,1157,527]]]'>The Act provides that “every public record of an agency” shall be available for examination. 65 P.S. § 66.2. Because the Housing Authority is an agency, as that term is defined in the Act, it is incumbent upon us to determine if the document at issue is a “public record” pursuant to that Act. The Housing Authority deems it to be a document outside the purview of the Act and unavailable for disclosure. It asserts that litigation settlement documents in the possession of the Attomey-in-Fact of its risk insurer are not “public records” within the meaning of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The terms of the settle<a id="p669" href="#p669" data-label="669" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*669</a>ment of a federal civil rights action, which are based upon acts of the Housing Authority and its employees under color of state law, can only fall within the disclosure requirements of the Act as a “public record.” This is so, notwithstanding the confidentiality agreement, inasmuch as the settlement agreement at issue involved conduct of the agency in its official capacity. Therefore, the agreement that settled the litigation involved the release from liability of a public entity by one of its employees for an act or omission of that public entity in its official capacity, and is a “public record” within the meaning of the Act. <em>See Morning Call, Inc. v.

However, we believe that lack of possession of an existing writing by the public entity at the time of a request pursuant to the Act is not, by itself, determinative of the question of whether the writing is a “public record” subject to disclosure. A writing is within the ambit of the Act if it is subject to the control of the agency. <em>See, e.g., Carbondale Township v. Murray, </em>64 Pa.Cmwlth. 465, <a href="/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%201273" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="440 A.2d 1273">440 A.2d 1273</a> (1982). If the preparation of a writing, such as a litigation settlement document, by an attorney for an agency or by an attorney-in-fact for the agency’s insurer is not viewed as preparation by the agency, any public entity could thwart disclosure required by the Act by having an attorney or an insurer’s attorney prepare every writing that the public entity wishes to keep confidential.

Although West Chester did not compile course information, it procured an agreement with the campus bookstore, a non-profit organization, to supply DDS with the information requested. Millersville supplied the registration data to DDS, but refused to provide information on course materials because the school did not compile such information. DDS filed suit to obtain the information pursuant to the Act. This Court concluded that, although state universities were state agencies subject to the Acts disclosure requirements, the university was not required, under the Act, to produce information concerning required textbooks and course materials. We found that the university had no part in the ordering or selling of textbooks and neither solicited, compiled, nor retained information on course materials. Ultimately, we concluded that, the fact that the non-profit organization that operated the university bookstore was required to work closely with university in order to carry out its stated purposes, it did not lose its status as an independent entity for purposes of the disclosure requirements of the Act.</p>

Actual agency exists when a principal, in this case the Housing Authority, and an agent, here HARIE, enter into an agency relationship.

The exceptions provide that a document is not a public record if it discloses matters relative to an investigation, is forbidden by statute, or prohibited by order of court. 65 P.S. § 66.1(2). There is no averment that disclosure is prohibited by statute or that the document is relative to an investigation. Further, in the instant matter, the federal district court in the civil rights action against the Housing Authority did not seal the terms of the settlement agreement; only the parties themselves agreed not to disclose those terms. Hence, disclosure of the settlement agreement is not restrained by the exceptions to disclosure contained in the Act. Moreover, we believe that the confidentiality clause contained in this agreement is void as against public policy to the extent that it conflicts with the text and purpose of the Act.

The people of this state, through their elected representatives, have stated in the clearest of terms that it is more important that they have access to this type of information than that it remain confidential.
