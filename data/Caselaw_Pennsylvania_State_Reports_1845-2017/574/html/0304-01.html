As a threshold matter, the Commission segregates its overall expenses into two general components of “direct expenses” and “indirect expenses,” with direct expenses comprised of expenditures that are specifically attributable to regulation of a given subset of utilities, <em>see </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 510(b)(1), and indirect expenses representing the balance of the Commission’s regulatory expenses. <em>See </em>66 Pa.C.S. § 510(b)(2).

In implementing this provision, however, the PUC did not simply apportion its gross indirect expenses among the Utility Groups according to the percentage of gross revenues attributable to each group. Instead, before undertaking such an allocation, the PUC first divided its total indirect expenses into four more general and overlapping subcategories: expenses pertaining to “Motor Carriers,” “Transportation,” “Fixed Utility,” or “All Utilities” (collectively, the “Indirect Expense Subcategories”), essentially bunching expenses attributable to different and intersecting subsets of the Utility Groups.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Only then did the PUC allocate the indirect expenses among the Utility Groups to which each Indirect Expense Subcategory or Subcategories attached.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Since each of the Indirect Expense Subcategories “Motor Carriers,” “Transportation,” and “All Utilities” attached to the “Motor Carriers of Property” Utility Group, indirect expenses from three of the four subcategories were allocated to UPS.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The Fiscal Office indicated that this was necessary to fairly allocate the expenses among relevant subsets of utilities in light of corresponding regulatory activities of the PUC.

Although we are uncertain whether the Commonwealth Court was correct on the merits of the underlying matter, the fact of the matter is that UPS prevailed, and the PUC did not file a direct appeal. The Commission’s assertion that UPS should have filed an appeal is without merit, since, as the prevailing party, UPS had no standing to appeal. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 501; <em>Pierro v. Pierro, </em><a href="/pa/434/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="434 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="1922562" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0131-01">434 Pa. 131</a>, 132, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20A.2d%20652" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="252 A.2d 652">252 A.2d 652</a>, 653 (1969) (explaining that an appealing party must be aggrieved, <em>i.e., </em>adversely affected, by order in order to have standing to appeal).

      <em>UPS I’s </em>mandate was for recalculation of assessments to UPS during the relevant time period in accordance with the terms of the opinion.
