Appellant overlooks the fact his petition was summarily dismissed not because it was patently meritless, but because it was untimely. A PCRA court may not examine the merits of a petition that is untimely. <em>Murray, </em>at 203. The PCRA court’s threshold inquiry was whether appellant’s petition was timely, and if not, whether appellant had met any of the timeliness exceptions. Appellant’s petition was dismissed on this basis. Although the PCRA court had to examine the merits of some of the underlying issues because they were also advanced as exceptions to the time-bar, the court did not apply an incorrect standard or go beyond the scope necessary to address the issue of timeliness.</p>

Rather, we find evidence therein that quite the contrary was true; that it was Appellant who, from the very beginning of the trial proceedings, openly criticized Judge Sabo and repeatedly asserted he would not abide by the court’s rulings. The trial record reveals numerous outbursts and displays of intemperate behavior on the part of Appellant. Judge Sabo, for the most part, displayed much patience with Appellant’s diatribes. At those points when it became necessary for the judge to restore decorum in the proceedings, he properly did so. Simply stated, Appellant’s own disruptive behavior cannot be used to demonstrate that the judge bore hostility towards him.</blockquote>
