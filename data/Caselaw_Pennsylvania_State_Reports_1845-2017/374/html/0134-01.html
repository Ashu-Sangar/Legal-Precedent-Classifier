Both the township and the school district of the township at once challenged the annexation ordinance by filing a complaint in the court of quarter sessions of the county as authorized by Section 1010 of The General Borough Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, as amended by The Borough Code of July 10, 1947, P. L. 1621, 53 PS §12900. The complaint was originally heard by the president judge and an additional law judge of the county who differed in their conclusions with respect to the validity of the ordinance. Each wrote an opinion both of which were filed on August 24, 1948, by the president judge who directed that the matter be heard on September 21st following by all four members of the court sitting en banc. On August 26th the board of directors of the borough school district, by resolution, advised the residents of the territory (which was the subject matter of <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>the borough’s annexation ordinance) to register their children on September 1st for attendance at the borough schools during the succeeding school year. The next day, the township school district, by public notice, sought to advise residents of the territory that their children should continue, to attend the township’s schools until the question concerning the validity of the annexation ordinance was finally determined. Even so, 67 children of residents of the territory involved in the proposed annexation were registered on September 1st as pupils in the schools of the borough school district.</p>

On July 15,1949, the Superior Court, in a unanimous opinion, affirmed the decree of January 7th: see <em>Irwin Borough Annexation case (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa-super/165/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="165 Pa.

On September 17, 1951, the court discharged the rule by an order to which the borough school district filed exceptions.

      <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>The matter which the amendment of January 10th attempted to add to the decree of January 7th was so plainly beyond the jurisdiction of the court of quarter sessions as to merit little discussion. The fact that Section 1010 of The General Borough Act, supra, as amended, conferred upon the court jurisdiction of the complaint attacking the annexation ordinance imputed no power to such court to be concerned with or to pass upon affairs of a school district whether of the township or of the borough. The ordinance was an exercise by the borough of its municipal power and had nothing to do with public schools or their administration. It neither purported to, nor did it, involve the rights and liabilities of the school districts in any way. Such matters were entirely foreign to the quarter sessions proceeding concerning the ordinance and, hence, not within the jurisdiction of the court. In <em>Irwin Borough Annexation Case (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa-super/165/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="165 Pa. Super. 134" data-case-ids="467387" data-case-paths="/pa-super/165/0134-01">165 Pa.

They are separate and independent legal entities; they operate in distinctive spheres of governmental power; and they are regulated by different codes of law. Boroughs are municipal corporations and are governed by The Borough Code. School districts are administrative bodies corporate and politic, and are governed by the School Code.” Questions arising under the School Code are cognizable in courts of common pleas. “If the court has no jurisdiction, it is of no consequence that the proceedings have been formally conducted, for they are coram non judice. ... A judgment rendered in the Court of Quarter Sessions in a proceeding exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas, and vice versa, is void for want of jurisdiction in the court rendering the judgment”: <em>Wall v.

      <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>The appellant contends, however, that, since the court of quarter sessions had jurisdiction of the complaint attacking the ordinance, it also had power to determine all other issues incidental to the case and reasonably necessary for the administration of justice. Ordinarily that is so, but it is subject to the important qualification that the “other issues” cognizable by the court must fall within its general jurisdiction. The opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Brownmiller, </em><a href="/pa-super/141/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="141 Pa. Super. 107" data-case-ids="1027582" data-case-paths="/pa-super/141/0107-01">141 Pa.

For instance, a court of equity, the completeness of whose remedy is most frequently observed, could not assume to grant a divorce to an aggrieved wife who had invoked the court’s competent jurisdiction to obtain an award of support from her husband because of his desertion of her. The remaining cases cited by the appellant in its effort to expand the jurisdiction of the court of quarter sessions afford no logical basis for its contention.</p>

Stated otherwise, the question of the court’s jurisdiction cannot be raised again in a suit between the same parties or their privies concerning the same subject matter: <em>Federal Land Bank of Baltimore v. Putnam, </em><a href="/pa/350/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="350 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="461160" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0533-01">350 Pa. 533</a>, 537-538, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20586" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="39 A.2d 586">39 A. 2d 586</a>. As a reading of the opinion in the <em>Annexation Case (No. 1), </em>supra, discloses, the only matter there considered by the Superior Court was the validity of the annexation <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>ordinance and not the liability of one school district to another for tuition of pupils. Because the decree of January 7th and the amendment of January 10th were set forth on the appeals to the Superior Court, the appellant urges that a question as to the propriety of the January 10th amendment could have been raised and that, consequently, the whole matter is res judicata as the doctrine embraces not only matters actually determined but also those which could have been determined in the former case. This broad rule is applicable, however, where the causes of action are the same. Cf. <em>Philadelphia v. Ridge Ave. Ry Co., </em><a href="/pa/142/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="142 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="976681" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0484-01">142 Pa. 484</a>, 493. The present proceeding was instituted for the recovery of the money liability sought to be imposed by. the amendment of January 10th whereas the original proceeding was a complaint against the annexation ordinance. Where the causes of action are different, the doctrine of res judicata, applies only to the matters actually determined in the former action between the parties. It is too clear for argument that the one thing passed upon by the Superior Court in <em>Annexation Case (No. 1) </em>was the invalidity of the ordinance. Furthermore, there was no duty upon the township school district to raise any question as to the competency of the amendment of January 10th, upon the borough school district’s appeal which exclusively called into question the lower court’s invalidation of the annexation ordinance by the decree of January 7th. It follows, therefore, that the Superior Court’s affirmance of the decree of January 7th did not render res judicata the question as to the jurisdiction of the court of quarter sessions to amend that decree in the manner in which it attempted to do on January 10th.</p>

Debate as we may about the impropriety and irregularity of this scholastic contretemps, a very pragmatic situation was presented to the Court which required immediate and effective action. And the Court did not fail in fulfilling the duty thrust upon it. With Solomonic detachment it realized that in every serious crisis, theories must yield in the face of facts. No one can dispute that, next to healthful food, raiment and shelter, nothing is more important to a child’s welfare than education. The battle of the handbills and posters between the two municipalities had so intermingled the students of the school district that immediate court action was imperative to prevent the loss of school time <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>on the part of the involved children.
