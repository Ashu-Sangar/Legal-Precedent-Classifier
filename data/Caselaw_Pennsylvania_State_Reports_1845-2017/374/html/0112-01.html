As the order is manifestly interlocutory, its appealability was raised at bar and the ensuing discussion has since been supplemented by further briefs of the parties. The <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>defendant, contending that snch an order is appealable, relies upon the ruling in <em>Colonial Securities Co. v.

There, a motion to quash appeals from orders of similar character was refused in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion. However, the present is the first instance of an appeal to this court from such an order since the ruling in the <em>Colonial Securities </em>case almost a quarter of a century ago and, in view of the apparent conflict injected into existing law by the decision in the <em>Colonial Securities </em>case, we deem it appropriate and advisable to re-examine the reasons given for the ruling in that case.</p>

In quashing the appeal, Judge (later Mr. Justice) Linn, whose scrupulous regard for the rules governing appellate jurisdiction and procedure was notable, said, in speaking for the Superior Court,— “We know of no statute authorizing an appeal from such an interlocutory order. While section 15 of the Practice Act provides that ‘The set-off or counterclaim shall be regarded as the defendant’s statement of claim, and the plaintiff’s reply as an affidavit of defense thereto,’ <em>the refusal of judgment for want of a sufficient reply is not the refusal of judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense within the meaning of the act </em>

Parrish et al., </em>was rejected by this court in the <em>Colonial Securities (Wo. 1) </em>case, supra, for the assigned but obviously irrelevant reason that a 1929 amendment of Sections 15 and 17 of the Practice Act of 1915 had intervened. That the cited amendment (Act of April 22, 1929, P. L. 627) did not have the slightest bearing on the rationale of the decision in <em>O’Hara v. Parrish </em>becomes evident upon a moment’s reflection. All that the amendment of Sections 15 and 17 did was to add the term “new matter” to the category of “set-off or counterclaim” for which a defendant could move for judgment for want of a reply or want of a sufficient reply under Section 17 of the Practice Act both as originally enacted and as amended. The opinion in the <em>Colonial Securities </em>case, then reasoning from the unchanged language of the Practice Act of 1915 that a motion by a defendant for judgment for want of a sufficient reply to new matter was the equivalent of a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, concluded that a refusal of judgment for want of a sufficient reply to new matter was by analogy appealable under the Act of 1874 which authorizes an appeal from a refusal of judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</p>

The <em>Scholl </em>case-was concerned with an appeal from an order denying the plaintiff judgment for want of a sufficient answer to his peti<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>tion (under the Act of April 20, 1905, P. L. 239) for possession of premises purchased at a sheriff’s sale. The appellant contended that “. . . the refusal of the judgment at bar is a ‘final,’ appealable order, because the case comes within the provisions of the Act of April 18, 1874, P. L. 64, expressly allowing an appeal where judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense is refused.”. In rejecting this contention, Mr. Justice Moschzisker, speaking for this court, said (p. 128), —“In the first place, the act cited has no general application to special statutory proceedings such as those before us; and, next, even when this legislation applies, it does not follow that an order appealed from thereunder is, ex necessitate, ‘final.’ Under the Act of 1874, supra, an appeal lies from the declination of the court to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, not by reason of the refusal being a final judgment, in the technical sense of that term, for it is not, but simply because the statute expressly provides for an appeal in such case. We conclude that the act relied upon has no relevancy; and further, under the circumstances of this case, that the order in question should be treated as interlocutory.”</p>

While the motion to quash the appeal in that case was refused (<a href="/pa/301/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="301 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="1126378" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0229-01">301 Pa. 229</a>, 232), when the appeal came on for disposition on the merits, the order of the court below refusing the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the pleadings was affirmed in a brief <em>per curiam </em>opinion, (see <em>Colonial Securities Co. v. Levy, (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/302/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="302 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1129103" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0329-01">302 Pa. 329</a>, 331, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="153 A. 553">153 A. 553</a>) for the reason given by the court below that “ ‘the court thinks this is not a case where any judgment should be given <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>on the pleadings. ... it is the kind of a case which can be developed only by a complete hearing of the testimony and of all the facts in connection with the transactions involved.’ ” The same observation would be peculiarly apposite here were we to consider the instant appeal on its merits. As the learned court below pointed out, the judgment note (later entered and satisfied), which the defendant pleads under new matter, is not specifically identified as representing the same obligation upon which the plaintiff’s complaint is based. Consequently, a judgment for the defendant for want of a sufficient reply to the new matter would, at most, be but an adjudication of a fact and not determinative of the action as a whole. It is clear that the appellate practice sanctioned in the <em>Colonial Securities (No. 1) </em>case has not been conducive to the definitive disposition of litigation.</p>

In addition to the two appeals just mentioned, there was also an abortive attempt which need not be included in the present reckoning.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Thus, of the appeals that <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>have been taken from orders refusing judgments for defendants for want of sufficient replies to set-offs, counterclaims or new matter, only one has resulted in a final appellate court order.</p>

Nor can they be. When a plaintiff moves for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> he seeks something which, if granted, will make an end of the litigation whereas, when a defendant moves for judgment for want of a sufficient reply to a set-off, counterclaim or new matter, the judgment, should his motion be granted, would not necessarily terminate the action. Indeed, the judgment which a defendant would obtain by such procedure might be entirely wiped out by a judgment later obtained by the plaintiff following a trial of the issues <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>under Ms complaint. <em>Colonial Securities (No. 1) </em>plainly so recognized. It was there suggested that “in all cases where such a judgment [for the defendant] is entered and issues not covered by the new matter must go to trial, the courts can, and, where appropriate should, protect the original plaintiff by staying proceedings on the judgment against him until final judgment is entered on the issues required to be tried.” Thus, the defendant would have the benefit of the lien of his summary judgment pending ultimate disposition of the litigation although, upon final adjudication of all issues, he might turn out to be the net debtor. A plaintiff enjoys no such privilege by virtue of a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient answer (i.e., affidavit of defense) to his complaint. When a judgment is entered on such a motion, it is dispositive of all issues in the case.</p>
