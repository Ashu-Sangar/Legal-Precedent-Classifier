    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[232,443,1155,1040]]]'>The history of this litigation begins with the filing of a petition for adoption of these children by Mr. and Mrs. Eastridge in the Orphans’ Court of Lackawanna County. The petitioners in that proceeding predicated their right to adopt upon the fact of abandonment by the natural mother for the six-month period required by the Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, as last amended by the Act of June 30, 1947, P. L. 1180, 1 PS 1 et seq. Hence, the maternal interest of relatrix in her children was directly in issue then as it is in the present application. A full hearing was held before Judge Beady, and he characterized the proceedings before him in these words: “Considerable testimony was taken in these cases and the record contains charges and counter-charges, allegations and denials. . .” After careful reflection on the credibility of the witnesses who made these contradictory statements before him, the learned orphans’ court judge denied the petition for lack of proof of abandonment.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[233,1498,1154,652]]]'>Upon the filing of the present petition for habeas corpus, it was agreed by counsel for both sides that the testimony taken in the orphans’ court be made part of the record in the court of common pleas. However, the relatrix and both respondents personally appeared before Judge Woodring to supplement what they had said in the orphans’ court. Later, upon petition of respondents, a further hearing was held directed solely to the question of the fitness of the relatrix as a mother. After consideration of the testimony taken at all three hearings, the Northampton County court awarded custody to the relatrix.</p>

    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[159,1056,1149,929]]]'>Decision of the present case according to these principles depended largely upon a determination of the credibility of witnesses. There was testimony, ample if believed, to support a finding that relatrix was unfit to have custody: testimony that she abused her children, used profanity toward them, fed and clothed them insufficiently, failed to keep them and the house in which they lived clean and tidy, that she desired to be relieved of the care of the children when she and her husband separated and was not particularly concerned about who should have custody. There was also testimony from which an inference could be drawn that she failed to observe the proprieties in her conduct with the young man with whom she kept company after divorcing her husband. This is the testimony which the Superior Court chose to believe and which formed the basis of its opinion.</p>
    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[158,1999,1148,323]],["BL_208.1",208,[267,333,1155,769]]]'>But in so doing that Court rejected the unqualified <em>denial </em>by relatrix, which was believed by the judges who saw her in the courts below, that she was guilty of such conduct and the corroboratory testimony of witnesses produced by her who said that she was a devoted mother, took proper care of her children and <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>household, evidenced concern for their well-being and desired to visit them even when she was forced to surrender them to the custody of others at. the time when her own home was broken up because of the dissolution of her marriage with the children’s father. In drawing the inference of improper conduct, the Superior Court was required to disbelieve the testimony of the young man’s mother that she was always present in the house when relatrix spent the night there, that she and her husband occupied the middle bedroom of the three in their home, that she always awoke and greeted her son and the relatrix and saw them proceed separately, one to the front and the other to the back bedroom, to retire.</p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[267,1116,1155,699]]]'>. The Superior Court’s decision was thus based on a categorical rejection of the conclusions on credibility reached by the two hearing judges who observed the witnesses and listened to their testimony. Judge Woodring, before whom the parties appeared twice, had said: “Under all the evidence in the case, we cannot doubt relatrix’ sincerity in desiring to properly rear her children. Nor, can we find any compelling reason why this mother should not have custody of these daughters of tender years. While the living conditions with relatrix’ sister might not be ideal, there can be no doubt that the home is adequate and comfortable for the children. . . .</p>
