In the vicinity of the accident, five sets of tracks ran in a general north-south direction. Plaintiff testified on his own behalf as follows : He and three friends were returning from a visit to the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Home in Erie, Pennsylvania, which is located on the west side of the railroad tracks. A well-beaten foot path started on plaintiff’s grandmother’s property and extended to the east side of the tracks; some distance away another well-beaten foot path extended from the west side of defendant’s tracks to the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Home. Plaintiff decided to cross the tracks. The crossing being blocked by a train of freight cars, plaintiff climbed over a car on the nearest track. He then discovered that there were freight cars on another track which he likewise decided to cross. He climbed aboard a flat car and had gotten halfway across it when the train started with a jerk and threw him under the wheels. He and other children and adults on prior occasions had climbed over the cars when they blocked the crossing at the end of the path, and he testified that this had been going on for a long time and that employees of the defendant knew about it.</p>

It is also true that residents of some of the houses to the east crossed the track immediately in front of their own properties instead of at the end of plaintiffs’ pathway, and that, generally speaking, a permissive right of way must be confined within definite lines and not spread out over open ground in many divergent directions: Conn v.

Plaintiff contends that any train which stopped in a position to block the permissive path must in the exercise of reasonable care have two men on the lookout for persons who might be using the permissive path, and if, as in the instant case, two trains were stopped at that position, four men would have to be furnished by the railroad to warn those using the permissive path that they could not climb over a car which momentarily was blocking the path. That would be stretching the legal <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>fiction of a permissive way or crossing to an unreasonable and unjustifiable extreme.
