It is obvious that the assessors could not, in a few months, gather all the required data and information with respect to 45,000 properties; and similarly, that the required cost charts and land values could not possibly have been obtained in time for the 1953 assessments. If injustice has resulted from any <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>technical irregularities in the assessments, it can be corrected on appeal.</p>

Suffice it to say that so far as was practically possible, due to the limitations of time, the assessors and chief assessor followed the provisions of the new or amendatory Acts of 1952 under which, as will hereinafter more fully appear, each property owner or taxpayer’s rights are carefully and adequately protected by a full public hearing on an appeal to the Board, with a further right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

There was no averment or contention that any property was assessed “at more than 75% of its actual value”, or that it was not “assessed at a value based upon an established predetermined ratio” as required and restricted by §602 of the Act of January 18, 1952, P.

It is clear, therefore, that the division or classification of land into surface, mineral, and farm land was not arbitrary or discriminatory or illegal, but was unquestionably reasonable, practical and just, and did not violate any provision of the Federal or State Constitution.</p>

Merely because a taxpayer can suggest a formula or method or yardstick which appeals to him as one that should be adopted, does not prohibit a tax-assessing body from adopting any formula or yardstick or method it desires, provided it is valid and constitutional. Moreover, it is quite evident that if the 1952 assessment of <em>each </em>property had been increased, not by a small percentage, but by 400%, the resentment and protests of the taxpayers would be just as great as is now expressed, and similar charges would be made of discrimination and lack of uniformity.</p>

The taxpayers point out that Equity should take jurisdiction in such a case of alleged arbitrary discrimination in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits by thousands of owners or taxpayers whose interest is the same. The main fallacy of this contention is that the premise is fundamentally wrong. If there be discrimination, inequalities or confiscation, the interest of all taxpayers is not identical but separate. Each individual property has a value which may depend upon its location, or market facilities, or transportation facilities, or operational costs, or other special facts; consequently all property owners, even of the same class and in the same district or area, may not have the same identical in<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>terests, nor would the same question or questions necessarily be involved in each assessment. Furthermore, each taxpayer has not only a right of public hearing with or without counsel, but a right of review and appeal to the Board, and still further to the Court of Common Pleas. Where a statute gives a property owner or taxpayer notice, a hearing, and a full and adequate remedy, the Constitutional requirement of “due process” is satisfied: <em>Com. ex rel. Chidsey v.

The following excerpts from Mr. Justice Chidsey’s opinion in that case are equally applicable to the facts in this case: “In Wynnefield United Presbyterian Church v. City of Philadelphia et al., <a href="/pa/348/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="348 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1220345" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0252-01">348 Pa. 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20276" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="35 A.2d 276">35 A. 2d 276</a>, Mr. Justice Linn said, ‘A distinction has been taken between the cases in which over-assessment or inadequate exemption has been alleged and the cases in which the property owner denies the power to levy any tax. In the former, it has been held that the remedy is by appeal from the assessment, as the statute provides, and not in equity; in the latter, equity affords the remedy: . . .’. That this is not a case of a denial by a property owner of the <em>‘power to levy any tax’ </em>is apparent. Here the plaintiff contends that the <em>method of assessment </em>is unconstitutional and disregards the statutes granting the power to assess. . . .</p>
