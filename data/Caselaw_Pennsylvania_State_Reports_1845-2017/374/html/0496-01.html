The question for decision is whether the defendant county was responsible for the care and maintenance of the highway bridge whereon the plaintiff’s decedent received the injuries resulting in his death. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that the responsibility was the Commonwealth’s by virtue of its express statutory adoption of the highway prior to the injury of the decedent. For present purposes, it is to be assumed that the testimony adduced by the plaintiff established that the decedent’s fatal injuries were the result of the improper maintenance of the bridge and its roadway. The court en banc denied the plaintiff’s motions for a new trial and the judgments from which the plaintiff has appealed were entered on the verdict. The Commonwealth has filed a brief under Rule 46 and participated in the oral argument in this court, contending, as does the appellant, that the county whs at the time of the injury in suit, and still is, responsible for the repair and maintenance of the bridge in question and the highway upon it.</p>

As was said in the <em>Rapho and West Hempfield Townships </em>case, supra,—“As a general proposition, but by no means universal, bridges are treated as portions of the highways which cross them, and are to be maintained by the same persons to whom the duty of repairing the highways is committed: Shear. &amp; Red. on Negligence, §248. In this state the .duty is statutory, and therefore we must look to the statute for its nature and extent.” The idea is succinctly, stated in Elliott on Roads and Streets, 3rd. Ed., Vol. 1, §34, p. 42, where, after recognizing that “It cannot. . .' always be true that statutes respecting highways extend to and include bridges”, it is said that “whether they do or not must depend upon the general tenor of the.particular statute and the purposes it was intended to accomplish*” We come, then, to a consideration'of the intent and purpose „of. the Act of <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>1941, supra, which deals exclusively with the Ohio Eiver Boulevard which, as we have seen, is described with particularity throughout the detailed course of its length of 13.5 miles from the City of Pittsburgh through numerous boroughs and a township to the Beaver County line.</p>

The word “highway” as defined by Sub-section (52) of Section 101 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019 (46 PS § 601), unquestionably includes the bridges which are a part of a highway.

It was, of course, within the legislature’s power to continue upon the county the duty of maintaining the bridges which were a part of the boulevard when adopted by the Commonwealth as a State highway. In <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, ex rel. v. Bird, </em><a href="/pa/253/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="253 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="1023980" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0364-01">253 Pa. 364</a>, 372, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20648" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="98 A. 648">98 A. 648</a>, it was recognized that “The Commonwealth could, if it had seen fit, have included in its appropriation of roads, under the Sproul Bill [Act of May 31, 1911, P. L. 468], the county bridges located upon the said highways, so taken over, but for reasons satisfactory to'the legislature, this was not done.” What the Sproul Act expressly did, however, was to <em>exclude </em>county bridges from the Commonwealth’s assumption by that Act of the duty of maintaining the roads and high<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>ways covered by the enactment. And, that is what the Act of 1941 with which this case is concerned <em>did not do. </em>It does not even contain the word “bridge” or “bridges”. There is no decision of this court that has come to our attention which holds that the maintenance of a county bridge is to be divorced from the maintenance of the highway of which it is an integral part where the Act of Assembly, dealing with the related question of the future maintenance of the highway, does not specifically differentiate between the highway and a bridge which it traverses. The general language in Section 1 of the Act of 1941, which the appellant stresses, that the Commonwealth’s duty of maintenance should be “under the provisions of present or future'laws governing State highways . . .” does not warrant a distinction between the Ohio River Boulevard and one of its bridges, when the Act makes no mention at all of bridges.</p>
    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[251,1279,1164,1039]],["BL_535.1",535,[157,344,1153,377]]]'>Nor is it reasonable to infer from anything contained in the Act of 1941 that, in taking over the Ohio River Boulevard, the legislature intended that the maintenance of the bridges which constitute such a large and important part of the highway should continue to be the charge of the county. The lack of control by the Commonwealth over the whole of this important artery of interstate travel, which would result were the duty of maintaining the bridge left with the county, negatives any such idea. The opinion for the court en banc, after mentioning that the highway parallels the Ohio River on its north side, points out that “The high ground bordering on the river is intersected by a number of ravines over which bridges were built by the County of Allegheny as a part of the completed improvement known as the Ohio River Boulevard.” The learned court below then correctly observed that “if the bridges over and upon which the Ohio River Boulevard is constructed were excepted, the Ohio River Boulevard would consist <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>of a number of separated segments of highways, whereas it is described [by the Act] as one continuous thoroughfare.” If the appellant’s contention were adopted, it would produce an absurd and unreasonable result which a familiar rule of statutory construction bids us not impute to the legislature as its intent: Statutory Construction Act of 1937, supra, Section 52 (1).</p>
    <p id="b535-3" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[155,734,1156,878]]]'>The appellant argues that, inasmuch as the Commonwealth’s liability for the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of the Ohio Eiver Boulevard, pursuant to the Act of 1941, was subject to “the provisions of present or future laws governing State highways”, the duty of maintaining the Birmingham Avenue Bridge in Avalon Borough was continued upon the county. This argument, the appellant predicates upon the assertion that the policy of the Commonwealth has been to continue responsibility for the maintenance of State highway bridges upon the counties and that express language of assumption is necessary to shift such liability to the Commonwealth. We agree with the learned court below that “The presumption ... is quite the other way” in the light of the legislative tendency exhibited over the past fifty years.</p>

L. 551, which empowered the various political subdivisions of the Commonwealth “to lay out, open, construct, vacate or abandon highways, streets and bridges,” roads and highways thereupon became matters for local concern and responsibility. As noted in <em>Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania v. Lewis, Secretary, </em><a href="/pa/317/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="317 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="8845984" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0387-01">317 Pa. 387</a>, 391, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.%2036" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="177 A. 36">177 A. 36</a>, by the Act of 1836, supra, “. . . the Commonwealth . . . [withdrew] from road building and [committed] highways and bridges to its agents [i.e., political subdivisions] for ownership, control, building, maintenance and repair, so that [thenceforth] almost every street, road, highway and <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>bridge in the Commonwealth was locally owned.” However, with the advent of automotive vehicles toward the end of the nineteenth century, it soon became apparent from the demands for better and more adequate highways that the political subdivisions of the Commonwealth (townships most obviously at first) would be financially unable to improve and maintain the highways in a manner made necessary by the ever-growing vehicular traffic. In manifest recognition of that situation, the legislature entered upon a highway program which was a direct reversal of the attitude of the Commonwealth in respect of such responsibility as reflected by the Act of 1836 in practice.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[256,1070,1164,1262]]]'>By the Act of April 15, 1903, P. L. 18S, the legislature created a State highway department which was authorized to cooperate with the several counties and townships and with boroughs in certain instances in the improvement of the public highways and the maintenance of improved highways. The Act provided for State-aid highways, the improvement and maintenance of which were to be effected by joint action of the State and a county or a township. Section 18 of the Act declared that “The word ‘highway,’ as used in this act, shall be construed to include any existing causeway or bridge,. . . which may form a part of a road, and which might properly be built, according to existing laws, by the township or townships; but shall not include causeways or bridges which should properly be built by a county ... or by the State.” So far, then, State relief from liability for bridge construction and maintenance was limited to townships only. Section 35 of the Act of 1836 had recognized the probable financial inability of townships in respect of bridge maintenance by providing that where a necessary bridge “would be too expensive for such township . . ., it shall be entered on record as a county bridge.”</p>

L. 318, which, after reciting that “It is of great importance to the people of this Commonwealth that the public highways should be systematically improved, and that the several counties and townships should be given the aid and encouragement of the State in the building and maintenance of improved highways”, substantially reenacted the Act of 1903, supra, including the above-quoted Section 18 which became Section 19 in the Act of 1905. Both of those Acts, however, were repealed by the Act of May 31, 1911, P. L. 468, known as the Sproul Act. By that Act, the Commonwealth embarked upon a comprehensive undertaking of State-wide highway construction, improvement, maintenance and control. In addition to continuing State-aid highways as authorized by the Act of 1903, the Sproul Act created a new class of highways which it denominated State highways, the burden of which was to rest entirely upon the Commonwealth. The Act further provided for the reorganization and extension of the Department of Highways and took over as State highways specified roads throughout the Commonwealth which were described by courses and termini and given separate State highway route numbers from “One” to “Two Hundred and Ninety-Six” inclusive.</p>

D.R. 266, said,—“We agree with the learned court, in the Center County case, that it would be better. for the State, to control the <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>State highways, absolutely, and not have a divided jurisdiction, in the maintenance of the same. This, however, is a matter for the consideration of the legislature, and not for the courts.” The trend in the Commonwealth’s policy toward more and more responsibility for the construction, maintenance and repair of bridges on State highways soon became evident.</p>

When, therefore, the Commonwealth takes over a county road as a State highway, unless the Act of adoption expressly continues upon the county the duty of maintaining a bridge or bridges on such road, the presumption is that liability for bridge maintenance is assumed by the Commonwealth. The Act of 1941, relating to the Ohio River Boulevard, did not, as we have seen, make any separation or other mention of bridges although it dealt with the entire length of the boulevard as measured over land and bridges. Nor is there any justification in the appellant's contention that the reference in the Act of 1941, supra, to “present or future laws governing State highways” was intended to continue upon the county liability for the maintenance of the bridges of the boulevard taken over by the Commonwealth as a State highway. The reference to “present or future laws concerning State highways” was in connection with the Commonwealth’s assumption of the duty to construct, reconstruct and maintain at the Commonwealth’s expense the described highway, which, without specific exclusion, included the highway’s bridges.</p>

By the appropriation that status ceased entirely, and thereafter the supervision of it and the duty of keeping it in repair were transferred from the township to the state highway department, and with that transference, as directed by the Act of 1911, that supervision and duty were taken from the township.”.

It could be just as correctly stated that nowhere does the Act of 1941 <em>include </em>bridges <em>within </em>the scope of the Commonwealth’s duty of maintaining the highway known as the Ohio River Boulevard. Since the Act of 1941 makes no mention whatever of bridges, an analysis of the statutes relating to highways and bridges is appropriate to aid in the construction of the words “in accordance with the provisions of present and future laws”. The majority opinion concedes that by the Act of 1836 the Commonwealth committed highways and bridges to its political subdivisions for ownership, control, building and maintenance, and points to subsequent legislation as evidence that the Commonwealth has subsequently completely reversed its attitude with respect thereto.

The title of the Act of 1911 reads, in part, as follows: “. . . providing for the improvement, maintenance and repair of said State Highways solely at the expense of the Commonwealth, and relieving the several townships or counties from any further obligation and expense to improve or maintain the same, and relieving said town<a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>ships or counties of authority over same; requiring boroughs and incorporated towns to maintain certain State Highways wholly and in part; . .

The long history of legislation from the Act of 1836 to the Act of 1945 also indicates that the progressive expansion of this liability has been a very gradual process and each successive step taken with discriminating care. While we may agree that it would be a wise policy for the Commonwealth to assume liability for maintenance and repair of all bridges forming a part of State highways and thereby relieve all counties and other political subdivisions from this liability, the limitation of the judicial function requires that such policy questions, involving as they do expenditure of the funds of the Commonwealth and additional demands upon its personnel and equipment, must be decided by the Legislature as it always has been done in the past. The Legislature by conducting hearings if necessary can ascertain the probable cost such extension of liability would impose upon the Commonwealth, and all of the other factors which might affect such decision, and with all the pertinent facts at its disposal make whatever provision it deems advisable. Until the Legislature has done so, the words “in accordance with the provisions of present <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>and future laws” as used in the Act of 1941 must be construed to mean that in taking over the Ohio River Boulevard as a State highway the Legislature did not intend to increase its liability to repair and maintain bridges beyond that established by the prior Acts of Assembly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> In the absence of express language of assumption of such liability, the conclusion by the majority is untenable.

Section 10 of the Sproul Act of 1911, as amended by the Act of May 7, 1929, P. L. 1566,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and the Act of June 26, 1931, P. L. 1388, reads as follows: “Anything herein contained, or any apportionment of the State into highway districts, shall not be construed as including or in any manner interfering with the roads, streets, and highways in any of the cities, boroughs, or incorporated towns of the Commonwealth: Provided, That where any road, street, <em>or </em>highway [or bridge over a stream, within the limits of any borough or in any incorporated town,] shall form a [part or section of] <em>continuation of </em>any <em>of the </em>State [highway,] highways, as herein described, <em>toithin the limits of any borough or incorporated </em>towns, the Department of Highways shall improve or reconstruct [such] <em>any </em>section or sections [or bridge over a stream, such width as it may deem advisable,] of such road, street, <em>or </em>highway <em>which have heretofore been maintained by the Department of </em>Highways, <em>to such width as it may deem advis</em>able, at the expense of the Commonwealth: . . .”.</p>

The entire Ohio River Boulevard had been constructed by the County of Allegheny. By the Act of 1941 the Ohio River Boulevard was “adopted” by the Commonwealth. At the time of such <em>adoption, </em>the boulevard was a completed county project and the bridge therefore never had been “on a continuation of <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>a State highway” within the meaning of the statute.</p>

      <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[175,1622,1149,700]]]'> The title of the 194i Act is as follows: “Establishing certain public roads and streets as a State highway, and providing for their construction, reconstruction and maintenance by the Department of Highways <em>subject to certain terms and conditions.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). It is to be noted that the establishment of the roads and streets as a State highway is “subject to certain terms and conditions”. This qualification of the purpose in the title indicates that the adoption of Ohio River Boulevard as a State highway was not absolute and unqualified. In order that this portion of the title be given effect, the words “in accordance with the provision of present and future laws” in the body of the Act must be construed as leaving undisturbed the duty of the county to maintain bridges other than those as to which the Commonwealth had specifically assumed such liability in prior statutes. Otherwise the above quoted portions of the title and the Act itself are meaningless.</p>
