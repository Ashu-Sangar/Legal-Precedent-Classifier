Allied having become financially involved at a time when the houses were still uncompleted, Housing instituted foreclosure proceedings on two of its mortgages, entered judgments on the bonds, issued executions, and at the sheriff’s sales bought in 13 of the lots under one sale for the sum of $67,000, and one lot under the other sale for the sum of $8,007.52; on the one sale it paid in cash $1,532 for costs and taxes and obtained from the sheriff a receipt for the balance; on the other sale it paid in cash $410.77 for costs and taxes and obtained from the sheriff a receipt for the balance. The sheriff filed proposed statements of distribution which granted priority to the claim of Housing to the extent of <em>all </em>its payments under its advance money mortgages over the claim of Clark on his purchase money mortgage. Clark filed exceptions, claiming priority for the amount still due on his mortgage<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> over the claim of Housing for any advance payments in excess of those stipulated in the schedule set forth in the construction loan agreements./ Upon petition of Housing the court made an order permitting the sheriff to deliver to it deeds for the 14 lots upon its paying to the prothonotary the sums of $9,658.00 and $742.00, or a total of $10,-400.00, which was to be held pending the final order of the court. The court appointed an auditor who filed a <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>report recommending that Clark’s exceptions be dismissed. The court below sustained the auditor’s report, whereupon appeals were taken to this court. We held <em>(Housing Mortgage Corporation v.

The auditor took additional testimony and filed a supplemental report taking the same view as before. Clark having meanwhile died, the executors of his estate filed exceptions to the supplemental report; those exceptions being overruled by the court the executors took two of the present appeals. The court imposed the costs upon Housing, from which action Housing has filed the two other appeals now before us.</p>
    <p id="b349-3" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[162,1352,1153,757]]]'>It is the contention of the Clark Estate (1) that their decedent, the purchase money mortgagee, had the right to insist upon Housing complying with the schedule of advance payments contained in the construction loan agreements between it and Allied; (2) that any payments made by Housing to Allied which did not so comply were voluntary, not obligatory, on its part; and (3) that the lien of Clark’s purchase money mortgage was therefore subordinated to that of the advance-money mortgages of Housing only to the extent that the advances made by the latter were as prescribed in the schedule. Since it is our opinion that these contentions are valid, the orders of the court below based on contrary conclusions must be reversed.</p>

And when, in the deed for the property, he agreed that the lien of- his mortgage should be postponed to that of “three certain mortgages' of even "date herewith and to be recorded, given by the mortgagor herein to Housing Mortgage Corporation,’hit: is equally obvious that the postponement thus effected was to be to the three specific or “certain” mortgages then and there executed and recorded simultaneously with his own mortgage, part of the terms of which were that the loans by Housing were to' be. advanced in" accordance with the; terms and requirements of ‘the accompanying construction' loan agreements 'between Housing and Allied thus, expressly referred to and thereby incorporated in those mortgages. -In. other: words, Clark, was not subordinating thé lien of his mortgage to <em>any </em>three mortgages aggregating $248,200, but '.to the' three mortgages expressly specified, and .’therefore:.as expressly conditioned by the terms and conditions of" the construction loan agreements under which the loans were to be'.'made. It would be wholly incredible to suppose that Clark, taking back a purchase money mortgage for the' full' price of the property he was selling, $23,800, could have intended to subordinate the lien of his mortgage to those of other tremendously larger mortgages: which would immediately have made his own mortgage wholly worthless,' if, as the court below in' effect held, such other liens Would have been paramount to his even though' Housing should have chosen to páy over td Allied at once the entire $248,200 of their proposed loans. On the contraryythe only reason for his subordination of his lien was; of course, that if .the.'payments were'advanced'by Housing only as agreed upon,::the Housing liens ahead oL his'own would Increase", in." amount' only . as . the. mortgaged ', property <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>simultaneously increased in value because of the concomitant progress in the work of construction. The evidence shows that Clark, Allied and Housing were in perfect understanding and agreement as to the entire transaction and as to the rights of each and all of them in connection therewith, and the interrelation of the deed and all the mortgages involved clearly appears from the documents themselves. Those documents, therefore, must be interpreted together, since, even though not made by the same parties, they were part and parcel of the same transaction: Restatement, Contracts, §235 (c); 3 Williston on Contracts, (rev. ed.) p. 1803, §628.</p>

The answer to this question clearly appears from the findings made by the auditor in his supplemental report. Those findings were to the effect that all the work had been finished on 13 of the houses as to stages (b), (c) and (d) specified in the schedule of payments, and on the house on the 14th lot as to the stages (b) and (c). This justified the payments advanced by Housing to the extent of |55,900.00. But the next stage of the construction work, namely, <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>(e) was not completed as to any of the houses, and yet advances were made by Housing in addition to the $55,900.00 — even, in some instances, advances that should have been made only Avhen the stages of (f) and (g) had been completed — to the extent of $26,500.00. The auditor found that the schedule had been “substantially” complied with, and therefore that the excess payments were justified, but his very recital in detail of the Avork remaining uncompleted shows that there was not any such substantial completion of the work as would have Avarranted the advance payments of the additional $26,500.00. Moreover, by the terms of the construction loan agreements advances were not to be made during the course of the performance of. any of the stages of the work, but only upon the <em>completion </em>of each stage, and while, as between Allied and Housing, the latter could, at its option, have <em>voluntarily </em>advanced moneys as the work progressed without waiting until the termination of that particular stage, it could not do this to the prejudice of Clark’s right to insist upon the performance of the construction loan agreements as written and as incorporated in the advance-money mortgages to which he had subordinated the lien of his own mortgage. Nor did the fact that the; advances were to be made “only if and when the various stages -of work are completed to the satisfaction of” Housing, give legal warrant to the latter; as. against the rights of Clark, to anticipate payments because of its being .“satisfied” that the progress of the work justified such liberality on its part. That provision was solely for the protection of Housing, and did not vest in it any additional latitude, as far as Clark-Avas concerned, to make payments which it. was..not required to make under, the terms .of--the. schedule.</p>
