During the first month in which it operated it sold huge quantities of copper scrap to Westinghouse Electric Corporation (hereinafter calléd Westinghouse) and National Electric Products Corporation (hereinafter called National), both of which are Pennsylvania corporations with offices in Pittsburgh. All of these sales were consummated in the following manner: Purchase orders were placed with Keystone by Westinghouse and National specifying the quantity of scrap desired, and with a provision that it was to be shipped by Keystone directly to a smelting and refining company in Carteret, New Jersey; this latter company was not affiliated with either the seller or the buyers. Since Keystone did not itself keep any copper scrap on hand, it was obliged, in order to fill the orders, to. buy the scrap from suppliers in Pennsylvania and other States. These suppliers shipped the scrap — 58 carloads — directly to the refinery in New Jersey. Keystone received from Westinghouse and National the sum of $826,-961.03 .in payment for the scrap. The mercantile license tax ordinance and resolution provided that where, as here, the taxpayer had not been in business during the entire year preceding that for which the tax was imposed, the volume of business on which the tax was to be computed should be twelve times the volume transacted in the taxpayer’s first month of business. Accordingly, the City Treasurer claimed that Keystone’s tax base for the taxable year.should include a sum equal to twelve times $826,961.03; on that amount there would be a tax of $9,935.37, plus interest and penalty of $4,023.82, in the case of the City of Pittsburgh, and $4,967.68, plus interest and penalty of $2,-011.91, in the case of the.

But in cases involving the legality of State <em>taxation </em>the question is not determined by the broad concept of what constitutes interstate commerce when problems of State <em>regulation </em>are concerned; it depends rather on whether there are sufficient local incidents to validate the tax, even though the total activities from which the transaction arises may have incidental interstate attributes: cf. <em>Coverdale v.

The exaction of the tax is for the privilege of doing business in Pittsburgh, of selling there to buyers also located in Pittsburgh. All of the business dealings between Keystone and its buyers — the placing of the purchase orders, their acceptance, and payment — occurred in Pittsburgh. While it is true that delivery took place in New Jersey and that, under the technical provisions of the law governing sales, title presumably passed to Westinghouse and National upon acceptance of the scrap by the smelting company in New Jersey, that fact alone cannot be regarded as controlling or affecting the present question: <em>Norton Company v. Department of Revenue of Illinois, </em><a href="/us/340/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="340 U.S. 534" data-case-ids="6931853" data-case-paths="/us/340/0534-01">340 U. S. 534</a>. The consummation of these entire transactions, with the sole exception of delivery, was within the borders of Pennsylvania. Had the delivery been made to the buyers in Pennsylvania and the goods then transhipped to the smelting plant, there would be no question but that the transactions were subject to the tax, and the mere fact that a shortcut was adopted by which shipment was made direct to the'New Jersey refinery cannot relieve Keystone of its duty to “pay its way” for the privilege of doing business in Pittsburgh. Nor is the tax invalidated by the fact that the tax base is greater by reason of the inclusion therein of the cost of the interstate transportation. “So far as the [contract prices] reflect a value attributable to the [cost of the interstate shipment], we think the burden oh the interstate business is too remote and too attenuated to call for a rigidly logical application of the doctrine that gross receipts from interstate commerce may not be made the measure of á tax”: <em>Western Live Stock v.

S. 33</a>) on this copper scrap material after its delivery within that <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>State had been effected, the subjection of the material to such a tax would be no different than that of all other property within the State, regardless of how it came there. Moreover, even were such a tax imposed it would not be in any way related to the sales transactions between Keystone and its customers upon which the present tax is based.</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[261,733,1158,593]]]'>Keystone contends that it is exempt from payment of the tax on the transactions in controversy because Article 7(g) of the regulations of both the City and School District provide that the taxpayer’s receipts are excluded if the seller agrees to, and does deliver the property to a purchaser at a point outside Pennsylvania. However, when this provision is read in connection with the preceding paragraph of the regulation it is clear that by “purchaser” is there meant one located outside Pennsylvania, and that therefore the provision relied upon has no relevancy to the present case.</p>

The court below relieved it from the payment of such interest and penalty, and the City and the School District appeal from that decision. The question thus raised has been definitely ruled against Keystone in <em>Goldstein v. Pittsburgh School District, </em><a href="/pa/372/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="372 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1238000" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0188-01">372 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.2d%20243" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="93 A.2d 243">93 A. 2d 243</a>, where, notwithstanding that the taxpayer’s omission to pay the mercantile tax due was found by the trial judge to have been in good faith on his part and with no intent to evade proper payment, it was held that interest at the rate of 6% per annum and an addtional penalty of <em>1% </em>a month contained in the mercantile license tax provisions of the City of Pittsburgh and the School District of Pittsburgh were properly assessed against the taxpayer. It is true <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>that in <em>Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. v. Hines, </em><a href="/pa/337/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="337 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1197346" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0048-01">337 Pa. 48</a>, 59, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20A.2d%20553" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="10 A.2d 553">10 A. 2d 553</a>, 558, we said that “harsh penalties or unusual interest rates cannot be imposed, pending litigation intended to test the construction or validity of an act, so as to deter or intimidate parties affected thereby from resorting to the courts for that purpose.” The interest charge in the present instance of 6% per annum is not at an unusual rate, and the penalty of <em>1% </em>per month is not so unduly harsh or sufficient in amount to be calculated to deter or intimidate a party affected thereby from resorting to the courts in order to test the construction or validity of this legislation. We are therefore of opinion that the court below erred in relieving Keystone from the payment of the interest and penalty imposed by the terms of the City ordinance and the resolution of the School District.</p>
