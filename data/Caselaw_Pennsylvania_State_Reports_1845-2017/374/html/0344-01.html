It is clear that testator did not intend to die intestate as to any income, but unquestionably intended his undisposed of income to be paid to the persons in the proportions and for the periods mentioned in Clause G. of his will. Moreover, there is a strong presumption that a testator intends to dispose of his entire estate and not die intestate as to any part of it: <em>Carmany Estate, </em><a href="/pa/357/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="357 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="472086" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0296-01">357 Pa. 296</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20731" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="53 A.2d 731">53 A. 2d 731</a>; <em>Renner Estate, </em><a href="/pa/358/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="358 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="8845630" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0409-01">358 Pa. 409</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20836" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="57 A.2d 836">57 A. 2d 836</a>; <em>Siple v.

C. H. and -E. Our interpretation and conclusion is fortified by the scheme of-the will-and particularly by Clause F. which we shall hereinafter, more fully discuss.</p>

      <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>Testator had, we repeat, three sisters and a brother. In Clause A. he gave his sister Martha %th of the income for life and upon her death the income to her surviving children (the present appellants) until the youngest reached the age of 35 years! These children were not life tenants and the testator clearly intended that when the youngest of the present appellants reached, as she did, 35 years of age, the income from this % share should cease.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[262,856,1155,928]]]'>In Clause B. testator gave l/6th of the income to Martha’s children, the present appellants, each of whom, upon reaching the age of 30, was to receive l/3rd of the principal from which he or she derived the income and when Franklin Tinker reached 35 years of age he was to receive the balance of the principal of this 1/6th share. Furthermore, testator provided in Clause E. that l/12th of the income was to be paid in equal shares to his sisters, Martha and Jennie, and his brother, William, for their respective lives, and the life of the survivor. Under this clause Martha received initially l/36th of the income, and eventually l/12th of the income. It is obvious, therefore, that Martha and her children received under the testator’s will in effect l/4th of the income, plus l/6th of the income, and eventually 1/6th of the principal, plus l/36th, or eventually l/12th, additional income.</p>

Martha and her children were not omitted by mistake, as is evident from the fact that Franklin was added by the codicil of January 6, 1914. The reason why the testator did not intend the present appellants to inherit their mother’s share of the income which the testator had not expressly disposed of is, we believe, obvious, — the testator had already given Martha and her children considerably more of his estate than he had given to any of his other sisters or brother or their descendants.</p>
