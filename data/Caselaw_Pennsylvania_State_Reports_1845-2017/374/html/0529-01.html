L. 230; Act of 1889, P. L. 277; Act of 1913; P. L. 568; Act of 1931, P. L. 932; Act of 1951, P. L. 662.)</p>

The title of the Act of 1889 reads: “An Act-.providing for the incorporation and government of. cities of. the third class.” Under the <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>authority of this Act, the City of Scranton annexed certain adjoining land. <em>(Lackawanna Township, Harris’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/160/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="160 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="852144" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0494-01">160 Pa. 494</a>). Some citizens living on that land appealed, protesting, inter alia, that the Act of 1889 was unconstitutional because its laconic title said nothing about annexation. This Court, in that case, speaking through Mr. Justice Williams, expounded quite interestingly the principle that annexation is an intrinsic right and duty imposed upon municipal corporations by the very exigencies of social progress and governmental orderliness: Justice Williams pointed out the growth of a city may be rapid: “Buildings may extend beyond its lines, and adjoiidng territory may be laid out by extending the city streets over it, and become undistinguishable from the city proper. It then becomes important for the people residing upon this territory, and for the city itself, that sewers, gas and water mains, police and fire protection, be extended over the district which, though separate in law, is physically a part of the city. The people residing on the territory so situated ask the city to take them in, and the city grants their request by an ordinance passed in the usual manner. This is an act that requires no special authority to sustain it. It is in the line of municipal legislation, needful for the proper government of the city, as its expanding proportions and municipal needs outgrow their original limits. The legislature has taken this view of the subject. Immediately after the adoption of the present constitution, the act of 1874, classifying cities and regulating the government of each of the several classes, was passed. ' The only words in its title chat could cover the exercise of the power to. admit ad. joining territory are the. words, that constitute the title to the act of 1889. Yet the act of 1874 contains provisions authorizing the admission of out-lots, and adjoining territory, into cities with which they are con<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>nected physically, and prescribes the mode of procedure to be adopted. It is clear therefore that the legislature did not regard an ordinance admitting adjoining territory into the city as an extraordinary exercise of municipal power that required to be taken notice of in the title of the act of 1874, but as an ordinary exercise of that power, by means of an ordinance, passed and approved in the ordinary way.”</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[255,780,1162,378]]]'>Since the power of annexation is, therefore, a governmental function to be expected in composite legislation dealing with powers of third class cities, it follows that any interested person should be aware that such power would be dealt with in the Acts of 1931 and 1951, which merely reenacted and consolidated the third-class city legislation.</p>

Dale Borough, </em><a href="/pa/272/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="272 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1068390" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0189-01">272 Pa. 189</a>, where we held unconstitutional an amendment to the Third Class City Act of 1913 because it imposed a new mandatory duty on a borough council in connection with city annexation without giving notice thereof in the title: “It (the amendment) attempts, not to regulate what the cities of the third class may do in the matter of increase of limits, but imposes an entirely new obligation upon an independent municipality.” In the instant case, however, no new obligation was imposed on the adjacent municipality. The duties of the township officials with respect to annexation of their land by third-class cities, had been imposed by the Act of May 9,1929, P. L. 1694, entitled: “Providing a method of annexation of boroughs having a population of less than ten thousand inhabitants, townships or parts of townships or outlying-lots, to cities of the third classy providing.for the.addi<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>tion of such territory to adjacent ward or wards of such cities, or for the erection of such territory into a new ward or wards; providing for the regulation of indebtedness and assets of annexed territory; regulating the proceedings pertaining to such annexation; and repealing inconsistent legislation.” It is obvious that the title of this Act gave sufficient notice of its provisions respecting annexation of townships to third-class cities and the regulation of the indebtedness and assets of the annexed territory.</p>
