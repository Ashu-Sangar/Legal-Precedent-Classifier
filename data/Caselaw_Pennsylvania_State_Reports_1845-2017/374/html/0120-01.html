The council of the city, by ordinance, directed the Director of Public Works to enter into contracts for the reconstruction of “Mill Creek Sewer” in Farragut Street within certain specified longitudinal limits. Pursuant to such direction, the Director entered into contracts for the reconstruction of the sewer. In carrying out the work, the contractor excavated Farragut Street to a depth varying from thirty-five to fifty-one feet. The old sewer was removed and a new one of different dimensions was laid. For the removal of rock and other obstacles to the excavation, blasting was used. After the new sewer was laid, the excavation was refilled with earth which was tamped heavily. The <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>work caused a subsidence in tbe appellant’s ground and a loosening, cracking and dislocation of the building erected thereon to its consequent injury.

From that order, the property owner took this appeal.</p>

Article VII, Section IV, of the preceding Constitution of 1838 had provided that “The legislature shall not invest any corporate body or individual with the privilege of taking private property for public use, without requiring such corporation or individual to make compensation to the owners of said property . . .” and Article IX, Section X, declared “nor shall any man’s property be taken or applied to public use . . . without just compensation being made.” The interpretation uniformly given these provisions was to limit them to the requirement of a right of recovery only where there was a taking of property. Unless property was actually taken, there was no liability for its injury or destruction due to a public use not negligently per<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>formed.

In <em>Stork v.

Of course, if the damage is not the immediate and necessary consequence of the municipal undertaking but flows, rather, from some tortious act, the injured party is not entitled to a board of view: <em>Stork v.

In justification of that conclusion, the. opinion for the court below reasons that “. . . the clear implication of the legislature [in the Act of 1891] was to confine action by viewers to cases of sewer construction where there was an original taking by eminent domain . . . .” We have already seen that, since 1874, <em>a taking </em>is not essential to. the enforcement of a claim for damages for municipal injury of private property. Hence, the distinction drawn from the absence of an exercise of eminent domain in connection with the reconstruction of <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>the sewer is irrelevant. A claim for property injury due to municipal <em>reconstruction </em>of a sewer in a public street no more requires <em>a talcing </em>(i.e., an exercise of eminent domain) than does an original <em>construction </em>of such a sewer. Nor is the reconstruction of a sewer to be excluded from the operation of the Act of 1891, supra, on the ground that the Act is to be strictly construed (cf. <em>Locust Street Subway Case, </em>supra) and that, consequently, the word “construction” does not include “reconstruction”. There is a vast difference between a subway, as in the <em>Locust Street </em>case, and a municipal sewer. The two terms and their meanings are readily distinguishable. The fact that the injuries in the <em>Fyfe </em>and <em>Chatham </em>cases, supra, were due to the construction of sewers is but an incident and not a material distinction from the reconstruction in the instant case.</p>
