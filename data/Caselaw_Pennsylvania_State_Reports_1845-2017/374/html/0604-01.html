Those criticisms, however, were apparently not seriously pressed, and, in any event, they do not merit serious discussion. Another complaint urged was that the ordinance does not limit itself to the scope of the usual mercantile license tax because, it is alleged, such taxes have “historically” been imposed only upon merchants, whereas this ordinance purports to tax also persons otherwise engaged. But, whether that fact be true or not, it is certainly wholly irrelevant because the sole question is whether the City has the power to impose the tax upon such “additional” persons and not whether preceding acts or ordinances have included them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Moreover, the ordinance itself provides that if the tax, or any portion thereof, which it imposes shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of any constitutional or statutory provisions, as applied to any person, such decision shall not affect or impair the right to impose the tax, or the validity of the tax so imposed upon other persons as therein provided. <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>Even if, therefore, it should be adjudged that the tax cannot validly be applied to any particular person or persons that would not affect or impair the validity of the ordinance as to those properly subject thereto.

Since clearly, therefore, a mercantile license tax is not a duplication of any of the property taxes paid by appellees to the Commonwealth, the City of Philadelphia is not prohibited by reason of any limitation on its power contained in tlie Sterling Act from imposing such a tax on corporations otherwise subject thereto. Indeed it was definitely so decided in <em>Federal Drug Co. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/358/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="358 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="8845730" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0454-01">358 Pa. 454</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20849" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="57 A.2d 849">57 A. 2d 849</a>, where the mercantile license tax imposed by an ordinance of the City of Pittsburgh was upheld; it was there concisely and categorically stated in an opinion by Mr. Justice Allen M. Stearns, speaking for a unanimous court, that a mercantile license tax did not duplicate or conflict with either the corporate net income tax or the foreign corporation franchise tax. The court below was of the opinion that this holding in tlie <em>Federal Drug </em>case was overruled, or at least impaired, by the decision in the <em>Murray </em>case. Nothing could be further from the truth. The ordinance held invalid, in the <em>Murray </em>case attempted to tax dividends received by persons on shares of stock in corporations paying these various property taxes, and it was held that, since such dividends represented merely a distribution of the net income of the corporation, a tax thereon was a <em>property </em>tax and therefore a duplication of the property <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>taxes paid by the corporation to the Commonwealth. What was held in the <em>Federal Drug </em>case was that, the mercantile license tax <em>not </em>being a property tax, it was <em>not </em>a duplication of the property taxes paid by the corporation. An analysis of the two cases makes this distinction entirely clear and there is not the slightest basis for the contention that they are other than in complete accord.</p>

But these appeals require careful consideration of claims to exemption from the tax imposed by the City ordinance based on another reason than that heretofore discussed, namely, the payment to the Commonwealth of alleged “license fees,” the Sterling Act providing that the council of the city shall not have authority to levy a tax on a privilege, transaction, subject or occupation “which is now or may hereafter become subject to a State tax or <em>license fee.” </em>The City earnestly argues that this prohibition should not be held applicable because, it alleges, the City had the power to impose a mercantile license tax under the wide authority granted it by the Act of August 25, 1864, P. L. 1030, which act, it is claimed, is still in force, and the Sterling Act gave the City no additional power in that respect; it is argued that the limitation contained in the Sterling Act on the City’s authority to tax should be deemed applicable only to those powers given by the Sterling Act which had not previously existed, and therefore not to this mercantile license tax. We cannot subscribe to this proposition. Canned to its logical extreme, it would mean that the city could impose many other taxes even though they duplicated, not merely license fees, but revenue-producing taxes of the Com<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>monwealtli. While it may seem, from a practical standpoint, that the payment of a mere license fee to the Commonwealth ought not to be regarded as sufficient to preclude the City from imposing a mercantile license tax on the State’s licensee, nevertheless the provision in the Sterling Act in that regard is explicit and unambiguous, and it is for the legislature alone to remove this limitation on the City’s power if that body should determine that such action is desirable.</p>

Therefore, even though the charge be labeled a “license fee,” it cannot be regarded as such if, being merely nominal in amount and not apparently equated to the probable cost of supervision and regulation of the licensee’s activities, it presumably was not legislatively intended to provide for such cost.; in such a case it must be considered as merely a registration charge intended to cover clerical costs of the. issuance of the license certificate and general office expenses, and in that event it does not, of course, prevent municipal taxation under the grant of power made in the Sterling Act.</p>

There the Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 587, as amended, is labeled, in part, an act to protect the public health by regulating and licensing the manufacture, handling, storage, sale and possession of meat and meat-food products. It provided for examinations by the Department of Agriculture of all establishments where meat-food products were prepared, stored or sold, or in which slaughtering or meat packing was carried on, and it required persons carrying on such operations to obtain an annual license and pay to the department at the time the application for registration and license was filed an annual fee of $10 for each establishment operated. We held that the fee thus exacted was not a <em>true </em>license fee within the meaning of that term in the “Tax Anything” Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145. We said, pp. 113, 114, A. p. 407: “It would be wholly absurd to suppose that the charge of $10 imposed by the 1945 Act was intended by the legislature to constitute a license fee in the sense thus indicated, especially in view of the tremendous size of the industry involved and the elaborate inspections which its regulation requires.

The charge here in question is wholly different from the license fee thus exacted of the milk dealers, and we are clearly of opinion that the meat-packers are not entitled to exemption from the City of Pittsburgh mercantile license tax merely because of their $10 payments to the Department of Agriculture.”</p>

AWen Tifft et <em>al., </em>appellants in No. 196 January Term 1953, representing themselves, the members of the Insurance Agents and Brokers Association of Philadelphia and Suburbs, and all other insurance agents and brokers, are engaged in the business of insurance agents and brokers and are duly licensed as such under the Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 789, as amended. The title of that act states, inter alia, that it is for the purpose of amending, revising and consolidating the law relating to the licensing and regulation of insurance agents and brokers. It provides for the licensing of both agents and brokers, prohibits certain transactions, misrepresentations and criminal acts on their part, gives the Insurance Commissioner power to examine the books and papers of the agents of any insurance company and, after hearing, to revoke the licenses of agents and brokers for cause. The Act of June 5, 1947, P. L. 445, empowers the Commissioner to examine and investigate the affairs of every person engaged in the business of insurance in order to determine whether such person has been or is engaged in any of the acts, methods and practices prohibited by the act, including unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of such business. The Act of 1921, as amended, imposes a fee of $19 for individual insurance brokers and $25 for licenses in the name of a copartnership or corporation, including individual licenses for any duly qualified individuals without extra charge for officers or solicitors, not exceeding three; and a fee of $2 for an agent’s license for each company.</p>

As the court below pointed out, the fee of $2 for the license of an agent is no more than that charged by the act for the issuance of any kind of a certificate. As the court further stated, the $2 and $10 charges are flat rates entirely unrelated to the. licensees’ volume of business, that-“A license fee cannot be conjured up merely by aggregating a number of registration fees,” and that “Manifestly there is no logical correlation between the number of insurance companies represented by an agent and the volume of business done by that agent.” There is no relationship between the amount of the fee for each agent and the magnitude of his business operations which might require supervision. Nor is the question controlled by the fact that for certain years reported by the Commissioner the receipts in connection with the issuance of licenses to agents and brokers was in excess of the expenditures of the licensing division of the department and the regulation of such licenses. Such statistics will naturally vary each year depending upon the actual amount of regulation which the department may elect to carry on in that year and how much expense it may choose to incur for that purpose, and they throw no light upon whether it was the intention of the legislature in the 1921 Act to exact such charges for the purpose of meeting the cost of regulating the activities of the agents and the brokers. Moreover, while the amount of receipts, even at the rate of $2 and $10 respectively per license, naturally becomes larger as the number of licenses increases, with that increase the need of regulation, of course, increases proportionately; the determining factor is the <em>unit </em>fee imposed. We hold, therefore, that, as the court below correctly determined, the fees specified in the Act of 1921 for insurance brokers and agents are not “true” license fees which exempt them from liability under the City’s mercantile license <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>

L. 217, which made it unlawful for any municipality to impose a license fee upon insurance companies, agents, or brokers, authorized to transact business under the Act of June 1, 1911, P. L. 607. Mercantile license taxes, notwithstanding their appellation, are revenue measures and not “license fees” to cover the cost of the regulation of a business and without payment of which a business may not continue to operate. Moreover, the Act of June 1, 1911, P. L. 607, thus referred to, was repealed by the Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 789, and therefore the provision of the statute relied upon by appellants has no present application.</p>

The title of that act states, inter alia, that it is for the purpose of protecting the public health and regulating the inspection, maintenance and operation of bakeries and premises, stores and shops connected therewith, and the manufacture and sale of bakery products. It provides for the maintenance of clean and sanitary bakeries and for the purity and wholesomeness of bakery products. It gives to the Department of Agriculture permission to inspect bakeries and their operation, to forbid the continuance of any violations of the act, and to suspend or revoke the license issued to the bakery. It exacts an annual fee of $5 for bakeries using less than 100 barrels of flour per week, of $10 for bakeries using 100 barrels and less than 200 barrels of flour per week, and $20 for bakeries using 200 barrels or more of flour per week.</p>

They are subject to the supervision of the Department of Banking of the Commonwealth under the Act of May 15, 1933, P. L. 565, as amended. That Act directs the Department of Banking to examine all such institutions at least once each year including a complete review of their property and the operation of their business, and for that purpose authorizes the Department to examine and investigate their books, papers and affairs. The Department may order them to cease any violation of law or the conduct of their business in an unsafe or unsound manner. Instead of exacting a “license fee” eo nomine, the act provides that all the expenses of the Department of Banking shall be charged to the institutions supervised by the Department in such equitable amounts as <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>the Department shall prescribe. The expenses incurred in connection with any examination or investigation, including a proportionate part of the examiner’s salary and counsel assigned to the examination or investigation, may be assessed by the Department upon the particular institution examined or investigated; these expenses are prorated among the institutions on the basis of their respective total assets as of the end of the preceding year. Accordingly the four Saving Fund Societies, present appellees, pay annually, as their equitable proportions of the expenses of the Department of Banking and the actual cost of the examinations of their institutions, sums running into several thousands of dollars. In this instance, therefore, there can be no doubt but that these Saving Fund Societies do pay substantial fees, the legislative purpose in regard to which may well be assumed to be the defraying of the expense involved in the regulatory activities of the Department of Banking, since they are measured and determined by that expense.

Alden Tifft et al., Insurance Agents and Brokers. The Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 789, as amended, 40 PS 1 et seq., empowers the Insurance Commissioner to examine and investigate the affairs of every person engaged in the business of insurance. Section 211 of that Act, 40 PS 49, imposes a fee of $10. for insurance brokers and $25. for license in the name of a copartnership or corporation, and a fee of $2. for an agent’s license for each company. I disagree with the majority conclusion that because the individual charges are relatively small, this charge is not a “true license fee”. The report of the Insurance Commissioner discloses that in the biennial period of 1949 and 1951 the amount of the agents’ and brokers’ licenses amounted to $836,923.27, while the <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>total of the expenditures of the entire insurance department during that period amounted to $1,147,533.97. Such large figures, to my mind, demonstrate that the gross amount was intended to and did cover almost the entire probable cost of properly regulating the business of such agents and brokers. As stated in the majority opinion: “While it may seem, from a practical standpoint, that the payment of a mere license fee to the Commonwealth ought not to be regarded as sufficient to preclude the City from imposing a mercantile license tax on the State’s licensee, nevertheless the provision in the Sterling Act in that regard is explicit and unambiguous, and it is for the legislature alone to remove this limitation on the City’s power if that body should determine that such action is desirable.” I would reverse the decree of the court below and hold that such insurance agents and brokers are exempted from liability under the ordinance in question.</p>

Such tax is imposed “. . . <em>on persons engaging in certain businesses, including manufacturing, professions, occupations, trades, vocations, and commercial activities. . </em>.”.

The “Tax Anything Act” will then surely be known as the <em>“Tax Everything Act”. </em>If such taxation is thus extended throughout the Commonwealth, there will be a speedy general exodus of business <em>from the Commonwealth. </em>Such tax ordinances and enactments will not prove, I am certain, the anticipated tax “horn of plenty”, but on the contrary will result in the opening of a Pandora’s box releasing economic ills which cannot be recaptured, to the irreparable injury to the City and the Commonwealth.</p>

When the Supreme Court vacillates from one case to another as to whether the corporate net income tax is an excise tax or a property tax, it would seem unreasonable to hold that the legislature was referring to these taxes when it used the words “privilege” or “subject”.</p>

This Court in the very recent case of <em>Murray v. Phila., </em>364 Pa. (1950), without overruling or even discussing the cases which held to the contrary, decided that the corporate net income tax is a “property” tax; and that the Philadelphia Ordinance which <em>imposed, openly and without subterfuge, income taxes </em>on various persons and corporations in Philadelphia was <em>invalid </em>because it was prohibited by the Sterling Act. This Court could reach such a conclusion only by looking below the surface into the “realities”. Looking at the realities, this Court squarely decided, inter alia, that under the Sterling Act the City of <em>Philadelphia has no power (a) to tax the income of a domestic corporation </em>which pays a capital stock tax or a corporate net income tax to the state; or (b) to tax the income of a foreign corporation which pays a franchise tax to the state, because a franchise tax is the equivalent of a capital stock tax for domestic corporations; or (c) to tax the net income of a credit union; or (d) even to tax a dividend in the hands of a shareholder which was received from a corporation which pays corporate net income taxes to the state; or which was received from a foreign corporation which pays a franchise tax to the state, or which was received from a state bank or a national bank; and (e) has no power to tax income from bonds in the hands of a bondholder which was received from a corporation which pays a corporate loans tax to the state; and (f) has no power to tax income from real estate.</p>
