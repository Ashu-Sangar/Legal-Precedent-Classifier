The Mellon National Bank and Trust Company purchased substantially all of the assets of the Citizens National Bank including its bank building, and assumed its deposit liabilities. Pursuant to the purchase agreement the Mellon Bank was appointed by the Orphans’ Court of Washington County successor-fiduciary in a majority of the trusts of which the Citizens Bank had been trustee. The Mellon Bank took possession of the assets of these trust estates, including the presently taxable securities, and they were thereafter, held in the-vaults, or- offices of the Mellon Bank at its Union Trust office in the City of Pittsburgh.

Section 2 of the Act of June 17, 1913, provided, prior to the amendment of May 20, 1949, with respect to a Personal Property Tax imposed upon securities constituting part of the principal of a trust estate as follows: “Provided, That any corporation, joint-stock association, or limited partnership, doing business in more than one county, shall be liable to make such return <em>only </em>in the county <em>in which its principal office</em>

      <em> </em>within this Commonwealth is situated, . . . .” There is no doubt that the principal office of the Mellon National Bank is situated in Allegheny County and under the facts in this case it is clear that the Personal Property Tax return is to be made only in, and the tax is payable only to, Allegheny County. The fact that the Orphans’ Court of Washington County still has jurisdiction and supervision over these trust estates is immaterial — that is not the test prescribed by the Act. <em>Griscom’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/333/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="333 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1187953" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0186-01">333 Pa. 186</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20693" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 A.2d 693">3 A. 2d 693</a> rules the instant case on this point. In <em>Griscom’s Estate </em>the corporate trustee’s principal office was located in Philadelphia; the co-trustees lived in surrounding counties; the trust assets were kept in Philadelphia County. The Court held that the Personal Property Tax was payable to Philadelphia County and said (p. 190-191) : “. . . the trustees keep and maintain the trust property and perform their duties as trustees in Philadelphia County, the domicile of the corporate trustee. The property is therefore taxable here and not in any other county where no part of it is maintained.”</p>
