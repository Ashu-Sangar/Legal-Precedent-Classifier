This conclusion or rule is supported not only by the aforesaid common law rule which prohibits the joinder or conviction of a misdemeanor in an indictment for murder or voluntary manslaughter, as Avell as by prior opinions of this Court, but also in our judgment by reasons which are sound, practical and Avise. If there could be a conviction of assault and battery on a murder bill the trial Judge would always have to charge the jury on first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and, certainly if requested, on aggravated assault and .battery and simple assault and battery. This has never been done in the history of the. Commonwealth. When we take into consideration the additional points the trial Judge must define in a murder case, such as presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt, and usually several others (depending upon the particular facts of that particular case) the jury Avould likely become sd befogged by legal' technicalities and so confused by the mazé of the law as to make a clear comprehension, weighing, and' correlation 'of the facts exceedingly difficult, and the rendition of a just, verdict both ...difficult-and doubtful.. Furthermore,: the likelihood-of á “murderer’-’ escaping his just <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>punishment and being found guilty of aggravated assault and battery or simple assault and battery instead of one of the degrees of murder or manslaughter of which he was actually guilty would be greatly increased to the detriment of society. Although some other states have reached a different conclusion, and although dicta may be found in some appellate court decisions in this State which create some doubt or confusion on the points we have hereinabove discussed, we are convinced that in the best interest and protection of the public the aforesaid common law rule and the long established practice in this Commonwealth should not be departed from or abrogated in cases of felonious homicide. For each and all of these reasons the Commonwealth’s demurrer to the plea of autrefois acquit on the murder indictment was properly sustained.</p>

The answer to the aggravated assault and battery and except in rare cases to the assault and battery is “no”. Is the present case one of the rare exceptions? Involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault and battery, and simple assault and battery are criminal offenses which, as we have noted, have acquired a technical meaning and therefore the legal questions here involved must be considered and decided on the basis of the legal meaning of the crimes charged and the applicable principles of law. One thing, at least, is clear at the outset — neither the common law rule which prohibits the conviction of a misdemeanor on a felony bill, nor the practical reasons applicable in the trial of a murder in<a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>dietment are applicable to a determination of this second question.</p>

Commonwealth, </em>114 Pa., supra, the Court said (p. 380): “It is very evident the plaintiff can never be tried again upon any charge of which he might have been convicted upon the first indictment. . . But the protection extends no further than the offence charged in the first indictment, <em>or of which he might have been convicted, under it. </em>He was not in jeopardy for any other offence.”</p>
    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[149,1562,1148,821]]]'>Applying these principles and tests to the instant case, the Commonwealth admits (1) that it based its indictment and trial of defendant in the involuntary manslaughter bill upon an intentional assault and battery by defendant upon Madden; and that it has based and tried the present indictments upon the same acts of violence by defendant against Madden as were relied upon in the bill charging defendant with involuntary manslaughter of Madden. It therefore clearly <em>appears from the record </em>that the assault and battery was <em>both factually and legally </em>a necessarily constituent part of the offense of involuntary manslaughter for which defendant was indicted and acquitted, and on which he could ha.ve been convicted of assault and battery: <em>Com. v. Russin, </em>171 Pa. Superior Ct., supra.</p>

      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>In tlxe trial of the indictment for involuntary manslaughter the Court did not charge the jury that it could find defendant guilty of assault and battery, nor was such charge requested by the defendant or by the Commonwealth. Moreover, it is a well known fact that an experienced trial Judge rarely, if ever, charges on or discusses the offense of assault and battery in a trial on an involuntary manslaughter bill. Obviously, therefore, the jury as a practical matter, did not, at the trial of Comber for involuntary manslaughter, pass upon or acquit Comber of the offense of assault and battery, although that might be the legal effect of its verdict of acquittal of the charge of involuntary manslaughter.</p>

The plea of autrefois acquit and the motion for arrest of judgment should have been sustained.</p>
