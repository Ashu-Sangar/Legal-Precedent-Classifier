Three questions arise: (1) Was the testamentary paper dated October 14,1944 and probated as a codicil although not denominated as such, a last will as required by the Annie Windolph Deed of Trust; (2) Was it a <em>specific </em>execution of the power of appointment given to Shafer under the Annie Windolph Deed of <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>Trust; and (3) Did it have to be witnessed by two witnesses, which was the requirement of the law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> and the test of validity at the time of the creation of the power of appointment in 1909, or did that Deed of Trust authorize a specific appointment (by the surviving life tenant) under a last will which was valid at the time of the life tenant’s death, when the requirement of two witnesses to validate a charitable gift had been repealed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">**</a>

    <p id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[170,853,1147,1096]]]'>There is no doubt that the power of appointment given to Shafer (as survivor) in and by the Annie Windolph Deed of Trust was a special or limited power of appointment as distinguished from a general power of appointment; and any appointment to be valid had to be exercised in conformity with the specific requirements prescribed in and by that Deed of Trust, namely, to such educational or other eleemosynary institution or charity as the survivor shall have by <em>Ms last will specifically </em>appointed. The requirement of a specific appointment was not loosely used — it was several times repeated in the Annie Windolph Deed of Trust. Therefore, unless Zachary Taylor Shafer specifically appointed the share in question and did so in conformity with the requirements of that Deed, the appointment cannot take effect. As this Court said in <em>Wickersham v.

An exception has been grafted upon and become a part of the rule, namely, where the instrument of execution would have no operation except as an execution of the power, and there is neither equivocation or uncertainty with respect to the intention to execute it or the property to which it refers, the appointment will be effective. In <em>Hupp v.

It may appear by express terms, recitals or necessary implication. It was early held that the intention to execute the power must be so clearly manifested in the act of execution that it is impossible to impute any other (Andrews v. Emmot, 2 Bro. C. C. 297, 29 Repr. 162; Doe D. Nowell v. Roake, 2 Bing. 497, 130 Repr. 398, reversed, 5 B. &amp; C. 721, 108 Repr. 268, which was affirmed 6 Bing. 475, 130 Repr. 1364), and this intention should appear in the instrument: Bingham’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="64 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1021217" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0345-01">64 Pa. 345</a>, 349. A classification was then made whereby the intention to execute was said to be clearly manifested: (1) By a reference to the power in the executing instrument. (2) By a reference to the property on which the power was to operate. (3) Where the instrument of execution would have no operation except as an execution of the power: Wetherill v.

For 33 years Shafer had been receiving income (a) from the Girard Trust Company, trustee of the Annie Windolph Trust, and (b) from the Girard Trust Company, trustee under the Elizabeth Gravell Deed of Trust. Shafer had a power of appointment under the Annie Windolph Deed but none under the Elizabeth Gravell Deed. It is nothing but a guess or conjecture whether Shafer thought he had a power of appointment under the Elizabeth Gravell Deed of Trust and was attempting, as he specifically and clearly said, to exercise such power; or whether, contrary to what he said, he was attempting to exercise the power under the Annie Windolph Trust. The record does not disclose the amount of principal of the Gravell Trust. For all anyone knows, Shafer may have had no intention of giving the Annie Windolph trust principal to John Brown University — certainly there is no specific reference thereto and certainly <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>there is no specific exercise by Shafer of the power of appointment which he possessed under that Deed. In other words, it is impossible to do anything but conjecture and guess as to whether Shafer intended, although mistakenly, to appoint the corpus of the Elizabeth Gravell trust to John Brown University, which he specifically said he did, or whether he intended to appoint the Annie Windolph trust corpus to John Brown University, although he never said so. In such a situation we are compelled to hold that there was no specific exercise by Shafer of the power of appointment given him in and by the Annie Windolph Deed of Trust.</p>
