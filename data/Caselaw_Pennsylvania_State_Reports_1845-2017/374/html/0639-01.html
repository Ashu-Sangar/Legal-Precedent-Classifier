The quantum of the damages was later fixed by the court after a hearing in the sum of $21,474.16. The plaintiff issued an attachment-execution on the judgment, summoning as garnishee Indemnity Insurance Company of North America, the insurer in a policy issued to the owner covering operation of the airplane. The garnishee pleaded nulla bona, claiming that the policy did not cover the accident because it was not to apply “while any aircraft of the assured is operated in violation of Federal regulations for civil aviation applicable, <em>inter alia, </em>to minimum safe altitudes, and the accident in this case was caused by low flying in violation of said regulations as set forth in the complaint of the plaintiff, upon the basis of which judgment in this case was obtained.” One of the specific averments of negligence contained in the plaintiff’s complaint was that Piechoski was flying the plane at the time of the accident at an altitude of less than 500 feet in violation of the regulations.</p>

The pilot testified: “We took off and we headed into the direction of her neighborhood, and as we flew, naturally you climb it, and I stood at the height of 1300 feet. As I arrived around the vicinity of the accident, I made a, left turn. As I made this turn, I went into a spin. When I was making this— while I was in this spin, your natural thing is to lower the motor as much as you can so you don’t fall as fast. I did that, and while I was pulling out the motor went dead.

There is nothing extraordinary about that. The airplane was falling! Naturally it would be getting closer to the ground all the time. Intentionally or unintentionally, that’s the way every airplane finally completes its flight. Even counsel for the garnishee, in cross-examining the pilot, had to admit that the plane was coming down to the ground: “Q. You were <em>falling </em>pretty much straight down; is that right? A.

How can their testimony in strict English be considered as disputing what Piechoski said, namely, that he started ■to fall from the height of 1300 feet? The testimony of Richard J. Rentz confirms Piechoski: “Q. What if anything did you see about an airplane that day? A.

Neither should it ordinarily be granted on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence where the evidence is conflicting and the jury might have found for either party.” But it did not apply the wisdom of that decision to this case because, it said, “there is evidence in the form of sworn averments in the plaintiff’s complaint in the trespass action that Piechoski was flying below a 500-foot altitude at the time of and immediately preceding <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>the accident.” There are many reasons why this position is not tenable:</p>
    <p id="b682-4" data-blocks='[["BL_682.4",682,[233,455,1150,90]]]'>(1) A statement in a Complaint is not per se evidence.</p>
    <p id="b682-5" data-blocks='[["BL_682.5",682,[234,566,1151,90]]]'>(2) PiechosM was not a party to the Complaint and is not to be held to what is contained in it.</p>
    <p id="b682-6" data-blocks='[["BL_682.6",682,[232,677,1153,319]]]'>(3) It is common knowledge that Complaints contain many averments of negligence, some superfluous and some contradictory to one another. It is not necessary that the plaintiff prove everyone of the averments. It is sufficient that he prove one item of negligence responsible for the accident.</p>
    <p id="b682-7" data-blocks='[["BL_682.7",682,[231,1008,1155,698]]]'>(4) In <em>Srednick v. Sylak, </em><a href="/pa/343/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="343 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1208393" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0486-01">343 Pa. 486</a>, we said: “The general rule is that admissions of fact in pleadings are admissible, but the pleader’s conclusions of law are not admissions of facts in issue. Whether an allegation is of fact or law is determined by the context disclosing the circumstances and purpose of the allegation. In perhaps the broad sense, the statement that a party is liable to another is a statement of fact, but the same words are in general use as a statement of law, and when intended to be so used the statement may not be treated as an admission of fact.” To aver violation of a law is a conclusion of law and therefore not admissible as an item of evidence.</p>
    <p id="b682-8" data-blocks='[["BL_682.8",682,[232,1725,1154,378]]]'>(5) In the original suit the issue was that of defendant’s liability to the plaintiff for negligence; but in the garnishment proceedings the issue was whether ■the insurance policy covered the risk in the particular circumstances. Thus, any admission in the original complaint in trespass cannot conclusively bind the plaintiff in the garnishment proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b682-9" data-blocks='[["BL_682.9",682,[233,2111,1154,212]],["BL_683.1",683,[176,337,1144,97]]]'>(6) The doctrine of estoppel by admission is applicable only if the fact essential to judgment is actually litigated and judicially adjudicated. But the fact in question was not litigated, because judgment was en<a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>tered in the plaintiff’s favor because of want of an appearance or answer.</p>
    <p id="b683-3" data-blocks='[["BL_683.4",683,[178,448,1149,653]]]'>(7) The plaintiff is the administrator of the estate of the deceased Rosella Devlin and has no personal knowledge of the facts. Thus, any averment of fact cannot bind him: “We are of opinion that the averment of such an admission is insufficient as a pleading and of <em>no value as evidence, </em>for it is well settled that an admission made by an executor or administrator with respect to matters of which he has no firsthand knowledge, as for instance the existence of an indebtedness by the decedent in his lifetime, cannot be received in evidence.” <em>(Compton v. Heilman, </em><a href="/pa/331/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="331 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1184264" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0545-01">331 Pa. 545</a>, 549.)</p>

There was very little dispute, if any, as to the actual facts. The only dispute was as to the inferences to be drawn from the facts. It was uncontested that Piechoski was a trained pilot, that he had no reason to want to be careless since not only the life of his friend but his own was at stake, that something happened to the engine of the airplane, and that he crashed to the ground. The testimony of the six witnesses for the garnishee seems to have troubled the trial judge, but it didn’t need to. There was only one issue. When these witnesses saw the airplane at the varying heights they testified to, was the airplane <em>flying </em>or falling? The jury decided that the aircraft was falling. And with that ascertainment of fact the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The Judge put this very issue squarely to the jury: “If a person for some reason has a misfortune in the air, and it is uncontrollable, and because of the lack of control that he has over the mechanism of the aircraft it goes below a thousand feet, then, in that <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>event, I will say to you as a matter of law that <em>that is not a violation. </em>A violation is one concerning which one would have knowledge and continue to do it in the face of the regulations.”</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[249,555,1153,488]]]'>The Judge put this issue squarely to them again in affirmance of the plaintiff’s Point No. 17, which read: “. . . if the jury finds that Joseph Pieehoski was operating the aircraft in violation of Federal regulations for civil aviation applicable to minimum safe distances, but that <em>such violation toas due to circumstances beyond his control, </em>their verdict must be <em>for the plaintiff, </em>James Devlin, administrator of the estate of Rosella Devlin, deceased.”</p>
    <p id="b684-5" data-blocks='[["BL_684.5",684,[249,1052,1155,485]]]'>The same issue was submitted to the jury through the affirmance of Defendant’s Point No. 21: “If you find that the aircraft in which Rosella Devlin was riding when she received the injuries which caused her death was operated with the consent and knowledge of the defendant, Joseph Pieehoski, <em>below an altitude of 1000 feet </em>above the highest object in the immediate vicinity of the crash immediately prior to the crash, your verdict must be <em>in favor of the </em>garnishee.”</p>
    <p id="b684-6" data-blocks='[["BL_684.6",684,[249,1549,1152,319]]]'>What more can a jury do in another trial? It can only decide whether Pieehoski purposely navigated below the 1,000 foot level or whether he got into that stratum of peril for reasons entirely beyond his control — and a jury, duly selected and duly instructed has definitively decided that issue.</p>
    <p id="b684-7" data-blocks='[["BL_684.7",684,[249,1880,1154,429]],["BL_685.1",685,[197,327,1145,146]]]'>The jury also passed on the matter of the endorsement'of the policy which was put to them as a question, through the affirmance of the Plaintiff’s Point No. 16, as follows: “... even if the jury believes that the endorsement to clause (e) under “Exclusions’ was in effect on August 28, 1949, if they find that Joseph Pieehoski was .not. violating, the Federal regulations for.ciyil aviation, applicable .to minimum safe altitudes, <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>their verdict must be for the plaintiff, James Devlin, administrator of the estate of Rosella Devlin, deceased.”</p>
    <p id="b685-3" data-blocks='[["BL_685.4",685,[195,494,1151,422]]]'>A reading of the record shows that this case was vigorously and most competently tried by very able and resourceful counsel. The trial was presided over by a very able and experienced judge. No reversible error occurred throughout the entire length of the long proceedings. I would let the conscientious and just verdict — which was the fruit of all these endeavors — ■ remain as if is.</p>
