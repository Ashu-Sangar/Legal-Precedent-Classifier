As a result of this telephone call, he had an interview that same day with two of defendant’s officers, Zuckerman and Sanger. As a result of this interview, plaintiff and Sanger and Zuckerman went to the New Holland Metals Co. Plaintiff introduced them to Holland’s purchasing agent and defendant thereafter entered into a contract with Holland to supply it with aluminum scrap. Accordingly defendant bought overseas, mostly in Europe, 7 million odd pounds of aluminum scrap which it sold and delivered to Holland. On these sales it paid plaintiff for his services in bringing the parties together a commission of % of a cent per pound or $2.50 a ton, or a total of $9,088.44.</p>

During the third week of July, 1948, the defendant <em>fraudulently represented </em>to the plaintiff that the commission which they, the defendants, were receiving from New Holland Metals Co. had been cut in half. 5. <em>Based on the aforesaid fraudulent inducement and representation, </em>the plaintiff agreed to reduce the commission to be paid to him to the amount of Two and 50/100 ($2.50) Dollars per ton.” Plaintiff then averred that upon discovery of the fraud he became entitled to commissions at the rate of $5 per ton. Defendant denied the agreement to pay $5 a ton and on the contrary averred that the commission agreed upon always was $2.50 a ton on aluminum scrap sold by it to Holland; and denied that it ever told plaintiff its commissions had been changed or cut or reduced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>

He never made any claim for additional commissions because “it would be useless to talk to them about it.” Nevertheless, having run out of money, (5) he went to see Mr. Sanger late in November, <em>19J¡9 </em>and asked him for approximately $80 which defendant had erroneously deducted from his wages for withholding taxes. He testified that at this interview he told Sanger he owed defendant some money for some calking lead which thej had sold him on credit ($87), but that he couldn’t pay it now. However, he persuaded Sanger to give him $37 or $50 to enable him to take a trip to Indiana on his personal business, and to deduct it from the $80 withholding taxes, and credit the balance on the $87 which plaintiff owed them.
