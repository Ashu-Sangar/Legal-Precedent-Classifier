At the outset, it is to be noted that the record does not sustain his position in this regard. The payroll clerk of the plaintiff’s employer did testify that he had lost wages of $1690.93, but it was not established that the days lost, except for some 57 days, were the result of the accident. In addition, he was in another accident in November, 1950, after which he was off work for 12 days. The loss-of-car item was his own estimate of depreciation resulting from the collision, based on his own estimates of its value before and after.

No mere difference of opinion, nothing short of a clear conviction, compelled by the evidence, that the jury must have been influenced by partiality, passion or prejudice or by some misconception of the law or the evidence, will justify an appellate court in declaring that the trial court was guilty of an abuse of discretion in refusing a new trial for inadequacy of damages where neither the evidence in the particular case nor the law applicable thereto furnished any definite standard by which they might be measured, and the jury had no other guide in arriving at the amount to be awarded but pure conjecture.’ ”: <em>Coleman v.

We there stated: “In the instant case, the court en banc in an opinion written by the learned trial judge, who saw and heard the plaintiff and his witnesses, both lay and medical, after a careful review of the evidence as to damages and the conflicts. therein, concluded that it could not properly disturb the jury’s finding. The grant or refusal of a new trial for inadequacy of the verdict is a matter for the sound discretion of the trial court whose action will not be reversed on appeal except for a clear abuse of discretion such as where a new trial is refused when the verdict is so unreasonably low as to present a clear case of injustice.”</p>

None of the jurors talked to her beyond what has been noted, but immediately reported the incident to the court. The trial judge, in chambers and in the presence of both counsel, ascertained the facts through his own questioning and that of plaintiff’s counsel, determined that they would not be prejudiced, was told by the jurors that they would not be, and after cautioning the jurors to say nothing to the other jurors, refused plaintiff’s motion for withdrawal of a juror and continuance. He then examined the plaintiff’s wife alone, advised her that she “might very easily be guilty of a criminal offense,” but that he did not believe she intended any wrong, and excused her with the admonition that she refrain from talking to the jurors.</p>

He also complains that the court instructed the jury that it could decide whether plaintiff lost any wages from the accident occurring in November, 1950.

It may well be that plaintiff might have required the production of the doctor making the report. But not having done so, — particularly since the witness examined was the physician to whom plaintiff was referred, with whom the reporting doctor collaborated, and who had the information as his own, — we cannot let him stand by, take his chances on the verdict, and then reverse on such ground after he finds the verdict was not to his liking.</p>
