    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[181,564,1147,931]]]'>Thomas McMullen, a single man, died August 1, 1945, having made this contested will on February 9, 1945. Two questions were submitted to a jury for determination: (1), did McMullen on February 9, 1945 have testamentary capacity, and (2) was his will obtained by undue influence? The first jury was unable to agree whether McMullen had testamentary capacity, but found that his will was not obtained by undue influence. On a retrial the jury found that McMullen did not have testamentary capacity to make and execute a valid will on February 9, 1945, and that the will was obtained by undue influence practiced upon McMullen by his nephew, Bussell Williams. The Chancellor who saw and heard the witnesses entered judgment non obstante veredicto. The testimony exceeded 1,000 pages, so it will be necessary for us to briefly summarize what we consider to be most important.</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.8",315,[182,1508,1149,530]]]'>The will (or alleged will) gave his sister Margaret, with whom he had lived for 60 years, all his property for life with power of consumption for support and welfare; and upon her death the property remaining was given to Margaret’s son, Bussell Williams, except for 3 legacies of fl,000 each. Bussell Williams lived with his mother and Thomas McMullen and was the latter’s frequent companion; the contestants rarely ever saw their uncle and were not on friendly terms with him.</p>

Contestants then produced 7 witnesses, all of whom were interested, who testified that decedent was of unsound mind and incapable of making a will. Most of them had not seen <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>décedent for two years prior to the will but they testified that he acted funny, mumbled, rambled, was incoherent, had peculiarities, had a blank look on his face, did not recognize them, suffered from loss of memory, and did a number of things which a rational man would never have done. Several additional witnesses corroborated them in small details. Two doctors who saw testator five months after he made his will testified that he was in their opinion incapable of making a will, since he was suffering from senile dementia caused by arteriosclerosis. However, it was admitted that it was possible for a person with that disease to have lucid intervals, and the testimony of the doctors was considerably shaken on cross-examination. Another witness for contestants, Judge McCready, expressed the opinion that during 1943 a guardian should have been appointed for McMullen. He further testified that in his opinion McMullen was mentally ill; but he had no knowledge of deceased’s mental capacity during February, 1945, and was unable to say whether McMullen was qualified to make a will at that time.</p>

Most of these witnesses including the family doctor and decedent’s attorney were disinterested witnesses, and the lengthy testimony of the attorney was especially strong and convincing. From a reading of the Court’s opinion it appears to us that he believed plaintiff and his witnesses and doubted or was unimpressed by defendants’ interested witnesses and doctors.</p>

We have quoted the contested document above with the foregoing principles in mind, and we at first observe that Mr. Hollar and Mr. Frantz, the subscribing witnesses, were both disinterested in the outcome of this controversy, and in no way related to any of the parties. <em>We also note that the document was prepared by the decedent’s own attorney, </em>in the attorney’s office, and that <em>the decedent’s own physician at the time of the execution of the document issued a certificate, certifying that the decedent had the mental capacity to execute a will. </em>It is announced in all of the late cases in Pennsylvania that we have examined, that less capacity is required to make a valid will than is sufficient in most cases to transact ordinary business, and that <em>the capacity of the testator at the time of the execution of the ivill </em>is the decisive and focal point of the inquiry.

The testimony further shows that Russell Williams, after the deceased’s retirement, befriended his uncle and gave all his time and talents for his uncle’s comfort. He drove him to various doctor’s offices for treatment of his physical ailments; he took care of his clothing needs, and it appears that the decedent was always an immaculate dresser.</blockquote>
