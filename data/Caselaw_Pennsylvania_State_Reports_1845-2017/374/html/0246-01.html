Mr. Mitchell, the executor, a reputable member of the bar of Philadelphia county, was the scrivener of the will. He was permitted to testify to his conversations with the testatrix leading to the preparation of her will. This testimony was admitted over the objection of the appellants, who contended that the will was clear and unambiguous and not subject to oral explanation. We agree with this contention of appellants and would exclude the testimony if it were offered only as explanation of the will: <em>Mizener’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/262/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="262 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1044387" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0062-01">262 Pa. 62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.%2046" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="105 A. 46">105 A. 46</a>; <em>Prime’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/335/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="335 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1193012" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0218-01">335 Pa. 218</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20530" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="6 A.2d 530">6 A. 2d 530</a>. But, as above stated, the creator of a tentative trust has power to revoke it by oral declarations, and the testimony of testatrix’s attorney was clearly admissible to show her intention that the trust be revoked, entirely apart from any question of interpretation of the written will. Testatrix told Mr. Mitchell that her sister Martha was the prime object of her bounty, that Martha was sole beneficiary under an earlier will but was now “.. . infirm mentally and physically . . . can’t look after things for herself, and somebody will have to look after her in case I go first”. She approved the attorney’s suggestion of a trust for maintenance and. support with power to in<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>vade principal and discussed with him, without reaching any definite conclusion, the Catholic charities to whom she would bequeath the remainder. According to Mr. Mitchell’s testimony, she then described the property which would be the subject of this trust as followswe have some stocks and we own the property we live in at 1805 Wylie Street,’ and she said, ‘my money is on deposit at the Beneficial Saving Fund Society.’ ” It is undisputed that the only money which testatrix had on deposit at that bank was the tentative trust fund in question. Unless she was referring to that fund when she spoke of her money on deposit at the Beneficial, her words were meaningless. Hence this conversation with the scrivener constitutes a clear declaration by the decedent of her desire to revoke the tentative trust and with that money make more appropriate arrangements for the care of her failing sister.</p>

It requires no legal or financial expert to conclude that after payment of her own debts and funeral ■and administration expenses, her assets other than the savings account in dispute would be pitifully inadequate for the establishment of a trust for. maintenance and support. It would be ascribing extraordinarily poor judgment to testatrix to suppose that she went <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>to the trouble of creating an elaborate testamentary trust for the relatively small assets she possessed outside the savings account and yet intended the fund which comprised the bulk of her estate to go to the sister absolutely. This account contained $34,356.30.</p>
    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[193,617,1148,930]]]'>Appellants also argue that, because the parties lived together sharing all expenses, had reciprocal wills and reciprocal tentative trusts with common possession of the pass books, the trusts which they created were irrevocable. The master and the court below found these circumstances inadequate to justify an inference that the sisters intended to make their trusts irrevocable. We are entirely in accord with this conclusion. We recently had occasion to discuss the quantum of evidence necessary to establish that a settlor intended to impart a quality of irrevocability to a tentative trust: <em>Ingels Estate, </em><a href="/pa/372/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="372 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1238071" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0171-01">372 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.2d%20881" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="92 A.2d 881">92 A. 2d 881</a>. The circumstantial evidence here present falls far short of the standard we there established; viz., “ ‘clear and unambiguous language or conduct’ indicating that [settlor] intended to make the tentative trust irrevocable.” (p. 177)</p>
    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[194,1561,1147,364]]]'>This tentative trust was revoked by testatrix in her lifetime by her oral declarations. But in any event the decedent by her will by establishing a testamentary scheme whereunder her assets would have been wholly inadequate, likewise disclosed an unequivocal intent of such revocation since her scheme failed unless the trust fund was included.</p>
