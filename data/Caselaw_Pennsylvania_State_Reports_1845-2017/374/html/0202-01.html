It was a very hot night and Druding asked the attendant whether he could take a swim. After the attendant told him that he could, plaintiff checked his valuables and then took a cold shower for about 5 minutes. The pool was 80 feet long and 30 feet wide. Plaintiff, according to his own testimony — and of course on a question of judgment n.o.v. he must be given the benefit of all testimony favorable to him and all reasonable inferences therefrom: <em>McDonald v.

The water was a greenish color — his witnesses said “dark greenish color, just ordinary city water” — and there were “a lot of fellows in there, jumping in and jumping out” “and playing tag in the water.” Plaintiff <em>looked </em>before he dove “to see that no one was in front of me” and hit his head and broke his neck on the bottom of the pool. He testified that the water at that point was about <em>3y2 </em>feet below the edge of the pool and was only 2 feet deep. The water came up to the knee or below the knee. The lifeguard was draining the pool that evening, although about 65 to 100 people were still using it. No sign or warning was given to persons that the pool was being drained. Plaintiff had not been in a swimming pool for approximately 26 years.</p>

If Thomas Druding had walked into the Kecreation Center, removed his outer clothing and, without inquiring of anyone, dived into the pool, it could be said that in the process he had disrobed himself of the garment of prudence and therefore could not legally complain of the injuries induced by his own precipitate and heedless action. But the record shows that he exercised reason <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>and care in anticipation of his swim: “Q. Tell us what happened when you got to the pool? A. I went to the door and I asked the man if I could take a swim. Q. What man? A. The attendant. Q. What did he say? A. He said, ‘Yes, sure.’ He says, ‘You got trunks?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Well, you got shorts?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Well, that’s o.k. Go ahead in.’ Q. You went in? A. Yes. Q. What happened after you got inside the Recreation Center? A. I went to the locker. He told me, he said I could take any locker that the door was open and it was empty. So when I came out, he said, ‘You got any money or any valuables?’ I said ‘Sure.’ So then he said, ‘You better let me hold it for you, because you’re liable to get clipped.’ Q. That was the same attendant? A. Yes, the same fellow that let me in the door. Q. You checked your money with him? A. That is right. Then he said, ‘You got to go under the shower before you go in the pool.’ Q. Did you go in the shower? A. Yes, I was under the shower maybe five minutes or so.”</p>

When he emerged from the showers he walked some 8 or 10 feet toward the end marked “Deep End,” which brought him within 15 feet of the extremity of the pool on the deep side and 65 feet from the extremity which was the shallow end. No one was standing in the water at the spot he mentally aimed at in his prospective dive so that he could not tell by the high water mark on anybody’s body that the water at that point was only 2 feet deep. He raised his hands above his head in the approved orthodox diving position and sprang forward into the water which, because of its dark green color, concealed the nearness of the concrete floor beneath.</p>

With one hour and 10 <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>minutes still remaining of bathing time, the defendant’s agent proceeded to dismantle the pool by emptying it.

A life guard standing by saw the plaintiff prepare to dive in and made no effort to stop him or warn him of the danger of a broken neck by plunging head foremost to a concrete floor covered by a mere two feet of yielding liquid.</p>
