Wiegand, individually as a citizen of the County of Montgomery, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and as editorial writer for The Philadelphia Inquirer Division of Triangle Publications, Inc., with the consent of the Attorney General, filed a bill in equity against The Barnes Foundation and the individual defendants who comprise its officers and trustees, averring that the latter were not carrying out the purposes for which the Foundation was incorporated as a corporation of the first class. The defendants filed an answer raising a number of preliminary objections to the bill, two of which the lower court, composed of four judges sitting en banc, sustained, and entered a final decree dismissing the bill. From this decree the plaintiff has appealed.</p>

Barnes, now deceased, was the progenitor of The Barnes Foundation, and following the grant of its charter on December 4, 1922, by indenture and agreement dated December 6, 1922, conveyed to the Foundation certain real estate on which was erected a large art gallery and other buildings, and transferred and delivered to the Foundation his valuable and outstanding collection of works of art consisting, inter alia, of hundreds of paintings, drawings, etchings and lithographs. In addition, he gave to the Foundation large sums of money and securities. The indenture and agreement contained conditions and stipulations under which the donation was made and received by the corporation, and as provided therein, was made a part of the by-laws of the corporation. The primary purpose of the incorporation, as set forth in the Foundation’s charter, was “to promote the advancement of education and the appreciation of the fine arts.”.</p>

The reason is, that if one individual may interpose, any other may, and as the decision in one individual case would be no bar to any other, there would be no end to litigation and strife. The general laws of order so necessary to good government forbid anything like this.”. As a matter of public policy we see no reason for departing from this sound concept. No cases have been cited by appellant in this or any other jurisdiction of contrary import.</p>

Comment d reads: “A suit for the enforcement of a charitable trust cannot be maintained by persons who have no special interest in the enforcement of the trust. The mere fact that as members of the public they benefit from the enforcement of the trust is not a sufficient ground to entitle them to sue, since a suit on their behalf can be maintained by the Attorney General.”.</p>

L. 328, as amended by the Act of May 23, 1895, P. L. 114, §1, 10 PS §13. The provisions referred to in all of the Acts mentioned have tó do with the application of the cy pres doctrine. Under the Act of 1855, as amended by the Act of 1895, it was required that proceedings be instituted “by leave of the Attor<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>ney General”.

The taxing authorities resisted the exemption, contending that the Foundation was not a purely public charity because, inter alia, “The property of the Barnes Foundation is not open to the public.”. In commenting on this contention, Mr. Justice Kephart quoted the opinion of the president judge of the trial court as follows: “ ‘It must be borne in mind that the gallery is used not as an art gallery as that term is ordinarily understood, but that it is an integral part of a new educational experiment, and the unrestricted admission of the public would be as detrimental to the work of The Barnes Foundation as it would be to the work carried on in the laboratories and clinics of the University of Pennsylvania. A clear conception of this fundamental destination [distinction] will aid in understanding the educational work of The Barnes Foundation.’ ”, It was held that the Foundation was entitled to tax exemption as a purely public charity.</p>

In defiance of the Charter and the Indenture, the Board of Trustees has sealed off the Art Gallery from the public. Those who ask to see the paintings, sculpture, drawings, etchings and lithographs housed in the Gallery receive a card which coldly announces: “THE BARNES FOUNDATION is not a public gallery. It is an educational institution with a program for systematic work, organized into classes which are held every day, and conducted by a staff of experienced teachers. Admission to the gallery is restricted to students enrolled in the classes.”</p>
    <p id="b193-3" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[188,1234,1147,1095]]]'>It would seem that Dr. Barnes in his lifetime, not unlike other geniuses, leavened the force of a powerful personality with the yeast of whim and idiosyneracy. The Board of Trustees apparently are seeking to perpetuate an idiosyncratic trend in the administration of the trust fund, but it has no right to go beyond the clearly worded intention of the charter and the Indenture. The Board is not privileged to guess as to what Dr. Barnes might have wanted. It must follow his explicit instructions that “it will be incumbent upon the Board of Trustees to make such regulations as will ensure that it is the plain people, that is, men and women who gain their livelihood by daily toil in shops, factories, schools, stores and similar places, who <em>shall have free access to the art gallery upon those days when the gallery is to he open to the public.” </em>Building a wall of haughtiness around the gallery, through which no one may pass except the chosen few picked by the Board of Trustees is certainly not conducive to helping the “plain people.”</p>

The Foundation enjoys immunity from local, state and federal taxation. It is asserted in the Bill of Complaint that this tax exemption has saved the Foundation “many hundreds of thousands of dollars since its incorporation.” The taxpaying public has a direct interest in this institution and that interest cannot be ignored by the Board of Trustees, especially in the face of the oft-repeated conditions announced by the donor.. If a court of equity does not step in to compel the Board of Trustees to enforce the dictates of the charter and the indenture, the Barnes Foundation will become a <em>private tax-exempt collection </em>of $25,000,000 worth of rare art, plus other property.</p>

In the case of <em>Hamilton v. John C. Mercer Home, </em><a href="/pa/228/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="228 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="969915" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0410-01">228 Pa. 410</a>, this Court approved of the statement made by the celebrated Judge Sulzberger, President Judge of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia County: “Fortunately, the powers of a court of equity are ample for the purpose. Whenever it is shown that trustees are derelict in the administration' of their trust, <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>the chancellor interferes to save the trust. This ancient remedy, under the inherent jurisdiction of the court, has been formally ratified by statute. The Act of June 16, 1836, sec. 13, P. L. 785, 789, confers upon us the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery so far as relates to GY. The control, removal and discharge of trustees, and the appointment of trustees, and the settlement of their accounts.’ And as regards the case in hand we have the additional power conferred in the same section, subhead ‘Y. The supervision and control of all corporations other than those of a municipal character. . . .’ If the plaintiffs have a standing here, it would be easy to shape a bill and its prayers so that any inefficiency in management tending to destroy or to impair the trust may be corrected.”</p>

The plaintiff makes the flat statement that the Art Gallery has been closed to the public. Under no semblance of logic can that statement be reconciled with the positive mandate that the public shall have access to the art gallery not more than two days a week. “Not more than” necessarily means more than nothing. If, on condition of tax exemption of a building housing a rare library, the owner or trustee announced to the public that it would have access to the library not more than 200 days a year, the only interpretation possible would be that on a certain number of days ranging from some substantial minimum number up to 200 the public could examine the volumes in question. But if the owner or trustee barred the doors completely to the public throughout the entire year, it cannot be questioned that his recalcitrance would be a matter for review by a Court of Chancery, whose jurisdiction was in<a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>voked by a member of tbe public. How does that differ from the situation at bar?</p>
    <p id="b196-4" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[235,450,1159,1578]]]'>No matter what powers the Board of Trustees may have, it cannot transcend the borders of the charter’s intention. Any by-laws and regulations which it may promulgate in violation of that intention may be modified, altered or outrightly invalidated by the Court of Equity upon application by an aggrieved party. In the case of <em>Lutz v. Webster, </em><a href="/pa/249/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="249 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1013687" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0226-01">249 Pa. 226</a>, a by-law of the involved corporation provided that four-fifths of the capital stock had to be represented for a quorum at a stockholders’ meeting. Upon suitable application to a court of equity, it was held that this was an unreasonable by-law and that a meeting could be held, even though four-fifths of the stockholders were not represented in person or by proxy. This Court affirmed the lower court’s decision: “The jurisdiction of the court to grant the relief prayed for is challenged, but we agree with the views of the learned chancellor and approved by the court in banc, that under the exceptional facts of this case, the court had power to determine whether the by-law was inconsistent with the law of the State, and if found to be so, to decree that an election be held at which a majority of the stock shall constitute a quorum. The appellant Webster has prevented the holding of an annual election for two years by refusing to attend a meeting called for this purpose, and certainly it is within the spirit and reason of our own cases for the court to order an election to be held in an orderly and lawful manner under such circumstances.”</p>
