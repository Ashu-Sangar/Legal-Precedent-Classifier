On February 20, 1940, the executors filed a federal income tax return for the decedent for the period beginning January 1,1939, and ending on December 10, 1939, the date.of death. The return included not only income actually received by the decedent in his lifetime, but also income in the form of dividends accrued prior to death but which the executors had not received. On February 20,1940, the executors paid the federal income tax and the transfer inheritance tax was then settled and paid, the executors taking credit for the amount paid for federal income tax.</p>
    <p id="b584-8" data-blocks='[["BL_584.10",584,[245,1557,1157,152]]]'>Thus it appears that the executors settled all sums due the Commonwealth for transfer inheritance tax, and nobody contends differently.</p>

The Commonwealth, in the audit of the second account of the fiduciary, filed its claim for inheritance tax in the sum of $1,223.15 on the said refund. The claim was denied by the court below, and this appeal by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania followed. The decision of the court below will be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[155,827,1154,260]]]'>It cannot be denied that, when the fiduciaries paid and settled the appraisement for transfer inheritance tax, nothing was then due the Commonwealth. In fact there were no assets of the estate which were not accounted for.</p>
