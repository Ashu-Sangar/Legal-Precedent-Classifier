Whether or not the language of this provision is subject to such characterization, in substance and effect the settlor could exercise complete control over the composition of the trust fund.

For seven years prior to the execution of the trust instrument Titlow had attended to the buying and selling of securities for the decedent, apparently acting in the capacity of investment adviser. Called on cross-examination by appellant’s counsel, he testified that he continued buying and selling securities on the decedent’s instructions after the execution of the trust instrument in the same manner as before its execution. When turned over to appellees’ counsel for direct examination, Titlow said that when he testified <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>that he bought or sold on the decedent’s instructions, he really meant with the decedent’s approval and that suggestions as to purchase or sale originated with Titlow and the decedent would then agree or disapprove of Titlow’s suggestions to buy or sell. Giving consideration to all of Titlow’s testimony, it is apparent that the relationship between him and the decedent remained the same before and after the execution of the trust agreement. It may be noted that Titlow’s accounts, which were introduced into evidence, both before and after the execution of the trust agreement, were kept in the name of “F. Edwin Titlow, Trustee for James H. Pengelly” and the only change in the situation was that prior to the existence of the trust agreement the securities remained in the name of the decedent while after its execution they were transferred to the name of Titlow as trustee. The relationship was in fact that of principal and agent. Titlow made suggestions as to the sale and purchase of securities but the decedent gave the instructions as to what should be bought or sold. Behind the mask of the colorable language employed, the decedent actually reserved the power to control the management of the trust.</p>

Thus, if the transfer to the trustee was by a deed formally executed and recorded, the conclusion that the trustee was also the agent of the settlor would be less likely to be drawn than if the transfer were less formally evidenced.”. However, where, as we have found in the present case, the reserved power of control was complete, no amount of formal embellishment can change actuality. Nor can the use of the words “trust” or “trustee” change the true character of the instrument: Tun<em>nell's </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/325/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="325 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1172311" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0554-01">325 Pa. 554</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.%20906" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="190 A. 906">190 A. 906</a>.</p>

L. 100, 20 PS §301.11, provides: <em>“A </em>conveyance of assets by a person who retains a power of appointment by will, or a power of revocation or consumption over the principal thereof, shall at the election of his surviving spouse, be treated as a testamentary disposition so far as the surviving spouse is concerned to the extent to which the power has been reserved but the right of the surviving spouse shall be subject to the rights of any income beneficiary whose interest in income becomes vested in enjoyment prior to the death of the conveyor.”. The effective date of the Act was January 1, 1948 so that appellant cannot rely thereon since the Act does not operate retrospectively: <em>McKean Estate, </em><a href="/pa/366/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="366 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="8845296" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0192-01">366 Pa. 192</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20447" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="77 A.2d 447">77 A. 2d 447</a>. However, the Act is confirmatory of a long existing public policy of the Commonwealth to protect the rights of widows, and irrespective of the husband’s motive in creating an inter vivos trust which excludes his widow from participation in the trust fund, any doubt as to the effectiveness of the trust in this regard should be resolved in favor of the widow.</p>
