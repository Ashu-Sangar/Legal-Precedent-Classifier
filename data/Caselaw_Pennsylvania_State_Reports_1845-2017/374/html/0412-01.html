Parsons, Chief Burgess of Hellertown, Pennsylvania, resigned his office; and his resignation was accepted by the Borough Council effective as of June 30,1951. On June 18,1951, at a regular meeting of the Borough Council (which is made up of nine members), the President announced that the Council would consider the election of a Burgess to serve out the unexpired term of Parsons. Three candidates thereupon were placed in nomination, and, after the voting, it was announced that Althrope Meixel, (a non-councilman), had received four votes, Raymond S. Judd, (a councilman) three votes, and Victor J. Abel (another councilman) two votes. The Council President, Gerald Wartman, declared that no one had received a majority of the votes, and the Council, decided to defer action <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>until the next regular meeting of the Council scheduled for July 2, 1951.</p>
    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[247,453,1158,931]]]'>On July 16, 1951, Meixell filed a Complaint in Mandamus in the courts of Northampton County asking that he be declared the duly elected burgess, since two of the councilmen. (Abel and Judd) had disqualified their vote by voting for themselves, contrary to the laws of the Commonwealth. On appeal from the decision of the Court of Common Pleas which sustained the preliminary objections to Meixell’s Complaint, this Court upheld the appellant’s position,, but on May 26, 1952, we handed down a supplemental order granting the defendant leave to make answer to the Complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> The defendant filed its Answer and New Matter, the plaintiff filed a Reply to the New Matter, and the resulting issue came on for trial before Judge Woodring, sitting without a jury. On September 15, 1952, the Court entered judgment in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff has appealed again to this Court.</p>

But with monetary emoluments go the honor and prestige associated with that of being chief executive of one’s own town. Heller-town does not have the size of New York nor the historical grandeur of Rome but for its inhabitants it is a world in itself, and any one can well be proud of the distinction of being its first citizen. However, even glory can be, and in some situations must be, regulated by statute. The General Assembly of Pennsylvania, by Act of July 10, 1947, P. L. 1621, §22 (53 PS 12871) provides, inter alia, that: “If any vacancy shall occur in the office of burgess ... by death, resignation, removal <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>from the borough ... or in any other manner whatsoever, the borough council shall fill such vacancy by appointing, by resolution, a registered elector of the borough ... to hold such office for the unexpired term of the office.”</p>

Councilman Ward, who had originally voted for Meixell, now placed in nomination the name of Asher S. Kichline, and Councilman Hine nominated Meixell. Eight voted for Kichline and one voted for Meixell. A resolution was then drafted declaring Kichline<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> elected or appointed, and this resolution was adopted by a vote of 8 to 1.</p>

Even if it were to be assumed, arguendo, that the voting on June 18th represented a selection of Chief Burgess, the Council had the right to reconsider its vote, as it has the right, under proper parliamentary procedure, to reconsider any vote. After the voting on J une 18th, the President declared that no one had been élected. As well stated by the lower court in its Opinion, “. . . the ruling of the president, whether right or wrong, was acquiesced in by the whole body of Council and thereby became the action of the body. No dissent or protest was made to thé ruling of the Chair and Council affirmatively accepted [that ruling by adopting the motion to defer action" on the selection of Burgess until the meeting of July 2.”</p>

This fact, of course, would not illegalize an election if one had taken place on resolution or the equivalent thereof. But the hearing in the lower court which followed the first decision of this Court in the matter, now demonstrates that the voting on June 18th was in effect but a casting of straws into the air to determine which way the political winds were blowing. Karl I-Iine, the councilman who had placed Meixell’s name in nomination, testified at the hearing: “A. After I learned that the results of the election were four, three, and two, I asked if it were not possible to name Mr. Meixell burgess. I said, ‘Does that mean that Mr. Meixell cannot be named the burgess?’ and the answer was, ‘You are right.’ Q. Who gave you that answer? A. The President of Borough Council, after consulting with the solicitor.” The minutes of the meeting of June 18th cover 12 printed pages, dealing with many municipal subjects for consideration. Less than two of those pages are devoted to the so-called election.</p>
