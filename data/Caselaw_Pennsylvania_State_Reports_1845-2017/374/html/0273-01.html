Gettys’ executor instituted an action in assumpsit to collect the balance due under the contract. The defendant renounced any indebtedness to the plaintiff, declaring that while it was true Gettys hád not.placed any mortgage or lien on the defendant’s property, this did not constitute a consideration for the promise to pay, since it was not proved that Gettys had any right to a lien or mortgage.</p>

On or about June 3, 1949, Anna S. Bennethum, by her <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>agent, William II. Bennethum, Jr., entered into an oral agreement with Malcolm Gettys for. alterations and repairs according to certain plans prepared by Robert N. Longacre, an architect, to premises 2227 North Second Street, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which was the property of Anna S. Bennethum. By said oral agreement Malcolm Gettys agreed to do all of the plastering, furnish all of the lumber and hardware, provide the necessary carpentry work, labor and the brick work, for a total price between §1,500 and $1,600, not to include a fire escape. Electrical, plumbing, painting and papering work involved in the alterations were contracted for and performed by others. Thereafter, Malcolm H. Gettys proceeded with said alterations and repairs according to said plan, and agreed to add new flooring on the third floor and make certain additions in the kitchen, not provided for in the plan, at the additional pi*ice of $250. However, Malcolm II. Gettys charged $375 for said flooring and additional work, rather than the agreed $250. On or about September 14, 1949, Malcolm II. Gettys had completed said alterations and repairs except to construct a wooden walk to the fire escape. . .”</p>

The offer by the defendant of the undated writing and the four checks (all dated prior to September, 1949) would have been ineffective to invalidate the contract.of the.latter date. Since the un<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>dated writing refers to September 15, 1949, as a future date it necessarily, therefore, antedated the second contract; and, in the absence of any explanation, the only possible inference is that the contract of September 15, 1949, rescinded all prior agreements. Thus, it would not be sufficient to show that payments were made under a prior agreement without first proving that that agreement was still alive on September 15, 1949. In the absence of any such proof, it followed that all payments presumably made thereunder could in no way be considered as having been made on account of the contract of September 15, 1949.</p>
