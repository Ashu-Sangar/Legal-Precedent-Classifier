The boys intended to do some hunting and, therefore, carried rifles. The four young men left the cabin where they were staying in order to spend an evening camping. They met the father in his automobile, left their equipment with him, and went in search of a camp site. During the search they came across an airport on the edge of which was a lunchroom operated by defendant. The boys stopped in the lunchroom for something to eat. It was testified that about a week previously this lunchroom had been burglarized. During the course of remarks between the boys and a Yelma Turner, the person in charge of the lunchroom, a statement made by the boys aroused Mrs. Turner’s suspicion that these boys may have had something to do with the burglary. After the boys had finished eating, they chose a camp site near the airport and moved their equipment to the new spot; they then started back to the lunchroom to obtain some ginger ale. Meanwhile defendant came into the lunchroom. He was informed of the remarks which had aroused the suspicion of Mrs. Turner and also that she had seen a car driving around the place in a suspicious manner. The defendant sent Mrs. Turner and her daughter down the road in his car to burn some garbage. It was while the mother and daughter were carrying out the defendant’s instructions that the boys reached the lunchroom for the second time. They tried <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>the door but found it locked. There was evidence that the. outer screen door had a connecting bell inside the room which- rang when the boys tried to enter and that they had “bucked up against the door”. These circumstances led the defendant to believe, he testified, that another burglary was about to be attempted.</p>
    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[244,669,1156,1313]]]'>■ When the boys found they could not gain entrance, they went .to the adjoining airfield and climbed into a parked plane. . At this point Mrs. Turner and her daughter returned. One of them, dressed in slacks, tried the same door by which the boys had tried to gain entrance, found it locked, returned to their car, turned off the headlights, drove to the side of the building facing the airfield, and entered the lunchroom by a side' door. Although it was light enough for the boys to witness this incident, they could not discern who was in the car. There was evidence that the boys saw a light flash on and off in a nearby plane. Thus the boys also became suspicious that everything was not right in the vicinity of the airport. They returned to their camp, procured their rifles, and again proceeded to the airport. Upon reaching the field, they split up, two of them going on each side of the building. At about 8:30 p.m. Mrs. Turner had seen the four approaching the airfield and had notified the defendant who had procured a shotgun and was waiting inside the darkened building. When he saw two of the boys coming toward the building, one of them carrying a gun, he shot through a window, fatally wounding Charles Van Pelt and injuring Erwin E. Bergdoll.</p>

The indictment conforms to the exact words of the statute above cited. This Court has ruled that an indictment drawn in conformity with the provisions of this Act is sufficient: <em>Goersen v.

    <p id="b465-3" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[146,727,1147,594]]]'>The remaining assignments of error relate to alleged trial errors. Two main objections are to two sentences in the court’s charge to the jury, relating to the plea of self-defense; viz.: “. . . The guilt of the accused must be established in the first instance beyond a reasonable doubt and when it was so established he is not to be acquitted because the jury after hearing him or his witnesses, may be in doubt as to whether he acted in self-defense. In making that defense he admits his intention of the killing of another and the burden is upon him to show it could not have been avoided. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[146,1336,1147,815]]]'>It is contended that the jury would be led to believe that it must first consider “the guilt of the accused” before considering the plea of self-defense. This standing alone might have been error under the principle laid down in <em>Commonwealth v. Palome, </em><a href="/pa/263/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="263 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="1047524" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0466-01">263 Pa. 466</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.%20783" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="106 A. 783">106 A. 783</a>. But the next sentence of the charge reads: “. . . Where a defendant sets up sel f-defense, and undertakes to establish his excuse, the evidence both from his side and the Commonwealth must be weighed so as to show by the fair weight and preponderance of the evidence that it was established, in order to acquit. . . .” Any possible error was cured by this explanation. Of course, the burden always remains upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt from all the evidence in the case the guilt of defendant.</p>

At the end of the charge the trial <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>judge inquired of the defense counsel if there were anything further he wished enunciated, and a request was made to develop this point further. The court then further charged: “. . . I stated that in making that defense the defendant admits his intention of killing another. By that is meant that <em>lie admits that the act of shooting, </em>as in this case, there is no denial that the man was shot and the defendant admits that he shot, and I further told you that the burden is on him to show that it could not have been avoided. <em>You are not to interpret from that remarle that he intended the wilful, deliberate and premeditated hilling of another. . </em>. <em>.” </em>(Italics supplied)</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[251,1053,1155,484]]]'>Immediately thereafter, the judge asked counsel for defense if that met his requirement. He answered, “Yes Your Honor”. A charge must be read in its entirety so that each thought may be scrutinized in the context that it was presented to the jury: <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b466-5" data-blocks='[["BL_466.5",466,[249,1550,1156,540]]]'>Another error complained of is the failure of defense trial counsel to petition for change of venue. New counsel was obtained by the defendant to prosecute this appeal. The Act of March 18, 1875, P. L. 30, Sec. 2, 19 PS 552 provides that “All applications for changes of venue shall be made to the court. . . before the jury shall be sworn . . .”. Here counsel did not apply for a change of venue as provided by the Act. The failure to apply may not be taken advantage of for the first time on appeal.</p>

The doctor who attended the deceased testified in direct examination that the wounds, in the extended arm position, were on the outside portion of the thumb. Defendant’s counsel emphasized in his cross-examination that the position of the arm tended to show that the deceased had raised his rifle. On redirect examination the doctor testified that the arm was in a semi-extended position which would tend to refute the inference that the rifle was aimed at defendant. The doctor was not asked in direct examination the position of the arm but the position of the wounds on the hand. It was, therefore, permissible for the Commonwealth to question the doctor on redirect examination. “. . . The examination of witnesses is to be conducted in such a manner as to discover the truth without taking any unfair advantage . . .

On the evening of September 1, 1952, at about 6 o’clock he took off for an hour’s instruction flight with one of his students, Rev. Norman C. Larson of the Christian Missionary Alliance, and at the termination of the flight taxied and parked the airplane to and at a point off the runway. At about 7:30 he returned to the airport building in which he owned a lunchroom, run by an advanced flying student, Mrs. Velma Turner (already a licensed pilot) who paid for her tuition by waiting on customers. With her was her daughter, Joyce Turner, 14 years of age, who assisted in the work.</p>

Mrs. Turner also told him about a strange car which had been slowly cruising past their place of business in a way to arouse suspicion.

When Mrs. and Miss Turner returned, Sallade told them that “they were back,” meaning that Ms two nocturnal visitors were.the ones who had broken into his place a week before and were probably preparing to break in again.

Trying to follow their movement through the windows, Sallade now moved into the lunchroom with Mrs. Turner and her daughter, when two of the prowlers suddenly turned the corner of the building and started toward that part of the structure in which he and the two women were concealed in the enveloping darkness. The girl Joyce cried out, “Mama, I’m scared.” Sallade, standing in front of an enameled refrigerator, quickly realized that with the moonlight streaming through the window he was a perfect target for anyone who might shoot through the glass.

It was while they were sitting in the plane, in. which they had no right to be and where they might have injured some of the delicate mechanism of the frail craft, that they saw an automobile drive up to the airport building and discharge a couple of persons. At the same time a light in another airplane on the field flashed. These two unrelated incidents set them off on further irresponsible exploits. Roger Grigson, 19, testified: “Q.

In fact, the only testimony on the subject is that Sallade had <em>no </em>intention of killing. The State Policeman who questioned the defendant immediately after the shooting said that the defendant told him: “He said he fired to stop them.

No doubt that such an imputation would be denied by the citizenry of the locale, but often prejudices Occur without one consciously calling them forth.

Whether any culpability attached to his behavior of the evening is unimportant in the light of the fact that he had to surrender his all, certainly too much to pay for any youthful escapade of the evening. The Van Pelt family probably derived some measure of comfort from Sallade’s conviction because by that conviction their boy’s record was presumably cleansed of all fault and wrongdoing. But the Van Pelts do not need a conviction for that comfort. Charles Van Pelt was a guileless victim of the times with its appalling emphasis on explosives, firearms and other devices for violent destruction.
