The accident which gave rise to it occurred on October 30, 1947, and now, nearly six years later, the parties have not even begun to try the case on its merits but are still enmeshed in mere procedural controversy.</p>

The owner and operator of the damaged car, Edward J. Wnek, claims damages of $31.00 for expenses and $525.00 for alleged depreciation in the value of his automobile. Each of his two passengers, Vivian Livingston and Matthew J. Wnek, claims $1500 for injuries sustained.</p>

On February 7, the additional defendant filed an answer together with new matter again setting forth the statute of limitations. On April 9, the court dismissed the amended complaint. On May 2, a stipulation of counsel was filed agreeing to the filing of a second amended complaint and such complaint was thereupon filed. On May 22, the additional defendant filed an answer with new matter as before. On October 22, the court dismissed the second amended complaint. On November 13, the court entered orders in each of the two cases separately to the same effect. On November 14, appeals were taken by defendant to the Superior Court.

In plaintiffs’ complaint against defendant they asserted that it was due to defendant’s negligence in that he operated his automobile at an excessive rate of speed, failed to have his car under proper and adequate control, and was guilty of other acts both of commission and omission. The amended complaint which defendant, in turn, filed against the additional defendant averred that plaintiffs, in their complaint, had charged that their injuries were caused solely by defendant’s negligence; that he would serve a copy of their complaint upon the additional defendant; that he did not admit either in whole or in part the accuracy of their charges; that the additional defendant was negligent in the operation of his automobile in various stated respects, — practically the same as those which plaintiffs had charged against defendant; that it would be impossible to determine until the cases were tried whether the negligence of the additional defendant was either the sole cause or a major contributing cause of the collision; that therefore he asserted that the negligence of the additional defendant was either the sole cause or a major contributing cause of the accident; that he desired to protect his right of contribution in the event hé be found to have been jointly or concurrently negligent with the additional defendant; that therefore he claimed that the additional defendant was jointly liable with him upon the causes of action declared upon by the plaintiffs.</p>

      <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>This amended complaint should not, in our opinion, have been dismissed. It is clear that if defendant were obliged, in a case such as this, in addition to averring facts showing negligence on the part of the additional defendant, to make admissions of his own negligence in order to establish joint or several liability, it would be tantamount to a denial of his right to bring the additional defendant on the record at all, since any such admissions could be placed in evidence and taken advantage of by plaintiffs on the trial of the case: <em>Hess v.

It is true that Pa. R. C. P. 2252(b) provides that “The defendant . . . shall file ... a complaint, in the manner and form required of the initial pleading of the plaintiff in the action, setting forth the facts relied upon to establish the liability of the additional defendant and the relief demanded.” But this, like all procedural rules, must be interpreted and applied so as to accomplish, from a practical standpoint, the beneficent results that it is the object of all such rules to achieve. As Mr. Justice Linn said in <em>Rau v. Manko, </em><a href="/pa/341/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="341 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1204528" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0017-01">341 Pa. 17</a>, 23, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20422" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="17 A.2d 422">17 A. 2d 422</a>, 425, 426, “One of the purposes of third party procedure is to avoid multiplicity of suits by adjudicating in one suit the rights and liabilities of all the parties to a single transaction which constitutes the cause of action, and the Rules should, if possible, be construed to accomplish that purpose.” At the trial of the present case, if defendant’s testimony should convince the jury that the additional defendant was negligent, they might, even if they concluded that defendant also was negligent, properly find that they were jointly or severally liable, in which case the question of the right of defendant to contribution from the additional defendant would have been settled in the one proceeding instead of compelling him, in case a verdict were found against him, to bring a subsequent <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>action against the additional defendant to recover contribution. Since defendant alleges in the amended complaint facts establishing the negligence of the additional defendant, what he is in substance pleading is that if he, the defendant, should be found by the jury to have been negligent as claimed by plaintiffs, the additional defendant’s negligence, as set forth in detail in defendant’s complaint, was also a contributing cause of the accident. We see no reason why such a pleading should not be permitted, especially in the case of a collision between two vehicles where it is always possible that both operators were negligent and thereby contributed to the happening of the accident.</p>

Universal Oil Products Co., </em><a href="/pa/355/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="355 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="468886" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0324-01">355 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20704" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="49 A.2d 704">49 A. 2d 704</a>, and <em>Carlin v.

In the <em>Zachrel </em>case, the averments in defendant’s complaint against the additional defendant were such that joint or several liability was wholly impossible; the question emerging from plaintiff’s and defendant’s respective complaints was whether a certain person who committed the tort was the agent of the defendant or of the additional defendant, so that either party would be liable as that fact appeared, <em>but both could not be. </em>In the <em>Carlin </em>case, the defendant asserted that the injured person was an employe of the additional defendant and that he was a trespasser on the defendant’s property where he was injured; therefore defendant was under no liability to him, and consequently, if there was any liability at all, it must be that of the additional defendant <em>alone. </em>In other words, in each of those two cases, while there was an allegation of joint and several liability, the very averments themselves of the defendant’s complaint negatived and contradicted the plea. As stated in GoodrichAmram, Civil Practice, §2252(a)-9: “it is the averments of fact in the complaint which are controlling and the <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>conclusion as to the nature of the liability of tbe additional defendant is to be ignored <em>when the facts are in conflict therewith ” </em>Such is not the present case.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[246,513,1159,206]]]'>The order of the Superior Court affirming the order of the court below dismissing the amended complaint against the additional defendant is reversed, and the record is remanded to the court below with a procedendo.</p>
