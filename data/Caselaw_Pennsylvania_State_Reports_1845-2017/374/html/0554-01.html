L. 905, as amended, in that he allegedly operated over a state highway route in Somerset County a motor vehicle which was in excess of the maximum width permitted by law without having obtained a permit authorizing such operation. A hearing was had before a Justice of the Peace as the result of which judgment was entered for the Commonwealth and a penalty of $50.00 and costs, or an alternative sentence of ten days in the county jail, was imposed. Hallberg appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Somerset County, where a hearing was had de novo. The defendant demurred to the evidence and moved to quash the information; the court granted this motion. The Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the order of the court below. We thereupon allowed this appeal.</p>

L. 1718, amending section 905 of The Vehicle Code. Section 905, before amendment, contained a subsection, (a) , which provided that the Secretary of Highways and local authorities in their respective jurisdictions might, under certain circumstances, issue a special permit authorizing the applicant therefor to operate a vehicle of a size and weight exceeding the maximum specified in the act. It also contained a subsection, (b) , which provided that in the event of a catastrophe or accident affecting the public safety or convenience such a permit might be issued subsequent to the operation or movement of the vehicle. It further contained a paragraph entitled “Penalty,” which provided that any person operating a vehicle of a size or weight ex<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>ceeding tlie maximum specified in the act, without first having obtained a permit so to do, should, upon summary conviction before a magistrate, be sentenced to pay a fine of $50.00 and costs, and, in default of the payment thereof, should undergo imprisonment for not more than ten days.</p>

To support this contention he points to Article 3, §6, of the Constitution, which provides that “No law shall be revived, amended, or the provisions thereof extended or conferred, by reference to its title only, <em>but so much thereof as is </em>revived, <em>amended, </em>extended or conferred shall be re-enacted <em>and published at length,” </em>and to section 81 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, which provides that “Whenever a law re-enacts a former law, the provisions . . . only of the former law as are omitted from the re-enactment shall be deemed abrogated, ...” In our opinion neither of these provisions justifies the reliance placed thereon by defendant. On the contrary, the constitutional provision requires that <em>so much of the law as is amended shall be published at </em>length; in the present instance the announced purpose was to amend the entire section <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>905, not only subsection (a). If it had really been intended to eliminate subsection (b) and the penalty clause such elimination constituted in itself an amendment of the section, and therefore not only subsection (a) but also subsection (b) and the penalty clause, in short, the entire section 905, had to be published at length if the constitutional mandate was to be observed. As far as section 81 of the Statutory Construction Act is concerned, it relates to a re-enactment of a former law, and in a re-enactment provides that such provisions only of the former law as are omitted from the re-enactment should be deemed abrogated. But the real question is how such “omission” is to be indicated. The answer to that question in the case of amendatory laws is to be found in section 71 of the Statutory Construction Act which, implementing the Constitution, provides that “The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall, in printing amendatory laws, cause to be printed the section or part of the law only as re-enacted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In the section or part of the law re-enacted, the secretary shall cause to be printed between brackets, the words, phrases, or provisions of the existing law, if any, which have been stricken out or eliminated by the adoption of the amendment, and he shall cause to be printed in italics all new words, phrases or provisions, if any, which have been inserted into or added to the law by the passage of such amendment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>It would seem entirely clear from this provision that, where the legislature intends to eliminate any section or part of a law, it is not enough merely to delete the publication of that section or part, but the entire section or part, including the section or part to be eliminated, must be published at length, with the section or part to be eliminated enclosed in brackets. If the purpose is declared merely to amend a <em>subsection, </em>as in the amendatory Act of July 16, 1935, P. L. 1056, it is sufficient to re-enact and publish at length only that subsection; all other parts of the section would then remain unaffected. If, on the other hand, the declared purpose is to amend a <em>section, </em>as in the amendatory act of June 5, 1937, P. L. 1718, the entire section must be re-enacted and published at length, including any subsection or part which it is intended to abrogate, which subsection or part must be placed between brackets; in other words, the intended abrogation must be affirmatively disclosed. The object of the Constitutional provision and of section 71 of the Statutory Construction Act is obvious, namely, to enable both the legislators themselves and all persons interested in the legislation to see exactly the changes made between the existing law and the. re-enactment, without the necessity of referring to the former for comparison <em>(Commonwealth v.

We are strengthened in this conclusion by the well-known, uniform practice, long existent, of legislative draftsmen <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>thus to place in brackets all parts of an existing law intended to be abrogated, as well as by the general understanding that such abrogation is to be deemed to occur only when so indicated. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that in the subsequent Act of August 24, 1951, P. L. 1368, section 27, which again amended section 905 of the Vehicle Code, subsection (b) and the penalty clause are set forth as they were prior to the 1937 amendment, but (except for an interpolated provision in the penalty clause) <em>not in italics, </em>indicating that the legislature was clearly of the opinion that subsection (b) and the penalty clause were not thereby being <em>reintroduced </em>into the legislation but <em>had never been abrogated.</em>

In that case the County contended that the amendment of July 15, 1935 which restated verbatim and reenacted and republished §518 of an earlier act and then added an additional provision thereto, merely restated and republished the original §518 <em>for the sole purpose of complying with </em>Article III, §6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This Court in its opinion on this point said (p. 435) : “We disagree Avith appellant’s ingenious but specious interpretation. We are convinced that the original Section 518 Avas restated verbatim in accordance Avith the requirements of Article III, §6 of the Constitution <em>for the piirpose and with the legislative intent to re-enact the original section with a new provision added.”</em>

It reads: “To amend the act, approved the first day of May, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, . . . entitled ‘An act for the protection of the public safety; . . .’ as amended, . . .; and changing and imposing penalties. Section 1. Be it enacted, &amp;c., That sections nine hundred and five and nine hundred and six . . . are hereby further amended to read as follows : Section 905. . . .” The legislature not only stated in the title that it was going to change the penalties, but also specifically stated that the act was further amended <em>“to read as follows”, </em>thereby clearly showing their intention that the law was thereafter to be what was fully set forth and published in the ensuing §905.

The legislature accordingly left out what they wanted to omit and published the act in full as they wanted it to be from the date of the amendment, thus complying with both the Constitution and §81. But the majority opinion ignores the clear and universally accepted meaning of the word “omit” and distorts it to mean “to bracket”; and since the “printer” or his employee did not restate the penalty clause and place it in brackets, the majority opinion holds it was not omitted and the entire amendment falls.</p>

In other words, the part or subsection which the legislature omitted should be published by the printer in brackets; but as far as interpreting the act is concerned, the bracketed part should be considered as if omitted, <em>thus reaching exactly the same result as occurs under </em>§81 <em>which provides that what is omitted is to he considered as abrogated.</em>
