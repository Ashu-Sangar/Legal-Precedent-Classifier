The matter proceeded to preliminary hearing at which Appellant, Elliott and Young were present. At the preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth called Schneyder as a witness. She recanted her prior statement to the police. She testified that she did not remember speaking with either Appellant or Elliott. Further, she admitted that she made the statements, but asserted that she made them in order to “tell them [the police] what they wanted to hear so [she] could get out of homicide.” N.T., 1/10/1995, p. 13.

After the preliminary hearing testimony was read at trial, Nicole Schneyder appeared. The Commonwealth and both defense counsels declined to call her as a witness. The court also allowed Detective Mangoni to read the prior statement that Schneyder made at the police station. Although counsel initially objected to Detective Mangoni’s testimony, when faced with the choice of either renewing an objection to Mangoni’s testimony or calling Nicole Schneyder to the stand, defense counsel did not further object to Mangoni’s testimony. Following the trial, Appellant was convicted of robbery and conspiracy. The jury was undecided on the first-degree murder charge with regard to Appellant and as to all charges against Elliott. The trial court declared a mistrial, and subsequently scheduled a retrial.</p>

Following the penalty phase, the jury found one aggravating circumstance — that the killing occurred in the perpetration of a felony<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> — and no mitigating circumstances and sentenced Appellant to death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

At the first trial, both prior statements were attributed to Schneyder. Schneyder’s preliminary hearing testimony provided that she was going to be questioned about the statement she gave to Detective Mangoni on January 24, 1992. Detective Mangoni testified that he was going to read the statement that Schneyder gave him on January 24, 1992. Thus, the jury knew that the statements admitted at both points in the trial were <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>identical. Based upon this, when the jury heard Detective Mangoni read Schneyder’s statement for the second time, the “X” clearly referred to Appellant since the statement was identical to the statement attributed to him in Schneyder’s previous statement. This error was compounded when, immediately after counsel’s objection, Detective Mangoni read the same part of the statement, this time replacing the “X” with Appellant’s name. At this point, the jury could surmise that “X” referred to Appellant. Additionally, Elliott’s hearsay statement was “powerfully incriminating” as it implicated Appellant directly in the crimes in question. Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Marsh, </em>the jury could reasonably infer from the face of the statements that Elliott was referring to Appellant in violation of <em>Bruton </em>and this was the kind of inference that a jury could make immediately.</p>
    <p id="b447-4" data-blocks='[["BL_447.4",447,[169,1139,1158,735]]]'>Moreover, while it is impossible to divine whether the jurors definitely knew that “X” and “A” referred to the same person or whether the jurors were simply confused by the alteration of the statement, we must conclude that based upon the similarity of the statements a reasonable juror would understand that the letter “X” referred to the same person as the letter “A”. Once the statements established that “X” or “A” was Appellant, the Confrontation Clause was violated. The only possible way to correct such a violation was to give Appellant the opportunity to cross-examine Elliott regarding the statement. <em>Bruton. </em>Appellant did not have such an opportunity and thus, we must conclude that the admission of the statement as redacted violated Appellant’s right of confrontation pursuant to <em>Bruton.</em>

      <em>A </em>similar analysis applies to the second trial. However, the error at the second trial was even more egregious. First, the jury was apprised that “X” was Hickey when Detective Mangoni read Schneyder’s police statement. Appellant was identified as Hickey throughout the trial. N.T., 7/10/1996, pp. 90, 94, 167; N.T., 7/11/1996, pp. 7, 50. Thus, without even referring to the other statements, the jury was informed that “X” was Appellant and the redaction failed to prevent the statement from incriminating Appellant. <em>Miles. </em>This error was <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>aggravated by the fact that the trial court never instructed the jury that Elliott’s statement was only admissible against the deelarant/Elliott and could not be considered in the case against Appellant. Accordingly, we must find that the admission of the statement during both trials, as redacted, violated Appellant’s right of confrontation as defined by <em>Bruton </em>and thus, any limiting instruction was simply insufficient to cure the prejudice to Appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a>

Although Appellant has failed to present the issue in his Statement of Questions Involved in compliance with Pa.R.A.P. 2116, it would be inappropriate for this court to decline review of the issue related to the alleged trial court error, merely on the basis of what amounts to appellant’s awkward phrasing of the Statements of Questions Involved.</p>

The Court then proceeds to the ostensible administrative outrages of the separate trials that would be necessary, contending that it would be unwise to compel prosecutors to bring separate proceedings, presenting the same evidence again and again, requiring victims and witnesses to repeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying, and randomly favoring the last-tried defendants who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution’s case beforehand. This speculation also floats unattached to any anchor of reality. Since the likelihood that more than one of the defendants in a joint trial will have confessed is fairly remote, the prospect of presenting the same evidence again and again is nothing but a rhetorical flourish. At worst, in the typical case, two trials may be required, one for the confessing defendant and another for the nonconfessing defendant or defendants.

Unfortunately, the Court’s approach introduces both inconsistency and uncertainty into the status of pre-Gray Bruton law in Pennsylvania. The Court cannot have it both ways: if it is <em>pre-Gray </em>law that applies, as the Court says, then the analysis of the propriety of the non-objected-to redaction here is limited to the statement. And, since appellant does not go by the name of “Mr. A” or “Mr. X,” Elliott’s redacted statement, which contains no references to appellant by name (or even by nickname), obviously was acceptable in 1995 and 1996. Indeed, the manner in which Elliott’s statement was redacted is materially identical to redactions that were approved by this Court in decisions that were contemporaneous with the trials in this matter. That fact, no doubt, explains why trial counsel, who had to try this case without the luxury of Gray-based hindsight, raised no objection.</p>

As redacted, Elliott’s statement, on its face, did not implicate appellant in the slightest. The statement requires inferences from or linkage to other evidence at the trials detailing appellant’s role in the murder to reveal that the “X” or “A” referred to in the statement was appellant. Although the redaction here was not so obvious an alteration as that at issue in <em>Gray </em>(where either the word “deleted” or a blank space was substituted for the defendant’s name), I do not dispute that the redaction would be problematic under the reasoning employed in the 5-4 majority decision in <em>Gray. </em>Thus, if appellant had anticipated and preserved a <em>Gray </em>claim which the trial court had overruled, and if <em>Gruy </em>applied retroactively, the trial court may well have “erred” in admitting Elliott’s statement.

It appears that the Court has confused Elliott’s redacted statement with the police statement of witness Nicole Schneyder, which included an account of a conversation she had with appellant on the day before the murder. At both trials, appellant objected not to the alteration of co-defendant Elliott’s statement, but to the alteration of Schneyder’s statement. Schneyder’s statement had been introduced during her testimony at the preliminary hearing, where she was subject to cross-examination.

In short, the detective,' perhaps wrongly assuming that since Elliott’s statement had been redacted to remove references to appellant, Schneyder’s needed to be altered too, effectively “redacted” Schneyder’s testimony and account. Appellant’s trial counsel, who was obviously alert to this, objected because the detective’s “redaction” of witness Schneyder’s statement “filled in the equation for the jury,” N.T. 11/21/95, p. <em>64 </em>— i.e., it could lead the jury to infer that Elliott in fact was referring to appellant when the letter “X” was used in his redacted statement.

Appellant’s actual objection, thus, did not have to do with <em>Bruton </em>or the adequacy of the redaction of Elliott’s statement at all. The objection to Mangoni’s rendering of Schneyder’s testimony was effectively identified and forwarded by trial counsel and certainly warranted a response from the trial court.

Moreover, unlike the issue the Court formulates, the claim that trial counsel raised was one that bears some relationship to what actually occurred at trial, and counsel’s objection led to an immediate response from the trial court.

This simply is not so. As redacted, Elliott’s statement never referred to appellant by name or even by nickname; instead, the letters “A” or “X” were substituted for his name. A link to appellant could only be found by looking to other evidence at the trials which detailed the primary role appellant played in strangling Lillian Gaines. Tellingly, in finding that Elliott’s statement “expressly implicated” appellant, both the lead opinion and the concurrence look not to the face of the statement, but instead to other events at these trials: specifically, Detective Mangoni’s botched reading of Schneyder’s preliminary hearing testimony. Thus, in reviewing the first trial, the lead opinion emphasizes that, when Mangoni read Schneyder’s account of her conversation with appellant and inadvertently substituted the letter “X” for appellant’s name, “the ‘X’ clearly referred to [a]ppellant since the statement was identical to the statement attributed to him in Schneyder’s previous statement.” Op. at 305. This error was compounded, the lead opinion reasons, when, immediately after counsel’s objection to the Detective’s lapse, Mangoni re-read the statement, this time replacing the “X” with appellant’s name. On this record, the lead opinion determines that the jury could “surmise” or “reasonably in<em>fer” </em>— i.e., that the jury could conclude from context or inference or “evidentiary links”' — that the “X” referred to in Elliott’s statement was appellant, even though nothing in that statement <em>qua </em>statement remotely suggested any such thing. Continuing in its inference/evidentiary linkage analysis, the lead opinion next reasons that the error at the second trial, the trial which resulted in appellant’s murder conviction, was even more egregious because the jury was apprised that “X” was “Hickey,” appellant’s nickname, when Mangoni read Schneyder’s police statement, and appellant had already been identified as “Hickey” throughout that trial. <em><a href="/pa/545/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="681 A.2d 1295" data-case-ids="465120,7867795" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0500-01,/a2d/681/1295-01">Id.</a></em>

      <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>In my view, the Court’s finding of a <em>Bruton </em>violation based not upon the co-defendant’s actual statement, but upon inferences that the juries may have drawn from other events at these trials is patently erroneous under the pr <em>e-Gray </em>state of the law that prevailed when these,trials were conducted. At that time, the most recent and governing U.S. Supreme Court decision was <em>Richardson. </em>In <em>Richardson, </em>although the co-defendant’s confession was redacted to remove all reference to the defendant, the defendant still argued that admission of the co-defendant’s confession violated her confrontation rights because it implicated her in the crime when linked with other evidence. As this Court recently noted in <em>Commonwealth v. Travers, </em><a href="/pa/564/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="564 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1276767" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0362-01">564 Pa. 362</a>, <a href="/a2d/768/0845-01" class="citation" data-index="215" data-cite="768 A.2d 845" data-case-ids="11118708,11118757,1276704,1276767" data-case-paths="/a2d/768/0845-01,/a2d/768/0845-02,/pa/564/0361-01,/pa/564/0362-01">768 A.2d 845</a>, 848 (2001), the <em>Richardson </em>Court “expressly rejected the theory of contextual implication, recognizing the important distinction between co-defendant confessions that expressly incriminate the defendant and those that become incriminating only when linked to other evidence properly introduced at trial.” In rejecting the theory, the <em>Richardson </em>Court noted that, when incrimination is merely inferential, “it is a less valid generalization that the jury will not likely obey the instruction to disregard the evidence.” <em>Richardson, </em><a href="/us/481/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="216" data-cite="481 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="6212712" data-case-paths="/us/481/0200-01">481 U.S. at 208</a>, <a href="/us/481/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="217" data-cite="481 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="6212712" data-case-paths="/us/481/0200-01">107 S.Ct. 1702</a>. Thus, at the time these cases were tried, if linkage with other evidence was required for the co-defendant’s statement to incriminate the accused, a proper limiting instruction was sufficient to satisfy <em>Bruton. </em>Importantly for present purposes, the <em>Richardson </em>Court also was careful to express “no opinion” on the admissibility of a confession where the redaction consists of replacing the defendant’s name “with a symbol or neutral pronoun.” <em><a href="/us/481/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="218" data-cite="481 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="6212712" data-case-paths="/us/481/0200-01">Id.</a> </em>at 211 n. 5, <a href="/us/481/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="219" data-cite="481 U.S. 200" data-case-ids="6212712" data-case-paths="/us/481/0200-01">107 S.Ct. 1702</a>.

The majority in <em>Gray </em>noted that its task-was to “decide a question that <em>Richardson </em>left open, namely, whether redaction that replaces a defendant’s name with an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space, the word “deleted,” or a <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>similar symbol, still falls within Bruton’s protective rule.” <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="220" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">523 U.S. at 192</a>, <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="221" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. 1151</a> (emphases supplied). In ultimately holding, for the first time, that such a redaction did fall within <em>Bruton, </em>the Court candidly acknowledged the tension between that new holding and the previously prevailing law under <em>Richardson. </em>Indeed, this was so much the case that the <em>Gray </em>majority expressly “conceded” both that <em>Richardson </em>had “placed outside the scope of <em>Bruton’s </em>rule those statements that incriminate inferentially” and that in a situation where a mere symbol of redaction was used, such as in <em>Gray </em>(and such as occurred here), “the jury must use inference to connect the statement ... with the defendant.” <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="222" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">523 U.S. at 195</a>, <a href="/us/523/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="223" data-cite="523 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="11503401" data-case-paths="/us/523/0185-01">118 S.Ct. 1151</a>. The Court then went on to explain why its departure from <em>Richardson’s </em>no-inferences rule was warranted. In short, then, it was not until <em>Gray </em>that the U.S. Supreme Court held — and, even then, only by a narrow 5^4 margin' — that inferences from other parts of the record could properly be employed to prove a <em>Bruton </em>violation.</p>

But the redaction of Elliott’s statement did not remotely convey that point on its own; instead, inference or linkage to Mangoni’s testimony is required to make that leap. That being so, under <em>Richardson, </em>which was the governing authority at the time of the trials here, Elliott’s redacted statement was properly admissible with a limiting instruction — which no doubt explains why appellant’s counsel did not object to the redaction. Furthermore, when the detective erroneously redacted Schneyder’s testimony, including her reference to appellant by name and nickname, appellant’s trial counsel acted effectively in forwarding a timely and specific objection, to which the trial court responded in a fashion which appellant has not challenged.</p>

Instead of employing the “rational application” test for retroactivity posed by the <em>Lopez </em>concurrence, the U.S. Supreme Court’s rather more sophisticated analysis focuses on whether the constitutional rule invoked by the defendant was “dictated by precedent” in existence at the relevant time. <a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="230" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">489 U.S. at 301</a>, <a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="231" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">109 S.Ct. 1060</a> (emphasis original).

That is not as facile or as just a <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>remedy as might seem. Joint trials play a vital role in the criminal justice system, accounting for almost one-third of federal criminal trials in the past five years. Many joint trials — for example, those involving large conspiracies to import and distribute illegal drugs — involve a dozen or more codefendants. Confessions by one or more of the defendants are commonplace — and indeed the probability of confession increases with the number of participants, since each has reduced assurance that he will be protected by his own silence. It would impair both the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal justice system to require, in all these cases of joint crimes where incriminating statements exist, that prosecutors bring separate proceedings, presenting the same evidence again and again, requiring victims and witnesses to repeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying, and randomly favoring the last-tried defendants who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution’s case beforehand. Joint trials generally serve the interests of justice by avoiding inconsistent verdicts and enabling more accurate assessment of relative culpability — advantages which sometimes operate to the defendant’s benefit. Even apart from these tactical considerations, joint trials generally serve the interests of justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts.</blockquote>

There is no requirement that a defendant must state before the defense presentation whether the defendant will testify or will not testify — much less is there a requirement that he be held to any stated position. Therefore, a trial court would not know whether to grant a separate trial for that defendant. The defense would be able to control the severability question by simply stating that the non-confessing defendant will not testify, when there is nothing that would prevent the defendant from testifying in a trial that was severed.</p>
    <p id="b479-6" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[167,1025,1160,784]]]'>Further, it is practically impossible to determine whether there is “no chance that the confessionary statement will prejudice the non-confessing co-defendant.” Since joint trials typically involve conspiracies, every redacted statement possesses at least a prospect of “spillover” prejudice; otherwise, such statement would be irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence of the confessing defendant. Indeed, that is why the U.S. Supreme Court created the <em>Bruton </em>exception to the rule that cautionary charges are alone always sufficient to avoid spillover prejudice. Nowhere in the law is there a “no chance of prejudice” standard when applied to evidentiary rulings. The scenario proposed by the concurrence joined by Chief Justice Zappala notwithstanding his majority authorship in <em>Wharton </em>would place a tremendous burden on the criminal justice system and be a waste of limited judicial resources.</p>
