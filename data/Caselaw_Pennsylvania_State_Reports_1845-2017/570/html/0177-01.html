A speeding motorcyclist struck their vehicle and injured both Mr. and Mrs. Burstein. Subsequently, the motorcyclist’s insurance policy surrendered the maximum amount payable under its liability limits, but failed to fully compensate the Bursteins for their injuries. This inadequacy forced the Bursteins to determine whether another insurance policy could cover their damages.</p>

The employer maintained liability insurance on the vehicle through Kemper Insurance Company, but declined uninsured motorist (UM) and UIM coverage. Although Mrs. Burstein received a Kemper insurance card, she never knew that the vehicle lacked UM and UIM coverage. Due to the employer’s declination of UM and UIM coverage, the Bur-steins could not recover UIM benefits from the Kemper policy.</p>

All of these vehicles were insured with liability, UM, and UIM coverage through Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company. The Bur-steins submitted a claim for UIM benefits under the Prudential policy. Prudential denied the claim because the policy specifically excluded regularly used, non-owned cars, such as Mrs. Burstein’s employer-provided vehicle. Thereafter, the Bursteins sued Prudential and claimed that the regularly used, non-owned car exclusion is unenforceable because it violates public policy.</p>

Judge Schiller, joined by Judges Kelly and Stevens, authored the opinion in support of affirmance. The court relied on three “prevailing policies” that, in its view, favored voiding the regularly used, non-owned car exclusion: (1) Pennsylvania’s Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1701-1799.7, hereinafter MVFRL, should be construed to provide the greatest possible coverage to injured claimants; (2) providing UIM coverage is in the public’s best interest; and (3) UIM coverage is first-party coverage and therefore “follows the person, not the vehicle.” <em>Burstein, </em><a href="/a2d/742/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="742 A.2d 684" data-case-ids="11500496" data-case-paths="/a2d/742/0684-01">742 A.2d at 687-88</a>. Thus, the court held that voiding the exclusion “furthers the aforementioned public policies by providing the greatest possible coverage to the [Bursteins], by compensating them for injuries caused by a tortfeasor who had inadequate coverage, and by allowing them to recover underinsured motorist coverage they had specifically paid for under their policy with [Prudential].” <em><a href="/a2d/742/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="742 A.2d 684" data-case-ids="11500496" data-case-paths="/a2d/742/0684-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/742/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="742 A.2d 684" data-case-ids="11500496" data-case-paths="/a2d/742/0684-01">at 688</a>.</p>

The MVFRL defines “first party benefits” as “[m]edical benefits, income loss benefits, accidental death benefits and funeral benefits.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702. First party benefits must be recovered in the following priority: (1) for a named insured, the policy on which he is the named insured; (2) for an insured, the policy covering the insured; and (3) for the occupants of an insured motor vehicle, the policy on that motor vehicle. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1713. Thus, first party coverage truly “follows the person,” as only injured claimants , who are not an “insured” under a policy of insurance may recover first party benefits from the insurer of the vehicle in which they were occupants. Conversely, the MVFRL provides an inverse priority of recovery for UM and UIM benefits. Injured claimants must first recover UM and UIM coverage from any policy covering the <em>motor vehicle </em>occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1733(a)(1). Thereafter, as a <em>secondary </em>source of recovery, claimants may recover from a policy covering a motor vehicle not involved in the accident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> <a href="/a2d/712/0741-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="712 A.2d 741" data-case-ids="11818176,507868" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0741-01,/pa/551/0605-01">Id.</a> at § 1733(a)(2).

Several dynamics affect an insurer’s risks pertaining to an insured’s regular use of a non-owned car: the type of car; the safety features of the car; the cost of repairing and maintaining the car; the miles regularly logged on the car; etc. To illustrate, if an insured’s employer-provided car offered only nominal safety features, the risk of injury would be far greater than if the insured were driving a vehicle that boasted state-of-the-art safety features. In effect, the heightened risks increase the probability that damages will exceed a tortfeasor’s liability policy <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>and, thereby, trigger an insured’s UIM coverage; once UIM coverage is invoked, the risks then increase the amount payable under the coverage.

    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[169,654,1156,1224]]]'>From a practical standpoint, Mrs. Burstein should have taken affirmative steps to determine whether the employer-provided vehicle was insured and, if so, with what types of coverage. This is especially glaring in view of Mrs. Burstein’s use of employer-provided vehicles for over eight years. Stipulated Facts at 2. Once she would have discovered the lack of UIM coverage, she would have had several options. First, she could have accepted the vulnerability of driving the vehicle without UIM coverage. While this may not have been the option preferred by Mrs. Burstein, this Commonwealth does not require UIM coverage. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(a) (requiring the offer of UM and UIM motorist coverage, but declaring that such coverage is optional). Thus, tolerating the risk of injury from an underinsured motorist was a viable option for Mrs. Burstein. Second, she could have obtained UIM coverage for the vehicle in either of two ways: she could have negotiated with her employer for it to purchase UIM coverage on the vehicle; or, if the employer refused, there is no evidence of record suggesting that Mrs. Burstein could not have purchased the coverage herself. Lastly, if Mrs. Burstein could neither obtain the desired UIM coverage nor accept the risk of driving the employer-provided vehicle without UIM coverage, then she could have refused to drive the car.</p>

Fundamental questions thus presented are: what precisely was the General Assembly’s conception of UM and UIM insurance when it first mandated such coverage; if it did not have a fixed understanding, to whom did it intend to delegate the determination of what must be offered; and have the legislative ideas in these regards changed over time?</p>

In this regard, a comprehensive review of the relevant Pennsylvania decisional law also suggests that the inconsistent judicial decisions in this area (and, in particular, the line of decisions that have voided exclusions sanctioned under duly promulgated regulations) may have had the unintended and unfortunate effect of essentially displacing the Insurance Department from its role in this regard. The remedy is not for the Court to merely abandon the regulatory role that it assumed by now reciting the phrase cost containment as a mantra, without addressing the substantial void created by this course of action in the landscape as it presently exists. Rather, I would acknowledge the conflict in the cases and endeavor to establish an appropriate and consistent understanding of the legislative scheme as it pertains to UM and UIM insurance, including the roles of the judicial and the executive branches, which expressly recognizes the critical part of the Insurance Department. In answer to the last question posed, I simply do not believe that the General Assembly’s core conception of UM and UIM coverage has changed over time.

The MVFRL defines an “insured” as the named insured, designated insureds, and certain household family members. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1702. This class of insureds has the strongest claim to portability of coverage, as their claim arises by virtue of their relationship with the named insured who maintains a contractual relationship with the insurer. Other categories of persons who may have a claim include guest occupants, who, by definition, must establish a nexus with a motor vehicle insured for UIM coverage. <em>See generally Dupin v.

Superior Court dissent, Prudential contends that the overriding policy to be effectuated in construing the MVFRL is the containment of automobile insurance costs to facilitate the offer and procurement of affordable coverage. Prudential asserts that such policy is advanced by enforce<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>ment of the regularly used non-owned car exclusion according to its terms, thus limiting insurer risks to those encompassed by written policy provisions against which premiums are measured and collected. Although Prudential concedes that most UIM policies incorporate limited portability aspects, it maintains that such is a function of contractual agreement rather than statutory mandate, determined, from the insurers’ perspective, by underwriting experience dictating an appropriate risks/premium exchange. Thus, Prudential disputes the position expressed in the Superior Court lead opinion that UIM coverage by its nature constitutes “first-party coverage,” in the sense that it must necessarily follow the person of an insured in all circumstances. Prudential emphasizes that the MVFRL does not expressly prohibit a regularly used non-owned car exclusion or specifically require that insurance policies issued with reference to particular vehicles must also cover all others regularly used by the insured or a household member. While acknowledging that UIM coverage serves the important purpose of compensating victims of underinsured motorists, Prudential cites decisions of this Court determining that such purpose does not rise to the level of a public policy overriding every other consideration of statutory construction. Prudential maintains that, by exposing it and other insurers to risks greater than contemplated by express and unambiguous policy terms, the Superior Court’s decision, if sustained, inevitably will result in higher premium charges.</p>

The Bursteins contend that such considerations have been invoked by this Court and the Superior Court to void similar exclusionary provisions, such as the “family car exclusion.” <em>See infra </em>§ I. The Bursteins also emphasize this Court’s admonition that public policy impact is to be determined in light of the particular facts presented; in <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>this regard, the Bursteins point to their purchase of UIM coverage on their own three vehicles, noting further that the decision of Mrs. Burstein’s employer not to purchase such coverage for company vehicles was beyond their control. According to the Bursteins, depriving them of UIM benefits in the circumstances would defeat their reasonable expectations concerning coverage that they believed they had obtained, particularly since no valid offer of UIM coverage for a regularly used non-owned car had been made, nor had Prudential obtained an express rejection of such coverage from the Bursteins. Both parties agree that the regularly used non-owned car exception applies by its terms to preclude the Bursteins’ recovery of UIM benefits unless contrary to public policy.</p>

In answer to the specific question presented in this case, I would conclude that the General Assembly did not intend to incorporate a fixed concept of portability into the UM/UIM provisions of the MVFRL, but rather, envisioned that the Department would play a significant role in terms of promulgating and enforcing specific required attributes for UM and UIM coverage.</p>

However, I find it significant that the Department’s decision to eliminate the other owned vehicle/household family member exclusion from the approved form defining the minimum authorized coverage was expressly predicated upon judicial decisions which are no longer valid in.light of this Court’s present interpretation of the MVFRL. <em>See Windrim, </em><a href="/pa/537/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="178" data-cite="537 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="775553" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0129-01">537 Pa. at 135</a>, <a href="/a2d/641/1154-01" class="citation" data-index="179" data-cite="641 A.2d 1154" data-case-ids="11296791,775553" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/1154-01,/pa/537/0129-01">641 A.2d at 1157</a> (recognizing the effective overruling of Bankes). On the other hand, the Department’s regulations do not appear to have ever authorized a general, regularly used non-owned car exclusion in any context. While, again, the then-extant judicial opinions may have influenced the Department’s decision not to attempt to formally modify its regulations as insurance companies gained sophistication and attempted to create additional geographic exclusions tailored to specific circumstances, there is no apparent basis upon which to predicate an affirmative conclusion in this regard. Although certainly the Department’s general regulatory ap<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>proval of UM and UIM policies which contain the exclusion constitutes some evidence of the Department’s intent, this is an insufficient basis for overlooking a formal, substantive regulation expressly delineating required minimum coverage. <em>Cf.

Certainly, affirming the Superior Court would have the effect of fostering additional change. The Insurance Department could elect to amend its regulations to align them with its present approval practices so as to allow for geographic exclusions such as the other owned vehicle/household family member and regularly used non-owned car exclusions which it determined were justified as a reasonable impingement upon the remedial objectives of the MVFRL based upon the cost containment objective.

Under the definitional provisions, a “non-owned car” is “a car which is not owned by, registered in the name of or furnished or available for the regular or frequent use of you or a household resident” (emphasis in original). Since it is undisputed that the company car in which the Bursteins were injured was available for their regular use, such car simply is not a “non-owned car” for purposes of the policy. <em>See generally Adelman, </em>386 A.2d at 538 (explaining that, “[w]hen a word used in the exclusion under scrutiny is specifically defined in the definitions section of the policy, it is that definition which must control in determining the applicability of the exclusion”) (citing <em>Great Am.

I would reinforce, however, that insurers must effectively communicate the limits of such coverage to the insured in terms that are precise, meaningful, and plain.

The principal intended significance of the policy definition of non-owned car appears to be in relation to the affirmative portability <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>provisions. By its terms, the policy covers the vehicles described in the policy <em>and </em>non-owned cars used as intended by the owner and with permission. By restricting the definition of non-owned cars to exclude those that are available for the regular or frequent use of the named insured or a household resident, the affirmative provisions of the policy themselves function in the manner of the exclusion claimed by Prudential. Before the arbitrators, however, Prudential did not frame its defense around the affirmative policy provisions or cite to the definitional language. Rather, Prudential invoked the express regularly used, non-owned car exclusion as the sole basis supporting its denial of coverage.</p>

In this regard, Mrs. Burstein stands in different shoes, since as to her claim, the arbitrators issued an award in Prudential's favor. Accordingly, in her case, Prudential benefits from the applicable review standards, and Mrs. Burstein bore the burden of issue preservation and presentation.</p>
