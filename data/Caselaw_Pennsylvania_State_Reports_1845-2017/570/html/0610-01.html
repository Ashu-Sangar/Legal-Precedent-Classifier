As Appellant proceeded through the checkpoint, a police officer requested that he produce his license and registration and asked him several questions. The police officer questioning Appellant detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Appellant and his vehicle, and asked him to step out of his vehicle and into an area adjacent to the checkpoint so that the police could administer field sobriety tests. After Appellant failed two such tests, the police arrested him, advised him of his constitutional rights, and provided him with implied consent warnings. Shortly thereafter, Appellant consented to having his blood drawn for the purpose of testing his blood alcohol content (“BAC”). A registered nurse, who was at the checkpoint with the police, withdrew a sample of Appellant’s blood approximately thirty minutes after he was stopped. A state-certified laboratory subsequently performed an analysis of the blood, which revealed that Appellant’s BAC was .241 percent.</p>

In reaching this conclusion, we relied on Pa.R.Crim.P 114 (“Rule 114”) (formerly Pa.R.Crim.P. 9025), which sets forth the obligations of the clerk of courts as follows:</p>

Further, I have little difficulty treating the docket deficiencies and the Commonwealth’s attestation to not having received the order as circumstantial evidence tending to support Appellant’s allegation that the Rule 1925 order was not properly delivered. Although I recognize the Court has moved in the direction of strict treatment of waiver principles, since these have their roots in prudential considerations, <em>see generally Interactive Gift Express, Inc. v.
