In 1984, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State Police (the “State Police”) began providing pre-termination hearings before review panels to probationary troopers facing employment termination for poor performance. The State Police afforded the probationary troopers designated for dismissal advance notice of any witnesses that would be appearing against them and permitted representation by counsel (or another) and presentation of responsive evidence. In 1993, following discussions between the State Police and the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association (the “Association”), the bargaining representative for troopers, the State Police also began providing pre-termination hearings in disciplinary matters. In conjunction with dismissals of Troopers David T. Burns and Scott C. Shade in 1995, however, the State Police attempted to eliminate the pre-termination procedure, and the <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>Association responded by filing an unfair labor practice charge with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (the “PLRB” or the “Board”). Prior to a hearing on that charge, however, the State Police and the Association reached an agreement (the “Burns and Shade Agreement”), providing for post-termination hearings and specifying procedures for accomplishing this task, with mutual reservation of rights pertaining to future disputes regarding whether bargaining was required in order to eliminate pre-termination hearings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Despite such reservation, the State Police continued to apply the procedure outlined in the Burns and Shade Agreement, until 1998.</p>

Encin that he was dismissed from employment, effective June 2, 1998. Although indicating that Trooper Encin’s dismissal was based upon a hypoglycemic episode, in which he was observed in an altered state of consciousness requiring medical treatment, the letter did not provide for any type of pre-termination hearing. Similarly, the State Police provided probationary Trooper Gerald T. Devlin with written notice of his dismissal effective two days after the date of the notice. Again, although the correspondence delineated the basis for this employment decision (reckless operation of a motor vehicle that resulted in the death of another), it contained no mention of pre-termination procedure. When the Association learned of the State Police’s renewed efforts to eliminate the hearing practice, it filed another unfair labor practice charge, asserting unilateral alteration of a term and condition of <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>employment in violation of Sections 6(l)(a) and 6(l)(e) of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act (“PLRA”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

At the outset, the hearing examiner recognized that an employer generally will be found to have committed an unfair labor practice when it unilaterally alters a bargainable term and condition of employment, as compared to changing course in a matter subject to managerial prerogative that is not subject to bargaining. <em>See <a href="/a2d/753/0803-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="753 A.2d 803" data-case-ids="11213247,225997" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0803-01,/pa/562/0113-01">id.</a> </em>at 4 (citing <em>Plumstead Twp. v.

In distinguishing between these categories of decisions, the hearing examiner viewed procedural matters as more closely associated with bargainable terms and conditions, and substantive decisionmaking as more closely aligned with managerial prerogative. Further, the hearing examiner invoked the traditional rational relationship test in evaluating the required nexus between the subject matter of the decision involved and the appropriate category of decisionmaking. <em>See PSTA v.

Further, the hearing examiner viewed the pre-termination hearings as a matter of procedure, as opposed to substance, particularly since such proceedings merely permitted probationary troopers the opportunity to defend themselves, but did not infringe upon the criteria employed by the State Police in making dismissal decisions. <em>See <a href="/a2d/693/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="693 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="11984665,960556" data-case-paths="/a2d/693/0190-01,/pa/548/0001-01">id.</a> </em>For this reason, the hearing examiner concluded that the affordance of hearings was more closely related to the probationary ti-oopers’ interest in terms and conditions of their employment than to the State Police’s managerial prerogative to establish employment qualifications. <em>See <a href="/a2d/693/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="693 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="11984665,960556" data-case-paths="/a2d/693/0190-01,/pa/548/0001-01">id.</a> </em>Thus, he concluded that elimination of the hearing procedure was a matter subject to bargaining. By way of remedy, the hearing examiner recommended that the State Police be directed to offer pre-termination hearings to probationary troopers who already had been dismissed, and cease and desist from refusing to negotiate with the Association concerning the matter. <em>See id. </em>at 5-6.</p>

While the Board did not dispute the assertion that the State Police possessed broad discretion to terminate probationary troopers as provided in Section 205(f) of the Administrative Code of 1929, 71 P.S. § 65(f), the Board concluded that probationary troopers need not be removed from Act Ill’s ambit to comply with this statutory directive. <em>See PSTA v.

The PLRB pointed out that application of the rational relationship test is not grounded in constitutional considerations, but rather, entailed the task, arising in the labor law setting, of balancing the employers’ managerial interest in controlling the disputed term and the effect of the employer’s actions on the employees. <em>See PSTA v.

Further, I am in full agreement with the PLRB’s reasoning distinguishing <em>Pipkin </em>as involving constitutional, as opposed to statutory or contractual entitlements, and reconciling Section 205(1) of the Administrative Code as speaking to discretion in the substantive decision-making process, but not as prohibiting the application of non-determinative, pre-termination procedure.

As applied to probationary troopers, however, this holding was in tension with various statutory provisions affording substantial and largely inviolable deference to the sound judgment of public employers. <em>See, e.g., Upper Makefield, </em><a href="/pa/562/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="562 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="225997" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0113-01">562 Pa. at 119</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0803-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="753 A.2d 803" data-case-ids="11213247,225997" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0803-01,/pa/562/0113-01">753 A.2d at </a>806-07 (citing 53 P.S. § 812); 71 P.S. § 65(f). <em>See generally Township of Sugarloaf </em><a href="/a2d/722/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="722 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="11768230" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0246-01">722 A.2d at 248-49</a>. While it is not apparent from the face of the decision, the <em>Upper Makefield </em>Court was therefore bound to deny probationary troopers the full benefit of Act 111 precisely because the Court previously had read Act 111 broadly to subsume a statutory entitlement to an insulated grievance arbitration procedure that simply could not be made available to probationary troopers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

The at-will status of employees in the labor context, however, can be taken only so far, since this characterization applies to most employees in the marketplace prior to the conferral of rights by virtue of collective bargaining, and therefore, represents only a starting point for the assessment of entitlements conferred or gained in labor cases. Further, as previously noted, the statutory grant of discretion to the State Police in relation to the retention of probationary troopers does not prohibit the implementation of procedures that are not inconsistent with its exercise. <em>See supra. </em>Here, the PLRB rendered a decision, supported in the record, that the pre-termination practices were such that they did not interfere or conflict with the legislatively protected discretion. Finally, <em>Upper Makefield </em>is distinguishable from the present case in that the PLRB’s decision under review here establishes, as a matter of fact, a past practice on the part of the State Police, which forms the predicate for a bargainable term and condition.

Its general protections are therefore facially available to probationary troopers, through their authorized representatives, as these troopers are subject to police duty assignments and are not excluded by the Act; moreover, this plain meaning interpretation is strongly advocated by the PLRB, the administrative agency vested with Act 111 oversight responsibility.

I did not participate in the <em>Betancourt </em>decision, as it pre-dated my tenure on the Court, and would not have reached the same conclusion. Act Ill’s insulated procedure for arbitration was expressly crafted in the context of interest arbitration arising out of a bargaining impasse and made available to the public employer and collective bargaining unit. <em>See </em>43 P.S. §§ 217.4-217.7. Act 111 contains no specific provision pertaining to individual grievance arbitration, and good reason exists to differentiate legislative purposes related to impasses and grievances, since bargaining impasses implicate a far more immediate and direct potential for destabilization in the workforce (the seminal concern of Act 111) than does the resolution of individual grievances. <em>See generally Philadelphia Fire Officers Ass’n v. PLRB, </em><a href="/pa/470/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="470 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1723803" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0550-01">470 Pa. 550</a>, 553-54, <a href="/pa/470/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="470 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1723803" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0550-01">369 A.2d 259</a>, 260 (1977) (explaining that Act 111, to prevent strikes by police and fire personnel, provides for collective bargaining and compulsory and binding arbitration in the event of an impasse). In light of this distinction, Act 111 's isolated and general reference to settlement of grievances or disputes in accordance with the terms of the enactment, 43 P.S. § 217.1, could have been read as an allusion to grievance <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>procedure established through the Act 111 bargaining process. Alternatively, the clause also could have been read as utilizing the terms grievances and disputes synonymously to refer to differences between the collective unit and the employer in bargaining, particularly as the pertinent provision bears the title “right to bargain,” speaks to righls exercised “through labor organizations or other representatives designated by fifty percent or more of such policemen,” and in all other respects is concerned with the rights and interests of the unit. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 217.1.</p>

I would not have joined <em>Upper Makefield, </em>however, had I foreseen that it would be interpreted so broadly as to preclude a class of policemen from benefiting from the terms and conditions of their employment as discerned by the PLRB in its factfinding capacity and in application of its administrative expertise.</p>

The PLRB highlights that, in order to deprive probationary troopers of Act Ill’s express protections, it would be necessary to effectively exclude (hem from the collective bargaining unit; since the legislation’s stated terms inure in favor of the interests of the collective body, as long as the troopers are members of the Association, Act 11 l's benefits flow to them. Indeed, all parties to this case agree that probationary troopers should not be excluded from the Association. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief of Appellee Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Police, at 13 (“The Commonwealth Court's decision [applying <em>Upper </em>Makefield] does not ... deprive probationary employees of the right to have the terms and conditions of their employment, for the duration of the probationary period, determined through the bargaining process.”).</p>
      <p id="b711-6" data-blocks='[["BL_711.6",711,[208,1934,1123,430]]]'>Notably, if probationary troopers, who are undeniably public employees, are said to fall outside the ambit of Act 111, they would facially be covered by the express terms of the Public Employe Relations Act (PERA), which defines a public employee as “any individual employed by a public employer but shall not include ... those employes covered under [Act 111].” 43 P.S. § 1101.301(2). Since, however, PERA confers not only a right to collectively bargain, but also the entitlement to strike under certain circumstances, <em>see </em>43 P.S. §§ 1101.701, 1101.1003, its direct application to any category of troopers would be inimical to Act Ill's purposes in limiting the recourse available to essential police and fire personnel in impasse situations.</p>
