Snizaski and four minor children survived Decedent. At the time of the fatal accident, Decedent was driving a 1996 Ford Explorer that Rox Coal had provided to him as a term of his employment. Rox Coal had hired Decedent on March 18, 1996, to work as a coal mine superintendent. In this position, Decedent was in charge of the operations of two mines (Diamond T-B and Diamond T-C), whose offices and main entries were located at one site.</p>

Rox Coal’s company car policy provided that the assigned driver shall “[o]bey all driving laws, speed limits, etc.” and “[djrivers and passengers [must] use seat belts at all times.” (Reproduced Record “R.R.” at 207a).</p>
    <p id="b167-7" data-blocks='[["BL_167.6",167,[143,1549,1159,634]]]'>The WCJ clarified that the issues before her were: (1) whether Decedent was a traveling employee; (2) whether Decedent was on special assignment for Rox Coal at the time of the accident; (3) whether the accident occurred while Decedent was furthering the business of Rox Coal; (4) whether Decedent’s employment contract included transportation to and from work; and (5) whether the accident occurred as a result of Decedent’s violation of the law or company policy. The WCJ determined that Rox Coal provided the vehicle to Decedent as part of his salary package; the WCJ found credible Snizaski’s testimony that Decedent never used the vehicle for anything other than traveling to and from work.</p>

Having found that Rox Coal established both affirmative defenses, the WCJ denied and dismissed the Fatal Claim Petition filed by Snizaski.</p>
    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[274,758,1154,734]]]'>Snizaski appealed to the WCAB, asserting that: (1) the WCJ failed to properly determine whether the special circumstance exception applied; and (2) the WCJ erred in concluding that Decedent’s alleged violations of law and company policy obviated Rox Coal’s responsibility to pay fatal claim benefits to Snizaski and her children. The WCAB agreed with the WCJ that Decedent’s employment contract did include transportation to and from work. The WCAB held, therefore, that Snizaski had established that Decedent’s injury fell within the first exception to the going and coming rule. The WCAB then limited its ensuing discussion to Rox Coal’s affirmative defenses, whether Decedent violated law or company policy within the ambit of section 301(a) of the Act and <em>Nevin Trucking, </em>respectively.</p>

The rule articulated in <em>Folino </em>created an exception to the general proposition that only felony and misdemeanor convictions could be introduced at subsequent civil proceedings. <em>See Hurtt v.

In <em>Hurtt, </em>we reasoned that summary offenses could not be introduced because expediency and convenience, rather than guilt, often controlled the response of the accused to these charges. In <em>Folino, </em>we reasoned that where the summary offense is a necessary operative fact in a felony or misdemeanor conviction, the accused “had adequate incentive to contest the issue and an adequate forum in which to litigate.” <em>Folino, </em><a href="/pa/523/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="523 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="1820287" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0532-01">523 Pa. at 536</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="523 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="1820287" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0532-01">568 A.2d at 173</a>.

Additionally, the WCAB held that the police accident report was uncorrob<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>orated hearsay and was insufficient to support the Findings of Fact of the WCJ that Decedent violated the law or company policy.

    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[267,591,1157,938]]]'>Rox Coal petitioned the WCAB for reconsideration and, simultaneously, appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which stayed the appeal pending resolution of the Petition for Reconsideration. Rox Coal argued that the WCJ properly relied on the police accident report to support its conclusion that Decedent violated the law and company policy, pursuant to section 301(a) and <em>Nevin Trucking, </em>and that the 1993 amendments to section 301(c)(1) of the Act, codified at 77 P.S. § 411(1),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> eliminated the first exception to the going and coming rule. The WCAB first reiterated that the police accident report did not constitute sufficient evidence to establish a violation of law or company policy. The WCAB then opined that the Act had been amended in 1993 to eliminate the employment contract exception to the going and coming rule. However, “because the issue was not raised before the WCJ and not cross or protectively appealed by [Rox Coal] to this Board, we consider this issue waved [sic].” Opinion of the WCAB on Reconsideration dated June 13, 2000, at 9.</p>

      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>The WCAB then discussed Snizaski’s contention that the WCJ erred in finding that the “special circumstances” exception to the going and coming rule did not apply. Because Rox Coal required Decedent to be constantly available to respond to emergencies at the Rox Coal facilities, the WCAB held that Decedent’s travel to and from work satisfied the special circumstances exception. Therefore, the WCAB reaffirmed its position that Decedent was injured while in the course of his employment and, accordingly, Snizaski and her children were entitled to fatal claim benefits pursuant to the Act.</p>

The Commonwealth Court refused to address the procedural issue of whether Rox Coal waived its argument regarding the 1993 amendments, preferring to address the underlying substantive question. The court determined that the 1993 amendments to the Act did not abrogate the employment contract exception to the going and coming rule as it had consistently recognized the exception in the post-1993 amendments era. <em>See, e.g., Wells Fargo Company v.

However, as we have determined that the WCAB properly rejected consideration of the police accident report, there is no evidence on the Record of Decedent’s alleged violations of law and, accordingly, this issue is rendered moot.</p>
