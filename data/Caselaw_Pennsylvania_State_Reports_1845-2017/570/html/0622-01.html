    <blockquote id="b732-9" data-blocks='[["BL_732.8",732,[299,1105,1119,899]]]'>On the evening of April 26, 1994, [Marinelli], his brother, Mark Marinelli (Mark), and [co-defendant Thomas] Kirchoff met at [Marinelli’s] apartment to plan a burglary of the residence of Conrad Dumchock (Dumchock), whom Mark knew to have stereo equipment. The three men obtained weapons, disguises, and gloves in preparation for the bur-, glary, and proceeded to Dumchock’s home in Kulpmont. Dumchock was home alone and had just spoken to his sister and brother-in-law on the telephone for forty-five minutes. The Marinelli brothers and Kirchoff arrived at Dumchock’s home and initially had difficulty gaining entry. Observing that Dumchock’s car was parked outside his house and concerned about the possibility of being discovered, the threesome left Dumchock’s residence but returned a few minutes later to again attempt to enter. Eventually, they broke a small window in the kitchen door and entered the residence.</blockquote>

When Dumchock requested that [Marinelli] leave his home, [Marinelli] struck Dumchock’s face with his gun and yelled for assistance from Mark and Kirchoff. <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>[Marinelli] and Kirchoff continued to beat Dumchock, despite Dumchock’s pleading with them to take what they wanted and leave him alone. The three rummaged through Dumchock’s home looking for items to take and asking Dumchock where his guns and money were located. When Dumchock would moan or not answer, [Marinelli] would hit Dumchock again.</blockquote>

[Marinelli] then shot Dumchock twice in the head, with one shot into Dumchock’s eye and the other directly between Dumchock’s eyes. [Marinelli] then ran out of Dumchock’s house and exclaimed, “Let’s get out of here!”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b733-6" data-blocks='[["BL_733.5",733,[213,1081,1113,947]]]'>The threesome returned to Kirchoff s home and divided the items stolen from Dumchock. A short while later, the Marinelli brothers returned to Dumchock’s house and took a motorcycle from the victim’s porch. [Marinelli] attempted to start the motorcycle on compression, with Mark following in a car. They were observed crossing the main road in Kulpmont heading toward the other side of town. When the motorcycle would not start, [Marinelli] abandoned it. On the morning following the killing, Clyde Metzger, who was waiting for Dumchock to drive him to work, entered the victim’s home and discovered Dumchock’s stereo equipment had been disarranged and Dumchock’s dog was shaking. Metzger called out to Dumchock but received no response. Metzger became concerned and left Dumchock’s home, and headed to the police station. On his way there, Metzger encountered a Kulpmont Police Sergeant Detective Robert Muldowney, and related to him the circumstances he had found.</blockquote>

Inside the house, Sergeant Muldowney discovered that telephone cords had been cut.

Sergeant Muldowney noted that Dumchock’s bedroom was disheveled, with drawers removed from the dresser and various items strewn on the victim’s bed. Pennsylvania State Police and County Coroner Richard Ulrich were called to the scene. The victim’s sister also arrived at his house and noted that Dumchock’s motorcycle was missing. The motorcycle was later recovered hidden in some brush where it had been abandoned. Dumchock’s brother-in-law informed police that guns, tools, and electronic equipment were also missing from Dumchock’s residence. One of Dumchock’s friends, David Dormer, was brought to Dumchock’s residence to assist police in determining which stereo equipment, as well as liquor, was missing.</blockquote>

These weapons were later identified as having belonged to the victim. County Coroner Ulrich was at the Coal Township police station when Ms. Chamberlain turned over these weapons. The coroner connected the items with the Dumchock killing, and notified the District Attorney and State Police. Further, Ms. Chamberlain allowed Shamokin Police to come to her home and remove other items Mark had left there, including a telephone answering machine. Coroner Ulrich recognized the telephone answering machine as being of the type reported missing from Dumchock’s house, and he notified the State Police.</blockquote>

A search of [Marinelli’s] residence by police recovered a number of items, including stereo equipment, later identified as property belonging to the victim. After being questioned by police, [Marinelli] gave police both an oral and a taped confession as to his involvement in the Dumchock killing.</blockquote>

The PCRA court did not give Marinelli a clear and unambiguous directive to fully re-brief in the Post-Hearing Memorandum all issues that he wished to preserve. Accordingly, we refuse to conclude that Marinelli’s decision to incorporate his lengthy First Amended Petition by reference, instead of repeating the identical arguments, operated as an abandonment of the issues fully briefed in the First Amended Petition.

Through this line of questioning, Rosini attempted to establish the possibility that Dumchock was not conscious at the time he was shot through the eye, which would militate against the aggravating circumstance of torture. Rosini testified at the PCRA hearing that his cross-examination of Dr. Mihalakis was designed to elicit a response that Dumchock could have been dead when he was shot, providing an alternate reason why Dumchock’s eyes were open. (PCRA N.T., 1/24/00 — 1/27/00, at 234-235). We find that Rosini effectively cross-examined Dr. Mihalakis on the torture aggravating circumstance and, accordingly, Marinelli has failed to prove that Rosini rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard.</p>

Mark testified before the PCRA court that Judge Sacavage and other members of the prosecution team instructed him to lie to the jury. However, during the course of his testimony, Mark invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate himself and the PCRA court ordered his testimony stricken. Without Mark’s testimony that he was told to perjure himself by the prosecution and in light of the testimony of Judge Sacavage that he in no way asked or told Mark to alter his testimony, we cannot find that Judge Sacavage impermissibly instructed Mark to perjure himself before the trial jury.</p>

In particular, my difference with the majority relates to Dr. Mihalakis’s opinion, predicated on the position of spent firearm shell casings, as to Appellant’s location at the time that he shot the victim. The majority acknowledges that Appellant’s claim in this regard may have arguable merit (as the testimony was outside the area of expertise for which Dr. Mihalakis was qualified), but reasons that counsel pin-sued a reasonable strategy in acceding to the admission of the evidence, since Appellant’s location at the time of the killing was irrelevant to the defense strategy. This conclusion, however, does not comport with the trial l-ecord. <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>Appellant offered no testimony or evidence in his own defense at the guilt phase of trial. Rather, as reflected in trial counsel’s closing statement, his defense was predicated largely on a statement that he had given to police after the killing in which he admitted his involvement, but claimed to have acted under compulsion from his brother, Mark Marinelli. <em>See </em>N.T., May 8-19, 1995, at 744-54 (defense counsel guilt phase closing speech). Specifically, Appellant claimed that he and his brother were standing inside the doorway of a particular bedroom on the upper floor of the victim’s house when: Mark Marinelli instructed Appellant to kill the victim; Appellant refused; Mark Marinelli produced a gun, pointed it at Appellant, and threatened to kill him if he did not comply; and Appellant, feeling threatened, walked from the bedroom to a position approximately five feet from the victim and fired the fatal shots. <em>See </em>N.T., May 8-19, 1995, at 633-86. Counsel also relied upon Appellant’s statement as a basis for suggesting that the victim may already have been dead at the time Appellant shot him. <em>See id. </em>at 751-51. The aim of the defense was for the jury to credit this statement (or at least for a reasonable doubt to arise by its account), thereby militating against a finding of the culpability necessary to support a verdict of first-degree murder.</p>

The intent and effect of this testimony was to undermine Appellant’s statement and, correspondingly, the foundation for his defense. <em>See </em>N.T., May 8-19, 1995, at 831 (prosecutor’s guilt-phase closing) (arguing, in rebuttal to Appellant’s version of events, “[a]nd there is no explanation whatsoever [under Appellant’s theory of the case] why the casing should be over here[;] Dr. Mihalakis says you can’t believe thatL;][t]hat is impossible”). While trial counsel may have suggested in the <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>post-conviction proceedings that Dr. Mihalakis’ testimony was consistent with the defense theory of the case, he obviously was of a different mind as of trial, when he argued:</p>

    <p id="b762-7" data-blocks='[["BL_762.6",762,[256,1103,1159,366]]]'>N.T., May 8-19, 1995, at 747 (defense counsel guilt-phase closing) (emphasis added). The majority is correct that the defense strategy was to “mitigate [Appellant’s] involvement” in the killing; however, it misses the point that Dr. Mihalakis’s opinion was offered precisely to establish the aggravated degree of Appellant’s participation. I therefore cannot agree with the majority’s reasonable strategy assessment.</p>
    <p id="b762-8" data-blocks='[["BL_762.7",762,[252,1492,1161,745]]]'>I would hold, however, that Appellant has failed to establish the necessary prejudice regarding this claim, since Dr. Mihalakis’s stray opinion testimony was sufficiently cumulative of substantial, properly admitted evidence. For example, testimony concerning Appellant’s proximity to the victim at the time of the killing based on an examination of one of the gunshot wounds substantially undermined Appellant’s version of the encounter, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T., May 8-19, 1995, at 184 (direct examination of Dr. Mihalakis) (describing a wound to the victim’s head as “near contact”), as did other evidence. Thus, while a closer question might be presented, in my mind, had this claim arisen as one entailing trial error subject to harmless error review, I agree with the majority’s ultimate conclusion that no relief is due at the post-conviction stage.</p>
    <p id="b762-9" data-blocks='[["BL_762.8",762,[253,2262,1151,98]],["BL_763.1",763,[184,325,1158,1079]]]'>Additionally, in rejecting Appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to produce a defense expert to <a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>rebut Dr. Mihalakis, the majority relies on the same conclusion that the defense theory of the case at trial was consistent with the Commonwealth’s expert evidence. I therefore disagree with the majority’s (and the PCRA court’s) finding of reasonable basis in relation to this claim for the reasons stated above. Again, while trial counsel attempted to reconcile the physical evidence with his theory of the case, it cannot reasonably be disputed that Dr. Mihalakis’s conclusions concerning the import of the physical evidence were antagonistic to the defense. Further, the defense strategy in the attempt to reconcile the Commonwealth’s evidence with Appellant’s own self-inculpatory statement, characterized by shifting and spreading of blame and rendered out of the presence of the jury, was a weak one, particularly in light of the inherent unreliability of such statements. Finally, I disagree with the majority that defense counsel’s re-elicitation of a Commonwealth witness’s direct testimony constitutes such effective cross-examination as would obviate the call for contrary defense evidence. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 1270 (quoting cross-examination of Dr. Mihalakis).</p>
    <p id="b763-5" data-blocks='[["BL_763.4",763,[186,1449,1156,916]]]'>Nevertheless, regardless of the appropriate decision concerning the reasonable strategy prong of the ineffectiveness test, I would find no relief due on the prejudice prong of the inquiry. The expert testimony offered by Appellant at the PCRA hearing, if believed, might bring into question the scientific validity of particular conclusions by Dr. Mihalakis, <em>see </em>N.T., Jan. 27, 2000, at 439-49, thus fostering some potential for doubt concerning the weight that should be accorded those specific opinions. But, since it does nothing to affirmatively support Appellant’s theory of the case, which was presented to the jury only indirectly (via Appellant’s statement to police as related during the Commonwealth’s case) and in argument and was contradicted by other evidence not addressed by Appellant’s post-conviction expert, it is not sufficient, in my view, to create the requisite controversy regarding the reliability of the verdict to support an award of post-conviction relief.</p>
