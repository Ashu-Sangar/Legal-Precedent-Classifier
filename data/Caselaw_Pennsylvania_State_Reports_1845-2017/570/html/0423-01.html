Hursh, and driven by Loren J. Druist. In a civil action commenced in Allegheny County against Marbec, Hursh, Druist, and others, Appellees Blanche M. and James E. Hoover averred that Druist failed to observe a traffic signal, causing the truck to strike the automobile driven by Mrs. Hoover, who sustained serious injuries. Marbec’s insurer, Appellant Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, filed the present declaratory judgment action naming the parties to the underlying action as defendants and seeking a judicial determination concerning its obligations under the policy issued to Marbec.</p>

According to Progressive, because Hursh’s tractor-trailer was transporting its cargo between two points within Pennsylvania, it was necessarily engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce. Appellees’ position was that the carriage via Hursh’s truck represented merely the final leg of a continuous, interstate shipment, since the truck’s contents previously had moved between states. To further contextualize the question, the parties attached to their submissions transcripts from deposition testimony adduced from parties and witnesses.</p>

The shipment derived from an order placed approximately one month prior to the accident by the Pennsylvania Agricultural Commodities Marketing Association, Inc. (“PACMA”), a grain broker,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> with the Jesse Stewart Co. (“Jesse Stewart”), a grain wholesaler that sells primarily to feed mills in Pennsylvania. PACMA requested to purchase fifteen truckloads of the grain, or approximately 345 tons. Jesse Stewart’s usual practice was to wait until it had accumulated enough orders to warrant the purchase of a bargeload (1,000 to 1,500 tons) of distiller’s grain, and then arrange for a barge to transport the commodity from the producer’s Illinois distillery to a storage facility owned and operated by Clairton Slag in West Elizabeth, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> There, Clairton Slag un<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>loaded, stored, and loaded grain onto trucks at Jesse Stewart’s expense, with some trucks being commissioned by Jesse Stewart for delivery to its customers and others by the customers themselves. In the case of customers, including PACMA, making their own arrangements for land transportation, title to the grain transferred upon loading at the Clairton Slag facility.</p>

Moreover, the depositions do not reflect knowledge on the part of Jesse Stewart of the ultimate destination of the relevant portion (one of fifteen truckloads) of the distiller’s grain. This destination was Kreider’s Feed Mill in Loysville, Perry County, Pennsylvania (PACMA’s customer), with PACMA arranging for the transportation with Marbec as the carrier. The timing of the lodging of the order of Kreider’s Feed Mill with PACMA is also not clear.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>Based on the above, the common pleas court denied Progressive’s motion for summary judgment and granted the Hoovers’, noting that even though the route of a shipment may be entirely within a single state (here, West Elizabeth to Loysville, Pennsylvania), the shipment may nevertheless be part of a larger, continuing movement in interstate commerce. <em>See Texas v. United States, </em><a href="/f2d/866/1546-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="866 F.2d 1546" data-case-ids="10538484" data-case-paths="/f2d/866/1546-01">866 F.2d 1546</a>, 1553 (5th Cir.1989). The common pleas court explained that whether a particular shipment is interstate or intrastate depends upon the essential character of the commerce — the primary determinant of which is the shipper’s fixed, persisting intent at the time of shipment — and that all of the circumstances surrounding the shipment at issue are to be considered in ascertaining the shipper’s prevailing intent. <em>See Century Indem. Co. v. Carlson, </em><a href="/f3d/133/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="133 F.3d 591" data-case-ids="22345" data-case-paths="/f3d/133/0591-01">133 F.3d 591</a>, 595 (8th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Roberts v.

It would ultimately be shipped to Jesse Stewart’s customers at various locations in Pennsylvania based upon preexisting orders.

The Superior Court also agreed with the common pleas court’s position that Jesse Stewart was the relevant shipper, and Jesse Stewart’s intent was to move the grain as far into Pennsylvania as barge transportation would allow, with the understanding that the product’s ultimate destination beyond the warehouse had already been determined when PACMA’s customers placed their orders. <em>See Hoover, </em><a href="/a2d/768/1157-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="768 A.2d 1157" data-case-ids="11120381" data-case-paths="/a2d/768/1157-01">768 A.2d at 1161-62</a>. In response to Progressive’s argument that the common pleas court erred in focusing on Jesse Stewart rather than PACMA as the shipper (since title to the distillers grain passed to PACMA in West Elizabeth and PACMA arranged the relevant carriage by Marbec), the Superior Court cited <em>Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau v.

That being the case, the Hoovers contend, it is irrelevant that Jesse Stewart did not arrange the West Elizabeth-to-Loysville leg of the journey, as the ICC’s two-shipper rule should not apply where, as here, it is evident that the party in control of the inbound shipment intended from the start that the shipment would move beyond the storage facility in a substantially continuous fashion. According to the Hoovers, therefore, the common pleas court and the Superior Court properly focused on Jesse Stewart’s intent as determinative of the interstate character of the transportation. Alternatively, the Hoovers assert that PACMA can be viewed as the initial shipper, since, although it did not directly arrange the inbound shipment of the distillers grain, it set the shipment in motion by placing an order for a specific product that it knew to be manufactured in Illinois, with the intent to have the product transported to Loysville, Pennsylvania.</p>

In response, the ICC implemented regulations requiring that leases entered into by ICC-licensed carriers contain a provision stating that the authorized carrier maintain “exclusive possession, control, and use of the equipment for the duration of the lease,” and "assume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment for the duration of the lease.” <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201057.12" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 1057.12">49 C.F.R. § 1057.12</a>(c) (superseded). Further, the ICC required that all ICC-certified carriers maintain insurance or other form of surety “conditioned to pay any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles” under the carrier’s permit. <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201043.1" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 1043.1">49 C.F.R. § 1043.1</a> (superseded).

Such practice, particularly in the form of “trip leasing” (leasing an owner-operator's vehicle for a single trip), was inimical to the protection of the public, as the equipment of these exempt owner-operators was often unsafe and poorly maintained; in addition, regardless of whether the owner-operators had adequate insurance of their own, the agreements with the carrier-lessees designated them as independent contractors, thereby enabling the carrier-lessees to avoid liability arising from accidents in which the leased vehicles were involved. <em>See Integral, </em><a href="/f2d/930/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="930 F.2d 258" data-case-ids="10541954" data-case-paths="/f2d/930/0258-01">930 F.2d at 261</a>; <em>Empire, </em>868 F.2d at 362; <em>Rediehs, </em><a href="/ne2d/491/1006-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="491 N.E.2d 1006" data-case-ids="11026522" data-case-paths="/ne2d/491/1006-01">491 N.E.2d at 1010</a>.</p>
