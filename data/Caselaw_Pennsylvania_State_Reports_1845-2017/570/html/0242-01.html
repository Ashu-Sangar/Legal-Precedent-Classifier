Appellant, Tribune Review Newspaper Company, published a newspaper article on September 27, 1997, stating that several historic buildings, including the building containing Appellee’s business, were set for demolition. On February 18, 1998, Appellant published another newspaper article, stating that the building containing Appellee’s business had been demolished. However, the building containing Appellee’s business had neither been scheduled for demolition, nor had it been demolished.</p>

Appellant filed an answer, new matter and motion for judgment on the pleadings, contending that Appellee’s claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations for defamation actions set forth in Section 5523(1).</p>

    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[182,1143,1156,940]]]'>The Superior Court reversed, offering two reasons why Section 5523(1) did not control. First, the Superior Court characterized Section 5523(1) as solely governing the tort of defamation, which protects against damage to one’s reputation, as opposed to the tort of commercial disparagement,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which protects one’s economic interests against pecuniary loss. Since Appellee’s claim did not require proof of injury to reputation, the Superior Court found Section 5523(1) inapplicable by its plain language. Second, because a commercial disparagement plaintiff must prove special damages, the Superior Court concluded that the one-year statute of limitations found in Section 5523(1) was inappropriate because “[ujnlike the harm associated with defamation, a showing of actual pecuniary loss may not be calculable within one year.” <em>Pro Golf Mfg., Inc., v.

We therefore hold that the statute of limitations for slander is the same whether the slander involves property or the person.
