Thus, PNI began to explore the feasibility of moving its facilities, and up to 900 employees, to a new suburban location. The city’s mayor, Stephen Reed, made several proposals to PNI in an attempt to make PNI’s remaining in the city a viable option. The first two proposals did not include tax increment financing and PNI rejected them. The third proposal that Mayor Reed offered included tax increment financing and sites for PNI’s construction of an office tower and parking garage at a central downtown location. PNI accepted this proposal.</p>

In order to do this, the City and HRA first had to acquire the properties that made up the project site and demolish existing structures on those properties.</p>

Initially, the City intended to apply some of the EDP grant toward the demolition costs, however, since the actual land acquisition costs exceeded prior estimates, all of the EDP grant was applied toward the cost of land acquisition and administration of the grant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Although the parties could not agree on stipulated facts, an evidentiary hearing was not held; only documentary evidence was presented for the Board’s consideration.

Initially, we note, as did the Board, that the fact pattern before us is unique. The circumscribed role of the City in the building project was to prepare and deliver vacant land. Once the City completed its contracts for asbestos removal and demolition, and conveyed the property to PNI, its limited involvement in the development of the property ceased altogether. <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>The City will evidently not be a party to any post-conveyance construction contract. <em>Other than possible state financing addressed in issue three below, no post-conveyance construction contracts will be paid for in whole or in part until public funds. </em>Thus, the factual scenario before us is unlike other situations in which a public body contracts for work which is to be paid for entirely with public monies.</blockquote>

By consenting to participate in a tax increment financing district, the taxing bodies agree to temporarily forego revenue increments that would otherwise result from improvements to the property. <em>See </em>53 P.S. §§ 6930.7, 6930.9(d). The method by which the tax increments are applied to construction costs is described in the testimony as a financing “loop.” A local government authority may issue tax increment bonds, the proceeds of which can be used to pay development costs, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 6930.9(2); in the present case, this occurred via a loan to the project owner (a PNI subsidiary). As work progresses, the project owner must tender to the taxing bodies both the base real estate tax (the predevelopment amount), as well as the tax increment resulting from improvements. The taxing entities retain the base tax as revenues but are required to allocate and furnish the increments to the issuing authority, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 6930.7, which monies can be disbursed for payment of the debt service for the bonds, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 6930.9(h), thereby completing the loop.

First, direct payment of development costs is accomplished by the project owner (as occurred here), such that, to the extent that the taxing bodies’ agreement to forego potential tax increments can be viewed as public financing, this occurs in the project background. The taxing bodies’ statutorily prescribed role in terms of calculation, collection, temporary retention, and disbursement of increments is ministerial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In conditioning prevailing wage obligations upon the payment of construction costs from public funds, Appellants argue, persuasively, that the General Assembly contemplated more direct and substantial involvement of a public body. Significantly, the financing arrangements were not structured in an effort to avoid prevailing wage obligations on an otherwise public project, <em>cf. Lycoming County Nursing Home Ass’n, Inc. v.

Moreover, their use is distinct from a present expenditure of public monies, since the increments would not likely exist but for the agreement of the taxing bodies to temporarily forego their prospective entitlement. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 6930.7(a), (b). The taxing entities receive and retain their base revenues, since the project owner remains responsible for the real estate taxes for the property as assessed prior to redevelopment. <em>See <a href="/pa-commw/156/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="627 A.2d 238" data-case-ids="1447119" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/156/0280-01">id.</a></em>
