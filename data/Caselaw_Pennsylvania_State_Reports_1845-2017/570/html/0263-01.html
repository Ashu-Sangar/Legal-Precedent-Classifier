Shortly after Larwa’s phone call, Officer Martin Reynolds arrived at Larwa’s home and observed that two cars in the driveway next to the home were damaged. Officer Reynolds spoke with Larwa and Appellant, who were the only people present in the home.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Larwa told Officer Reynolds that Zarcone had appeared at his home and when he refused to open the door to allow Zarcone inside, Zarcone threatened to injure him and vandalized his two cars.

Officer Reynolds asked Larwa and Appellant to each make a written statement <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>regarding their allegations and gave them forms on which to make those statements.</p>

Both Larwa’s and Appellant’s signed written statements substantiated what they had orally told Officer Reynolds earlier that day. Based on Larwa’s and Appellant’s allegations, Officer Reynolds filed a charge of terroristic threats against Zarcone. On April 9, 1998, a preliminary hearing was held concerning that charge. Appellant testified during the preliminary hearing in a manner consistent with his previous statements to Officer Reynolds. Based on the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing, the trial court determined that there was sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.</p>

During the trial, Zarcone called Appellant to testify regarding the statements he made to Officer Reynolds and the testimony he gave during the preliminary hearing. Instead of confirming his prior statements and testimony, however, Appellant testified that his statements and testimony were not true accounts of what happened on February 16. According to Appellant’s testimony at trial, Zarcone was not at Larwa’s house on February 16 and, in fact, Larwa had vandalized his cars himself. Appellant also testified that Larwa had coerced him into telling the false story both to Officer Reynolds and at the preliminary hearing.

Based on its receipt of the report, which Appellant planned to admit into evidence at his trial, on September 13, 1999, the day before Appellant’s trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine requesting that the trial court preclude Appellant from presenting any evidence regarding the duress defense provided for in 18 Pa.C.S. § 309. According to Section 309, the duress defense applies in the following circumstances:</p>

The trial court ruled that Appellant could present evidence of the duress defense but that Appellant could not present any evidence from medical experts regarding his mental condition because, according to the trial court, such evidence would improperly bolster Appellant’s credibility. Consequently, on the first day of his trial, Appellant argued that although he had made false statements to Officer Reynolds and at the preliminary hearing, Larwa had coerced him into making those statements; In support of his argument, Appellant presented evidence of his own testimony during Zarcone’s trial in which he stated that Larwa had forced him to tell the false story by shooting him with a B.B. Gun and choking him, as well as Larwa’s testimony at Zarcone’s trial in which Laiwa stated, “[Appellant’s] brain doesn’t work like yours and mine.” N.T., 9/14/99, at 45.</p>

According to Mesa, Appellant continues to suffer from severe headaches and seizures. Mesa also testified that Appellant’s school informed her that Appellant is borderline mentally retarded and will not be able to intellectually develop above approximately a third-grade level. Furthermore, Mesa testified that both Appellant and his wife, Tracey Zook, notified her that Larwa was threatening Appellant. Mesa explained that she notified her local police in Philadelphia about the threats, but was told by the police that they could not help Appellant because he was outside of their jurisdiction.</p>

Thus, to establish the duress defense under Section 309, unlike under the common law rule, the force or threatened force does not need to be of present and impending death or serious bodily injury.

While the trier of fact must consider whether an objective person of reasonable firmness would have been able to resist the threat, it must ultimately base its decision on whether that person would have been able to resist the threat if he was subjectively placed in the defendant’s situation. Therefore, in making its determination, the trier of fact must consider “stark, tangible factors, which differentiate the [defendant] from another, like his size or strength or age or health.” Model Penal Code § 2.09 cmt. at 7 (Tent. Draft No. 10, 1960). Although the trier of fact is not to consider the defendant’s particular characteristics of temperament, intelligence, courageousness, or moral fortitude, the fact that a defendant suffers from “a gross and verifiable” mental disability “that may establish irresponsibility” is a relevant consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Moreover, the trier of fact should consider any salient situational factors surrounding the defendant at the time of the alleged duress, such as the severity of the offense the defendant was asked to commit, the nature of the force used or threatened to be used, and the alternative ways in which the defendant may have averted the force or threatened force. <em>See id. </em>at 7-8.</p>

The trier of fact must decide whether the defendant disregarded a risk that involves a gross deviation from what an objective “reasonable person” would observe if he was subjectively placed “in the [defendant’s] situation.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(b)(3).
