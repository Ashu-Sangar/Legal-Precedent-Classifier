Saranchak robbed, shot, and killed his uncle and grandmother. He pled guilty to murder generally and was sentenced to death based upon aggravating circumstances involving the commission of the murders during the perpetration of a felony and the convictions of multiple murders. The judgment of sentence was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v.

On appeal, however, this Court issued a <em>per curiam </em>Order remanding for the appointment of new counsel and the filing of a new PCRA petition. After the Defender Association of Philadelphia was appointed as substitute counsel, it proceeded to file the petition and pursue post-conviction review.</p>
    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[186,704,1153,570]]]'>Pending hearing on this petition, however, Saranchak submitted a letter to the PCRA court indicating that he wished to discharge his attorneys and forego further legal proceedings. The PCRA court conducted a colloquy on July 31, 2000, at which time Saranchak confirmed that he understood the nature of the capital proceedings, his entitlement to counsel, and his rights under the PCRA, but nevertheless maintained his wish to waive such rights. The PCRA court expressed satisfaction that Saranchak’s waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent; accordingly, it removed the Defender Association as counsel and dismissed the post-conviction petition.</p>

By Order dated October 25, 2000, this Court held the matter in abeyance pending supplementation of the record with expert, psychiatric opinion concerning Saranchak’s competency to effectuate a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel and to pursue further collateral proceedings. Subsequently, the Commonwealth filed a copy of the report of Larry A. Rotenberg, M.D., Director of Psychiatry at the Reading Hospital and Medical Center, containing the opinion that Saranchak had the ability to effectuate an appropriate waiver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The PCRA court conducted a hearing, at which Dr. Rotenberg’s report was admitted into evidence, and the psychiatrist testified to his findings and was subject to <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>cross-examination. On the basis of the supplemental record provided, this Court concluded that the PCRA court had made sustainable legal findings supporting its order approving the discharge of the Defender Association as Saranchak’s counsel and the withdrawal of his post-conviction petition. Accordingly, by Order dated November 6, 2000, the Court denied the motion for stay of execution and dismissed the Defender Association’s appeal based on lack of standing.</p>

Although the district court denied relief following a hearing, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued the requested stay on the Defender Association’s subsequent application. The Commonwealth immediately sought relief from the stay in the United States Supreme Court.</p>
    <p id="b626-6" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[261,1194,1157,465]]]'>While the Commonwealth’s application was pending, the Defender Association filed a second motion for stay of execution in this Court.

On February 7, 2001, this Court issued an Order directing that the PCRA court conduct a colloquy to determine the veracity of the statement and to assess Saranchak’s intentions.

The colloquy proceeded, and the transcript confirmed the veracity of the signed statement and independently reflected that Saranchak wished to pursue post-conviction relief and for the Defender Association to represent him. Therefore, this Court is now presented with the question of whether Saranchak’s reversal prior to termination of the appeal proceedings commenced by the Defender Association constitutes a ground upon which the post-conviction proceedings may be reinstated.</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[187,926,1156,597]]]'>Saranchak’s argument is that, due to the graveness of the punishment of death, a capital petitioner’s most recent expression of his wishes in relation to the pursuit of post-conviction relief should control. The Commonwealth emphasizes the validity of Saranchak’s waiver in the PCRA court, as previously confirmed by this Court, contending that we should look no further. In this regard, the Commonwealth asserts that reinstatement relief is beyond the standards governing reargument and predicts that its affordance in this case would subject appellate jurisprudence to the will or caprice of appellants.</p>

The Court then employs the Federal Defender’s improper vicarious appeal as a basis to reinstate Saranchak’s PCRA petition — even though Saranchak, who was ruled competent, never appealed its dismissal — on the basis that, after the Federal Court granted him a stay of execution, Saranchak “changed his mind” about the Federal Defender representing him, and also about pursuing post-conviction relief.

Leaving philosophy aside, there is no question that capital cases are in fact treated differently than other criminal matters in this Commonwealth in a number of important respects. There are differences at trial. Jury selection, for one, generally involves a far more probing analysis of the jurors’ views. There are also differences on appeal. One example is that the General Assembly has deter<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>mined that this Court is statutorily obliged to review every sentence of death on direct appeal.

While Saranchak’s PCRA petition was pending in the PCRA court, he indicated, in a letter dated July 29, 1999, that he wished to discharge the Federal Defender as counsel and forego all further legal proceedings. He wrote that he had had sufficient time to ponder the magnitude of his crimes and that he was in agreement with the sentence of death. Saranchak further stated that his counsel’s filings were not on his behalf and were without his consent. At a subsequent hearing on July 31, 2000, the PCRA court conducted a colloquy during which Saranchak reiterated his desire to waive both counsel and all further review. The PCRA court concluded that Saranchak’s waiver of counsel and further review was know<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>ing, voluntary and intelligent. Accordingly, it acceded to Saranchak’s wishes and removed the Federal Defender as counsel and dismissed the PCRA petition. Saranchak did not appeal this decision. Thus, as to Saranchak, the PCRA court’s order became final thirty days later, <em>i.e., </em>on August 80, 2000. The Federal Defender, however, in contravention of Saranchak’s record wishes, filed its own notice of appeal with this Court, attempting to challenge the PCRA court’s order. The Federal Defender’s vicarious appeal was improperly filed in Saranchak’s name, thus explaining the misleading caption here. The Federal Defender essentially assumed that it was entitled to next friend status, despite the PCRA court’s finding that Saranchak was competent.</p>

On October 17, 2000, the Federal Defender filed an emergency motion with this Court seeking a stay of its former client’s execution pending its attempted vicarious appeal of the PCRA court’s ruling. In its stay motion, the Federal Defender claimed that the PCRA hearing testimony of Dr. Robert Fox, Jr., a psychiatrist who had previously examined Saranchak in October of 1997, cast doubt on the PCRA court’s finding that Saranchak was competent to waive counsel and collateral review. Where there is any question concerning a death-sentenced inmate’s competency, the Federal Defender contended, due process requires a contemporaneous psychiatric evaluation.</p>

Rotenberg, a court-appointed psychiatrist, examined Saranchak, filed a report, and testified at a supplemental waiver hearing held on November 3, 2000, that, in his opinion, Saranchak was competent to waive his right to counsel and to pursue collateral proceedings.

Our order dismissing the Federal Defender’s appeal resulted from our finding that Dr. Rotenberg’s report and testimony confirmed the PCRA court’s previous assessment of Saranchak’s competency and, thus, the Federal Defender lacked standing to pursue an appeal on his behalf.

The Federal Defender did not allege any error in this Court’s resolution of the issues for which they sought reargument. Instead, the claim simply was that, the Third Circuit having thwarted his previously stated, on-the-record, competent desire to see his lawful sentence executed, Saranchak had now changed his mind about pursuing post-conviction relief. Attached to the reargument application was an unsworn declaration by Saranchak dated November 16, 2000, indicating his desire to reinstate his post-conviction proceedings.

This Court <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>remanded Fahy’s appeal to the PCRA court, which conducted a colloquy and found that Fahy was competent and had knowingly waived his rights to further review. Although Fahy had also testified that he did not want his appointed counsel or former counsel, the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy <em>&amp; </em>Defense Assistance (“CLEADA”), to pursue the matter further, CLEADA — like the Federal Defender here— filed its own appeal with this Court. CLEADA alleged that, notwithstanding Fahy’s letter and testimony, he actually did not waive his right to collateral review. In support of this claim, CLEADA filed with the Court a non-record declaration of Fahy purportedly signed by him twelve days after the waiver colloquy, stating that he did not intend to waive his post-conviction rights. This Court unanimously affirmed the waiver determination, without even remanding for a hearing, noting that there was nothing in the record to support CLEADA’s representation that the previous waiver was not knowing and voluntary. Because the waiver was valid and because it appeared that counsel was acting without Fahy’s consent, CLEADA’s appeal was dismissed. <em><a href="/a2d/700/1256-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="700 A.2d 1256" data-case-ids="11907938,17949" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/1256-01,/pa/549/0159-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/700/1256-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="700 A.2d 1256" data-case-ids="11907938,17949" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/1256-01,/pa/549/0159-01">at 1259-60</a>.</p>

Like the Federal Defender here, CLEADA also cited <em>Lonchar </em>for the proposition that once a post-conviction petitioner changes his mind about waiver, his current wishes control as a federal constitutional matter. This Court unanimously denied the reargument petition. We did so because Fahy’s non-record verification contained no new information which would lead the Court to conclude that Fahy’s statements under oath at the waiver colloquy were not knowingly and voluntarily made and that, even if the verification were considered, it would amount to nothing more than evidence that appellant changed his mind about waiving his post-conviction rights. In denying relief, the Court also necessarily found that <em>Lonchar </em>was not precedent for the argument that a waiver is valid only until there is a change of mind.</p>

Not having yet decided Michael’s appeal, this Court remanded to the PCRA court, directing it to conduct a colloquy to determine whether Michael fully understood the consequences of his request to withdraw his appeal and waive further collateral review.

At the competency hearing, Michael confirmed that he had in fact changed his mind and wanted to proceed with his PCRA appeal. At the close of the hearing, the PCRA court found that Michael was mentally competent and that he was competent at the time he initially waived further PCRA review. The PCRA court also recognized, however, that Michael’s most recent affidavit, as well as his testimony at the competency hearing, suggested a “change of mind.” Before this Court could rule on the appeal, Michael apparently changed his mind yet again, indicating in a letter that he did not wish to pursue any further appeals.</p>

    <p id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[268,446,1156,732]]]'>The majority’s wholesale departure from statutes, rules, and precedent will have significant negative consequences for the orderly administration of justice in this Commonwealth. For one thing, if a capital defendant’s mere change of mind automatically necessitates reinstatement of his collateral rights, so long as somebody in the world has taken an appeal in his name, then presumably a stay must automatically issue if we have not ruled on the waiver at least fifteen days prior to the defendant’s execution date. Since an appellant has fourteen days within which to file for reargument with this Court, <em>see </em>Pa.R.A.P. 2542(a), any decision by this Court less than fifteen days from the execution date would have to be accompanied by a stay of execution to- provide the death-sentenced prisoner with sufficient time to change his mind.</p>

If a valid waiver is effective only until there is a change of mind then no waiver is ever final, no matter how clear and unequivocal the defendant’s record decision to forgo further proceedings. Any “waiver” can automatically be negated by a subsequent claim that the defendant merely has had a change of heart.</blockquote>

The Court today, of course, blindly adopts the Federal Defender’s absolutist view. In so holding, the Court ignores jurisdictional limitations, <em>stare decisis, </em>next friend principles, and the standards governing reargument. Moreover, on the merits, the Court has effectively reduced every valid, on-the-record waiver proceeding to a mere dress rehearsal, which may be subsequently undone at the whim of the waiving party.
