In this capacity, he cut and welded iron and repaired motors, and was required to climb scaffolds and ladders and <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>lift heavy steel beams. On May 20, 1994, as he was working, Claimant was struck in and about the head, neck and back by a steel beam, and was rendered unconscious. Claimant was taken to the hospital, and came under the care of Dr. Stephenson both during and after his hospital stay. Dr. Stephenson diagnosed Claimant as having sustained a concussion, a mild head injury and an acute cervical and lumbro-sacral strain and sprain. Over the ensuing months, Claimant experienced headaches, dizziness, loss of balance, trouble sleeping, and upper and lower back pain. Upon Dr. Stephenson’s recommendation, Claimant commenced physical therapy treatments in June 1994, and consulted an ear, nose and throat specialist and a neurosurgeon thereafter. Dr. Stephenson last saw Claimant on March 14, 1995. As of that date, Dr. Stephenson maintained a diagnosis of chronic cervical and lumbro-sacral sprain and strain, and concluded that Claimant was unable to perform the duties of his pre-injury job. Dr. Stephenson testified that Claimant would have to avoid climbing on ladders and scaffolds, and restricted his lifting to less than 20 to 25 pounds. Claimant never returned to Reinforced Earth’s employ. On September 24, 1994, with the execution of a Separation Agreement and Release, which preserved Claimant’s rights under the Act, Claimant’s employment relationship with Reinforced Earth was terminated.</p>

First, the WCJ concluded that even “[accepting that Claimant as an alien did not have proper [INS] documentation to work for [Reinforced Earth], such illegal alien status at the time of injury does not bar relief to the Claimant under the [Act].” (R. 199a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Second, the WCJ concluded that Claimant met his <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>burden of proof, establishing all of the elements of compensability by substantial and competent evidence.

    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[181,536,1155,520]]]'>Accordingly, the WCJ circulated an order on November 26, 1997, granting Claimant’s Claim Petition, and ordering Reinforced Earth to pay Claimant compensation for total disability at the rate of $884.86 per week commencing as of May 21, 1994 and continuing thereafter until liability is altered pursuant to law; to pay all of Claimant’s related reasonable and necessary medical expenses, including those Claimant had submitted, subject to the Act’s limitations; to remain responsible for Claimant’s medical expenses; and to pay the litigation costs.</p>

Without taking additional evidence, the Board affirmed the WCJ’s decision and order. With respect to Reinforced Earth’s argument that Claimant’s status as an unauthorized alien barred him from the Act’s coverage, the Board determined that Reinforced Earth failed to prove that Claimant’s alleged violation of the law — the use of invalid documents to secure employment — was causally related to his injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In addition, the Board stated that any determination that Claimant’s immigration status alone would <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>vitiate his entitlement to compensation benefits would violate the humanitarian purposes of the Act. Next, the Board concluded that the WCJ correctly decided that Claimant met his burden of proof, showing that he was totally disabled for all periods covered by the record. Finding that Reinforced Earth failed to show Claimant’s possible earnings, the Board then rejected Reinforced Earth’s argument that a suspension of benefits was in order because Claimant could not show that he was disabled throughout the proceedings. Finally, of the view that Claimant’s employability was not yet an issue in light of the WCJ’s conclusion that Claimant was totally disabled, the Board also rejected Reinforced Earth’s argument that the WCJ should have suspended Claimant’s benefits because his unauthorized alien status prevents him from ever returning to work or from making good faith efforts to secure employment.</p>

Reinforced Earth argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board’s ruling that Claimant’s status as an unauthorized alien does not bar him from receipt of the Act’s relief is inconsistent with the Commonwealth Court’s decision to refuse workers’ compensation to an escaped prisoner in <em>Graves v.

To repeat, Reinforced Earth does not argue that the General Assembly has shown that it intends for the policies which underlie the Act to yield to the policies which underlie the federal immigration statute. Instead, Reinforced Earth argues that this Court should see to it that such a result occurs. Thus, the dissent's willingness to deny unauthorized aliens workers' compensation benefits in the context of this case means that it would grant Reinforced Earth's request that this Court make an extra-statutory declaration of public policy with regard to that matter, which we believe is contrary to our teaching in <em>Mamlin v.

Appellant does not claim that the IRCA preempts the WCA with respect to workers' compensation benefits for unauthorized aliens. Our concern presently is whether an award of workers' compensation benefits to an unauthorized alien runs counter to federal immigration policy, to which Pennsylvania's legislative scheme should defer.</p>

That was not true under the INA regime, which had no “provisions . .. making it unlawful for an employer to hire an alien who is present or working in the United States without appropriate authorization." <em>Sum-Tan, </em><a href="/us/467/0883-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="467 U.S. 883" data-case-ids="6210025" data-case-paths="/us/467/0883-01">467 U.S. at 892-93</a>, <a href="/us/467/0883-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="467 U.S. 883" data-case-ids="6210025" data-case-paths="/us/467/0883-01">104 S.Ct. at 2809</a>.</p>

A secondary function of the workers' compensation system in Pennsylvania is to take the place of the tort system for injuries in the employer-employee arena; the exclusive remedy provisions of the WCA ensure this. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 481. It would be wrong to conclude, however, that Pennsylvania’s workers' compensation scheme is merely an administrative substitute for tort claims against an employer. The scope of the WCA imposes much broader financial responsibility on an employer for an employee's work-related injury — providing benefits irrespective of the employer's fault — than the tort system, with its requirement that liability result from negligence.</p>

If an unauthorized alien is ineligible for benefits under the WCA, it follows that the employer should not enjoy the immunity from suit granted by 77 P.S. § 481. Consequently, the injured worker returns to the protections of the tort system, and may sue the employer for injuries caused by the negligence of the employer.</p>
