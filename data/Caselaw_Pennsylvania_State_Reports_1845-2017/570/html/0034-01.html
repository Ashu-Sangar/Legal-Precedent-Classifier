The Superi- or Court concluded that the trial court erred in failing to merge one of the corruption of a minor convictions with the statutory sexual assault charge.

    <p id="b139-8" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[161,1190,1156,572]]]'>During September and October of 1996, Gatling was a guest in the family home of J.N., the victim, who was eleven (11) years old at the time. Gatling, a friend of J.N.’s mother, grandmother, and uncle, lived in the basement of the house. At some time in September of 1996, Gatling, then twenty-seven (27) years of age, summoned J.N. to the basement, told the child to lie face down on the couch, climbed on top of her, and while both were still clothed, Gatling began pushing with his penis against her buttocks. After approximately four or five minutes, Gatling got up and J.N. climbed back upstairs; J.N. did not tell anyone what had happened.</p>

He once more told the girl to lie face down on the couch, whereupon he climbed on top of her, while both were clothed, and again began pushing with his penis against her buttocks. However, this time, Gatling told J.N. to turn over, at which point he pulled down her pants, then his own, and proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse with her. When again Gatling had finished, J.N. went back upstairs and told no one. A few days later, J.N.’s teacher found a note on the floor of the classroom that J.N. had written to Gatling. The teacher spoke to J.N. and informed the school principal, <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>who contacted the family of J.N. and the police. The police brought J.N. to St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children, where a pelvic exam revealed tears in and beyond J.N.’s hymen, which are consistent with vaginal penetration.</p>

    <p id="b142-7" data-blocks='[["BL_142.6",142,[272,1010,1156,565]]]'>The doctrine of merger in Pennsylvania has its genesis in the decision of this Court in <em>Harman v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/serg-rawl/12/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="12 Serg. &amp; Rawle 69" data-case-ids="8877613" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/12/0069-01">12 Serg. &amp; Rawle 69</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1824%20WL%202417" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1824 WL 2417">1824 WL 2417</a> (Pa.1824). In that case, the Commonwealth charged the defendant with both rape and assault with intent to ravish; the court found the defendant guilty, generally. The court sentenced the defendant for rape only. The defendant appealed, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in joining the misdemeanor assault charge with the felony rape indictment; at the time, joinder of a felony with a misdemeanor was illegal. We rejected this argument, reasoning as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b142-8" data-blocks='[["BL_142.7",142,[312,1588,1116,774]]]'>The defendant was found guilty of rape, and received the judgment which the law has ordained for that offence. He was subject to no inconvenience or hardship on his trial; being charged with felony, he was admitted to his privilege of peremptory challenge. There could be no surprise on him, nor any difficulty in defending himself against both charges. Indeed, if he was guilty of the rape, he must have been guilty of the assault, with intent to ravish; and if he was not guilty of the assault, with the intent to ravish, he could not be guilty of the rape: so that when he prepared for defence against one event, he must necessarily prepare for defence against the other. It would have been unjust, however, to punish him for the assault, which was merged in the greater offence of rape, and therefore, he was not punished for it.</blockquote>

The Commonwealth submits that, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>merging the crimes for which the jury convicted Gatling arising from the mid-October 1996 events, gives Gatling a volume discount for criminal acts that exceeded a solitary offense, even if the elements of the offenses could otherwise merge.

If the defendant shoots the victim in the foot first, intending to incapacitate, and then shoots him in the chest four times, intending to kill, he has intended to commit two separate crimes and should be held accountable for both.</p>

A break requires both that: (1) the acts constituting commission of the first crime were completed before the defendant began committing the second crime; and (2) proof of the second crime did not in any way rely on the facts necessary to prove the first crime. In addition, the break must be either: (1) a significant temporal lapse; or (2) where applicable, indicated by a change in the <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>criminal intent of the defendant at some point during the sequence. Where a defendant is convicted of two or more crimes and there is no break, the court must then proceed to the merger analysis as above described. If the acts that make-up the first crime are complete before the defendant begins the second crime, if proof of the second crime does not rely on any of the facts supplying proof of the first crime, and if there is either a significant temporal break or a change in the defendant’s intent, the defendant will have committed multiple criminal acts.</p>

During the September incident, Gatling stopped his actions after rubbing against J.N. while both were clothed and there is no evidence that he intended to engage in sexual relations with J.N. at that time. Conversely, during or immediately after his clothed contact with J.N. in mid-October 1996, Gatling decided to undress J.N. and himself and have vaginal intercourse with the child. The crime of corruption of a minor was complete before Gatling turned J.N. over and removed her clothes. The acts constituting statutoiy sexual assault did not commence until after Gatling turned J.N. over and took off her clothes and proof of the statutory sexual assault does not in any way rely on the facts constituting the conniption of a minor charge.

The lead opinion finds that a merger analysis is not necessary in this case as there <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>were two distinct criminal acts. Because I do not believe that there was a break in the action sufficient to support a finding that two different sets of facts underlie the convictions for corrupting the morals of a minor and statutory sexual assault, I am compelled to dissent.</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[143,611,1155,688]]]'>As the lead opinion correctly notes, the central inquiry of a merger analysis is whether the crimes are greater and lesser included offenses. To answer this inquiry we look at the elements of each offense. If all the elements of the lesser offense are within the elements of the greater, and the greater offense includes at least one additional element, which is different, then the sentences merge. <em>Commonwealth v. Anderson, </em><a href="/pa/538/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="538 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="475550" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0574-01">538 Pa. 574</a>, <a href="/a2d/650/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="650 A.2d 20" data-case-ids="11311697,475550" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0020-01,/pa/538/0574-01">650 A.2d 20</a> (1994). This inquiry is not conducted in a vacuum; by necessity it requires consideration of the factual context culminating in the convictions at issue, since sentences will only merge where the convictions arise from the same factual predicate. <em>Commonwealth v. Belsar, </em><a href="/pa/544/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="544 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="463566" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0346-01">544 Pa. 346</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="676 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="463566,7862620" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0346-01,/a2d/676/0632-01">676 A.2d 632</a> (1996).</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[148,1338,1148,149]]]'>A merger analysis begins with an examination of the crimes subject to sentence. The elements of the offenses at issue are set forth within the following relevant excerpts:</p>

Statutory sexual assault is established by proof of sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons where one party <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>is under the age of 16 and the other party is at least four years older.</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[269,434,1157,674]]]'>In this case, to meet the necessary elements to support a conviction for corruption of minors and statutory sexual assault, the Commonwealth established, beyond a reasonable doubt, the following facts. In October of 1996, the defendant called the victim to his basement room and told her to lie face down on the sofa. The defendant climbed on top of the victim and began to grind his pelvis against her buttocks. The defendant proceeded to turn the victim face up, pull down, first her pants and then his own, and engage in sexual intercourse. The entire incident was conducted within a time span of four to five minutes. The defendant was 27 years of age when he had sexual intercourse with the victim, who was eleven years of age.</p>
    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[266,1133,1157,785]]]'>The lead opinion does not look at the elements of the two offenses as it finds no merger analysis should take place given the factual circumstances at bar. The lead opinion dissects the facts set forth into two distinct pieces as follows: the initial grinding constitutes one criminal act followed by a break in the action; whereupon the defendant formed a different intent demonstrated by turning the victim to face him, and then committed a second criminal act, by engaging in sexual intercourse. I cannot accept the lead opinion’s highly speculative analysis of the defendant’s intent in order to conclude that a break in the action occurred. As I pointed out in my dissent in <em>Belsar, </em>a break indicates that action ceased and then was resumed. <em><a href="/pa/544/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="676 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="463566,7862620" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0346-01,/a2d/676/0632-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/544/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="676 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="463566,7862620" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0346-01,/a2d/676/0632-01">at 638</a> (Cappy, J. dissenting).<a class="footnotemark">1</a> To conclude that such a break occurred on the facts of this case stretches that concept to a meaningless conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b158-7" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[266,1943,1154,147]],["BL_159.1",159,[147,325,1160,474]]]'>Rather, I would find that the merger doctrine does and should apply to the convictions in this case. Based on the facts of this case, all of the elements.of corruption of a minor, <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>the age of the parties and the proof of an act (sexual intercourse) that corrupted, are contained within the greater offense of statutory sexual assault, as that crime requires proof of a four-year age disparity, sexual intercourse, and that the parties are not married to one another. All the elements of the lesser offense are included within the greater offense and the greater offense requires proof of one element that is different. Thus, the two convictions merge for purposes of sentencing.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[150,828,1152,94]]]'>Accordingly, as I would affirm the decision of the Superior Court, I must dissent.</p>

Insofar as I discussed the concept of the intent of the accused within a merger analysis, I was using that as a reference point to further explicate the concept of a definitive break in the action. I in no fashion meant that merger could be avoided merely be positing that the defendant’s intent changed in the midst of an unbroken, continuous criminal act.</p>
