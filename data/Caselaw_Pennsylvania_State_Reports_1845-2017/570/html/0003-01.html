The clerk filled her order and tallied her purchases. The victim then reached under her shirt for her wallet, tendered the amount due, put the change in her wallet, replaced her wallet under her shirt and left the store. At the same time, [Chambers] and a group of his friends were playing pinball and eating fish sandwiches in plain view of the victim. They had recently come from the home of Adam McKinney, a member of this group, where they had smoked some marijuana and drank some alcoholic beverages. These friends testified that [Chambers] neglected to place money into the common fund they collected for food purchases that day at the fish store and that moments after the victim departed, [Chambers] told his friends that he had something to do, adding he would meet them later in the evening at Adam McKinney’s house. [Chambers] quickly left the fish store.</blockquote>

In addition, Edgar Coder testified that [Chambers] had what appeared to be a large stick in one of his hands. Sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., another witness, Kevin Hartmen, while walking his dog there, noticed a body under the Maryland Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge (hereinafter the “Black Bridge” so named because of its painted color). (The Black Bridge is in close proximity to the Silver Bridge and both of these structures span the Codorus Creek.) Kevin Hartmen immediately contacted his friend, Donald Snell, who also saw the body. Mr. Snell approached his father about what he had seen. His father then told a retired policeman. In <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>turn, the retired policeman contacted the York Police Department and reported the body beneath the Black Bridge. The police arrived at the scene at 8:35 p.m. and began their investigation. The police found the victim’s numerous articles of clothing, her tom open, empty wallet, along with her upper and lower dentures strewn around her lifeless, nude body. The autopsy revealed the victim was beaten to death by a blunt instrument and the cause of death was later determined to be a subdural hemorrhage or brain hemorrhage.

Before he was permitted to enter the bar, the manager, John Ettline, ordered [Chambers] to leave this club outside because Mr. Ettline did not want patrons carrying weapons into his establishment. [Chambers] complied and meandered through the Shady Dell for a time and left without re-claiming his stick. From there he proceeded to Adam McKinney’s home. When he arrived at Adam’s home, [Chambers] now possessed alcohol, marijuana, and money. [Chambers] did not tell his friends where he had been, what he had done, or where he [had] obtained the money to make his purchases, whereas a few hours before he did not have funds to contribute to their kitty. Over the next few months, the police engaged in an exhaustive investigation. The questioning of witnesses revealed that [Chambers] often carried an axe handle, that he told his friends the police considered him a prime suspect, and that the police stopped [Chambers] as he was attempting to leave town. Debra Phillips, a woman who knew [Chambers], told the police she gave the axe handle to him because of a foot injury he received in an altercation with Debra’s nephew some time before the murder. At that time, she suspected he could use the handle as a cane. Intense questioning of [Chambers’] acquaintances confirmed that on the day of the murder [Chambers] was seen carrying this axe handle. Their testimony also revealed that when he entered the fish store on the day of the murder, he had the <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>axe handle with him but the owners requested he leave it outside. When [Chambers’] friends left the fish store after [Chambers] had departed, they noticed that the stick was gone. And finally, they noted that [Chambers] did not have “his stick” when he rejoined them later in the evening at Adam’s house.</blockquote>

[Chambers] said, “that when he asked the victim for her money and she refused, he hit her and took the money.” The next day Jeffrey Hutchenson contacted his attorney, who notified the police. An arrest warrant was then issued on December 12,1986, for [Chambers].</blockquote>

The Commonwealth charged Chambers in the instant case with both robbery and murder and the Commonwealth proceeded on a theory that Chambers’ financial situation — he was consistently unemployed and without any source of income — served as the motive for the robbery in the present case and the earlier robbery. Likewise, the Commonwealth asserts that the fact that Chambers prostituted himself was relevant to establish Chambers’ motive to acquire money. The Commonwealth maintains that evidence of Chambers’ incarceration in the York County Prison served as the foundation for two jailhouse confessions that Chambers made to his cellmates and, therefore, evidence of his incarceration is relevant.</p>

The admission of evidence of Chambers’ prior robbery and prostitution, however, is more troubling. Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 404(b)(2) provides that “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted ... as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident[,]” provided that the probative value of the proffered evidence outweighs any potential prejudice. The Commonwealth attempts to classify this evidence as proof of Chambers’ motive to rob Anna Mae Morris (Morris). The connection seems tenuous. Chambers may have been motivated to commit the prior <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>robbery and prostitute himself in order to “remedy” his then financial situation. He may also have committed the robbery of Morris to remedy his current financial situation. However, the Commonwealth is not using the fact of the existence of the prior robbery or Chambers’ prostitution as the motive for the robbery of Morris. The alleged motive is Chambers’ financial situation, not his commission of these prior bad acts. Accordingly, Chambers’ claim has arguable merit. Even if a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has underlying merit, a defendant must still prove that counsel’s deficient performance caused him prejudice.</p>

Although they could not hear what Chambers and Morris were saying to each other, they appeared to be arguing. In addition, Coder testified that Chambers had what appeared to be a large stick in one of his hands. Sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., another witness, Kevin Hartmen (Hartmen), while walking his dog, noticed a body, that of Morris, under the Maryland-Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge.

Over the next few months, the police engaged in an exhaustive investigation. The questioning of witnesses revealed that Chambers often carried an axe handle, that he told his friends the police considered him a prime suspect, and that the police stopped Chambers as he was attempting to leave town. Debra Phillips, a woman who knew Chambers, told the police she gave <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>him the axe handle because of a foot injury he received in an altercation with Debra’s nephew some time before the murder.

Thus, Chambers has failed to establish that he suffered any prejudice as a result of counsel’s failure to present this evidence. Accordingly, his <em>Brady </em>claim cannot succeed. <em>See Commonwealth v.

To support this argument, Chambers introduced a report by Dr. Patricia Flemings (Dr. Flemings), a psychologist who examined Chambers in March of 1998. Dr. Flemings found that Chambers had suffered head trauma, which would cause organic brain damage. During the guilt phase, Chambers staunchly maintained his innocence. The presentation of evidence of his mental health problems would have militated against that stance, so counsel had a reasonable basis for not presenting this evidence. Evidence of Chambers’ mental health problems would likely have been more relevant during the penalty phase, but we do not discuss that issue because we have already determined that Chambers is entitled to a new penalty phase.

Chambers failed to explain why trial counsel had not previously undertaken to request this discovery. Likewise, Chambers’ allegation that trial counsel was ineffective for-failing to request this discovery cannot succeed. Chambers failed to question his trial counsel at the PCRA hearing to determine why counsel did not seek blood testing of both Chambers and Morris at the time of the original trial and trial counsel did not explain his inaction in the Affidavit that Chambers submitted to the PCRA court. Exhibit 1 to Brief of Chambers. Chambers has failed to prove that his trial counsel did not have a reasonable strategic basis for not seeking blood testing.
