For example if a person — taking this case as an example, if a person was afflicted by organic brain disorder or some psychiatric disease or some mental health problem, I’ve heard asked repeatedly in other cases, isn’t this inconsistent with the type of planning that goes into the perpetration of this crime?

Notably, such testimony was offered in response to a general question concerning dangers in presenting mental health issues (“The danger that you described to presenting certain mental health issues, what are those dangers?”); does not take into account the specifics of the available mental health evidence pertinent to the case at issue or reflect the attendant weight and potential benefit vis-a-vis other available defenses; and does not represent the sum and substance of trial counsel’s reasons for not pursuing mental health evidence at the penalty phase in the present case. If these sorts of generalized concerns about the presentation of mental health evidence on their own can be said to provide a reasonable basis for failing to investigate and/or present mental health evidence in mitigation, there would rarely be a need for a hearing on this issue, since these considerations will apply in virtually every capital case. As demonstrated by the present appeal, however, this has not been the course ■ chosen by careful PCRA judges (here, the Honorable Kevin A. Hess) who, in appropriate circumstances, have undertaken the necessary task of sifting through and weighing the evidence. Thus, the following additional considerations are critical to my assessment of the present appeal.</p>

The actual explanation for trial counsel’s strategy remains undeveloped on the record, since counsel was permitted to refrain from disclosing the details of his conversations with Appellant. This deficiency cannot redound to Appellant’s benefit, however, since he bore the burden of proof at the post-conviction stage. In these circumstances, it was simply not possible for Appellant to satisfy this burden while concealing critical facts utilizing the shield of the attorney-client privilege and a course of artful questioning.</p>
