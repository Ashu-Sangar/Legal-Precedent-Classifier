Because § 1586 is remedial legislation designed to further a compelling state interest in highway safety, it should be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928. Moreover, the legislature furthered the Compact’s underlying policy by requiring Pennsylvania-licensed drivers to adhere to the drinking and driving laws of other party states, even if those laws differ from those in Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>Article 1(b)(1). Appellee contends that § 1586 is permissible legislation which represents the legislature’s exercise of power granted under Article IV(c) to define which out-of-state offenses Pennsylvania considers to be substantially similar to offenses delineated under Article IV(a).

In contrast, the Compact, as interpreted by <em>Petrovich, </em>required a level of impairment to a degree which rendered the operator “incapable of safely driving”; impairment which did not reach this level was not punishable.</p>

We stated that, “an amendment ... would be a matter for the contracting States subject, of course, to the congressional consent required by Article 1, Section 10, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution .... ” <em>Henderson, </em>66 A.2d at 848. While <em>Henderson </em>is distinguishable from this case because the compact there required congressional consent, I do not read <em>Henderson </em>as standing for the proposition that an amendment to an interstate compact only requires consent of the party states where the compact at issue is controlled by the Compact Clause. The fact that an interstate compact is not controlled by the Compact Clause merely obviates the requirement of consent by Congress to an amendment. It does not obviate the requirement of consent by the party states to an amendment.</p>

While the Driver’s License Compact explicitly contemplates and authorizes a mechanism for withdrawal, <em>see </em>Section 1581, Article IX (titled “Entry into Force and Withdrawal”), it neither contemplates nor authorizes a mechanism for amendment, let alone unilateral amendment.
