    <p id="b552-8" data-blocks='[["BL_552.7",552,[274,925,1156,680]]]'>The facts of this case are not in dispute. On June 13, 1985, Trooper Durante sustained a work-related injury to his right arm when he was carrying two boxes of highway flares. After he returned to work, Trooper Durante suffered several recurrences of the original injury; because of these recurrences, he was assigned to a light duty position working for Staff Services in 1988. The Staff Services position to which Trooper Durante was assigned has been held only by state troopers. The Staff Services position did not, however, implicate some of the duties expected to be performed by a state trooper assigned to the field, such as forcibly arresting a person, performing rescue functions, and handling and discharging a firearm.</p>
    <p id="b552-9" data-blocks='[["BL_552.8",552,[274,1645,1154,364]]]'>In 1993, Trooper Durante suffered yet another recurrence of the original injury and underwent surgery. During his eight-month post-operative recuperation period, Trooper Durante was incapacitated from performing his duties in Staff Services and thus did not work during that period. Trooper Durante returned to his Staff Services position in August of 1993; he worked in this position until his retirement in 1995.</p>

These benefits are payable to a state trooper “who is injured in the performance of his duties ... and by reason thereof is temporarily incapacitated <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>from performing his duties....” 53 P.S. § 637(a).

    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[182,438,1151,349]]]'>The Pennsylvania State Police (State Police) denied Trooper Durante benefits. The State Police determined that although Trooper Durante could perform his Staff Services duties, his injuries permanently prevented him from performing the full range of essential duties required of a state trooper. Thus, as he was permanently, and not temporarily, disabled, he was not entitled to benefits under the Act.</p>

Arbitration Hearing, 9/29/1998, at 27-29. Thus, Trooper Durante was incapable of performing five of the nineteen duties that the State Police considered essential for a trooper to be able to perform. <em>Id. </em>It was unquestioned, however, that Trooper Durante was capable of performing all of the duties of his Staff Services position.</p>

The arbitrator therefore awarded benefits.</p>

Judge Doyle stated that while the Staff Services position was one historically filled by a state trooper, the position did not implicate the essential duties of a state police officer. Judge Doyle posited that a position could be considered one which is “regularly assigned to state policemen ’’only if such a position required the execution of all of the duties a trooper could be expected to perform, including subduing suspects and engaging in rescue operations.

As this is a question of law, we are in no fashion constrained by the determination of a lower court; thus, our standard of review is <em>de novo. </em>Furthermore, our scope of review in this matter is plenary as we may examine the entire contents of the record. <em>See Phillips v.

It reasons that since Trooper Durante’s injury precluded him from performing all of the functions of a trooper assigned to a field position, then he was permanently disabled and thus could not recover under <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>the Act. Furthermore, the State Police strenuously contends that the Commonwealth Court erred when it concluded that Trooper Durante’s return to work in his Staff Services position was tantamount to him returning to work as a state trooper, thus rendering his 1993 incapacity “temporary”. Rather, it contends that the relevant inquiry should focus on whether Trooper Durante could perform each of the duties required of a trooper deployed to a position in the field. In support of its position, the State Police relies heavily on this court’s decision in <em>Cunningham, supra.</em>

The State Police subsequently asserted that Trooper Palmeri’s injury was permanent rather than temporary, and that Trooper Palmeri was not entitled to benefits under the Act. Trooper Palmeri appeared at the hearing, and testified that he was able to perform all of the duties of his pre-injury supervisory position. The State Police, however, desired to have him classified permanently disabled as Trooper Palmeri could not perform all of the functions of every position to which a trooper could be assigned.

Trooper Cunningham was offered a light duty position by the State Police. He rejected the position, however, stating that the position was located too far from his home and <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>that his injury would not permit him to undertake such a long commute. Trooper Cunningham hypothesized that another light duty position located closer to his home might have been acceptable. Yet, there was no indication whether such a position actually existed in close proximity to the trooper’s home. Moreover, several medical specialists examined Trooper Cunningham, and all of them opined that Trooper Cunningham was unable to return to work.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[264,754,1155,836]]]'>After discussing that Trooper Cunningham rejected the light duty position and that all the medical specialists who examined him opined that his injury precluded him from working as a trooper, we concluded that Trooper Cunningham’s injury was permanent. We reasoned that a disability is permanent where “the disability is of a nature which prevents the individual from performing the type of services normally required in his or her occupation.” <em>Cunningham, </em><a href="/pa/510/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="510 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1796960" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0074-01">507 A.2d at 47</a>. We stated that it was of great public importance that a trooper be capable of performing all of the duties of his position. We thus emphasized that “it is not enough to demonstrate that [the injured trooper] may be capable of exercising some of the non-physical responsibilities of the position. To the contrary, [the injured trooper] must demonstrate that he or she can adequately assume those responsibilities expected of a state policeman.” <em><a href="/pa/510/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="510 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1796960" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0074-01">Id.</a> </em>at 47 n. 14.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[262,1615,1156,520]]]'>The State Police argues that <em>Cunningham </em>stands for the proposition that unless a trooper is able to perform every function required of a trooper working in the field, then he is permanently disabled. It contends that it is of no moment that an injured trooper is able to perform-and has performed-the duties of a position that has exclusively been filled by troopers. Additionally, the State Police’s only recognition of the existence of <em>Palmeri </em>is a fleeting reference in a footnote to its brief. The State Police speculates that <em>Palmeri </em>is inconsistent with <em>Cunningham, </em>and thus no longer controls.</p>

      <em>sub silentio. </em>Yet, we find it would be improvident to conclude that <em>Cunningham, </em>overruled <em>Palmeri, </em>sub silentio <em>unless the two are irreconcilable.</em>

    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[168,488,1152,894]]]'>Sober examination of the two cases readily reveals that they can be read so that they harmonize with one another. It is beyond dispute that <em>Cunningham </em>stands for the proposition that a trooper must be able to perform all of the essential duties of his job in order to avoid being deemed permanently disabled. The <em>Cunningham, </em>court did not, however, dictate that the duties should be defined in terms of the most hazardous assignment a trooper could possibly receive, without regard to the duties of other positions held by and regularly assigned to troopers. <em>Palmeri, </em>in turn, acknowledged the reality that there are different trooper positions within the State Police, with divergent requirements of strength and dexterity. Thus, the <em>Palmeri </em>court held that an injured trooper will be deemed temporarily disabled so long as he is capable of “performing] the duties of a position that is regularly assigned to state policemen even though the job be entirely sedentary.” <em>Palmeri, </em><a href="/pa/508/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="508 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="1793978" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0544-01">499 A.2d at 282</a>.</p>

Yet, the injured trooper need not be able to perform every duty of the most demanding position a trooper could hold in order to avoid a finding of permanent disability. Rather, it need only be shown that the injured trooper is able to fulfill all of the essential duties of a position that is held by and regularly assigned to troopers. To arrive at a contrary holding approaches absurdity. For, how can we find that a trooper who is fulfilling all of the duties of his job-a job which is held by and regularly assigned to other troopers-is concomitantly permanently disabled from working?</p>

In my view, for an appellate court to rest its contrary determination on the identification of limited responsibilities performed by some subset of troopers in general, or a light-duty assignment made available to the trooper after his injury, is in tension with the Heart and Lung Act as stated, <em>see generally supra &amp; </em>note 1, its underlying policy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> and restraints on judicial review of administrative adjudications, including respect afforded to factual findings made by an agency that are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>2 Pa.C.S. § 704. Further, such approaches would seem to facilitate potentially perverse incentives on the part of the State Police in the calculus that it must perform in its relationship with an injured trooper, for example, in militating toward possible curtailment of compassionate duty assignments.</p>

The purpose of the Heart and Lung Act is to provide Commonwealth and municipal employees engaged in police, corrections, or fire-fighting functions with temporary disability compensation for injuries incurred in the course of their sometimes-hazardous duties, with the guarantee of uninterrupted income during such disability constituting both an attraction for service and an incentive for a reasonably speedy return to full active duty. <em>Sea Camaione v.

While compensation pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act is similar in certain respects to that provided under the Workers’ Compensation Act, the latter’s purpose is more directly humanitarian, as it provides benefits to injured workers for losses of earning power resulting from either temporary or permanent disability, whereas the former extends benefits only for temporary disability. <em>See generally Iben v.
