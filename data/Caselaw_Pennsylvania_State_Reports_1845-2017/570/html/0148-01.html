(Brooks) entered into a sales agreement with Gebhard to sell all the assets associated with the insurance portion of his business, effective January 1,1997. Pursuant to the contract of sale, Brooks sold only the insurance portion of his business to Gebhard, while he retained the real estate operation. He continued to operate as Hoaster, Inc., under the same corporate entity. The agreement also provided that, for three years after the sale, Hoaster would receive, as part of the sale price, the commissions and fees earned on the insurance accounts transferred from Hoaster to Gebhard. The contract included the sale of all of Hoaster’s then-existing contracts and agreements, including Hess’ employment agreement containing the covenant not to compete. The inventory of assets being sold specifically included the employment agreement, expressly valued at $0.00, and goodwill, expressly valued at $0.00. (Hearing of August 27, 1999, Exhibit 11.) It is undisputed that Hess did not consent to the assignment of the covenant to Gebhard and that no one ever discussed the covenant with him or asked him to agree to its assignment.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[275,1420,1151,788]]]'>In November of 1996, Gebhard informed Hess that it had decided to eliminate Hess’ position when Gebhard officially assumed ownership. Gebhard did tell Hess that there might be two positions available on the effective date of sale, neither of which involved the work that Hess had done for twenty-two years, although Gebhard said that he had reservations concerning Hess’ ability to perform the positions. One involved new sales only and the other was as a customer service representative, a position requiring typing skills that would be offered at a salary far less than Hess was earning. Hess did not feel that he was qualified for either position and, in December of 1996, he indicated that he was not interested. Hess worked for Hoaster until December 31, 1996, and Gebhard assumed control on January 1, 1997. Gebhard provided Hess with a letter of recommendation.</p>

In early January of 1997, Hess and Bowman’s were in final employment contract negotiations. On January 5, 1997, less than one week after leaving Hoaster, Hess used information that he had acquired while in Hoaster’s employ and solicited the County of Lebanon, one of Hoaster’s major clients, as a new client for Bowman’s. Gebhard and Hoaster learned of this and sent Hess a letter, with a copy to Bowman’s, reminding Hess of the covenant not to compete and threatening legal action if Hess refused to comply. As a result of the letter, Bowman’s decided against hiring Hess. Shortly thereafter, Hess filed suit against Gebhard, who joined Hoaster as a party defendant.</p>

At the first hearing, the trial court denied the intentional interference with contractual relations claim, based on the pleadings. <em>Hess v. Gebhard &amp; Co. and Eugene Hoaster &amp; Co., </em>No. 1997-01189 (C.P.Pa. May 18, 1998) (Trial Court I). It also held that the assignment of the covenant from Hoaster to Gebhard, even without an explicit assignability clause or permission from Hess, was enforceable. (Trial Court I.) At the second hearing, the trial court again held that the covenant not to compete was assignable and went on to address the reasonableness of the covenant. <em>Hess v. Gebhard &amp; Co. and Eugene Hoaster &amp; Co., </em>No. 1997-01189 (C.P.Pa. February 9, 1999) (Trial Court II). The trial court found the agreement unreasonable as to time and distance, limited the duration of the covenant from the inception of the covenant (January 1, 1997) to the date of the hearing (December 1, <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>1998), and forbade Hess from contacting then-existing insurance customers of Hoaster and Gebhard for an additional period of two years. (Trial Court II.) It also determined that Hess was free to work for a competing firm in the Lebanon geographical area. (Trial Court II.) At the final hearing, in August of 1999, the trial court declined to address the assignability of the covenant but reviewed the issue of damages. <em>Hess v. Gebhard &amp; Co. and Eugene Hoaster &amp; Co., </em>No.1997-01189 (C.P.Pa. December 29, 1999) (Trial Court III).

    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[264,948,1156,421]]]'>The Superior Court affirmed, holding that the assigned covenant was enforceable because Hoaster retained a continuing interest in Hess’ competitive employment, even after the sale of its business. The Superior Court distinguished the present matter from its decision in <em>All-Pak, Inc. v. Johnston, </em><a href="/a2d/694/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="694 A.2d 347" data-case-ids="11974854" data-case-paths="/a2d/694/0347-01">694 A.2d 347</a> (Pa.Super.1997), on this basis and that, in the present case and unlike <em>Allr-Pak, </em>Hoaster had a continuing interest in the business.

Charles Brooks, the owner of Hoaster, testified that he continued to be involved in the insurance portion now owned by Gebhard. Hoaster continued to receive compensation from Gebhard on the proceeds from Hoaster’s client base sold to Gebhard. Hess, after he gained new employment with Bowman’s Insurance Agency, contacted a client of Gebhard who was formerly a client of Hoaster and attempted to procure the client’s business. Because Gebhard’s client was a former client of Hoaster, Hoaster would lose compensation from Gebhard if the client went with Bowman’s Insurance Agency. Therefore, we find that, unlike the original employer in <em>All-Pak, Inc., </em>Hoaster, who was the original employer in the present covenant, had a continuing interest via Gebhard in enforcing the covenant, not to compete.</blockquote>

The non-disclosure covenant limits the dissemination of proprietary information by a former employee, while the non-competition covenant precludes the former employee from competing with his prior employer for a specified period of time and within a precise geographic area. In Pennsylvania, restrictive covenants are enforceable if they are incident to an employment relationship between the parties; the restrictions imposed by the covenant are reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer; and the restrictions imposed are reasonably limited in duration and geographic extent. <em>Sidco Paper Co. v.

The majority of these states have concluded that the restrictive covenants are not assignable.

As we previously stated, “Our law permits equitable enforcement of employee cove<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>nants not to compete only so far as reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer.” <em>Sidco, </em><a href="/pa/465/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="465 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1712666" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0586-01">351 A.2d at 254</a>. We have also indicated that, in determining whether to enforce a non-competition covenant, the Court must balance the employer’s protectible business interest against the oppressive effect on the employee’s ability to earn a living in his or her chosen profession, trade or occupation. <em><a href="/pa/465/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="465 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1712666" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0586-01">Id.</a> See Hayes </em>(refusing to enforce a restrictive covenant in the employment contract of an optometrist because the employer had sold his practice and retained no protectible business interest).</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[268,881,1159,781]]]'>Hoaster asserts a continuing interest in the insurance accounts sold to Gebhard because it retains a financial interest in the performance and continuance of the accounts as reflected in the payout provisions of the sales agreement. The Superior Court agreed, reasoning that, as long as Hoaster retained a financial interest in the performance of the covenant in such a way that it would benefit by the performance of the covenant and lose by its violation, the covenant was enforceable. The “financial interest” found sufficient to keep the covenant alive was the retention of an interest in the future profits of the business of the corporation in the hands of a successor. However, pure financial gain at the expense of restricted competition is insufficient to constitute a protectible business interest. This Court, quoting <em>Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co.,</em>

Moreover the potential customers that were available to Hoaster’s insurance business were the same as those that were available to Gebhard or to any other insurance agency operating in Lebanon County and the identities of potential clients were widely known and easily available. If the information the employer seeks to keep confidential could be obtained by legitimate means by its competitors, enforcement of the covenant on that basis is not appropriate. <em>Carl A.
