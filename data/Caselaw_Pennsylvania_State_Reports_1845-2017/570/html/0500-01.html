Therefore, the city argues, threats are not an abnormal working condition for a police officer. However, the evaluation of threats in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Ryder </em>does not mean, as a matter of law, all types and manners of threats may be anticipated in the course of an officer’s duties. “Psychic injury cases are highly fact-sensitive and for actual work conditions to be considered abnormal, they must be considered in the context of the specific employment.” <em>Ryder, </em>at 966 (quoting <em>Wilson, </em>at 343).</p>
