In fact, Huttenstine filed four separate protection from abuse (PFA) petitions against Drumheller, one in July of 1996, one in February of 1997, one in December of 1997, and the most recent one on January 15, 1999. Each of the PFA petitions contained recitations of acts of abuse perpetrated by Drumheller against Huttenstine, including numerous incidents where Drumheller punched Huttenstine in the face, pulled her hair, kicked her, threw her to the ground, choked her, and threatened to kill her. Following the filing of each petition, the court entered a restraining order against Drumheller. With the last PFA petition, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Drumheller on January 15, 1999, and issued a final restraining order on February 8, <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>1999, that Huttenstine never requested be discontinued, altered, or modified.</p>

The court served Drumheller with notice of the January 15, 1999 PFA order restricting his contact with Huttenstine. However, on at least four occasions, Huttenstine reported to police that Drumheller had violated the terms of that order by contacting her. (Notes of Testimony (N.T.), dated December 6, 2000, Volume 4, at 152-153). In fact, on March 2, 1999, approximately six weeks before her death, Huttenstine reported to police that Drumheller had appeared at her home and had grabbed her. <em>Id. </em>at 144-148.</p>

Thereafter, Huttenstine became a confidential informant and had contact with police many times. Brenda Thomas (Thomas), another former girlfriend of Drumheller, who was also cooperating with police as a confidential informant, testified that she had first met Huttenstine in May of 1997, at which point Huttenstine showed her bruises and bite marks. According to Thomas, Huttenstine told her that Drumheller had done this by punching her, pulling her hair, biting her, and kicking her with steel-toed boots. <em>Id. </em>at 195. While Huttenstine was at Thomas’ house, Drumheller appeared and accused them both of plotting against him to set him up on a drug bust. <em>Id. </em>at 196. Drumheller allegedly told Huttenstine and Thomas that if “either one of [them] ever did anything to set him up he would kill [them].” <em>Id. </em>On other occasions, Drumheller told Thomas that he thought Huttenstine was providing information to police about his drug dealing and that if he “ever found out or had proof to back up his suspicions he would kill her.” <em>Id. </em>at 197. Cheryl Cerasoli (Cerasoli), the director of Beyond Violence, a women’s center that Huttenstine frequented between January of 1999 and her death that April, testified that Huttenstine told her that, “Troy is going to kill me. He knows that I am going to testify against him.” <em>Id. </em>at 208-209.</p>

Photographs illustrating the wife’s battered condition, including cigarette burns on her face, were admitted into evidence after witnesses testified to her continuous gruesome appearance. Appellant not only admitted to slapping his wife occasionally, but that he was under court order to forego the physical abuse of his wife. The trial court ruling admitting evidence of Appellant’s actions towards his wife for a period of seven months prior to the house burning was proper as it went to showing his ill-will and malice towards her, establishing his homicidal motive, and culminated in his murdering her.</blockquote>

Drumheller then stabbed Huttenstine in the left side of her torso, turned to Brockway, stabbed Brockway in the chest, laughed, and stated the following: “See that? Look at that. You are bleeding. You are going to die tonight. We are all going to die tonight.” (N.T., Volume 3, at 46-47). At some point in after 1:30 a.m., Brockway left the mobile home to get help. At 1:44 a.m., police arrived at the scene and found Huttenstine dead. The coroner testified that the time of death was 1:35 a.m., no more than five minutes after Brock-way left the mobile home. Huttenstine had been stabbed twenty-one times in the chest, abdomen, and side, six of which were potentially fatal, and the coroner stated that the “wounds [were] consistent with having been inflicted by a single perpetrator with a single knife.” (N.T., Volume 2, at 56).

Drumheller’s first assertion, that he did not create a grave risk of death to Brockway, is baseless. Drumheller points us to the testimony of Dr. Cynthia Graves (Dr. Graves), the emergency room physician who treated Brockway immediately following the incident. Drumheller characterizes the testimony of Dr. Graves as standing for the proposition that Brockway’s stab wounds inflicted by Drumheller were “superficial” and “not life-threatening.” (Brief of Drumheller, at 13). Dr. Graves testified that Brock-way’s wound was superficial to the chest cavity, meaning that it did not pierce into the chest cavity, but stated that the knife with which Drumheller stabbed Brockway came within one-half of an inch of entering the chest cavity, which contains the heart, aorta, and pulmonary vessels. (Graves Transcript, November 6, 2000, at 18-22). While Brockway’s injury was far less severe than it could have been, the actual injury he suffered is irrelevant to the determination of whether Drumheller put him in grave risk of death. <em>Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">599 A.2d at 628</a> (“ft]he fact that another person is lucky, and is not injured, is of no importance”). The relevant question is whether Drumheller’s conduct brought Brockway into a life-threatening situation, not whether Brockway’s wound itself was life-threatening. <em>Id, </em>We hold that Drumheller’s act of knowingly stabbing Brockway in the chest created a grave risk of death to Brockway.</p>

Hence, our inquiry turns on the point in time at which commission of the murder of Huttenstine started. If the stabbing of Brockway occurred before the murder started, then the fact that Drumheller put Brock-way in grave risk of death is of no moment because that risk would not have occurred in the commission of Huttenstine’s murder. Drumheller argues that Brockway was not in close proximity to Huttenstine at the time of the murder, and <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>therefore was not placed in grave risk of death during the murder, because he departed the mobile home while Huttenstine was still alive.</p>

Drumheller latched the door and began screaming at Huttenstine about “running away from him all the time, going to the police all the time, testifying [against him].” (N.T., Volume 3, at 45). Drumheller then stabbed Huttenstine in the left side of her torso. This evidence was sufficient to establish Drumheller’s specific intent to kill Huttenstine. At this time began Drumheller’s murder of Huttenstine. Immediately thereafter, Drumheller stabbed Brockway in the chest, placing the latter in grave risk of death as was above discussed. Drumheller then told Brockway: “You are going to die tonight. We are all going to die tonight.” (N.T., Volume 3, at 47-48).
