Observing that the Comment to Rule 405 states that a law enforcement officer may issue a citation based upon information from a witness to a summary offense, the trial court concluded that the Citation was in full compliance with Pennsylvania law inasmuch as it “was issued by a law enforcement officer, [Chief] Deputy Corwell, based on information that [Appellant] committed a summary violation received from a very credible witness.... ” (Trial Court Memorandum Opinion of 10/11/00 at 2.)</p>

The court then determined that “[t]he source for [Chief] Deputy Corwell’s authority to issue the citation in question without having observed [A]ppellant driving a motor vehicle may be found in Pa.R.Crim.P. 405, Issu<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>anee of citation, and the comments thereto.” <em><a href="/a2d/781/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="781 A.2d 168" data-case-ids="9477130" data-case-paths="/a2d/781/0168-01">Id.</a> </em>(footnote omitted). Applying the terms of Pa.R.Crim.P. 405 to the facts, and focusing on that portion of the Comment to the Rule which allows a law enforcement officer to use information received from a witness when issuing a citation, the Superior Court concluded that Chief Deputy Corwell was authorized to issue the Citation based on Musser’s reported observations, and notwithstanding the fact that he did not personally witness Appellant’s violation. <em><a href="/a2d/781/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="781 A.2d 168" data-case-ids="9477130" data-case-paths="/a2d/781/0168-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/781/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="781 A.2d 168" data-case-ids="9477130" data-case-paths="/a2d/781/0168-01">at 170</a>.

Having observed a vehicle pass a line of traffic stopped in a no-passing zone, Deputy Sheriff Kevin Gibbons directed the driver, Marshall Leet, to pull off the road. The Deputy Sheriff saw an open can of beer on the front seat as he approached the vehicle. The Deputy Sheriff administered a field sobriety test on Leet, and detained him, waiting for a radio check on his license status. The license status report revealed that Leet’s license was expired. Accordingly, Municipal Police Officer Donald Weber, who had arrived on the scene to give assistance, issued citations to Leet for driving without a valid license, for driving in a no-passing zone, and for consuming an alcoholic beverage while his vehicle was in operation. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1501, 3307, 3715.</p>

We then considered whether the sheriff and his deputies have the authority to take the law enforcement action that was at issue — a warrantless arrest for a Vehicle Code violation. We observed that under the common law, the sheriff and his deputies are empowered to make arrests without a warrant for felonies and breaches of the peace committed in their presence. <em><a href="/a2d/641/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="641 A.2d 299" data-case-ids="11291417,775549" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/0299-01,/pa/537/0089-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/641/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="641 A.2d 299" data-case-ids="11291417,775549" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/0299-01,/pa/537/0089-01">at 302-03</a>. Thus, for purposes of determining whether the warrantless arrest before us was proper, we looked to see whether that common law power has been abrogated by statute, as opposed to looking for a statute that authorized such power. Finding no abrogation, we concluded that the sheriff and his deputies may make warrantless arrests for Vehicle Code violations committed in their presence which amount to breaches of the peace. <em><a href="/a2d/641/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="641 A.2d 299" data-case-ids="11291417,775549" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/0299-01,/pa/537/0089-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/641/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="641 A.2d 299" data-case-ids="11291417,775549" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/0299-01,/pa/537/0089-01">at 303</a>.

R.Crim.P. 405, as well as its Comment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 410, which were prepared by the Committee, provide that a law enforcement officer may issue or file a citation, as the case <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>may be, based on information received from a witness to the summary violation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="ADU" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[180,444,1152,636]]]'>In contending that the Rules do not authorize Chief Deputy CorwelPs actions, Appellant makes two arguments. Appellant’s first argument is that insofar as <em>Leet’s </em>conditions for making a warrantless arrest remain unsatisfied, the Chief Deputy does not meet Pa.R.Crim.P. 108’s definition of a “law enforcement officer”. This argument has no merit. As we have determined, those conditions from <em>Leet </em>are not presently relevant. <em>See supra </em>at pp. 1194-95. Moreover, in that we have established that the sheriff and his deputies enforce the law, <em>see Leet, </em><a href="/a2d/641/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="641 A.2d 299" data-case-ids="11291417,775549" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/0299-01,/pa/537/0089-01">641 A.2d at 301-02</a>, Chief Deputy Corwell was a law enforcement officer within Pa.R.Crim.P. 103’s plain meaning.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[178,1110,1155,635]]]'>Appellant’s second argument is that the Rules which govern citation procedures do not contemplate a deputy’s use of citations based on information received from a witness. Appellant contends that the Committee’s Comments to the Rules, which he concedes state otherwise, are not binding and must be disregarded. We disagree. Although the Comments are not part of the Rules and have not been officially adopted or promulgated by this court, <em>see </em>Comments to General Provisions of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, a court may rely on the Comments to construe and apply the Rules. <em>See, e.g. Commonwealth v. Lamonna, </em><a href="/pa/473/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="473 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1730307" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0248-01">373 A.2d at </a>1358 &amp; n. 11.

We note that the trial court and the Superior Court stated in their respective opinions, as do the parties in their respective briefs, that Chief Deputy Corwell issued the citation under Pa.R.Crim.P. 405. The record reveals, however, that Deputy Chief Corwell filed the citation under Pa.R.Crim.P. 410. The fact that the lower courts and the parties have proceeded as if Chief Deputy Corwell issued the citation under Pa.R.Crim.P. 405 does not have legal significance. The analysis of the questions this appeal raises applies to both a deputy sheriff’s issuing a citation under Pa.R.Crim.P. 405 and his filing a citation under Pa. R.Crim.P. 410. Therefore, in the interests of judicial economy, we will dispose of this appeal, considering the issues raised in terms of the filing of a citation under Pa.R.Crim.P. 410.</p>
