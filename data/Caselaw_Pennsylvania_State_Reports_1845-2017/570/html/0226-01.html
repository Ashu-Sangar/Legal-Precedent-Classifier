Toward this end, the Chester County District Attorney’s Office approved four separate periods of interception. Although no interceptions occurred during the initial period, January 15, 1998, through February 9,1998, the police recorded a telephone conversation between Johnson and Spangler involving arrangements for a drug transaction on the first day ' of the next approved period (February 11 to March 2, 1998). Approximately one-half hour later police also recorded a conversation between Johnson and Spangler that occurred during the drug transaction. The tape recordings from these interceptions were delivered to the district attorney’s office on February 24, 1998, and no additional surveillance occurred during this period. From March 12, 1998 through April 12, 1998, the police were again authorized to conduct surveillance and, again on the first day, recorded a conversation between Johnson and Spangler concerning the purchase of cocaine, delivering the recording to the district attorney’s office on March 31, 1998. The final approved period for interception extended from May 26, 1998 through June 15, 1998. Three conversations were recorded on May 27, the first two concerning arrangements for a drug delivery, and the last involving the actual sale. The tape recordings of these interceptions were turned over to the district attorney’s office on July 13, 1998.</p>

Although this section was superceded prior to the court’s decision, <em>see </em>Act of Feb. 18, 1998, P.L. 102, No. 19, § 11,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> its provisions permitted suppression where the interception was not “made in accordance with Section 5704.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5721(a)(3) (superseded). In this respect, the court explained that the Wiretap Act, including Section 5704(2)(ii)’s requirement that the prosecutor approving the interception act as custodian of the recorded evidence, is to be strictly construed. Emphasizing that the district attorney’s own policy obligated police officers to forward recordings as soon as practicable, and that the West Chester Police Department was <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>only six blocks from the district attorney’s office, the court concluded that suppression was appropriate, since the failure to promptly deliver the tape recordings to the authorizing prosecutor violated the custody requirement of Section 5704.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[166,548,1156,1474]]]'>On the Commonwealth’s appeal, a divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum decision, with the majority’s reasoning tracking that of the suppression court. The dissent noted that, in the circumstance of interceptions of communications where neither party consents, upon the expiration of the order authorizing the interception, the recordings are to be immediately transferred to the judge who issued the order and sealed under his direction. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5714(b). In contrast, the dissent emphasized that the one-party consent provision in Section 5704(2)(ii), which designates the authorizing prosecutor as the custodian of the recorded evidence, does not contain a time frame for the transfer of the recordings. The dissent found the distinction to be intentional, as surveillance involving one-party consent does not generally implicate constitutional concerns and is not scrutinized as closely as non-consensual surveillance. The dissent thus declined to infer that the General Assembly intended to impose the same requirements on one-party consensual interceptions. Agreeing with the majority that a reasonableness standard should be imposed in the absence of legislative guidance, the dissent would have concluded that it was reasonable for the police to transfer the February 11 and March 12, 1998 recordings to the district attorney’s office before the expiration of the respective authorization periods, but that it was unreasonable to deliver the May 27, 1998 recordings after such expiration. This Court allowed appeal to address the Wiretap Act’s limitation upon remedies for non-constitutional violations in connection with the custodial requirement in Section 5704.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth asserts that, although Section 5704(2)(ii) designates the prosecutor who approved the interception as the custodian of the recordings, there is no requirement that he or she take physical possession at any specified time. Contrasting the explicit requirements respecting transfer and custody of recordings involving non-consensual interceptions, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5714(b), the Commonwealth argues that the absence of such requirements in Section 5704(2)(ii) was a deliberate legislative decision, as one-party consent interceptions do not implicate constitutional concerns on the order of those which pertain to non-consensual interceptions. Spangler, on the other hand, cites to the custody requirement in Section 5704 and the policy of the district attorney’s office fostering prompt transfer, arguing that the Wiretap Act requires suppression where, as here, the interception was not conducted pursuant to the requirements governing one-party consent. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 5721.1(b)(1). According to Spangler, exclusion is warranted under either version of the rule, as the interception was not accomplished in “accordance with” or “pursuant to” Section 5704, because the delay in transferring the tape recordings was in derogation of the custodial obligation of the district attorney who approved the intercep<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>tion, as well as the district attorney’s own policy requiring that recordings be turned over as soon as practicable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

As an alternate ground for affirming the order of suppression as to the February 1998 interception, Spangler argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the approval preceded the interception. Spangler bases such argument on the lack of clarity concerning the dates appearing upon the documents evidencing the informant’s consent and the prosecutor’s approval. The suppression court’s opinion resolves this issue in finding that "all the requirements of the statute regarding such intercepts were complied with up to the point where the confidential informant was given his wire and sent out to make purchases from Yuri Spangler.” The record supports this finding.</p>

The majority improperly focuses on the apparent need to engraft an additional element (a specific time requirement for transfer of recorded evidence) <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>to the provision of the Wiretap Act dealing with one-party consensual interceptions, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5704(2)(ii). To the contrary, one need not alter the statutory language to find an illegal interception here. The lower courts recognized that Section 5704(2)(ii) provides that the Attorney General or District Attorney (or its designee), who authorizes the interception, shall act as the custodian of the recorded evidence obtained therefrom. As such requirement was not satisfied here, the lower courts correctly ruled that the tape recordings were inadmissible at trial.</p>

None of the tapes were placed into the District Attorney’s custody within a reasonable time after interception. The tape of February 11 or 12, 1998, was returned nearly two weeks later on February 24, 1998. The tape of March 12, 1998, was returned over two weeks later on March 31, 1998. Finally, the tape of May 27, 1998, was returned over six weeks later on July 13, 1998. In suppressing the evidence as violative of the custodial requirement, the trial court found that it was the policy of the District Attorney’s Office to have any tape recordings returned “as soon as practicable.” Trial court opinion at 236. The court further found that the police headquarters and the District Attorney’s Office are located only 6 blocks away from each other. <em><a href="/citations/?q=422%20A.2d%20105" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="422 A.2d 105">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=422%20A.2d%20105" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="422 A.2d 105">at 236</a>.

This provision deals with a <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>different type of interception than the one at issue in this case and provides for a different procedure to be employed. It is simply irrelevant to the analysis here. . The fact that Section 5704(2)(ii) does not include the word “immediately” or some other time designation prior to the custodial language is of no moment. In order for the District Attorney’s Office to act asf the custodian of the tape recordings, it must possess and control the recordings within a reasonable time after interception. It did not do so here. The majority’s proposition that the Legislature in some way intended to permit police detectives to retain tape recordings after one-party consensual interceptions is belied by the plain statutory language requiring the District Attorney’s Office to act as custodian of the evidence in these cases.</p>

Section 5721.1(b)(1) was enacted, effective on February 18, 1998, to replace Section 5721(a)(3).
