States (“Claimant”) was employed as an interstate truck driver, by Appellee Mcllvaine Trucking, Inc.

At hire (and apparently as a condition of his employment), Claimant signed an agreement to be bound by the workers’ compensation laws of West Virginia should he <a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>suffer work-related injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In June of 1992, Claimant did sustain injury to his leg and lower back while performing his duties at Employer’s facility located in New Stanton, Pennsylvania, initially resulting in a five-day absence from work, for which he applied for and received benefits under the West Virginia workers’ compensation act. Claimant’s symptoms later recurred following a period of furlough, and he was diagnosed with a disabling back injury in the late spring of 1994. Subsequently, Claimant filed a claim petition under the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> as well as a penalty petition. In response, although acknowledging the fact of the work injury, Employer asserted that the WCJ lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the petition in light of Claimant’s consent to be bound by the laws of West Virginia. Although Employer acknowledged the Act’s general applicability to instate injuries, it argued that in Section 305.2(d)(5) of the Act the Legislature authorized agreements altering such effect by providing that:</p>

According to Claimant, Section 805.2 in no way sanctions an agreement to avoid Pennsylvania jurisdiction over an in-state injury. Further, Claimant maintains that any such agreement is void as in violation of the Act’s overriding policy to afford compensation for in-state, work-related injuries. In support of Claimant’s position, <em>amicus curiae, </em>the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association, criticizes the Commonwealth Court’s reliance upon <em>Robert M. Neff, </em>since the decision approves the assertion of Pennsylvania jurisdiction over an in-state injury, as well as <em>Creel, </em>since it concerned an extraterritorial injury and thus, unlike the present case, represented an appropriate setting for <a id="p668" href="#p668" data-label="668" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*668</a>application for Section 305.2. Employer, on the other hand, maintains that Section 305.2(d)(5) authorizes choice-of-law agreements in the workers’ compensation setting governing the conferral of benefits for both in- and out-of-state injuries. Employer asserts that the underlying policy of Section 305.2 is to foster broad predictability in the workers’ compensation process by allowing parties by agreement to ameliorate the administrative burden and uncertainty involved in compliance with the many, and sometimes conflicting, state workers’ compensation systems in force nationwide. <em>Amici curiae, </em>American Trucking Association, Inc. and Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association, elaborate upon such burdens and cite to decisions from other jurisdictions which they contend adopt Employer’s proffered construction of provisions substantially similar to Section 302.5(d)(5). <em>See, e.g., Cawyer v.

    <p id="b780-4" data-blocks='[["BL_780.4",780,[263,717,1160,904]]]'>The language of § 305(d)(5) evinces the Legislature’s intent to allow an employee and employer to confer jurisdiction of the workers’ compensation laws of a particular state when the employee regularly travels in more than one state. The Legislature provided for two protections in allowing the designation to be made: first, the agreement designating the state in which the employee’s employment is principally localized must be in writing; and second, the agreement is to be given effect under the Act unless the designated state refuses jurisdiction. Notably, § 305(d)(5) provides that such an agreement “shall be given effect <em>under this act </em>” when those conditions are satisfied. Section 305(d)(5) is not limited by its terms to injuries occurring extraterritorially, under only that specific provision of the act. To the contrary, the language of § 305(d)(5) clearly requires the agreement to be given effect under the entire act. This extends to those injuries that are sustained within Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b780-5" data-blocks='[["BL_780.5",780,[261,1653,1155,580]]]'>To hold otherwise defeats the Legislature’s intent. Section 302(d)(5) was designed to eliminate the uncertainty as to which state’s workers’ compensation law would apply when an employee’s regular travel within different states would give rise to the possibility that jurisdiction would lie in any of those states. In authorizing the employee to enter into a written agreement, the Legislature created a mechanism whereby an employer could determine where it would be responsible for maintaining workers’ compensation insurance. The written agreement would eliminate the uncertainty facing an employer whose employees travel in several states.</p>

When a claim can potentially be filed in any state in the country, a motor carrier employer must become expert on up to 50 state workers’ compensation systems, and establish an infrastructure of health care providers and legal counsel in every state. This cumulative burden results in significantly increased administrative expenses to manage claims in many different states, loss of economies of scale that could result from dealing in only one or a limited number of forums, and difficulties in assembling a cadre of health care personnel to provide the medical care and rehabilitative services associated with workers’ compensation programs. Motor carriers must also waste resources on developing a network of legal counsel in multiple states to fight jurisdictional issues that need not arise. Finally, the unpredictability of where a claim may be heard increases the carrier’s workers’ compensation insurance premiums or cost of self insurance.</blockquote>
