On February 7, 1986, a jury found Haag guilty of the first-degree murder and kidnapping of Richard Good. Following a penalty phase hearing, the jury sentenced Haag to death and the trial court imposed a consecutive sentence of ten to twenty years imprisonment for the kidnapping charge. Haag filed a direct appeal with this Court. During the pendency of his direct appeal, Haag’s attorney at trial and on appeal, Robert L. Van Hoove, Esq. (Van Hoove), died. Subsequent to his death, Van Hoove’s files regarding Haag’s case were destroyed. Then, this Court affirmed Haag’s conviction for murder in the first-degree and the sentence of death. <em>Commonwealth v.

An attorney from the Huntingdon County Public Defender’s Office represented Haag at the involuntary treatment hearing. By Order dated April 5, 1991, former President Judge Newton C. Taylor denied the Petition for Involuntary Treatment. The judge found evidence that Haag was mentally ill; however, he denied the petition because the DOC had failed to demonstrate that Haag was a danger to himself or others, as required for involuntary treatment orders under the Mental Health Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Due to the severity of the penalty involved, we do not want such a potential class of claims to escape review; however, we do not believe that an indefinite suspension of PCRA proceedings is the best way to preserve such issues.

      <em>Ford </em>addresses only the imposition of the death penalty and does not examine any limitation on a state’s power to require a next friend to proceed with the post conviction proceedings that he or she has initiated.

A next friend in the PCRA context is no different. Unlike trial, collateral review may effectively proceed despite a prisoner’s incompetence.

In separate proceedings, CLEADA sought an Order from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania staying the execution of Heidnik and designating Heidnik's daughter as next friend. On April 16, 1997, this Court granted a temporary stay of execution. Meanwhile, the federal district court denied relief to Heidnik, but continued a stay of execution pending an appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

A perpetual stay of the PCRA proceedings pending Haag’s speculative return to competence could, thus, foreclose review of his substantive PCRA claims entirely, forever preventing him from receiving whatever relief he may be due.

The very reason that courts permit such vicarious litigation by a next friend is so that third-parties may pursue matters on behalf of parties who are unable to do so themselves. <em>See Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em><a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">495 U.S. 149</a>, 163, <a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">110 S.Ct. 1717</a>, <a href="/us/495/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="495 U.S. 149" data-case-ids="633773" data-case-paths="/us/495/0149-01">109 L.Ed.2d 135</a> (1990) (“A ‘next friend’ does not himself become a party to the ... action in which he participates, but simply pursues the cause on behalf of the detained person, who remains the real party in interest.”) (emphasis added). The test for next friend status is designed to ensure that the party who would conduct the vicarious litigation is one who truly has the disabled litigant’s best interests at heart. Where a qualified next friend (here, Haag’s mother) and competent counsel stand ready to pursue the cause on an incompetent PCRA petitioner’s behalf, the matter should proceed so that the petitioner may promptly have the claims reviewed and reap the benefit of any claim deemed meritorious. The indefinite suspension of Haag’s PCRA proceedings would perversely effect the very result that the next friend doctrine is meant to prevent: the effective abandonment of a potentially meritorious cause of action merely because the PCRA petitioner is personally incapable of pursuing the matter at the time. Not surprisingly, while many decisions in this jurisdiction and elsewhere have recognized the propriety of a next friend stepping into the shoes of an incompetent capital defendant and vicariously litigating a cause on his behalf, appellant cites no authority holding that the true purpose of next friend standing is to immediately halt <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>that vicarious litigation after once establishing the power to pursue it.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[273,447,1155,1425]]]'>As the majority also recognizes, a perpetual stay is problematic because it could effectively destroy the notion of finality in capital cases. The inability of a party to meaningfully participate in any vicariously litigated cause has a potentially adverse effect upon the cause, but that would be no reason to abandon or delay a cause especially where the alleged harm — • here, wrongful conviction and punishment — is not merely a past episode but is present and ongoing by the fact of incarceration. It is difficult to imagine a non-capital prisoner, whether pursuing the matter in his own right or represented by a next friend, filing a PCRA petition and then insisting that it be placed in indeterminable stasis: the notion of vindication after many years wrongly served in prison is anathema to a system of justice.

Haag may be granted relief in this action; even if he is not, he may never be competent again or, if he is, there may in fact be.no non-waived, cognizable PCRA claims for him to pursue. In short, the issue posed may never ripen into an actual case or controversy. More importantly, as the majority recognizes, the standards that govern the availability of eollat<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>eral attack are not immutable; thus, the PCRA landscape itself may be significantly altered by the time Haag would pursue relief via a serial petition. For example, depending upon the contours of the serial claim(s) to be raised, eligibility for relief may be affected by intervening decisional law. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(iii) (setting forth exception to PCRA time bar where “the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively”). This is not at all an unusual circumstance in the capital arena. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court’s recent holding in <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em><a href="/us/536/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="186" data-cite="536 U.S. 304" data-case-ids="1255406" data-case-paths="/us/536/0304-01">536 U.S. 304</a>, <a href="/us/536/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="187" data-cite="536 U.S. 304" data-case-ids="1255406" data-case-paths="/us/536/0304-01">122 S.Ct. 2242</a>, <a href="/us/536/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="188" data-cite="536 U.S. 304" data-case-ids="1255406" data-case-paths="/us/536/0304-01">153 L.Ed.2d 335</a> (2002), which held, for the first time, that execution of the mentally retarded is violative of the Eighth Amendment, no doubt has already generated litigation under this provision of the PCRA, centering around the question of retroactivity. Moreover, the standards governing both PCRA eligibility and PCRA procedural matters are subject to change by the General Assembly and by this Court through its rulemaking authority, respectively. Changes to PCRA legislation and PCRA procedural rules obviously are often directly responsive to opinions from this and other courts responding to previously unperceived or unanticipated issues. Thus, this very case may cause the General Assembly — which is better equipped than this Court to identify and balance all relevant considerations affecting the availability of collateral review under the PCRA — to squarely address the question of the incompetent PCRA petitioner who proceeds via a next friend petition.

The after-discovered evidence exception found in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(h) covers situations “when the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(h) (emphasis added). The theoretical situation posed here, however, is not one where the facts would be unknown to Haag, but rather the exact opposite: the facts would be exclusively within his knowledge.
