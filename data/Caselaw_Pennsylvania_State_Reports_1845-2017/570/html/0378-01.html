Ms. Sharpe’s bra had been ripped off and her skirt was pulled up above her waist. Ms. Mitchell was also found naked from the waist down, with her underwear ripped from her body. In the store, the cash register drawer was open and loose change was strewn on the floor. While the police were investigating the scene of the crime, Appellant approached the police, identified himself as Kenneth Jones, and stated that he knew who killed the two victims. Initially, he told an officer that he was in Ms. Sharpe’s store and witnessed the murders. Shortly thereafter, he changed his story and told the officer that he watched the murders from across the street. Appellant then requested that a detective accompany him down an isolated street where the two talked. At this time, Appellant appeared to become <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>agitated about the deaths of the two victims and the detective attempted to calm him down by patting him near the waist. When the detective put his hand on Appellant, he felt a hard object. He reached under Appellant’s clothing and removed a ten-inch Bowie knife from his waistband. Appellant pulled up his sweater to wipe his forehead and revealed a blood stain on his T-shirt. The detective then asked Appellant to go to the police station to further explain to the police what he saw. Appellant acquiesced and stated that he would do anything to help catch the people who killed the two women. At the police station, Appellant was handcuffed to a chair and interviewed by another detective. This detective saw blood on the zipper area of Appellant’s pants and on his sweater. He asked Appellant to remove his clothing. When Appellant took off his two bloodstained shirts, he revealed a cut on his chest. Appellant also removed his pants and swim trunks, both of which had blood stains on them. After Appellant was given his Miranda warnings, he claimed to have been playing “craps” during the murders and that he had won a large amount of money doing so. He also claimed that he had received the chest abrasion during a fight with two men and that an unidentified man had given him the Bowie knife. Appellant’s fingerprints, his knife and a victim’s blood type subsequently linked Appellant to the killings. Appellant was arrested and charged with murder and related offenses.</p>

New counsel was appointed to represent Appellant and on April 7, 1997, an Amended Petition alleging the availability of after-discovered exculpatory evidence and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was filed. On July 9, 1997, the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss Appellant’s Amended Petition. The following day, Appellant, represented by Mr. Lee and Billy Ñolas of the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy and Defense Assistance (CLEADA), filed a Supplemental Petition and on September 8, 1997, filed a Supplemental Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief and for Statutory Post-Conviction Relief Under the Post-Conviction Relief Act.

Specifically, Appellant contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by: soliciting highly prejudicial comments from Commonwealth witness Daisy Fisher; attempting to deceive the jury as to whether Commonwealth witness Paulette Riddick had an arrangement with the prosecution; improperly alluding to Appellant’s criminal record by soliciting testimony that brought out the fact that Appellant’s fingerprints were already on file with the police prior to his arrest for the murders; improperly vouching for the credibility of one of the detectives who worked on the case; telling the jury that there was additional <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>evidence that the Commonwealth had not brought forth; and knowingly presenting perjured testimony to the jury. He also claims that the perjury of Commonwealth witness Dennis Sims Africa constitutes after-discovered evidence that entitles him to relief; that his right to confront witnesses was violated by the trial court’s restrictions on cross-examination; that his conviction and death sentence were the products of racial discrimination; that the trial court’s instructions on mitigating evidence were unconstitutional; that his rights were violated by Mr. Justice Castille’s failure to recuse himself from hearing Appellant’s direct appeal to this Court; that the trial court erred in failing to advise the jury regarding the meaning of a life sentence under <em>Simmons v.

The PCRA court, however, went on to conclude that there was no .reasonable probability that the outcome of the penalty phase deliberations would have differed. The PCRA court noted that although Appellant’s mitigating evidence was extensive, it was “severely compromised by the quality of defendant’s prior bad acts and the effective cross-examination of [Appellant’s] experts.” <em>See id. </em>at 18. In support of this conclusion, the PCRA court pointed to the Commonwealth’s rebuttal evidence that Appellant had previously been convicted of the sexual assault of a twelve year-old boy, that he had been a gang member in his youth, and that he had threatened to Mil his grandparents and set their house on fire. In addition, the court noted that the Commonwealth would have presented psychiatric evaluations of Appellant concluding that he had an anti-social personality disorder and that he was aggressive, explosive, and impulsive. The PCRA court also noted that the Commonwealth would have presented the opinion of a clinical psychologist that Appellant does not suffer from organic brain damage and that he is not learning disabled.</p>

It is the duty of the jury to consider all evidence — evidence of aggravating circumstances, evidence of mitigating circumstances as well as rebuttal evidence — in deciding whether or not a defendant should receive the sentence of death. Yet, the jury in the instant case was, in effect, given no meaningful evidence of mitigation to consider in their weighing process even though, as the PCRA court noted, extensive evidence was available. Even without such evidence, however, the record shows that the jury was deadlocked at one point during their penalty phase deliberations. Given these circumstances, we cannot agree that there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the penalty phase deliberations would have been different had <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>counsel presented evidence of mitigation, including evidence of Appellant’s history of abuse, mental illness and dysfunction. We therefore agree with Appellant that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present such evidence and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in this regard.

At some point during the arguments relating to each of these waived claims of straight trial error, Appellant tacks on a bald sentence that trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise and/or properly litigate the underlying claims of error. Then, at the end of the discussion section of his brief, Appellant adds a one paragraph summation that each of these “ineffectiveness claims” were of arguable merit, that counsels' failures had no reasonable strategic bases, and that the <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>errors all established prejudice.

However, an undeveloped argument such as the one presented by Appellant, which fails to meaningfully apply the standard governing the review of ineffectiveness claims at any point, simply does not satisfy Appellant’s burden of establishing that he is entitled to any relief. <em>See Commonwealth v.

We could not, however, reach this same conclusion had Appellant framed the instant claims as ones of ineffectiveness, applied and discussed the tripartite ineffectiveness standard at least as it related to trial counsel’s performance, and provided a properly-layered assertion that prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. Only then, contrary to what Justice Newman suggests in her concurring opinion, would these claims warrant merit review under this Court's precedent. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=787%20A.2d%20344" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="787 A.2d 344">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=787%20A.2d%20344" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="787 A.2d 344">at 351-57</a> (reviewing numerous claims where appellant addressed each prong of the ineffectiveness standard as it related to trial counsel and at least included a properly-layered assertion that all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s trial counsel testified that, prior to trial, he spoke with the prosecutor who indicated that he would provide trial counsel with Appellant's mental health reports from the parole department, which, according to the prosecutor, contained evidence that Appellant was explosive. Based on this conversation and without actually reviewing the parole board files, trial counsel declined the prosecutor’s offer and decided not to introduce any psychiatric records during the penalty phase given his concern that the reports might have opened the door to the admission of Appellant’s prior record. Trial counsel eventually did review the parole board records, but not until the lunch recess just before he was to present Appellant’s evidence of mitigation. Thus, although counsel did offer a reason for not presenting Appellant's psychiatric records, this decision was based on very limited information and without actually reviewing the supporting documents.

In this regard, it is notable that, although appellant produced his trial counsel at the evidentiary hearing below, he did not call direct appeal counsel. Nor has there ever been any proffer from appellant as to what appellate counsel might say in response to the present accusation. The Court thus summarily grants relief upon a Sixth Amendment claim, and casually labels a member of the bar of this Court as a constitutionally incompetent appellate lawyer, despite having no factual record, or legal argument, that remotely accounts for the conduct of that lawyer, the only lawyer whose stewardship is subject to attack under the PCRA. The Court grants relief without displaying an awareness or concern for the actual federal constitutional value — competent appellate counsel — that is at stake. Thus, the Court makes no attempt to “reconstruct the circumstances” facing appellate counsel, or to “evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time.” <em>Bell; Strickland. </em>Nor does the Court discuss the claims that counsel actually raised on appeal, much less explain why counsel was required to raise this claim in addition to, or instead of, the claims that were pursued. <em>See Gray v.

These are not technical deficiencies; they go to the very heart of the Sixth Amendment matter, since the Court’s <em>per se </em>standard effectively reverses the constitutional presumption that counsel was competent. The Court’s <em>per se </em>holding deems it irrelevant to consider, for example, what kind of investigation appellate counsel actually undertook with respect to this extra-record claim, <em>i.e., </em>whether he talked to his client, his client’s family, and to trial counsel respecting foregone potential mitigation evidence; whether appellant and his family disclosed any helpful information in that regard; whether trial counsel admitted his own ineptitude then as willingly as he later admitted it at the PCRA hearing; and whether appellate counsel performed legal research on the issue and, if so, what he found.

Or, for all the Court knows, direct appeal counsel may have perceived the claim but determined, in his professional judgment, that the claims he actually pursued on appeal — which the Court never discusses — offered a greater prospect for relief under the law in existence at that time. Contrary to the Court’s erroneous view of the Sixth Amendment, appellate counsel is not automatically ineffective for failing to discover and pursue on appeal any and all possible claims — and especially non-record-based claims that depend critically upon admissions of incompetence from previous counsel.</p>

Appellant does not merely seek a new penalty hearing, but also a new trial. To that end, he has raised numerous claims arising from alleged errors at the guilt phase of his trial. These claims, like the claim upon which the Court grants relief, are reviewable only as claims sounding in appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness. Appellant’s argument respecting appellate counsel as to these claims is the <em>very same </em>boilerplate argument that the Court deems sufficient to warrant a finding of <em>per se </em>ineffectiveness and penalty phase <em>relief </em>— i.e., it is the single paragraph that comprises Argument XIX.

If there must inevitably be bad law resulting from this hard case, I would prefer that it be confined to a state procedural matter that we might attempt to explain or correct. On the substantive question here, however, the inescapable fact is that trial counsel’s belated confession of ineptitude does not control the constitutional inquiry into the objective reasonableness of the appellate litigation decisions made by direct appeal counsel. The outright grant of penalty phase relief here is, in short, perplexingly erroneous under United States Supreme Court authority — authority the Court inexplicably fails even to acknowledge.</p>

In his separate Concurring Opinion, Mr. Justice Saylor responds to this dissent by suggesting that this Court overrule our decisions holding that <em>Albrecht, </em>which enforced the PCRA waiver provision and abrogated the judicial relaxed waiver doctrine on PCRA review, should be applied to petitions pending when <em>Albrecht </em>was decided. The effect of recasting <em>Albrecht </em>as a purely prospective decision, and reinstituting relaxed waiver, would be to ignore that appellant’s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness is barred under the terms of the PCRA which, in turn, <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>would avoid the necessity of addressing whether appellate counsel was ineffective. In my Concurring Opinion in <em>Bracey, </em>I addressed at length why I believe that (1) <em>Albrecht </em>was correctly decided, as it merely enforced the PCRA's waiver provision which had been wrongly subverted by relaxed waiver, and (2) our decisions on the retroactivity of <em>Albrecht </em>were also correctly decided, in light of the actual purpose, scope and history of the doctrine. <a href="/pa/568/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="192" data-cite="795 A.2d 935" data-case-ids="163716,9427271" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0264-01,/a2d/795/0935-01">795 A.2d at </a>951--57 (Castille, J., concurring).

The federal habeas question of adequate state procedural grounds is distinct from the question of Pennsylvania law we faced in Albrecht, <em>i.e., </em>whether to continue subverting a valid statutory default via a misplaced, discretionary judicial doctrine. A federal court looking at the adequacy of a state procedural default for habeas purposes is not concerned with whether the default is based upon a statute, rule, or case law, or even with whether the default has an unconstitutionally retroactive effect. Instead, the broader habeas inquiry is concerned with how settled and consistently applied the default was at the time the default occurred. In determining the distinct question of the propriety of relaxed waiver upon PCRA review, this Court could not overlook the fact that the default is statutory, and that any application of relaxed waiver which would defeat the statute was erroneous. Similarly, in later determining the question of retroactivity, we could not refuse to apply <em>Albrecht </em>without flouting the statutory provision.</p>
