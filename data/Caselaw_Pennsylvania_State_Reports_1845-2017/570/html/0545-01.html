We agree. This Court addressed all of the claims raised at the time of Appellant’s direct appeal. <em>See </em><a href="/pa/534/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="534 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1839680" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0488-01">534 Pa. 488</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="534 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1839680" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0488-01">633 A.2d 1100</a>.

As, for these purposes, a judgment becomes final at the conclusion of direct review per 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3), the previous proceedings, despite being labeled as PCRA proceedings, could not have been Appellant’s first PCRA petition. Thus, under the circumstances and particular procedure of this case, we proceed to analyze the current appeal as if it resulted from a timely first petition for relief under the PCRA.</p>

She closed the door and hoped Appellant would be okay. She further states in her affidavit that, “[a] few days later I hear that the [victims] had been killed .... and that they’d been dead for a couple of days before the police found their bodies.

This argument fails for the same reason that counsel were not ineffective for failing to present evidence of mental illness as a mitigating factor during the sentencing hearing. Counsel did pursue an investigation into Appellant’s mental health, and this investigation did not reveal any mental illness. We cannot therefore find counsel ineffective for not pursuing an avenue of defense, which he did indeed investigate.

Appellant also asserts that Brecher was using drugs and/or alcohol at the time of his trial testimony. This assertion is also based upon Brecher’s affidavit.

That helped to calm me so that I could testify against my friend.” Brecher affidavit, Appellant’s Appendix § 18,- at ¶ 18. Assuming, arguendo, that Brecher’s affidavit accurately reflects that he had imbibed alcohol prior to testifying at trial, Appellant fails to explain why or how counsel was or should have been aware of this at the time Brecher testified.

Trial counsel argued to the jury that it should not find that Appellant committed the murders with premeditation. The closing statement that Appellant now objects to is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b667-7" data-blocks='[["BL_667.6",667,[228,1235,1115,960]]]'>Now, murder of the first degree in an intentional killing. And the Crimes Code defines intentional killing as a killing by means of poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful deliberate and premeditated killing. The key terms in terms of intentional killing are premeditation and deliberation. In terms of the time factor. And scholars even today debate over what is the proper time where you can form the premeditation to kill someone. Now, some believe, and certainly it is within your province to say that a person can form the premeditation to kill someone within a fraction of a second. You certainly have that province as jurors to follow that kind of a view. The other view and the more traditional view is that in terms of premeditation, and when we think about premeditation in general we think about plotting to kill someone or planning to kill someone. That is the traditional view; and I think that kind of view, if you applied that view to this particular case here you will come up with third degree murder.</blockquote>

The Commonwealth presented evidence that Appellant had previously been convicted of aggravated robbery, rape, and burglary in support of aggravating circumstance (d)(9). During the guilt phase of the trial, the Commonwealth demonstrated that Appellant committed two murders either at the same time, or one before the other and thus had demonstrated aggravating circumstance (d)(ll). With these two aggravating factors, we cannot find that the jury could have, for instance, decided that appellant had previously been convicted of violent crimes prior to the murder of one victim, but not prior to the murder of the other victim. Nor do we find that a more explicit separation of the two sentences would have resulted in any juror finding a mitigating circumstance.

Similarly Appellant seeks a remand for review of a video tape produced by former Assistant Distinct Attorney Jack McMahon which purports to train prosecutors to discriminate against African-American jurors. This Court has reviewed Appellant’s claim under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>and found that Appellant has failed to demonstrate any racial bias in the jury selection process.

The relevant question with regards to the issue is whether a material question of fact was presented. Appellant submitted to the PCRA court, as well as to this Court, a significant amount of factual material primarily in the form of affidavits from various potential witnesses including mental health witnesses, family, and friends. The veracity of these affidavits are not in dispute here, however, for the various reasons stated previously in this opinion this evidence does not entitle Appellant relief under the PCRA. Additionally, many of the issues which often require a hearing were resolved under the unique post-trial procedure which included testimony from Appellant as well as trial counsel. For the reasons stated above, Appellant has not demonstrated his eligibility for relief under the PCRA and we affirm the order of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
