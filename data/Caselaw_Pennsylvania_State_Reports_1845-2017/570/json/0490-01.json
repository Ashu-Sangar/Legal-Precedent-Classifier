The Commonwealth Court ignored those portions of the Physical Therapy Practice Act (PTPA) that provide that the PTPA will not limit a physician\u2019s ability to practice medicine. See 63 P.S. \u00a7 1304(a), (b.l). These provisions must be read in pari materia with the Medical Practice Act and the Osteopathic Medical Practice Act, which delineate the scope of the physician\u2019s practice of medicine. In my view, the practice of medicine encompasses the services at issue here, and is not limited by the PTPA. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1712, amended by 2002, Oct. 4, P.L. 845, No. 123, \u00a7 3 (amending the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law to require insurers to cover \u201crehabilitative medicine . .. services\u201d, including \u201cphysical therapy\u201d). Accordingly, I cannot join the decision to affirm per curiam the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nJustice NIGRO joins this dissenting statement.",
