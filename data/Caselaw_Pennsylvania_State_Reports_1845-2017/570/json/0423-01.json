        "text": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nThis appeal requires us to consider, for purposes of determining the effect of an interstate commerce endorsement appended to a commercial vehicle liability insurance policy, whether a tractor-trailer was engaged in interstate commerce when it collided with another vehicle.\nThe accident occurred in November, 1995, in Forward Township, Allegheny County; the tractor-trailer involved was dispatched by Appellee Marbec Trucking Company, leased from Appellee Wayne S. Hursh, and driven by Loren J. Druist. In a civil action commenced in Allegheny County against Marbec, Hursh, Druist, and others, Appellees Blanche M. and James E. Hoover averred that Druist failed to observe a traffic signal, causing the truck to strike the automobile driven by Mrs. Hoover, who sustained serious injuries. Marbec\u2019s insurer, Appellant Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, filed the present declaratory judgment action naming the parties to the underlying action as defendants and seeking a judicial determination concerning its obligations under the policy issued to Marbec.\nProgressive\u2019s base policy covered vehicles scheduled within the declaration pages, which did not include Hursh\u2019s truck. Nevertheless, in connection with Marbec\u2019s federal certification to conduct interstate operations, the business had also obtained from Progressive an \u201cEndorsement for Motor Carrier Policies of Insurance for Public Liability under Sections 29 and 30 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.\u201d Commonly referred to as an \u201cMCS-90\u201d or \u201cinterstate commerce endorsement,\u201d this rider required Progressive to pay a final judgment recovered against its insured \u201cresulting from negligence in the operation, maintenance or use of motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of Sections 29 and 30 of the [MCA] regardless of whether or not each motor vehicle is specifically described in the policy.\u201d Since Sections 29 and 30 of the MCA pertained to certain matters involving interstate commerce, see infra note 8, the endorsement was therefore implicated in relation to Hursh\u2019s truck only to the extent that it was operated, pursuant to the Marbec lease, in furtherance of interstate commerce.\nProgressive and the Hoovers filed cross-motions for summary judgment to vindicate their respective views concerning the application of the MCS-90 and, in particular, to resolve whether the shipment at issue was interstate or intrastate in character. According to Progressive, because Hursh\u2019s tractor-trailer was transporting its cargo between two points within Pennsylvania, it was necessarily engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce. Appellees\u2019 position was that the carriage via Hursh\u2019s truck represented merely the final leg of a continuous, interstate shipment, since the truck\u2019s contents previously had moved between states. To further contextualize the question, the parties attached to their submissions transcripts from deposition testimony adduced from parties and witnesses.\nThe cargo involved was distiller\u2019s grain, a byproduct of the production of ethanol used as a feed additive for dairy cattle. The shipment derived from an order placed approximately one month prior to the accident by the Pennsylvania Agricultural Commodities Marketing Association, Inc. (\u201cPACMA\u201d), a grain broker, with the Jesse Stewart Co. (\u201cJesse Stewart\u201d), a grain wholesaler that sells primarily to feed mills in Pennsylvania. PACMA requested to purchase fifteen truckloads of the grain, or approximately 345 tons. Jesse Stewart\u2019s usual practice was to wait until it had accumulated enough orders to warrant the purchase of a bargeload (1,000 to 1,500 tons) of distiller\u2019s grain, and then arrange for a barge to transport the commodity from the producer\u2019s Illinois distillery to a storage facility owned and operated by Clairton Slag in West Elizabeth, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. There, Clairton Slag unloaded, stored, and loaded grain onto trucks at Jesse Stewart\u2019s expense, with some trucks being commissioned by Jesse Stewart for delivery to its customers and others by the customers themselves. In the case of customers, including PACMA, making their own arrangements for land transportation, title to the grain transferred upon loading at the Clairton Slag facility.\nWhen purchasing quantities of distiller\u2019s grain, Jesse Stewart\u2019s intention was to have the product move through the storage facility to customers as quickly as possible. A barge-load apparently remained in the facility for seven to fifteen days on average. Although it appears that an order such as that placed by PACMA would aid in prompting Jesse Stewart toward purchasing a bargeload, a representative of the company testified that it would have done so only in the context of an overall buying strategy, not in the sense that the quantity ordered by PACMA could be traced to a particular bargeload (the storage facility could hold approximately one and one-half bargeloads). Moreover, the depositions do not reflect knowledge on the part of Jesse Stewart of the ultimate destination of the relevant portion (one of fifteen truckloads) of the distiller\u2019s grain. This destination was Kreider\u2019s Feed Mill in Loysville, Perry County, Pennsylvania (PACMA\u2019s customer), with PACMA arranging for the transportation with Marbec as the carrier. The timing of the lodging of the order of Kreider\u2019s Feed Mill with PACMA is also not clear.\nBased on the above, the common pleas court denied Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted the Hoovers\u2019, noting that even though the route of a shipment may be entirely within a single state (here, West Elizabeth to Loysville, Pennsylvania), the shipment may nevertheless be part of a larger, continuing movement in interstate commerce. See Texas v. United States, 866 F.2d 1546, 1553 (5th Cir.1989). The common pleas court explained that whether a particular shipment is interstate or intrastate depends upon the essential character of the commerce \u2014 the primary determinant of which is the shipper\u2019s fixed, persisting intent at the time of shipment \u2014 and that all of the circumstances surrounding the shipment at issue are to be considered in ascertaining the shipper\u2019s prevailing intent. See Century Indem. Co. v. Carlson, 133 F.3d 591, 595 (8th Cir.1998) (quoting Roberts v. Levine, 921 F.2d 804, 812 (8th Cir.1990)). Having implicitly identified Jesse Stewart as the shipper, the common pleas court summarized the facts of the case and concluded that\n[clearly] this grain was moving in interstate commerce. When Jesse Stewart purchased the grain from [the producer] in Illinois, its ultimate destination had in large part been predetermined. It would ultimately be shipped to Jesse Stewart\u2019s customers at various locations in Pennsylvania based upon preexisting orders. The barge trip from Illinois to West Elizabeth was intended to be only the first leg of shipment. Once the grain was unloaded into the storage facility, it would only remain there briefly until Jesse Stewart\u2019s customers picked it up to transport it to the final destinations within Pennsylvania.\nThus, Jesse Stewart clearly intended that the distillers grain would move beyond its storage facilities in West Elizabeth.\nTherefore, the common pleas court determined that the MCS-90 applied and, accordingly, directed Progressive to pay any final judgment obtained by the Hoovers against Marbec, up to the policy limits.\nOn Progressive\u2019s appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, applying the same focus as the common pleas court in terms of the essential character of the commerce, the fixed and persisting intent of the shipper, and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the shipment. See Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hoover, 768 A.2d 1157 (Pa.Super.2001). The Superior Court also agreed with the common pleas court\u2019s position that Jesse Stewart was the relevant shipper, and Jesse Stewart\u2019s intent was to move the grain as far into Pennsylvania as barge transportation would allow, with the understanding that the product\u2019s ultimate destination beyond the warehouse had already been determined when PACMA\u2019s customers placed their orders. See Hoover, 768 A.2d at 1161-62. In response to Progressive\u2019s argument that the common pleas court erred in focusing on Jesse Stewart rather than PACMA as the shipper (since title to the distillers grain passed to PACMA in West Elizabeth and PACMA arranged the relevant carriage by Marbec), the Superior Court cited Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau v. ICC, 867 F.2d 458 (8th Cir.1989), noting that in that case the court deemed an instance of transportation between two in-state points to have been one leg of an interstate journey without reference to the identity of the shipper for each particular segment. See Hoover, 768 A.2d at 1162-63 (citing Middlewest, 867 F.2d at 460-61).\nThe Superior Court also made an assessment of the temporary storage of the distiller\u2019s grain at the Clairton Slag facility following its journey from Illinois. In this regard, the court distinguished decisions in which shipments came to rest for manufacturing or processing reasons, see Hoover, 768 A.2d at 1161 (citing National Retail Transp., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Utility Comm'n, 109 Pa.Cmwlth. 72, 530 A.2d 987 (1987)), and for maintenance in inventory pending solicitation of customer orders, see Hoover, 768 A.2d at 1161-62 (citing Pittsburgh-Johnstown-Altoona Express (PJAX), Inc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Utility Comm\u2019n, 123 Pa.Cmwlth. 237, 554 A.2d 137 (1989), and Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Standard Oil Co., 275 U.S. 257, 48 S.Ct. 107, 72 L.Ed. 270 (1927)), concluding that the brief storage pending retrieval by a pre-designated bi*oker/customer did not disrupt the continuity of the interstate movement. See Hoover, 768 A.2d at 1162. The Superior Court acknowledged Progressive\u2019s accurate citation to decisions of the former Interstate Commerce Commission (the \u201cICC\u201d), applying a \u201ctwo-shipper rule\u201d foreclosing a finding of fixed and persistent intent where multiple shippers are involved in transportation. See id. at 1164 (citing Hays Home Delivery Serv., Inc., MC-C-30219, 1994 WL 665958 (ICC Nov. 15, 1994) (articulating the precept that \u201cwhen the initial shipper (in interstate or foreign commerce) is different from the second shipper (which only distributes the merchandise or products involved within a single State) there can be no fixed and persisting intent, for there is no one shipper in a position to manifest that intent with respect to both legs of the shipment\u201d)). It nonetheless found such reasoning to be in conflict with applicable decisions of federal courts and inconsistent with the central focus on the essential character of the transportation. See Hoover, 768 A.2d at 1164.\nPresently, the parties agree that the determination of whether Progressive\u2019s interstate commerce endorsement mandates payment for liability on account of an unscheduled vehicle operated for Marbec depends upon which general regulatory scheme (federal or state) applies to the transportation, and, concomitantly, its interstate versus intrastate character. Both parties recognize the mandatory nature of the interstate commerce endorsement as respects carriers that choose to meet federal financial responsibility requirements for engaging in commercial transportation between states by means of insurance. Further, they acknowledge the salutary purposes of such requirement, in terms of fostering safety incentives for carriers and protecting against the possibility that, by inadvertence or otherwise, some vehicles may be omitted from a policy, to the detriment of the public. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.1. See generally Adams v. Royal Indem. Co., 99 F.3d 964, 968-69 (10th Cir.1996).\nAlthough Progressive thus concedes that the MCS-90 endorsement \u201ccast[s] a wide protective net for the motoring public,\u201d it nonetheless emphasizes that such rider does not require an insurer to pay every judgment entered against the motor carrier on whose behalf it is issued. While Progressive acknowledges the common pleas court\u2019s determination that Jesse Stewart clearly intended the distillers grain to move beyond its storage facilities in West Elizabeth, it implies that such finding is simply irrelevant given that Jesse Stewart was not the shipper for the West Elizabeth-to-Loysville journey. On the same basis, Progressive discounts the significance of PACMA\u2019s apparent knowledge that the product that it ordered was manufactured in another state; when PACMA functioned as a shipper, Progressive contends, its only intent was to move the product from one location in Pennsylvania to another. Progressive maintains that the decisional law, and in particular the decisions of the ICC, reflect the two-shipper rule without exception, and that the ICC, as the agency that was responsible for administering the MCA, is owed deference.\nThe Hoovers argue that the fixed and persisting intent of both Jesse Stewart and PACMA throughout was to cause the distillers grain to be transported by virtually continuous movement from Peoria, Illinois, to West Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, and from there to the location of PACMA\u2019s customer, specifically, Loysville, Pennsylvania. That being the case, the Hoovers contend, it is irrelevant that Jesse Stewart did not arrange the West Elizabeth-to-Loysville leg of the journey, as the ICC\u2019s two-shipper rule should not apply where, as here, it is evident that the party in control of the inbound shipment intended from the start that the shipment would move beyond the storage facility in a substantially continuous fashion. According to the Hoovers, therefore, the common pleas court and the Superior Court properly focused on Jesse Stewart\u2019s intent as determinative of the interstate character of the transportation. Alternatively, the Hoovers assert that PACMA can be viewed as the initial shipper, since, although it did not directly arrange the inbound shipment of the distillers grain, it set the shipment in motion by placing an order for a specific product that it knew to be manufactured in Illinois, with the intent to have the product transported to Loysville, Pennsylvania.\nAs noted, the MCS-90 endorsement provides that, in consideration of the policy premium, Progressive will pay any final judgment recovered against Marbec for liability resulting from negligence in the operation of motor vehicles in interstate commerce, regardless of whether the subject vehicle is listed, in the policy. Section 203(a) of the MCA, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(a), defines the term \u201cinterstate commerce,\u201d quite simply, as, inter alia, \u201ccommerce between any place in a State and any place in another State or between places in the same State through another State....\u201d\nPursuant to the relevant decisional law, the opinions of the Superior Court and the common pleas court properly reflect that transportation of goods within a single state may be deemed \u201cinterstate\u201d in character when it forms part of a \u201cpractical continuity of movement\u201d across state lines from the point of origin to the final destination. Johnsen v. Allsup\u2019s Convenience Stores, Inc., 119 N.M. 245, 889 P.2d 853, 857 (Ct.App.1995) (citing Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U.S. 564, 568, 63 S.Ct. 332, 335, 87 L.Ed. 460 (1943)). As noted, the interstate versus intrastate determination hinges upon an assessment of the essential character of the commerce, manifested by the shipper\u2019s fixed and persisting intent at the time of the shipment, and ascertained from all of the circumstances attending the transportation. See United States v. Erie R.R. Co., 280 U.S. 98, 102, 50 S.Ct. 51, 53, 74 L.Ed. 187 (1929). See generally Swift Textiles, 799 F.2d at 700-01 (noting that an \u201c \u2018intent\u2019 inquiry ... underlies all modern interstate commerce analysis\u201d). Relevant circumstances include, in particular, the presence (or absence) of certain indicia of \u201cthrough carriage\u201d such as through billing; storage-in-transit tariff provisions; uninterrupted movement; continuous possession by the carrier; unbroken bulk; and absence of processing or substantial product modification. See Texas v. United States, 866 F.2d at 1556; Georgia Textile Mach., Inc. v. Federal Express Corp., 252 Ga.App. 594, 556 S.E.2d 845, 849-50 (2001). Courts frequently caution, however, that no particular factor is, in and of itself, determinative. The determination is, instead, to be based upon the practical realities of the transportation at issue. See Northwest Terminal Elevator Ass\u2019n v. Minnesota Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, 576 F.Supp. 22, 25 (D.Minn.1983) (citing Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 398, 25 S.Ct. 276, 280, 49 L.Ed. 518 (1905)), aff'd, 725 F.2d 80 (8th Cir.1984).\nWhile these guiding principles are readily stated, their application has proved to be less straightforward. Indeed, during its tenure, the ICC attempted to reformulate the relevant test on multiple occasions.\nIn a substantial line of decisions, courts and regulators have considered whether two phases of transportation, one which crosses state borders and another that does not, should be regarded as a single, interstate venture, or as comprised of separate interstate and intrastate components. In many of these cases, the intrastate leg occurs first, for example, where a seller transports his goods to a port or other distribution point for export. The seminal decision of the United States Supreme Court in Sabine, 227 U.S. at 112, 33 S.Ct. at 229, is illustrative, as it concerns shipments made to the seaboard for export, holding that such shipments were to be treated as residing in foreign commerce from the time that their movement to their foreign destination commenced, and that the character of the shipment was not affected by such incidents of transportation as intrastate billing, reconsignment, reshipment at port, or processing in transit. See id. at 127, 33 S.Ct. at 234.\nAlthough the front-end cases yield differing results depending upon the particular facts and circumstances involved, courts and regulators have remained especially circumspect in cases in which the intrastate leg of the transportation occurs after interstate travel followed by some pause in the voyage, for example, at a warehouse or distribution point. For example, in an early decision, the United States Supreme Court expressed the following dictum regarding such \u201cback-end\u201d cases:\nThe mere fact that cars received on interstate movement are reshipped by the consignee, after a brief interval, to another point, does not, of course, establish an essential continuity of movement to the latter point. The reshipment, although immediate, may be an independent intrastate movement. The instances are many where a local shipment follows quickly upon an interstate shipment and yet is not to be deemed part of it, even though some further shipment was contemplated when the original movement began. Shipments to and from distributing points often present this situation, if the applicable tariffs do not confer reconsignment or transit privileges.\nBaltimore & Ohio South-Western Railroad Co. v. Settle, 260 U.S. 166, 173-74, 43 S.Ct. 28, 31, 67 L.Ed. 189 (1922). A particular concern has been expressed that carriers should not be subject to unreasonable uncertainties in identification of the character of a shipment and, correspondingly, the controlling regulatory framework. Moreover, the ICC had noted that shipments from a distribution point following an interstate movement are often deemed a separate intrastate movement if the applicable tariffs do not confer reconsignment or transit privileges. See Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 2 I.C.C.2d 63, 69 (1986), aff'd, State of Texas v. I.C.C., 866 F.2d at 1546; see also Boyd v. United States, 275 F. 16, 18 (4th Cir.1921) (\u201cWhen goods moving in interstate commerce reach their ultimate destination, and are reconsigned from that destination on a new contract of shipment to some other point in the same state, the last movement is not interstate.\u201d (citations omitted)); Frito-Lay, Inc. v. Wisconsin Labor and Indus. Review Comm\u2019n, 95 Wis.2d 395, 290 N.W.2d 551, 556-57 (Ct.App.1980), aff'd, 101 Wis.2d 169, 303 N.W.2d 668 (1981). Indeed, in a number of earlier cases in which back-leg transportation within a single state was deemed part of a larger interstate movement there were elements of fraud or subterfuge on the part of a shipper or carrier attempting to manipulate tariff rates or regulation. See, e.g., Settle, 260 U.S. at 173-74, 43 S.Ct. at 31 (refusing to find that a pause in transportation destroyed its interstate character, where the shipper admitted that the stoppage was solely for the purpose of taking advantage of local tariff rates). See generally Rush Common Carrier Application, 17 M.C.C. 661, 677 (1939) (citing cases).\nNevertheless, in applying the essential character of the commerce assessment, with particular emphasis on the shipper\u2019s fixed and persisting intent, back-end situations are sometimes deemed to entail interstate transportation in the absence of misconduct. See, e.g., Jacksonville Paper, 317 U.S. at 568, 63 S.Ct. at 335 (\u201cThe entry of the goods into the warehouse interrupts but does not necessarily terminate their interstate journey[;][a] temporary pause in their transit does not mean they are no longer \u2018in commerce\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d). While generalizations in this arena are likely to be misleading, the placement of orders of the ultimate customer on a pre-shipment versus post-arrival basis is frequently referenced as a substantial factor in distinguishing interstate from intrastate commerce situations. See Murray v. Briggs, 569 So.2d 476, 480 (Fla.App. 5 Dist.1990) (\u201cUnquestionably, a factor to take into account in determining the \u2018fixed and persisting intent\u2019 of the shipper is whether, at the time the transportation commenced, a specific interstate destination for the shipment was definitely planned.\u201d (citations omitted)). Along these lines, one court offered the following assessment:\nAs a practical matter of business, any time a shipper moves products to a terminal his ultimate intent is that they be distributed among various consumers at various consuming points. If this is the only intention, the interstate journey ordinarily ends at the terminal. However, if, at the time he moves products to a terminal his present intention is that they merely be put through the terminal on their way to specific consumers at specific consuming points the interstate journey does not end until the products reach those consumers at those points.\nMajure, 162 F.Supp. at 601 (finding unitary interstate transportation in a single-shipper, back-end paradigm involving through movement to specific consuming points to be interstate); see also Beggs, 167 F.2d at 704 (holding that warehouse distributions to company-owned stores constituted interstate commerce, since, inter alia, the company knew at the time out-of-state shipments to the warehouse commenced that the shipments were bound for its retail stores); Shew, 370 F.2d at 380-81 (finding interstate commerce in the case of shipments from a company distribution point supplied by out-of-state shipments made pursuant to preexisting orders from company branches).\nThe jurisprudence of the former ICC also embodied a two-shipper rule, as Progressive emphasizes, requiring that fixed and persistent intent be found lacking in certain instances in which multiple shippers are involved in transportation. While Progressive contends that such precept is absolute, perspective on this claim may be gained by examining its derivation from the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Atlantic Coast Line, 275 U.S. at 257, 48 S.Ct. at 107.\nThis case involved the transportation of petroleum products by tank steamer from refineries in Louisiana and Mexico, owned by sellers, to storage facilities owned by a buyer at several locations on the Florida coast. See id. at 261-66, 48 S.Ct. at 108-09. The steamers were owned and chartered by the seller; the buyer took title to the products upon delivery. The products remained in the storage terminals until, on the basis of consumer demand, the buyer shipped them to bulk stations throughout the state by means of tank cars that it leased and hauled by a railroad company over its lines. When the railroad company began charging for the in-state shipments at interstate rates, which were higher than the intrastate rates previously charged, on the ground that such shipments were a continuation of the flow of interstate commerce, the buyer sought to enjoin it from doing so. See id.\nThe Supreme Court agreed with the buyer that the in-state shipments were intrastate in character. See Atlantic Coast Line, 275 U.S. at 267, 48 S.Ct. at 110. In the course of its analysis, the Court emphasized that a reshipment of an interstate shipment could constitute interstate or intrastate commerce, and that determining the character of such a reshipment required \u201cweighing the whole group of facts in respect to it.\u201d Id. at 268-69, 48 S.Ct. at 110. The \u201cimportant controlling fact,\u201d according to the Court, was that the buyer\u2019s \u201cwhole plan\u201d was to have its oil purchases delivered to the seaboard storage facilities to await \u201cconvenient distribution\u201d within the state; the buyer did not need or intend to ship the oil to the bulk stations \u201cby immediate continuity of transportation.\u201d See id. at 269, 48 S.Ct. at 110-11. The Court explained that the seaboard facilities were the natural place for a change from interstate to intrastate transportation to occur, and that nothing in the history of the transaction militated against such a change. The sellers intended to transport the oil products no farther than the seaboard storage facilities, the Court noted, and neither they nor the railroad played any part in determining the ultimate destinations of the products. See id. at 269, 48 S.Ct. at 111.\nThus, the Atlantic Coast Line Court did not indicate that it was establishing an inflexible two-shipper principle, but rather, reemphasized that ascertaining the character of a particular shipment requires careful examination of all of the surrounding circumstances. See generally Roberts v. Levine, 921 F.2d 804 at 814 (reiterating that \u201cto focus on any one fact would violate [the essential-character-of-commerce] standard\u201d). Moreover, while Progressive asserts that the ICC applied the two-shipper rule absolutely, the ICC announced that the rule is subject to express exception in the primary decision that Progressive cites, Hays Home Delivery. There, the ICC indicated that its two-shipper rationale:\ndoes not apply if the initial shipper identifies (or addresses) the merchandise for a particular, ultimate consignee. Then the requisite fixed and persisting intent is manifest at the time of the initial shipment, and the transportation remains interstate or foreign commerce at least until the merchandise is delivered to that identified consignee.\nHays Home Delivery, 1994 WL 665958, at *5 n. 6. Such exception appears to derive from and .is consistent with the necessary focus on the essential character of the commerce and practical realities, suggesting that the ICC itself did not intended to dispense with a totality assessment in all cases involving two shippers. Accord Swift Textiles, 799 F.2d at 699 (\u201cThe nature of a shipment is not determined ... by when and to whom title passes\u201d); Roberts, 344 N.W.2d at 410 (recognizing that \u201cthe intent element is to be gleaned from all the surrounding facts and testimony and not solely from the subjective intent of the original shipper\u201d). Further, contrary to Progressive\u2019s contention, federal courts have in fact not applied the rule universally. See, e.g., Klitzke, 110 F.3d at 1470 (following Jacksonville Paper in holding that \u201ceven though the [initial] shippers did not know the goods\u2019 ultimate destinations, the orders were placed and the goods were shipped to satisfy contracts between [the second shipper] and its customers that specified a final place of delivery within Oregon other than the [second shipper\u2019s] warehouse\u201d (emphasis in original)). Indeed, invariable application of the two-shipper rule would facilitate potential abuses in a manner analogous to the practice of trip leasing bred under the prior regulatory scheme. See supra note 10. See generally Hoover, 768 A.2d at 1164 (observing that to apply the two-shipper rule in the present circumstances \u201cwould be to permit buyers and sellers to change the nature of interstate commerce by merely changing shippers in mid-stream\u201d).\nAccordingly, and at least in absence of a specific indication to the contrary by the present federal regulators, we will not apply the former ICC\u2019s two-shipper rule in a talismanic fashion. Rather, we read the cases as requiring transportation to be deemed non-continuous in the two-shipper, back-end paradigm in absence of indicia akin to storage-in-transit tariff provisions, reconsignment privileges, or other strong indicia of a contrary intent on the part of the shipper arising from the outset of the transportation. Accord Texas v. United States, 866 F.2d at 1557; Swift Textiles, 799 F.2d at 701 (concluding that \u201c[i]t is irrelevant that the foreign and domestic legs of the voyage are effected by different shippers or carriers\u201d where \u201ca shipment of foreign goods is sent to the United States with the intention that it come to rest at a specific destination beyond its port of discharge\u201d (emphasis added)); cf. Georgia Textile, 556 S.E.2d at 849-50 (noting in a one-shipper, back-end case that, even in absence of concrete indicia of a through shipment, \u201cthe movement of the goods may be continuous even in the absence of such incidents where it is admitted that a shipment made to the ultimate destination had at all times been so intended\u201d). Obviously the challenge facing the regulators was to implement the public policy underlying the MCA, while at the same time imposing some framework facilitating greater certainty in an arena necessarily governed by ad hoc totality assessments. Certainly, the ICC\u2019s efforts in this regard were reasonable, and are entitled to our respect. See generally supra note 7.\nThe present circumstances involve a two-shipper, back-end paradigm in which no evidence has been presented that is akin to storage-in-transit tariff provisions or reconsignment privileges. The proofs offered by the Hoovers are lacking in material regards, including in terms of Jesse Stewart\u2019s (the initial shipper\u2019s) awareness at the outset of the transportation that a portion of the distiller\u2019s grain was bound for its ultimate destination, Kreider\u2019s Feed Mill in Loysville, see generally Roberts, 921 F.2d at 810-11 (distinguishing Atlantic Coast Line on the basis that it was a two-shipper case, in which the initial shipper had no involvement with determining the commodity\u2019s ultimate destination), or PACMA\u2019s receipt of a specific order from Kreider\u2019s Feed Mill at or prior to such time. While certainly the common pleas court and the Superior Court were able to identify a number of uncontested factors that militate in favor of their determinations, see supra, we find that the material gaps in the deposition testimony presented, viewed in the light most favorable to Progressive as the non-moving party, see Manzetti v. Mercy Hosp. of Pittsburgh, 565 Pa. 471, 482, 776 A.2d 938, 944 (2001) (articulating the applicable summary judgment standard), control, as they implicate both the potential for a dispute regarding material factual details and a deficiency in the Hoovers\u2019 present proofs as assessed according to the applicable authorities. Such deficiency is particularly apparent on review of the painstaking detail evaluated by federal courts in effectuating the essential character of commerce assessment. Compare, e.g., Roberts, 92.1 F.2d at 806-09, with supra notes 4-5. In our review, we have found no precedent, in a two-shipper case, for rendering a matter-of-law declaration of continuous transportation in analogous circumstances.\nWhile we conclude that the common pleas court erred in granting summary judgment in the Hoovers\u2019 favor, we discern no error in the common pleas court\u2019s refusal to enter judgment for Progressive on the record presented. Significantly, in its summary judgment submissions made to the common pleas court, Progressive did not identify the controlling standard in terms of the essential character of the commerce measured with reference to the shipper\u2019s fixed and persisting intent and assert an insufficiency of the Hoovers\u2019 proofs in this regard. Rather, Progressive merely argued that, since it was undisputed that the shipment via Hursh\u2019s truck occurred entirely within Pennsylvania, the MCS-90 was inapplicable as a matter of law. See R.R. at 496a-515a. As elaborated above, however, this analysis is misleading in its failure to confront the controlling question of whether and to what degree the interstate and intrastate phases of the transportation of the distiller\u2019s grain should be deemed interrelated within the well-established framework for such inquiry. Since, just as the record presented does not establish that the movement of distiller\u2019s grain was continuous, it also does not definitively establish non-continuous transportation, Progressive\u2019s motion was properly denied on the merits of the argument presented.\nIn summary, we find the record presented insufficient to establish, as a matter of law, the character of the shipment via Hursh\u2019s truck. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and the matter remanded to the common pleas court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nChief Justice ZAPPALA concurs in the result.\n. P.L. 96-296, 94 Stat. 793 (July 1, 1980) (the \"MCA\u201d) (amending various provisions interspersed throughout Title 49 of the United States Code).\n. PACMA, formerly a cooperative, is now a privately held merchandiser of grain and feed ingredients, with three rail-to-trnck transfer facilities, two warehouses, and a headquarters in Palmyra, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.\n. Portions of Jesse Stewart's purchases were also based upon predictions about its customer needs or prospective sale in the \"spot market.''\n. A substantial portion of the deposition testimony presented is couched in generalizations and approximations. For example, the seven-to-fifteen day reference derived from the testimony of a Jesse Stewart representative as follows:\nQ: How long generally \u2014 you say you want to move [distiller's grain] as quickly as you can \u2014 how long generally do bargeloads remain at Clairton Slag from the time that they are off-loaded until they are ultimately transported out?\nA: We load anywhere from one to two barges per month, so they might last, you know, I don't know, anywhere from like 7 to 15 days.\nSee also infra note 5.\n. A PACMA representative testified that \"[generally speaking in the distillers trade [PACMA would] buy four or five loads at a time, and then [would] turn around and sell them as the market \u2014 as the need [arose].\u201d At the time of his deposition, he was unable to provide more specific information with regard to the Kreider\u2019s Feed Mill order.\n. The Hoovers assert that on May 17, 2001, the non-jury trial of the underlying action culminated in verdicts in their favor in the amounts of $854,465 for Mrs. Hoover and $85,000 for Mr. Hoover, and that the verdicts have not been appealed.\n. The ICC was abolished as of January 1, 1996, via the ICC Termination Act of 1995, P.L. 104-88 109 Stat. 803 (1995), its responsibilities transferred to the Department of Transportation and its newly created Surface Transportation Board, see id. at \u00a7 201, 109 Stat. at 932-34, and various statutory provisions deriving from the MCA revised and renumbered. Pursuant to a savings provision, however, Congress expressly prescribed that regulations issued by the ICC would \u201ccontinue in effect according to their terms until modified, terminated, superseded, set aside, or revoked in accordance with law.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 204(a), 109 Stat. at 941; see Lynch v. Yob, 95 Ohio St.3d 441, 768 N.E.2d 1158, 1161 & n. 2 (2002). See generally Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 117 Md.App. 72, 699 A.2d 482, 491-92 (1997) (elaborating on the effects ol the ICC Termination Act). While the regulatory scheme has changed substantially since the time of the accident involving the Hoovers, see generally The Munitions Carriers Conference, Inc. v. United States, 147 F.3d 1027, 1029 (D.C.Cir.1998), it appears that ICC interpretations retain some continuing validity pursuant to the savings provisions or otherwise. See generally El Conejo Americano of Texas, Inc. v. Department of Transp., 278 F.3d\u201d 17, 19 (D.C.Cir.2002) (observing that \"[t]he Department of Transportation . .. recognized, pursuant to [the] savings provision, the continuing legal vitality of ICC decisions; it gave public notice that it interpreted the savings provision to cover all legal documents ol the ICC that were issued or granted by an official authorized to effect such document\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). The agency's decisions are pertinent to the present case, of course, since the ICC administered the relevant federal regulatory scheme at the time of the accident.\n. As previously noted, the interstate commerce endorsement applies with regard to vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of Sections 29 and 30 of the MCA, regardless of whether the vehicles are scheduled in a policy. Section 30(a)(1) of the MCA required the Secretary of Transportation to establish regulations mandating minimal levels of financial responsibility pertaining to public liability, property damage, and environmental restoration for commercial, motor transportation conducted on an interstate basis. See P.L. 96-296 30(a)(1), 94 Stat. at 820 (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10927(a)(1) (superseded)).\n. In the MCA, Congress authorized the ICC to promulgate regulations rendering lessee-carriers fully responsible to the public for the operation of the equipment they leased. See generally Empire, 868 F.2d at 362; Rediehs Express, Inc. v. Maple, 491 N.E.2d 1006, 1010-11 (Ind.Ct.App.1986). In response, the ICC implemented regulations requiring that leases entered into by ICC-licensed carriers contain a provision stating that the authorized carrier maintain \u201cexclusive possession, control, and use of the equipment for the duration of the lease,\u201d and \"assume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment for the duration of the lease.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.12(c) (superseded). Further, the ICC required that all ICC-certified carriers maintain insurance or other form of surety \u201cconditioned to pay any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles\u201d under the carrier\u2019s permit. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1043.1 (superseded). The ICC developed the MCS-90 to assure compliance with this requirement, mandating inclusion of the endorsement in insurance policies of carriers who used leased vehicles to transport property under ICC certificate. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3.\n. Under the prior regulatory scheme, in an effort to evade restrictions that accompanied federal regulation, some authorized carriers adopted the practice of leasing equipment from owners who were exempt from such regulation. See generally American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. United States, 344 U.S. 298, 303-04, 73 S.Ct. 307, 311, 97 L.Ed. 337 (1953); Integral Ins. Co. v. Lawrence Fulbright Trucking, Inc., 930 F.2d 258, 261 (2d Cir.1991) (describing the purpose of the MCA and the regulations promulgated under it as \u201cto stem the unregulated use of non-owned vehicles that threatened both public safety and the vitality of the trucking industry\u201d). Such practice, particularly in the form of \u201ctrip leasing\u201d (leasing an owner-operator's vehicle for a single trip), was inimical to the protection of the public, as the equipment of these exempt owner-operators was often unsafe and poorly maintained; in addition, regardless of whether the owner-operators had adequate insurance of their own, the agreements with the carrier-lessees designated them as independent contractors, thereby enabling the carrier-lessees to avoid liability arising from accidents in which the leased vehicles were involved. See Integral, 930 F.2d at 261; Empire, 868 F.2d at 362; Rediehs, 491 N.E.2d at 1010.\nThus, as previously noted, the ICC endorsement that is the subject of this appeal had its origin in the ICC's desire that the public be adequately protected where a federally licensed carrier uses a leased vehicle to transport goods pursuant to an ICC certificate. See generally Rediehs, 491 N.E.2d at 1011 (\u201cThe independent contractor concept has been eliminated for lease arrangements under ICC regulations[;][l]iability of a carrier is fixed as a matter of policy upon the carrier owning operating authority in lease situations[.]\u201d).\n. Parenthetically, we note that, as between the insured and the insurer, all of the policy's terms, conditions, and limitations remain in effect, and the insured agrees to reimburse the insurer \u201cfor any payment that the [insurer] would not have been obligated to make . . . except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.'' Accordingly, the MCS-90 endorsement does not constitute insurance coverage per se. See National Am. Ins. Co. v. Central States Carriers, Inc., 785 F.Supp. 793, 795 (D.N.Ind.1992). Rather, in furtherance of the goal of protecting the public, it extends the coverage provided by the insured\u2019s policy to any vehicle for which the insured is responsible, regardless of policy exclusions or the lack of active negligence on the part of the insured itself. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.1; Adams, 99 F.3d at 968; see also Century Indem., 133 F.3d at 594; Empire, 868 F.2d at 362-63 (\u201cthe ICC endorsement negates any inconsistent limiting provisions in the insurance policy to which it is attached\u201d). With respect to injured third parties, then, the MCS-90 imposes on the insurer an obligation analogous to that of a surety. See Horco Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Bobac Trucking Inc., 107 F.3d 733, 736 (9th Cir.1997). .\n. It should be noted that legal questions involving the breadth of interstate commerce arise in many different statutory contexts. See McLeod v. Threlkeld, 319 U.S. 491, 495, 63 S.Ct. 1248, 1250, 87 L.Ed. 1538 (1943) (\u201cThere is no single concept of interstate commerce which can be applied to every federal statute regulating commerce\u201d); Federal Trade Comm\u2019n v. Bunte Bros., 312 U.S. 349, 351, 61 S.Ct. 580, 582, 85 L.Ed. 881 (1941) (observing that construction of every statute regulating interstate commerce presents \"a unique problem in which words derive vitality from the aim and nature of the specific legislation\u201d). See generally Swift Textiles, Inc. v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., 799 F.2d 697, 700-01 & n. 2 (11th Cir. 1986) (noting various contexts in which the essential-character-of-comrnerce test arises). Our focus here is on decisions that turn upon the essential nature of the commerce or transportation as the litmus.\n. Federal law governs the operation and effect of ICC-mandated endorsements.

Corollary to its two-shipper rule, discussed further infra, the ICC has expressed the view that this factor is less significant in cases in which the initial shipper controls the purchase, shipment, and sale of the goods throughout.

See Hays, MC-C-30219, 1994 WL 665958, at *3-4 (citing Atlantic Coast Line in support of the two-shipper rule); Advailtage Tank Lines, Inc., 10 I.C.C.2d 64, 74 & n. 10 (1994) (same); Association of Texas Warehousemen, 8 I.C.C.2d 476, 489 (1992) (same); Pittsburgh-Johns-town-Altoona Express (PJAX), Inc., 8 I.C.C.2d 821, 833 & n. 10 (1990) (same); Pacific Coast Bldg. Prod., Inc., MC-C-30121, 1989 WL 237806, at *3 (ICC Jan. 6, 1989) (same); Ottawa Strong & Strong, Inc. v. Tobler Transfer, Inc., MC-C-30076, 1989 WL 238107, at *8 (I.C.C. Mar. 1, 1989); Quaker Oats Co., 251 F.3d 170, 4 I.C.C.2d 1033, 1048-49 (1987) (explicating the view that, in Atlantic Coast Line, \"[t]he involvement of two separate shippers \u2014 the first to point of temporary storage, the second from the point of temporary storage \u2014 broke the continuity of the movement\"), aff\u2019d, California Trucking, 900 F.2d 208.\n. According to our review, in the cases in which the rule has not been followed there have been other particularly strong factors favoring the interstate commerce determination. See, e.g., Webb, 999 F.Supp. at 1472 (finding non-fungible character of goods to constitute the strongest evidence of the shipper's fixed and persisting intent in the circumstances presented in a back-end, two-shipper case).\n. The record does not reflect that any party has sought to invoke primary jurisdiction of the present federal regulators with respect to the instant controversy. See generally Central Freight, 899 F.2d at 417 (discussing the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in the interstate commerce context); Middlewest, 867 F.2d at 459 (same).\n. As noted, in front-end cases, courts seem to attach lesser significance to the presence of multiple shippers. See supra note 22. Bui see Burlington Northern, 719 F.2d at 308-10.\n. Due to PACMA\u2019s identity as a commercial broker, its involvement from the outset of the transportation, and Jesse Stewart\u2019s knowledge of PACMA's involvement and trade from the outset, evidence of PACMA\u2019s knowledge of an ultimate destination as of the time that the transportation commenced in Illinois would serve as a close substitute for knowledge of the initial shipper of an ultimate destination. See generally Farmers Cooperative, 302 F.Supp. at 782-84 (discussing the question of whose intent is properly at issue and concluding that \"[l]he authorities on this subject say nothing to indicate that the \u2018continuing intent' must be that of the party having control of the shipment at any particular point in its movement, nor do they limit the scope of this concept to the elemental motivating factors behind the acts of each of the initiating parties.\u201d); Southern States Transp., Inc. v. State, 774 S.W.2d 639, 641 (Tex.1989) (emphasizing fixed and persisting intent of the shipper, \"or others for whose benefit the shipment is made\u201d). intrastate character, shipments picked up by the shipper's designated carrier from those concerning which transportation is arranged by customers themselves. See Central Freight, 899 F.2d at 422.\n. The Superior Court\u2019s citation to Middlewest, 867 F.2d at 458, would appear to be the decision most favorable to Appellees' position, as it appears to involve a back-end paradigm, in which the ICC found the relevant transportation to be part of continuous interstate transportation. Nevertheless, it is not clear from the decision that two shippers were involved, and, indeed, there are indicia to the contrary in the underiving decision of the ICC. See, e.g., Matlack, Inc., No. MC-C-10999, 1989 WL 98610, at *4 (I.C.C. June 1, 1987) (concluding that \"[hjere, the record demonstrates that [the shipper\u2019s] intent is to ship not to [its distribution terminal] but. to its customers\u201d), aff\u2019d, Middlewest, 867 F.2d at 458. Moreover, the circumstances entailed a situation in which \"the vast majority of shipments involvefd] supply contracts and other sales arrangements entered into prior to the shipment, [such that the shipper] knows, in almost all cases, the final destination from the moment the shipment leaves its out-of-state origin.\u201d Matlack, 1989 WI, 98610, at *4; see also id. at *5 (contrasting Atlantic. Coast Line on the ground that \"[h]ere, by contrast, it is clear that [the shipper] intends the chemicals to continue their movement through the storage facilities for delivery to known customers\u201d). In this case, the circumstances involve consignment to an intermediary broker, PACMA, with no demonstrated knowledge on tire part of Jesse Stewart or PACMA of the ultimate destination as of the commencement of the shipment at its out-of-state origin in Illinois.\nCentral Freight, also cited by Appellees, is not directly on point, since it is a single-shipper case, and involved the use of storage-in-transit provisions. See Central Freight, 899 F.2d at 420 (\"A stoiage-in-lransit tariff may effectively convert what would otherwise be a separate movement into part of a through interstate movement by lying movements together into a continuing service.\u201d (citations omitted)). Indeed, Central Freight expressly distinguished, in terms of their interversus",
