        "text": "OPINION\nCHIEF JUSTICE ZAPPALA.\nThis appeal presents an issue of first impression: whether an action for commercial disparagement is governed by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5523(1), or the two-year statute of limitations set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5524(7). The Superior Court determined that the two-year limitations period found in Section 5524(7) applied. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and hold that the one-year limitations period found in Section 5523(1) governs an action for commercial disparagement.\nAppellee, Pro Golf Manufacturing, Incorporated, is in the business of manufacturing golf equipment, repairing golf equipment and providing golf instruction. Appellant, Tribune Review Newspaper Company, published a newspaper article on September 27, 1997, stating that several historic buildings, including the building containing Appellee\u2019s business, were set for demolition. On February 18, 1998, Appellant published another newspaper article, stating that the building containing Appellee\u2019s business had been demolished. However, the building containing Appellee\u2019s business had neither been scheduled for demolition, nor had it been demolished.\nOn August 16, 1999, Appellee filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County setting forth a single cause of action for commercial disparagement, alleging that these false publications caused a pecuniary loss and a loss of customers. Appellant filed an answer, new matter and motion for judgment on the pleadings, contending that Appellee\u2019s claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations for defamation actions set forth in Section 5523(1).\nFollowing a hearing and the submission of briefs, the trial court granted Appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding that Appellee was complaining of an action for \u201cinjurious falsehood\u201d and that the one-year statute of limitations applied. The trial court reasoned that since Appellee\u2019s cause of action stemmed from an act of publication, Section 5523(1) controlled.\nThe Superior Court reversed, offering two reasons why Section 5523(1) did not control. First, the Superior Court characterized Section 5523(1) as solely governing the tort of defamation, which protects against damage to one\u2019s reputation, as opposed to the tort of commercial disparagement, which protects one\u2019s economic interests against pecuniary loss. Since Appellee\u2019s claim did not require proof of injury to reputation, the Superior Court found Section 5523(1) inapplicable by its plain language. Second, because a commercial disparagement plaintiff must prove special damages, the Superior Court concluded that the one-year statute of limitations found in Section 5523(1) was inappropriate because \u201c[ujnlike the harm associated with defamation, a showing of actual pecuniary loss may not be calculable within one year.\u201d Pro Golf Mfg., Inc., v. Tribune Review Newspaper Co., 761 A.2d 553, 557 (Pa.Super.2000). The Superior Court denied Appellant\u2019s subsequent Application for Reargument by order dated November 20, 2000.\nOur review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny judgment on the pleadings is limited to determining whether the trial court committed an error of law or whether there were facts presented that warranted a jury trial. Travelers Casualty & Sur. Co. v. Castegnaro, 565 Pa. 246, 772 A.2d 456 (2001).\nIn its complaint, Appellee titled the cause of action here at issue as one for commercial disparagement. As stated by the Superior Court below:\nAlthough we shall use the term \u201ccommercial disparagement\u201d in our analysis, this cause of action is described in various terms. As noted by the Superior Court of New Jersey,\n... Sometimes it is called slander of title, sometimes slander of goods, or disparagement of goods, or trade libel, or unfair competition, or interference with prospective advantage, or whatever else the fancy of the particular Judge or writer may lead to select....\nVaccaro Construction Co. v. A.J. DePace, Inc., 137 N.J.Super. 512, 349 A.2d 570, 572 (1975) (citation omitted). The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 623A labels this tort as \u201cinjurious falsehood.\u201d Regardless of the label, the publication of a disparaging statement concerning the business of another is actionable where: (1) the statement is false; (2) the publisher either intends the publication to cause pecuniary loss or reasonably should recognize that publication will result in pecuniary loss; (3) pecuniary loss does in fact result; and (4) the publisher either knows that the statement is false or acts in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 623(A) (1977).\nPro Golf, 761 A.2d at 555-56.\nAppellant argues that the tort of commercial disparagement has historically been called libel or slander, in one form or another, by the courts of this Commonwealth. Appellant therefore reasons that, under the plain language of Section 5523(1), the one-year statute of limitations applies. We agree.\nAs the Superior Court has previously observed:\nDisparagement of title, variously labeled slander of title, defamation of title, or in other contexts, slander of goods, trade libel or injurious falsehood, is the false and malicious representation of the title or quality of another\u2019s interest in goods or property. See Young v. Geiske, 209 Pa. 515, 58 A. 887 (1904); Paull v. Halferty, 63 Pa. 46, 3 Am.Rep. 518 (1870).\nTriester v. 191 Tenants Ass'n, 272 Pa.Super. 271, 415 A.2d 698, 701 (1979).\nThe mere fact that Appellee labeled this action as one for commercial disparagement does not remove the cause of action from the one-year statute of limitations applicable to slander. Section 5523(1) is not limited to slander against the person only; nor would there be any legislative purpose in making such a distinction. We therefore hold that the statute of limitations for slander is the same whether the slander involves property or the person. In both instances, the one-year statute of limitations found in Section 5523(1) applies. Accordingly, Section 5528(1) controls actions for commercial disparagement.\nThe Superior Court reasoned that because the torts of defamation and commercial disparagement protect different interests and require different burdens of proof, the same statute of limitations should not govern. The Superior Court posited that protection against damage to one\u2019s reputation was the interest Section 5523(1) protected against. However, this contention is belied by the fact that Section 5523(1), by its very terms, applies to an action for \u201clibel, slander or invasion of privacy.\u201d Appellant asserts that Section 5523(1) does not solely govern torts that require proof of damage to reputation because invasion of privacy is not a tort designed to protect reputation:\n[The tort of invasion of privacy] primarily protects a plaintiffs interest in keeping private matters from public view. \u201c[A]ll libel cases concern public exposure by false matter, but the primary harm compensated is damage to reputation. In the \u2018right of privacy\u2019 cases the primary damage is the mental distress from having been exposed to public view, although injury to reputation may be an element bearing upon such damage.\u201d Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, 387 n. 9, 87 S.Ct. 534, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 (1967), citing Wade, Defamation and the Right of Privacy, 15 Vand. L.Rev. 1093, 1094, 1124 (1962).\nBrief for Appellant at 19. Appellant is correct. To state a cause of action for the tort of invasion of privacy in Pennsylvania, a plaintiff must aver that there was an intentional intrusion on the seclusion of their private concerns which was substantial and highly offensive to a reasonable person, and aver sufficient facts to establish that the information disclosed would have caused mental suffering, shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities. McGuire v. Shubert, 722 A.2d 1087 (Pa.Super.1998); see also Aquino v. Bulletin Co., 190 Pa.Super. 528, 154 A.2d 422 (1959). The Superior Court\u2019s distinction based upon the interest to be protected is without merit.\nLikewise, the Superior Court\u2019s distinction based upon the burden of proof, i.e., the element of special damages, is without merit. Reasoning that a disparagement plaintiff must prove special damages, the Superior Court determined the two-year statute of limitations found in Section 5524(7) appropriate because a disparagement plaintiff \u201cmay be unable to demonstrate the existence or full extent of the pecuniary loss caused by the disparagement until well after publication.\u201d Pro Golf, 761 A.2d at 557. As pointed out by Appellant, however, a plaintiff alleging slander'must also prove special damages unless the statement is slander \u201cper se.\u201d See Agriss v. Roadway Express, Inc., 334 Pa.Super. 295, 483 A.2d 456, 470 (1984).\nThe Order of the Superior Court is reversed, and the Order of the trial court, granting Appellant\u2019s motion on the pleadings, is reinstated.\nFormer Chief Justice FLAHERTY did not participate in the decision in this case.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5523(1) requires that the following actions or proceedings be commenced within one year: \"An action for libel, slander or invasion of privacy.\u201d\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5524(7) requires that the following actions or proceedings be commenced within two years:\nAny other action or proceeding to recover damages for injury to person or property which is founded on negligent, intentional, or otherwise tortious conduct or any other action or proceeding sounding in trespass, including deceit or fraud, except an action or proceeding subject to another limitation specified in this subchapter.\n. While the trial court described the action here at issue as \"injurious falsehood,\u201d the Superior Court described the action as \"commercial disparagement,\u201d the term used by Appellee in its complaint.",
