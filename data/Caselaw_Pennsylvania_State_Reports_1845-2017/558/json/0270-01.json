The Commonwealth Court misapplied the governing legal standard. Under the Whistleblower Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1421 et seq., assuming the truth of all the allegations in appellant\u2019s Complaint and drawing all inferences reasonably deducible therefrom, appellant has pled facts sufficient to sustain a cause of action. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court erred by granting appellees\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. Jurisdiction is relinquished.\nJustice CAPPY dissents.",
