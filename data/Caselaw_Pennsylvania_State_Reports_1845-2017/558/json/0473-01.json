        "text": "OPINION\nCASTILLE, Justice.\nThe issue before this Court is whether the Superior Court correctly held that an enclosed backyard of an apartment building constitutes the \u201cplace of abode\u201d of one of the tenants for the purposes of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106(a), which provides: \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in paragraph (2), any person who carries a firearm in any vehicle or any person who carries a firearm concealed on or about his person, except in his place of abode or fixed place of business, without a valid and lawfully issued license under this chapter commits a felony of the third degree.\u201d (Emphasis added). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Superior Court and remand this matter for trial.\nOn April 21, 1996, appellee Javier Ortiz was arrested and charged with violating 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106(a), Firearms Not To Be Carried Without a License, and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6117(a), Altering or Obliterating Marks of Identification. Appellee filed a Motion to Quash the Information. At a hearing on the motion, the parties stipulated that appellee leases an apartment on the second floor of the building located at 1023 North Front Street, a three-apartment row home with a fenced backyard. The parties also stipulated, for the purposes of the motion hearing only, that appellee was in the backyard at the time the gun was taken from his possession.\nThe trial court granted the motion in part, dismissing the charge of violating 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106(a), on the grounds that appellee was in his \u201cplace of abode.\u201d The trial court set forth the following facts:\nOn April 21, 1996, Officer David Anderson of the Reading Police Department was dispatched to 1023 N. Front Street, Reading, Berks County, Pennsylvania in regards to two Hispanic males playing with a handgun. Officer Anderson arrived at the location, a three-story apartment building, and noticed two men in a rear, fenced-in yard. Officer Anderson approached [appellee], who lived in the second floor apartment, and asked where the gun was. [Appellee] answered that it was in his front pants pocket. The Officer then retrieved a .22 caliber silver handgun with a black handle. [Appellee] next stated that he did not have a license to carry the gun. The serial number, which had been scratched off, was retrieved by an evidence technician of the Reading Bureau of Police. The serial number was discovered to be #263131. This gun was registered to a Lester Hollenbach. Mr. Hollenbach stated that is was his gun, that he had not been able to locate it, and that it had been missing for approximately one year.\nTrial Court Opinion at 1-2.\nThe Commonwealth appealed and the Superior Court, in a published opinion, affirmed. Commonwealth v. Ortiz, 704 A.2d 646 (Pa.Super.1997). We granted allocatur to determine whether the Superior Court erred in defining \u201cplace of abode\u201d to include a shared backyard of an apartment building.\nWhen interpreting a statute, words that are not defined in the statute shall be construed according to their common and approved usage. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cplace of abode\u201d as \u201cone\u2019s residence or domicile.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1149 (6th Edition 1991). Black\u2019s further defines domicile as \u201ca person\u2019s legal home,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 485, and residence as a \u201cplace where one actually lives or has a home; a person\u2019s dwelling place or place of habitation; an abode; house where one\u2019s home is; a dwelling house.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1309. Finally, Black\u2019s defines dwelling as \u201cthe house or other structure in which a person or persons live; a residence; abode; habitation; the apartment or building, or group of buildings, occupied by a family as a place of residence. Structure used as a place of habitation.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 505 (emphasis added). In addition, the Dictionary of Modern American Usage defines \u201cplace of abode\u201d as \u201ca pretentious way of referring to someone\u2019s home or house.\u201d The Dictionary of Modern American Usage 5 (1998) (emphasis in original).\nIt is clear from these definitions that the common meaning of \u201cplace of abode\u201d is the actual house or apartment of a person. It does not include common areas to which a person has \u00e1 right of access but which are shared with others who have a similar right of access. The backyard in question is not in the exclusive control of appellee or in the control of others over whom appellee has control. The fact that the backyard in this case is shared with the tenants of only two other apartments does not in any way diminish the fact that it is not appellee\u2019s personal space. The shared backyard of the apartment house in which appellee\u2019s apartment is located is no more appellee\u2019s \u201cplace of abode\u201d than is a tenant\u2019s shared elevator or fitness center in a high-rise apartment complex.\nJurisdictions that have addressed the issue of whether handgun licensing exceptions for residences extend to the common areas of apartment complexes have reached the same conclusion. Clark v. State, 49 Ark. 174, 4 S.W. 658 (1887) (tenant on stairway outside leased premises was not \u201cupon his own premises\u201d); State v. Sealy, 208 Conn. 689, 546 A.2d 271 (1988) (common area outside defendant\u2019s third floor apartment in building with two apartments was not defendant\u2019s \u201cdwelling or abode\u201d); Hines v.

Dunphy, 377 Mass. 453, 386 N.E.2d 1036 (1979) (implied exception to firearms license requirement for individual inside his residence does not extend to backyard of apartment building); Commonwealth v. Seay, 376 Mass. 735, 383 N.E.2d 828 (1978) (implied exception to firearms license requirement for individual inside his residence does not extend to common areas over which the individual lacks exclusive control); State v. McNeill, 78 N.C.App. 514, 337 S.E.2d 172 (1985) (defendant in hallway of duplex is not \u201cwithin his own home\u201d); In re Samuel P., 626 A.2d 224 (R.I.1993) (\u201cdwelling house exception to firearms license requirement is inapplicable to common areas of a tenement over which the defendant lacks exclusive control\u201d); Bryant v. State, 508 S.W.2d 103 (Tex.Crim.App.1974) (common parking lot for apartment complex is not \u201cone\u2019s own premises\u201d).\nAlthough none of these cases involved statutes using the term \u201cplace of abode,\u201d the reasoning is equally applicable to the statute at issue here. In each case, the court held that the dwelling house exception was only applicable where the defendant had exclusive control of the area in which he or she possessed the weapon. Therefore, regardless of whether the statutory exception applied only within the defendant\u2019s house or extended to land within the possession of the defendant, the courts declined to extend the exception to common areas of multi-tenant buildings. The federal courts have also recognized the \u201ccommon sense distinction between places of abode, such as apartments, and common hallways.\u201d United States v. Holland, 755 F.2d 253 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1125, 105 S.Ct. 2657, 86 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985) (the common hallway of , a building with two apartments was not tenant\u2019s home).\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 6106(a) provides that an individual may carry a concealed firearm when he is in his place of abode, not near his place of abode or outside his place of abode. Appellee was not in his apartment or other area over which he had exclusive control, but was in a common area outside the building in which his apartment is located. Because appellee was not in his place of abode at the time the firearm was allegedly taken from him, the trial court erred in quashing the indictment for violating 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106(a).\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n. Paragraph (2) of \u00a7 6106 is not applicable to this case.\n. We do not decide whether a person violated Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106(a) when he is outside his house or apartment in an area over which he has exclusive control.",
