Appellee and Cory Whitbeck are the parents of a son, Ryan, who was born on October 27, 1992. Appellee, who currently resides in Blair County, Pennsylvania, separated <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>from Whitbeck, who now lives in North Carolina, prior to Ryan’s birth. On July 31, 1995, the Blair County Court of Common Pleas ordered that Ryan was to remain alternately in the physical custody of his mother for two months and then in the physical custody of his father for one month on a recurring basis. On February 13, 1996, the trial court modified the custody arrangement and provided that Ryan would reside with his mother consecutively for eight and one-half months of the year and with his father consecutively for the remaining three and one-half months of the year.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b345-4" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[193,829,1151,515]]]'>On March 29, 1996, pursuant to DPW reporting regulations, appellee provided a copy of the February 13, 1996 custody order to the Blair County Assistance Office (“BCAO”). Because of her change in circumstances, the BCAO redetermined appellee’s eligibility for benefits and concluded that because her child was not living with her for three and one-half consecutive months and because she did not have any other children for whom she was providing care, both she and the child were ineligible for AFDC benefits during the time the child lived with his father.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In the notice, the BCAO proposed discontinuing appellee’s benefits on April 15, 1996. On April 3, 1996, appellee filed a timely appeal with the <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>DPW and requested a telephone hearing with the DPW’s Bureau of Hearings and Appeals (“BHA”).</p>
    <p id="b346-4" data-blocks='[["BL_346.4",346,[226,404,1151,359]]]'>On June 4,1996, the BHA conducted the requested hearing. The Hearing Officer denied the appeal, finding that appellee would not have care and control of Ryan during the time Ryan lived with his father and, therefore, that appellee would not be entitled to AFDC benefits during that time period. On July 26, 1996, the Acting Director of the DPW affirmed the Hearing Officer’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b346-5" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[224,786,1153,466]]]'>On August 20, 1996, appellee filed a Petition for Review with the Commonwealth Court. On December 22, 1997, the Commonwealth Court determined that the DPW had erred in discontinuing, rather than temporarily suspending, appellee’s AFDC benefits. The Court remanded to the BCAO to determine the period of Varner’s eligibility and the amount of benefits which she was eligible to receive. On October 19, 1998, this Court granted the Department’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal.</p>

The Commonwealth Court determined that, under 55 Pa.Code § 151.43(d)(2), the placement of Ryan with his father for three and one-half months constituted a “temporary separation” which warranted merely a temporary suspension, not an outright discontinuance, of appellee’s AFDC benefits. Thus, the Commonwealth Court determined that the DPW committed an error of law by discontinuing benefits entirely. The regulation at issue, 55 Pa.Code § 151.43, provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AsG" data-blocks='[["BL_346.7",346,[265,2131,1110,201]]]'>
      <em>(d) Temporary absence of the child or relative. </em>The temporary absence of either the child or the relative from his home will not affect the eligibility of the child for AFDC under the following circumstances:</blockquote>

    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[191,743,1155,790]]]'>The Commonwealth Court reasoned that appellee would be responsible for the care and control of Ryan for eight and one-half months during 1996, which was actually a longer overall period of care and control than that which existed under the former custody agreement. Since appellee had received AFDC benefits under the former agreement, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the aforementioned regulation compelled the awarding of AFDC benefits to appellee under the new custody agreement. Consequently, the Commonwealth Court, while agreeing that appellee was ineligible to receive benefits during the three and one-half months in which Ryan resided with his father, remanded for a determination of the benefits which were owed to appellee for the eight and one-half months during which she would be exercising care and control.</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[189,1590,1154,583]],["BL_348.1",348,[232,278,1149,251]]]'>By concluding that the language of 55 Pa.Code § 151.43 did not allow DPW to discontinue appellee’s benefits, the Commonwealth Court misapplied the applicable regulation. Specifically, the Commonwealth Court overlooked the fact that the phrase “temporary absence” is defined in the Code as “an absence of less than 30 days.” 55 Pa.Code § 147.22. Here, the revised custody order provided that Ryan would be out of appellee’s custody and care for a period far exceeding 30 days. Accordingly, the DPW properly applied the general rule requiring the outright discontinuance of benefits if a recipient no longer meets eligibility conditions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> There <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>simply exists no statutory or regulatory authority to justify a suspension of benefits, rather than a discontinuance of benefits in these circumstances. Consequently, the Commonwealth Court incorrectly concluded that the DPW’s adjudication in this matter amounted to an error of law.</p>
    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[230,579,1152,1013]]]'>In addition to misapplying the precise regulation which was at issue in this appeal, the Commonwealth Court ignored the entire structure of the regulatory scheme as it pertains to AFDC benefits. In accordance with state regulations, eligibility for AFDC benefits is determined prospectively on a month-by-month basis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> A recipient family is ineligible if their net income, when prospectively determined, equals or exceeds a certain amount as prescribed by regulation. 55 Pa.Code § 183.101. Given that this regulatory scheme clearly requires eligibility for assistance to be determined prospectively on a month-by-month basis, the BCAO could not statutorily calculate appellee’s income for a period that is four months in the future. Instead, the proper procedure under the regulatory scheme is for appellee to reapply for benefits at the time that she regains eligibility through the exercise of care and control of her child. At this point, if the BCAO prospectively determines that appellee’s projected income for the month at issue falls below the threshold levels for assistance, then appellee will, once again, be entitled to benefits.</p>
