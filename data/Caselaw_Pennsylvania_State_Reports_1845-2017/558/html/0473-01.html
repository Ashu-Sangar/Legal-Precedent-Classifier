Officer Anderson arrived at the location, a three-story apartment building, and noticed two men in a rear, fenced-in yard. Officer Anderson approached [appellee], who lived in the second floor apartment, and asked where the gun was. [Appellee] answered that it was in his front pants pocket. The Officer then retrieved a .22 caliber silver handgun with a black handle. [Appellee] next stated that he did not have a license to carry the gun. The serial number, which had been scratched off, was retrieved by an evidence technician of the Reading Bureau of Police. The serial number was discovered to be #263131. This gun was registered to a Lester Hollenbach. Mr. Hollenbach stated that is was his gun, that he had not been able to locate it, and that it had been missing for approximately one year.</blockquote>

Black’s Law Dictionary defines “place of abode” as “one’s residence or domicile.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1149 (6th Edition 1991). Black’s further defines domicile as “a person’s legal home,” Black’s Law Dictionary 485, and residence as a “place where one actually lives or has a home; a person’s dwelling place or place of habitation; an abode; house where one’s home is; a dwelling house.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1309. Finally, Black’s defines dwelling as “the <em>house or other structure </em>in which a person or persons live; a residence; abode; habitation; the <em>apartment </em>or building, or group of buildings, occupied by a family as a place of residence. <em>Structure </em>used as a place of habitation.” Black’s Law Dictionary 505 (emphasis added). In addition, the Dictionary of Modern American Usage defines “place of abode” as “a pretentious way of referring to someone’s <em>home </em>or <em>house.” </em>The Dictionary of Modern American Usage 5 (1998) (emphasis in original).</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[238,1318,1152,677]]]'>It is clear from these definitions that the common meaning of “place of abode” is the actual house or apartment of a person. It does not include common areas to which a person has á right of access but which are shared with others who have a similar right of access. The backyard in question is not in the exclusive control of appellee or in the control of others over whom appellee has control. The fact that the backyard in this case is shared with the tenants of only two other apartments does not in any way diminish the fact that it is not appellee’s personal space. The shared backyard of the apartment house in which appellee’s apartment is located is no more appellee’s “place of abode” than is a tenant’s shared elevator or fitness center in a high-rise apartment complex.</p>
