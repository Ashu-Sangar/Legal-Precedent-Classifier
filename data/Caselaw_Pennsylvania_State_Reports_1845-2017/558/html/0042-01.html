For the reasons expressed below, we agree.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[166,464,1155,996]]]'>The Superior Court correctly ascertained the general rule that, in a negligence suit, evidence that a <em>defendant </em>carries liability insurance is inadmissible, with certain narrow exceptions, due to the fact that it is prejudicial to the defendant and generally irrelevant to the real issues in the case. <em>See Trimble v. Merloe, </em><a href="/pa/413/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="413 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1888560" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0408-01">413 Pa. 408</a>, 410, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.2d%20457" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="197 A.2d 457">197 A.2d 457</a>, 458 (1964). However, the Superior Court determined that, under the circumstances of this case, the rationale driving the aforementioned evidentiary rule does not apply because the court concluded that appellants’ election of the limited tort option was relevant to issues in this matter. Specifically, the Superi- or Court determined that the fact that appellants elected the limited tort option resulting in lower premium payments was relevant, first, to explain to the jury why appellants had to carry the high burden of establishing that Deborah Price had suffered a “serious injury” before they could recover and, second, to aid in determining what level of damages were appropriate. We disagree with the Superior Court on both points.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[163,1486,1153,679]]]'>First, the jury simply did not require an explanation of <em>why </em>appellants had to demonstrate the existence of a “serious injury” before they could recover non-economic damages. All that was required was a clear explanation of the criteria which the jury was permitted to consider in determining <em>whether </em>appellants had demonstrated the existence of a “serious injury.” By delving into an explanation of why appellants shouldered their burden, the trial court brought facts to the jury’s attention which were of no consequence to any issue in the case. The fact that appellants had declined to contract for the more expensive insurance option did not aid the jury at all in determining whether Deborah Price had suffered a “serious injury.”</p>
    <p id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[161,2190,1154,150]],["BL_120.1",120,[221,297,1151,258]]]'>Second, the fact that appellants paid lower insurance premiums in exchange for limited tort coverage was wholly irrelevant on the issue of the amount of damages required to <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>compensate appellants if the jury determined that they had suffered non-economic damages. The severity of the non-economic injuries suffered by a plaintiff and the corresponding level of damages simply bears no causal nexus whatsoever to the nature of the insurance option which that plaintiff selected.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[217,598,1155,1230]]]'>Moreover, the extraneous facts which were brought to the jury’s attention in this matter were prejudicial to appellants. When the trial court informed the jury that appellants had “admitted” that they had voluntarily chosen the less expensive limited tort insurance option, the court risked imparting to the jury the notion that appellants’ selection of the less expensive alternative was, in and of itself, a factor to be considered in determining whether appellants should be compensated for their non-economic injuries. Just as this Court views evidence of the fact that a defendant carried insurance as prejudicial to the defendant in a negligence case, we equally view evidence of the fact that a plaintiff selected a less expensive insurance option as prejudicial to the plaintiff. In either case, there is a risk that, in determining liability, the jury -will depart from the relevant standards and definitions on which they have been charged and instead consider the fact of a party’s insurance coverage, or lack thereof, as relevant on the issue of liability. Just as a jury is more likely to attach liability to a defendant covered by insurance who will not suffer financially from a plaintiffs verdict, so too is a jury less likely to award damages to a plaintiff who it views as having bargained away its right to non-economic damages in exchange for having obtained less expensive insurance coverage.</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[216,1870,1153,471]]]'>The purpose of jury instructions is to keep jurors focused on resolving factual disputes based on the governing law rather than on their own ideas of how best to balance the equities. By allowing jurors to consider the extent to which parties have elected to insure themselves, trial courts afford jurors the opportunity to determine the issue of liability in accordance with their own notions of fairness, cost allocation, and risk management, rather than in accordance with the law on which they have been instructed.</p>
    <p id="b121-3" data-blocks='[["BL_121.3",121,[180,287,1151,303]]]'>
      <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Thus, we conclude that the trial court erred by informing the jury that appellants elected the limited tort option and that such election resulted in their paying lower premiums. On this record, we cannot conclude that this error did not affect the verdict. Consequently, we remand this matter for a new trial.</p>

Madame Justice Newman takes issue with the words “probably misled,” and would focus instead on whether the jury was "palpably misled.” However, the standard of review for a faulty jury charge must be expressed in terms of probabilities, as there is simply no way to determine whether a juror was, in fact, misled. A reviewing court has no means to access a juror’s actual thought processes to determine whether the juror "palpably” relied on the faulty jury charge in reaching a decision. Accordingly, we believe that the standard of review in this context is best articulated in terms of probabilities.</p>

Ed. 2d 130">121 L.Ed.2d 130</a> (1992) (burden to show prejudice in order to grant new trial on moving party). Thus, I believe that it is improper to conclude that reversible error occurs whenever the appellate court is unable to discern whether prejudice has occurred, as suggested by the Majority Opinion. Instead, prejudice to the moving party must be readily discernable and there must be a reasonable likelihood that it affected the outcome of the case.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[229,843,1153,637]]]'>With this standard in mind, I find that the instructions of the court directing the attention of the jury to the insurance options of the Plaintiff palpably misled the jury, and reasonably could have affected the verdict in this matter. I agree with the conclusion of the Majority that the inclusion of insurance issues into the case is as prejudicial to a plaintiff as it is to a defendant. Consequently, the general prohibition against the infusion of a defendant’s insurance coverage into a case, as set forth for example in <em>Trimble v. Merloe, </em><a href="/pa/413/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="413 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1888560" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0408-01">413 Pa. 408</a>, 410, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.2d%20457" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="197 A.2d 457">197 A.2d 457</a>, 458 (1964), is equally applicable to the direct reference of the plaintiffs insurance matters. Accordingly, the instruction of the trial court was reversible error.</p>
