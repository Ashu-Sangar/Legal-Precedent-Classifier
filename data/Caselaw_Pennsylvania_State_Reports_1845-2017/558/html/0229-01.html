The City of Philadelphia and Rendell claimed in their preliminary objections that the doctrine of res judicata barred appellants’ only claim against the City appellees — that the 1961 ordinance violated their free association rights under the Pennsylvania Constitution. The remaining appellees, all of whom are Commonwealth parties (Commonwealth), filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer asserting that appellants failed to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>because the 1961 ordinance does not violate appellants’ state constitutional rights to free speech, free association, and equal protection.

Instead, appellants raise the issue of whether it is constitutionally permissible for a public employer to force its employees to be represented by a union chosen solely by the public employer and against the will of the employees.

In addition, the 1961 ordinance does not involve a suspect class such as race or gender, nor do appellants claim to belong to a protected class for purposes of equal protection analysis.

On August 14, 1996, the federal district court amended its decision holding that the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited it from deciding state constitutional questions against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PLRB once the federal constitutional claims were dismissed, but the court confirmed its dismissal of the state and federal claims against the City of Philadelphia and Rendell. The Third Circuit affirmed. <em>Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Correctional Officers v.
