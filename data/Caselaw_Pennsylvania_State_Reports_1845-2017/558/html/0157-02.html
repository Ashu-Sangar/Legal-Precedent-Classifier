While on patrol, he received information from a radio dispatcher that a person had called the police and reported seeing two African-American males, one wearing a blue jacket and the other wearing a blue jacket with yellow sleeves, shining a flashlight into his vehicle parked in the driveway of his house at 722 East 22nd Street. Shortly thereafter, the radio dispatcher reported that the suspects had left the area of the house and were last seen walking west on East 22nd Street.</p>

At first, he observed no one. Suddenly, however, he saw Appellant, who was wearing a blue jacket with yellow sleeves, pop out from between two houses, slowing down from a run to a walk. Officer Fetterman immediately stopped Appellant and observed that he was out <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>of breath. He then placed Appellant under arrest and conducted a search incident to the arrest. Upon reaching into Appellant’s pocket, Officer Fetterman recovered a plastic bag of cocaine.</p>

Judge Hudock found that the trial court improperly reached its decision by focusing individually on each circumstance surrounding Appellant’s arrest. Considering the totality of the circumstances and the evidence presented, Judge Hudock concluded that Officer Fetterman had probable cause to believe that Appellant was the person who had committed the crime. In addition, Judge Hudock rejected Appellant’s alternative additional argument that his warrantless arrest was <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>unlawful because the officer lacked probable causé to believe that a felony had been committed.</p>

Responding to Appellant’s alternative argument, Judge Eakin found that the officer could have concluded that the crime of theft was afoot, and explained that a warrantless arrest for theft is authorized by 18 Pa.C.S. § 3904. While recognizing that the charges ultimately filed against Appellant were for a misdemeanor, Judge Eakin stated that this fact does not mean the officer lacked probable cause to believe that the crime of theft had been committed, and thus the warrantless arrest of Appellant was lawful.</p>
    <p id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[223,1022,1153,474]]]'>Judge Brosky, however, dissented. Considering the facts of this case, Judge Brosky found that Officer Fetterman only had reason to suspect that the misdemeanor crime of loitering and prowling at night time may have been committed. Judge Brosky explained that a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor is lawful only when committed in the arresting officer’s presence or when authorized by statute. Finding neither of these conditions present, Judge Brosky concluded that the warrant-less arrest of Appellant was unlawful.</p>

Similarly, a person commits the crime of attempted theft if, with the intent to commit theft, he does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the theft. 18 Pa.C.S. § 901(a). Although theft and attempted theft may be classified as either felonies or misdemeanors,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> this classification is not relevant in this case since, as noted above, the legislature has authorized warrantless arrests for all grades of theft and attempted theft committed outside the presence of an officer. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3904.

    <p id="b238-7" data-blocks='[["BL_238.9",238,[219,1108,1152,825]]]'>I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision that the warrantless search of appellant was unlawful thereby resulting in the suppression of the fruits of that search. Appellant was apprehended by police after he was observed on a darkened driveway, in the early morning hours, shining a flashlight into a car that he did not own, which was parked on a private residential property that he did not own. The only reasonable inference that can possibly be drawn from appellant’s conduct is that he and his co-conspirator were attempting to steal the ear in question or items within the car. The law is abundantly clear that a police officer has the same right to arrest a suspect without a warrant for any grade of theft as exists for the commission of a felony. 18 Pa.C.S. § 3904. Because the police could reasonably have concluded in this case that appellant and his co-conspirator were attempting a theft, a warrant-less arrest was lawful.</p>

    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[164,601,1154,976]]]'>Here, the arresting officer responded to a radio dispatch that a suspect who had been observed earlier shining a flashlight into a car parked in the owner’s driveway and whose description appellant matched was approaching the 600 block of East 21st Street. The officer drove to the 600 block and at first saw no one, but then appellant suddenly emerged from between two houses, slowing from a run to a walk. I believe that the totality of these circumstances clearly gave the officer probable cause to believe that appellant had been in the process of attempting to commit the crime of theft. Thus, pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 3904, the officer acted within his authority in arresting appellant without a warrant and conducting a search incident to a lawful arrest. <em>See Commonwealth v. Gwynn, </em><a href="/pa/555/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="555 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1701971" data-case-paths="/pa/555/0086-01">555 Pa. 86</a>, 99, <a href="/a2d/723/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="723 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="11753974,1701971" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/0143-01,/pa/555/0086-01">723 A.2d 143</a>, 149 (1998) (stop and search of appellant proper where appellant was seen four times in short time period with a knapsack with something sticking out of it by a police officer in a high crime area where a burglary had been reported resulting in a reasonable conclusion that crime was afoot).</p>

Certainly, any person of “reasonable caution” would conclude that appellant was in the process of committing either a theft of the vehicle itself (a third degree felony) or the theft of the contents of the vehicle. The law is clear that the commission of a crime includes the preparation to commit the crime, all steps toward the commission of the crime, the actual commission of the crime and flight following commission of the crime. Here, the conduct of appellant and his co-conspirator can hardly be deemed innocent conduct. I fail to see why it is unreasonable to conclude that two persons, unknown to the potential victim, who enter upon private residential property in the dead of the night with no license or permission to do so <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>and who shine a flashlight into the interior of a private vehicle obviously looking for the keys to the vehicle or for items of value in the vehicle and who take flight at the arrival of a police cruiser are not, as the majority concludes, taking a substantial step towards the commission of a theft crime? There is, beyond peradventure, no lawful or salutary purpose that can be associated with the conduct in question or the subsequent flight from the authorities upon their arrival.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[218,719,1154,946]]]'>Notwithstanding this failure on the part of the majority to link this conduct to criminal activity, the majority further fails to realize the practical problems associated with its suppression of the evidence. The majority would have the police officers in this situation who are called to a darkened scene by a concerned citizen first seek an arrest warrant before seizing a person such as the appellant. The difficulty arising from this requirement is as to just <em>who </em>will be named in this arrest warrant and just <em>what </em>becomes of the detainee while the police are seeking this warrant. The “who” can only be ascertained after detention of the suspect by the police officers, an act which the majority would conclude to be unlawful. However, once appellant is detained by the police in this situation, his freedom of movement is curtailed and he can be considered arrested. Since appellant is now arrested, what logical purpose is there in obtaining an arrest warrant? Would an arrest warrant somehow absolve the original arrest of the illegality which the majority perceives?</p>

On the one hand, if the officers act efficiently and prevent a crime from occurring, they risk suppression of potentially relevant evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> On the other hand, under the majority’s reasoning, the officers would have to allow the crime to develop to full fruition in order to lawfully seize potential evidence such as stolen property following the commission of the theft. Either scenario is fraught with negative consequences — either the evidence is suppressed, or the crime is permitted to be culminated under <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>the watchful eye of the police.

Even though the charges that were ultimately filed against appellant were for a misdemeanor, that does not mean that the arresting officer lacked probable cause to believe that appellant was involved in the act of attempting to commit the crime of theft for which no warrant of arrest is required. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Superior Court on this basis.</p>
