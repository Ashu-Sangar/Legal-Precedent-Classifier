Officer Kopecki further testified that Hall, after looking in the direction of the approaching police car, put the baggie in his pocket and began walking away, quickening his pace into a run when the officer ordered him to stop. Under the totality of these circumstances, we find no error in the Superior Court’s conclusion that Officer Kopecki had the requisite reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of Hall.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The Commonwealth argues, however, that the officer’s frisk was not outside the scope of <em>Terry </em>under <em>Dickerson </em>because <em>Dickerson </em>holds that if an officer, while frisking an individual to determine if he is armed, feels an object whose mass or contour makes its criminal character immediately apparent, then the officer may seize that object. <em>Dickerson, </em><a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">508 U.S. at 375-76</a>, <a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">113 S.Ct. at 2137</a>. The Commonwealth notes that here, Officer Kopecki testified that he grabbed and squeezed Hall's pocket, felt something "bulky, crunchy” and immediately recognized the baggie, based on his experience, as containing vials of drugs. The Commonwealth’s argument, however, fails to recognize that Officer Kopecki testified that when he grabbed and squeezed Hall’s pocket he was attempting to discern if the baggie contained drugs, and not whether the pocket contained a weapon. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth’s argument fails for another reason. In <em>Dickerson, </em>the Supreme Court found that once the initial pat-down of an individual dispels the officer’s suspicion that the individual is armed, any further search which manipulates (i.e. squeezes, pokes) the contents of a defendant's pocket is not authorized by <em>Terry.

The officer had observed the defendant, in the middle of the afternoon, hand an unidentifiable object to an unknown female who, in turn, gave appellant an undetermined amount of cash. When the officer’s patrol car drew near, the appellant attempted to flee, but was subsequently apprehended. In stating that these facts fell “narrowly short” of establishing probable cause, the <em>Banks </em>Court emphasized that the officer was not a trained narcotics officer and that the containers he observed were not commonly known to hold drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 455, <a href="/pa/540/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="658 A.2d 752" data-case-ids="472204,7872252" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0453-01,/a2d/658/0752-01">658 A.2d at 753</a>.

Indeed, additional suspicious factors not even contemplated by the <em>Banks </em>Court were present here, such as the fact that appellant actually felt what he reasonably believed to be crack vials in appellant’s left pocket, and the fact that appellant was directing a transaction between two other individuals. In this regard, it is important to note the sequence of events observed by the officer here: (1) the two men standing a few feet from appellant were looking at him as he held out his plastic baggie towards them; (2) appellant motioned to the two men with his free hand; (3) one of the two men then handed the other small items which fit into the palm of his hand, while the other handed him United States currency in return. The advantages of conducting illegal narcotics transactions in this manner are widely understood by the law enforcement community. When a seller maintains a small inventory of narcotics while conducting the actual transactions with customers and the “bagman” maintains the principal stash, if the seller is apprehended, he will be caught <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>with only a small amount of drugs — perhaps not enough to qualify for a mandatory minimum sentence. Also, as the seller is generally the immediate focus of attention, the bag-man may be able to escape with the drug supply in the event that the customer is an undercover officer, since apprehending two individuals is obviously more difficult than apprehending one. Because probable cause determinations must be made “not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement,” <em>Gates, supra, </em>the officer here was entitled to be even more suspicious on the basis of his observations of this orchestrated, three-person transaction.</p>

Specifically, appellant points to the fact that police did not receive anonymous tips that drugs were being sold from the location at issue, nor did police witness a <em>series </em>of transactions. Appellant fails to explain how the police could have witnessed a series of transactions when he fled at the sight of them, or why an anonymous tip was necessary when the officer here had personally observed illegal narcotics trafficking from the location at issue.

Certainly it was not a covert midnight sale for Rose Electric of miniature light fixtures for doll houses.

It is just possible that the officer did not defy the canons of reason in concluding that few businessmen, other than drug dealers, would set up shop on a desolate street corner in a high-crime area after midnight, distance themselves from their customers by using an intermediary to physically conduct sales and collect cash pursuant to surreptitious hand signals, then hide their wares and flee the scene when confronted with a police presence.</p>

    <p id="b113-8" data-blocks='[["BL_113.8",113,[175,1514,1156,473]]]'>Based on my reading of the facts of this case, I cannot agree that Officer Kopecki had the requisite reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory detention of Hall. The exchange of an unidentified item in a “high crime area,” coupled with Hall’s nervous behavior and flight in response to the appearance of Officer Kopecki, provides no reasonable basis to believe that Hall might have been engaged in the illegal sale of narcotics. <em>See Commonwealth v. Cook, </em><a href="/pa/558/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="558 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="838534" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0050-01">558 Pa. 50</a>, <a href="/a2d/735/0673-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="735 A.2d 673" data-case-ids="11536992,838534" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0673-01,/pa/558/0050-01">735 A.2d 673</a>, 679-80 (1999) (Dissenting Opinion of Zappala, J.).</p>

The fact that “Hall’s subsequent flight forced Officer Kopecki to confront Hall alone, in an alley, approximately forty feet away from his partner” (Majority Op. at <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>660), states a reason why the officer might be justifiably concerned Hall was armed. However it supplies no articulable reasons to believe that Hall was armed and dangerous.</p>
    <p id="b114-5" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[201,460,1151,741]]]'>Despite my disagreement on these points, I join the holding in <em>Hall </em>that where there is reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may be afoot and a limited pat-down for the search of weapons is supported by a reasonable belief that the suspect is armed and dangerous, <em>“Terry </em>simply does not allow an officer to conduct a search in an attempt to validate a belief that the suspect is carrying non-threatening contraband.” (Majority Op. at 661). Further, I join the holding in <em>Commonwealth v. E.M., </em>that under the plain feel doctrine adopted in <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em><a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">508 U.S. 366</a>, <a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">113 S.Ct. 2130</a>, <a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">124 L.Ed.2d 334</a> (1993), the evidence seized from E.M. must be suppressed because the incriminating nature of the contraband was not immediately apparent. (Majority Op. at 662-65).</p>
