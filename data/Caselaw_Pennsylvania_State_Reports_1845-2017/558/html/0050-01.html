The individuals were engaged in conversation. The officers passed the group at a very slow rate, and they observed appellant take his left hand out of his front pocket in a fist position and reach toward one of the other individuals. The individual reached out toward appellant and attempted to receive the unidentified item from his hand. To further investigate this conduct, Officer Heffner made a U-turn and drove to the corner where the group was gathered. As soon as appellant spotted the officers and the car, he placed his hand back in his pocket and began backing away from the group. Officer Juba exited the car, identified himself as a Harrisburg police officer, and began walking toward the group. Appellant immediately began to run “in almost a dead sprint.” Officer Juba chased the appellant, with Officer Heffner following in the vehicle.</p>
