He maintains, however, that given the enhanced privacy rights recognized under Article I, Section 8 of our state constitution, we should adopt a “constitutional waiver” standard for determining whether a consensual search is valid in Pennsylvania. According to appellant, a waiver standard similar to that adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v.

Significantly, the Court held that a consent search is valid if it meets the test of “voluntariness.” That test involves consideration of whether the confession was the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice. <a href="/us/412/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="412 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6172008" data-case-paths="/us/412/0218-01">412 U.S at 225</a>, <a href="/us/412/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="412 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6172008" data-case-paths="/us/412/0218-01">93 S.Ct. 2041</a>. According to the Court, “voluntariness” is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances and while knowledge of the right to refuse consent is a factor to consider in determining whether consent to search was voluntarily and knowingly given, it is not dispositive. In so holding, the Court reasoned that such a requirement would not only be impractical but it would also hamper legitimate police investigation. Two competing concerns — the legitimate need for consent searches and the assurance that the subject of the search not be coerced — dictated the Court’s decision. <em><a href="/us/412/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="412 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6172008" data-case-paths="/us/412/0218-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/412/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="412 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6172008" data-case-paths="/us/412/0218-01">at 227-28</a>, <a href="/us/412/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="412 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6172008" data-case-paths="/us/412/0218-01">93 S.Ct. 2041</a>.</p>

Appellant essentially argues that to require an intelligent waiver of the right to refuse one’s consent to an illegal search would protect and enhance one’s privacy rights under our state constitution without any significant impact upon law enforcement. Appellant likens this issue to that of requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to obtaining a confession, noting that the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings has resulted in no significant reduction in the number of confessions. We are unpersuaded by appellant’s argument. In short, we find no policy issues unique to Pennsylvania such as widespread police misconduct infringing upon our citizens’ rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, that would cause us to depart from the federal standard. Indeed, consideration of all the <em>Edmunds </em>factors leads us to conclude that the federal voluntariness standard as enunciated in <em>Schneckloth </em>adequately protects the privacy rights obtained under Article I, Section 8 of our state constitution. It is important to remember that even under the federal standard, one’s knowledge of his or her right to refuse consent remains a factor to consider in determining the validity of consent; it simply is not a determinative factor since other evidence is oftentimes adequate to prove the voluntariness of a consent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Given this Court’s consistent determination that Article I, Section 8 affords broader privacy rights than those provided by the Fourth Amendment, I wholeheartedly disagree with the majority that our state constitution sanctions a person’s relinquishment of the right to refuse consent when he has no knowledge of such a right’s existence. In my view, both our state constitution and common sense require that a person be aware of his rights before any waiver to those rights is constitutionally validated. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Many cases hinge on confessions, despite the <em>Miranda </em>warning requirement. Although somewhat different considerations are often present in a confession situation, such as the prior arrest of the defendant, and thus more than mere suspicion exists at that point, there is little cause to believe that warnings of the right to refuse to consent to search will, in any great degree, cause a vast reduction in the number of consent searches.</blockquote>
