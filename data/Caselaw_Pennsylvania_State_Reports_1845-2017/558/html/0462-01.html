Specifically, Taxpayers contended that the Act unconstitutionally imposed an unequal tax burden upon a nonexempt party entering into a taxable real estate transaction with an exempt party. According to Taxpayers, such inequality resulted from the fact that a nonexempt party must bear exclusive liability to the Commonwealth for the taxes, whereas parties transacting with other nonexempt parties share the liability to the Commonwealth jointly and severally (Taxpayers characterized this circumstance as “doubling” their liability). Taxpayers claimed that this asserted inequality constituted discrimination violative of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2, as well as the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. Art. VIII, § 1, and the equal protection clause under the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. Amend. XIV.

It opened its analysis by noting that the Act uniformly imposes a single tax upon all transfers, with liability for the full amount of the payment generally being shared jointly and severally among the parties to the transaction, and with the parties being free to discharge such liability in any agreed manner. Although the scheme imposes exclusive liability upon a party transacting with an exempt entity such as a governmental unit, the Commonwealth Court rejected Taxpayers’ claim that this results in either disparate treatment or inappropriate classification. To the contrary, the Commonwealth Court concluded that parties who transact with the United States simply are “no worse off’ than parties who transact with nonexempt parties. <em>Wilson Partners, </em><a href="/a2d/723/1079-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="723 A.2d 1079" data-case-ids="11775122" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/1079-01">723 A.2d at 1084</a>.

As a practical matter, in most taxable transfers the parties have apportioned the tax liability by agreement.

We recognize that the <em>Washington </em>decision arose in the context of a claim by the federal government that the Washington system of revenue collection circumvented its tax immunity. Nevertheless, <em>Washington’s </em>reasoning is pertinent to this case, in part because Taxpayers invoke the FDIC’s tax immunity as a basis for relief in their favor. In this regard, it is significant that the Court has held that non-discriminatory efforts by states to tax the federal government indirectly may be justified. <em>See Washington, </em><a href="/us/460/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="460 U.S. 536" data-case-ids="6196080" data-case-paths="/us/460/0536-01">460 U.S. at 547</a>, <a href="/us/460/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="460 U.S. 536" data-case-ids="6196080" data-case-paths="/us/460/0536-01">103 S.Ct. at 1350</a>; <em>see generally Minneapolis Star and Tribune v.

More fundamentally, <em>Washington </em>is directly relevant here because the federal government’s arguments in that case were premised upon its claim that the Washington taxing scheme treated federal contractors in a discriminatory manner, and the Court expressly rejected such contention.</p>

We acknowledge that, viewing the transaction from Taxpayers’ perspective, there is a degree of differential treatment, since Taxpayers bore exclusive liability for the taxes; whereas, those involved in transactions among private parties share liability jointly and severally. Thus, the Commonwealth Court’s statement that Taxpayers are "no worse off" is correct only when viewed through the framework of <em>Washington, </em>which requires that the transaction be viewed from a wider perspective and holds that the complained-of differences lack constitutional significance.</p>

The uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides that ”[a]ll taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under the general laws.” Pa.
