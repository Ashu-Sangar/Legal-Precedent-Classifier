On June 30, 1993, Lewistown Borough (the “Borough”) entered into an Intermunicipal Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Derry and Bratton Townships (the “Townships”)(the Borough and the Townships shall be collectively referred to as the “municipalities”) to form the Mifflin County Regional Police Department (the “RPD”). The Agreement was reached pursuant to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and was approved by the three municipalities through the enactment of ordinances in July 1993.</p>

Agreement sections 7 and 8, R.R. 119a-125a. The RPD began operations on August 27, 1993.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.5",217,[190,1003,1155,680]]]'>The Lewistown Police Association (the “Association”) is the collective bargaining representative of the RPD’s police officers. Prior to the formation of the RPD, the Association was the representative of the police officers employed by Lewis-town Borough and Derry Township. Bratton Township did not employ police officers prior to the formation of the RPD. The collective bargaining agreements covering these police officers expired on December 31, 1993. The RPD and the Association proceeded to binding interest arbitration pursuant to Act 111 when the parties were unable to agree to the terms of a new labor agreement and negotiations reached impasse. Among the issues for resolution was the determination of pension benefits for the RPD’s police officers.</p>

Further, the award required that employee contributions be returned to the employees before the plans were consolidated and that municipal contributions by the Borough and Derry Township be distributed to the RPD. The award also required that the consolidated pension plan provide a retirement benefit of 70% of final average salary upon attainment of age 50, with 25 years of service.</p>
    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[222,725,1151,203]]]'>A copy of the arbitration award was sent to the Borough on January 13, 1994. The RPD’s board of directors voted unanimously to implement the arbitration award. Thus, no direct appeal was ever taken from the arbitration award.</p>
    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[222,952,1151,623]]]'>Subsequently, Officer Robert Rarick of the RPD sought to retire. Officer Rarick had been employed by the Borough until August 27, 1993, when he became a RPD police officer. In responding to Officer Rarick’s request to retire, the RPD advised Officer Rarick that it was unable to provide the pension benefits granted by the arbitration award because, unlike Derry Township, the Borough refused to distribute its pension funds to the RPD. The Borough took the position that the arbitration award was in violation of the Police Pension Act (“Act 600”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, the RPD was unable to establish a consolidated pension fund in accord with the interest arbitration award.</p>

A PLRB hearing examiner conducted a hearing on June 7, 1994. By proposed decision and order dated December 20, 1994, the hearing examiner concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the RPD and the Borough engaged in unfair labor practices by failing to comply with the interest arbitration award.</p>
    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.7",219,[189,670,1154,1164]]]'>On January 3, 1995, the Borough filed with the PLRB timely exceptions to the hearing examiner’s proposed decision. In a final order entered May 30,1995, the PLRB sustained the exceptions in part, dismissed the exceptions in part, and modified the hearing examiner’s finding of unfair labor practices. Specifically, the PLRB vacated the hearing examiner’s conclusion that the RPD was a public employer for purposes of Act 111. The PLRB noted that to be a public employer for purposes of Act 111, the employer must be a “political subdivision of the Commonwealth” or the “Commonwealth.” 43 P.S. § 217.1. The PLRB found that the RPD is not a “political subdivision of the Commonwealth” or the “Commonwealth” for purposes of Act 111. Thus, the PLRB determined that the RPD was not a public employer in and of itself for purposes of Act 111. However, the PLRB concluded that the Borough and the Townships, which are political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, jointly controlled the RPD, and thus, through their designated representatives on the RPD board, the Borough and Townships jointly exercised the powers that demonstrated an employer-employee relationship. Thus, the PLRB found that the Borough and the Townships, acting by and through the RPD, are employers of the RPD police officers.</p>

Thus, the PLRB affirmed that the Borough committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to comply with the arbitration award. The Borough appealed to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[225,582,1152,528]]]'>The Commonwealth Court reversed the decision of the PLRB. The Commonwealth Court concluded that because the Borough, as trustee of the Borough’s police pension fund, was not a party to the interest arbitration proceedings and did not participate in those proceedings, the provisions of the award relating to the pension fund could not be binding on the Borough. Thus, the Borough did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing to comply with the arbitration award.

Thus, we must determine whether the Borough was a party to, or participated in, the interest arbitration proceedings.

Each municipality has equal representation on the board of directors as the board consists of two directors from each municipality. The governing body of each municipality appoints the municipality’s two directors. Agreement section 4.1, Appendix BL section 1.2, 1.3, R.R. 133 a.

Specifically, the PLRB determined in its order, that the RPD is not a “political subdivision” within the meaning of Act 111. If the Borough, as a political subdivision, is not considered to be a joint employer, then, the officers would not be employed by a “political subdivision” as required for applicability of Act 111. Thus, the RPD police officers would not be covered by Act 111.

Again, the municipalities appoint their representatives to the RPD board. The RPD board is the governing body of the RPD and is granted all powers with respect to the employer-employee relationship, expressly including all powers with respect to collective bargaining under Act 111. Thus, the RPD board serves as a conduit or a representative of the municipalities with respect to employment relations. Here, the RPD fully participated in the Act 111 interest arbitration proceedings. Indeed, the issue of the award’s legality was raised before the arbitration panel. The RPD consistently took the position that the award of any benefits outside of Act 600 was not permissible. In fact, the arbitrator chosen by the RPD dissented from that part of the 2-1 arbitration award which granted a calculation of benefits at 70% of an officer’s final average salary and the return of contributions made by the officers as being contrary <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>to Act 600.

    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[162,1159,1158,1052]]]'>The Commonwealth Court determined that the Borough was not a party to, and did not participate in, the underlying interest arbitration proceedings, and thus, was not bound by the arbitration award. Specifically, the Commonwealth Court found that the Borough did not delegate its fiduciary powers and responsibilities as trustee of the Borough pension fund to the RPD. The court noted that section 742.5 of the Borough’s pension fund, such fund being created pursuant to Act 600, states that the Borough may not delegate to others the responsibility for the funding, solvency, administration, investment and actuarial soundness of the fund. Also, the Commonwealth Court found that pursuant to the Agreement, the Borough only granted the RPD limited powers to establish a new pension plan for the RPD’s police officers. Thus, the Commonwealth Court concluded that despite its retention of control over the Borough pension fund as its trustee, the Borough did not participate in the interest arbitration proceedings. As a result, the Borough could not be bound by the provisions of the arbitration award that related to the Borough’s pension fund.</p>

The Commonwealth Court’s determination <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>that the arbitration award is not binding on the Borough consists of two related concepts. There is a procedural issue of the Borough’s participation in the arbitration proceedings and a substantive issue of whether or not the Borough could, or did, delegate to the RPD its functions, powers and responsibilities with respect to the Borough pension fund.</p>

    <p id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[251,1001,1154,786]]]'>As to the issue of whether the Borough could delegate, or did delegate, its powers regarding the Borough pension fund, we believe that the Borough was prohibited from raising this issue because it was waived. The delegation issue is whether the Borough agreed to delegate its pension fund responsibilities to the RPD or whether it is permitted to do so under Act 600 or the terms of the pension fund. It is, in essence, an examination of the legality of the arbitration award regarding consolidation of the pension plans. However, issues regarding the legality of the award were raised, or could have been raised, in the arbitration proceeding or in a direct appeal of that award. Again as discussed above in greater detail, as the arbitration award was not appealed, the Borough cannot now, in an unfair labor practice proceeding raise issues of the legality of the award.</p>

The Commonwealth Court concluded that delegation of the Borough’s responsibilities, as trustee of the trust, was impermissible under the Borough pension fund. However, subsequent to the issuance of the Commonwealth Court’s opinion, Act 600 has been amended to address the impact of the formation of regional police departments on police officer pensions. The amendments clearly allow consol<a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>idation of police pension funds of the political subdivisions that form regional departments and require that police officers who continue with a regional police department receive credit for time spent as a member of the political subdivision’s pension fund. These concepts of consolidation and credit for previous service are certainly contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s notion of the Borough’s duty as a trustee and the Borough being permitted to keep its pension fund separate from that of the RPD plan. 53 P.S. § 770.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

As the PLRB notes, if not covered by Act 111, the officers employed by the regional police department would necessarily be covered by the Public Employe Relations Act, 43 P.S. §§ 1101.101-1101.2301 ("PERA”). Under the PERA, these officers would have the right to strike, a situation certainly not intended by the legislature in crafting Act 111, which denies police officers the right to strike in return for binding arbitration. However, the right to strike under the PERA would be seemingly illusory because the PERA authorizes enjoining strikes that create a "clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public.” 43 P.S. § 1101.1003. With respect to striking police officers, it would be difficult to see how this standard would not be met. However, unlike Act 111 where the absence of the right to strike is offset with the promise of binding arbitration, under the PERA, the officers would lack any meaningful right to strike and would be deprived of the right to compel their employer to submit bargaining impasses to binding arbitration. Thus, if the Borough is not deemed to be a joint employer, regional officers will either have the right to strike or be deprived of both a meaningful right to strike and the quid pro quo for relinquishing strike rights, binding interest arbitration.</p>
