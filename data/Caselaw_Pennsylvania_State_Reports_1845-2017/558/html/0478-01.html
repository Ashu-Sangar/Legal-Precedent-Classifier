(now deceased), counsel for Chmiel at his first trial? We conclude that the admission of such testimony was error and therefore reverse.</p>

    <p id="b555-6" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[176,735,1152,619]]]'>David Chmiel was charged with stabbing to death three elderly siblings, Angelina, Victor, and James Lunario, while robbing their home in Throop, Lackawanna County, in the early morning hours of September 21, 1983. In 1984, a jury convicted Chmiel of three counts of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to death. This Court reversed the convictions after finding that trial counsel (Attorney Kennedy) had been ineffective. <em>Commonwealth v. Chmiel, </em><a href="/pa/536/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="536 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="1843135" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0244-01">536 Pa. 244</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="639 A.2d 9" data-case-ids="1843135,7858443" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0244-01,/a2d/639/0009-01">639 A.2d 9</a> (1994). Chmiel was retried in 1995. As before, he was convicted of three counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death. This direct appeal from that judgment of sentence followed.</p>
    <p id="b555-7" data-blocks='[["BL_555.6",555,[170,1388,1158,735]]]'>The principal Commonwealth witness against David Chmiel at both the first and second trials was his brother, Martin Chmiel. According to Martin, David told him late in the summer of 1983 that he needed to obtain money quickly; he (Martin) told David that the Lunarios kept large sums of money in their home; and he and David then decided to break into the Lunarios’ home in order to steal the money. While admitting that he participated in the planning of the break-in to the extent of fashioning ski masks for himself and David from the sleeves of an old sweater, Martin asserted that he subsequently changed his mind and had nothing further to do with the scheme. Martin testified that David confessed to him shortly after the murders that he had stabbed the Lunarios to death and stolen $5,300.00 from their home.</p>
    <p id="b555-8" data-blocks='[["BL_555.7",555,[170,2150,1153,204]],["BL_556.1",556,[223,313,1152,467]]]'>After the jury’s verdict in the first trial, David Chmiel filed counseled post-trial motions as well as a <em>pro se </em>petition alleging that Attorney Kennedy had been ineffective for, <em>inter alia, </em>making no effort to locate alibi witnesses, discouraging <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>him from taking the stand, and failing to request an accomplice instruction as to Martin Chmiel’s testimony. The trial court appointed new counsel, stayed the post-trial motions, and held an evidentiary hearing (treated as a hearing pursuant to the then-effective Post Conviction Hearing Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9551) on the ineffectiveness claims. Following the hearing, at which Attorney Kennedy testified, the trial court denied David Chmiel’s post-trial motions and formally imposed the sentence of death.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[223,804,1150,300]]]'>On direct appeal, this Court determined that Attorney Kennedy’s failure to request an accomplice instruction with regard to the testimony of Martin Chmiel constituted ineffective assistance that prejudiced the defendant. Accordingly, the judgment of sentence was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b556-6" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[222,1136,1151,574]]]'>Prior to the retrial, David Chmiel (hereinafter “Chmiel”) filed an omnibus motion requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court preclude the use at trial of the testimony given by Attorney Kennedy at the evidentiary hearing in 1988.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The basis for the motion was that such testimony had impermissibly disclosed confidential attorney-client communications. Opposing the motion, the Commonwealth argued that Attorney Kennedy’s testimony should be admitted for impeachment purposes in the event that Chmiel decided to take the stand. The trial court denied Chmiel’s motion to preclude use of the testimony.</p>

The crux of his testimony was that circumstances at the time of the killings strongly suggested to him that his brother Martin had committed the crime. Chmiel testified on direct examination that he had gone near the Lunarios’ residence on only two occasions. The first occasion was in late June or early July of 1988, when he and Martin went there to “case the joint.” The second occasion was early in September of that year, when he and Martin drove to the <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>residence with the intent of burglarizing it; however, they abandoned the plan upon discovering that, contrary to their expectation, someone was at home.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[170,481,1154,959]]]'>Concerning his whereabouts on the night of the murders, Chmiel testified as follows: After having spent the day doing construction work on the home of Nancy and Tom Buffton, his sister and brother-in-law, Chmiel arrived home at about 4:30 p.m. Leaving there, he drove to the residence of Mike Cordaro, an electrical contractor to whom he owed money, in order to pay him. After paying Cordaro, Chmiel drove to North End Plumbing Supply to check prices, to a six-pack store to buy lottery tickets, and then to Betz’s Bar, where he stayed until at least 11:00 p.m. From the bar he went to the Bufftons’ house to check on tools that had been left there; to the home of a friend, Pat Battle, with whom he had a few beers; and to his brother Marty’s house, where he learned from Marty’s wife that Marty was not at home but was with Tom Buffton. After stopping at a donut shop and a mini-market, Chmiel went home. He went out once more to buy aspirin for his child. Then, he testified, he returned home to stay at 3:00 or 3.T5 a.m.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[168,1471,1152,301]]]'>As promised, the Commonwealth used Attorney Kennedy’s testimony to cross-examine Chmiel concerning his whereabouts at the time of the murders. Because it is important to understand the nature of such testimony and the use that was made of it, we quote at length the pertinent portion of the cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b557-7" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[166,1810,1154,202]]]'>Chmiel maintained that he had not been in the vicinity of the Lunario residence when the murders were committed and that he had “never ... told anybody anything different.... ” The prosecutor then asked:</p>

He contends, rather, that the ineffectiveness hearing did not address the same criminal issue as his subsequent trial on homicide charges. According to Chmiel, the issue at the evidentiary hearing was Attorney Kennedy’s effectiveness at the first trial, and such issue does not imply the commission of a crime or the threat of criminal punishment; the issue at the second trial, in contrast, was Chmiel’s guilt or innocence of three charges of murder in the first degree. Therefore, Chmiel argues, it cannot be said that <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>the hearing afforded him a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Attorney Kennedy on the issue that was fundamental to his second trial.

    <p id="b573-4" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[175,455,1154,510]]]'>The issue at the second trial, as at the first, was Chmiel’s guilt or innocence of three charges of first-degree murder. The issue at the evidentiary hearing was Attorney Kennedy’s effectiveness in defending Chmiel against those charges at the first trial. Central to both issues was Chmiel’s credibility: Was he to be believed when he testified concerning his whereabouts on the night in question? As Attorney Kennedy’s testimony on this issue was decidedly negative, Chmiel’s motive for cross-examining Attorney Kennedy is readily apparent.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[171,999,1158,1050]]]'>The fact that Attorney Kennedy would not face criminal punishment if found to be ineffective is, as to this issue, irrelevant. It was not the significance of the hearing to Attorney Kennedy that mattered, but the significance of the hearing <em>to Chmiel. </em>If Chmiel succeeded in demonstrating prior counsel’s ineffectiveness with respect to the investigation of alibi witnesses, his own desire to take the stand, or any of the other asserted grounds, he would obtain a new trial (as, indeed, he did on the ground of failure to request an accomplice instruction). A new trial would afford him not only a second chance for acquittal but also, failing that, a second chance at a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death. It was therefore in Chmiel’s interest to impeach or disprove Attorney Kennedy’s testimony concerning each and every allegation of ineffectiveness. Indeed, a more compelling motive for effective cross-examination is difficult to imagine. Therefore, as Chmiel had both the motive and the opportunity to cross-examine Attorney Kennedy at the evidentiary hearing, Section 5917 did not bar the admission of Attorney Kennedy’s testimony at Chmiel’s second trial.</p>

This disclosure is made in the strictest confidence, relying upon the attorney’s honor and fidelity. To permit the attorney to reveal to others what is so disclosed, would be not only a gross violation of a sacred trust upon his part, but it would utterly destroy and prevent the usefulness and benefits to be derived from professional assistance. Based upon considerations of public policy, therefore, the law wisely declares that all confidential communications and disclosures, made by a client to his legal adviser for the purpose of obtaining his professional aid or advice, shall be strictly privileged;— that the attorney shall not be permitted, without the consent of his client, — and much less will he be compelled — to reveal or disclose communications made to him under such circumstances.</blockquote>

    <p id="b584-8" data-blocks='[["BL_584.8",584,[228,1066,1154,1276]]]'>The majority holds that to allow the now deceased counsel’s testimony from a prior ineffectiveness hearing to be used to impeach appellant at his second trial would violate appellant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The majority reasons that allowing the use of such testimony would result in criminal defendants having the Hobson’s choice of deciding whether to disclose information covered by the attorney-client privilege for the purpose of proving an ineffectiveness claim, knowing that the disclosures could be used against them in a later proceeding, or to refrain from bringing an ineffectiveness claim, thereby possibly giving up their right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. In so holding, the majority is effectively permitting appellant to resurrect a waived attorney-client privilege in order to prevent counsel’s sworn testimony from the ineffectiveness hearing to be used to impeach appellant’s perjurious testimony at his second trial. I respectfully dissent because subsequent use of this testimony (which was initially obtained pursuant to a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and made part of the public record on a meritless ineffectiveness claim) does not implicate appellant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The right to effective assistance of counsel does not encompass the right later to testify falsely under oath once the ineffectiveness claim has been asserted.</p>

      <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>Initially, appellant sought to prevent the disclosure of his trial counsel’s testimony, arguing that the attorney-client privilege barred such disclosure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> It is axiomatic that the attorney-client privilege is intended to foster candid communications between legal counsel and the client so that counsel can provide legal advice based upon the most complete information possible from the client. The historical concern has been that, absent the attorney-client privilege, the client may be reluctant to fully disclose all the facts necessary to obtain informed legal advice if these facts may later be exposed to public scrutiny.</p>
    <p id="b585-5" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[173,886,1154,569]]]'>The attorney-client privilege, however, is not an absolute privilege. The privilege is not available to protect attorney-client communications where the client attacks the effectiveness of the attorney’s representation. <em>Loutzenhiser v.

In order to rebut the charges of ineffectiveness, trial counsel testified under oath at the evidentiary hearing on his effectiveness that he chose not to present appellant as a witness or to pursue an alibi defense because appellant, in preparation for trial, had told him three contradictory versions of his whereabouts at the time of the crime. Specifically, trial counsel testified that appellant first told him that he was near the victims’ residence, casing it out for a future robbery, when he saw his brother, Martin Chmiel, emerge from the house, run down an alley, and disappear into a waiting car. Five months later, appellant informed trial counsel that he had not been at <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>the crime scene that night at all, but rather was in the company of various other persons throughout the course of the night. Appellant’s third statement regarding the killing was that his brother had confessed to him that he and two accomplices had killed the victims.</p>
    <p id="b586-5" data-blocks='[["BL_586.4",586,[220,574,1153,466]]]'>Notwithstanding the disclosure of these communications in open court that included appellant’s initial statement that he had been at the crime scene on the night of the murders, appellant took the stand at his second trial and testified that he had <em>not </em>been in the vicinity of the crime scene when the murders were committed. The Commonwealth then sought to impeach appellant with trial counsel’s testimony from the ineffectiveness hearing where counsel testified that appellant told him that he <em>had </em>been present at the crime scene.</p>
    <p id="b586-6" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[221,1064,1151,520]]]'>The trial court allowed such cross-examination. The majority now finds that the trial court erred in so doing because such practice would have a “chilling effect” on a party’s assertion of his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. Thus, the issue becomes whether otherwise public, relevant information which would bear directly upon appellant’s credibility should be excluded from a subsequent trial because the information was made public in order for appellant to raise an ineffective assistance claim. I would allow such communications to be used against the defendant at a later proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b586-7" data-blocks='[["BL_586.6",586,[219,1608,1153,733]]]'>A defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel entitles him to allege and attempt to prove that his counsel was ineffective during the course of the representation. Apparently, the Majority here believes that, by allowing appellant’s trial counsel to furnish impeachment testimony at his retrial, there would be a chilling effect on appellant’s right to the effective assistance of counsel by, <em>inter alia, </em>rendering it less likely that he would ever choose to bring an ineffectiveness claim in the first place following a finding of guilt. As a matter of logic, the Majority’s reasoning is quite simply incorrect, for reasons which I state below. As a matter of policy, the Majority’s reasoning troubles me greatly, as I believe it is tantamount to placing this Court’s judicial imprimatur on the practice of perjury in the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b587-4" data-blocks='[["BL_587.3",587,[177,297,1155,1222]]]'>
      <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>First, appellant himself has defeated the notion that he would not bring a claim of ineffective assistance knowing that his attorney might be allowed to provide impeachment testimony against him if he won a retrial and then tried to change his defense. Quite simply, appellant <em>did </em>bring an ineffectiveness claim under such circumstances. It is inconceivable to me that this Court would order a new trial on the basis of a “chilling” of appellant’s Sixth Amendment right when appellant quite clearly exercised that right as vigorously as it can be exercised. Moreover, it is equally inconceivable that <em>any </em>criminal defendant in appellant’s situation would ever decline to bring a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance on the grounds that such a course of action might impair the defendant’s freedom of imagination in the event that the defendant won a new trial. I do not believe I am making a bold prediction when I suggest that defendants will find the alternative of death by lethal injection to be less palatable than the prospect of bringing a claim of ineffective assistance while knowing that they will not be able to concoct a new story inconsistent with what they have already told their attorneys. Consequently, I believe that the Majority’s concerns related to the putative chilling effect on appellant’s Sixth Amendment rights are logically unsound.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

    <p id="b587-5" data-blocks='[["BL_587.4",587,[177,1544,1150,96]],["BL_588.1",588,[215,300,1155,1500]]]'>Second, I am troubled by what I perceive to be the policy ramifications of the Court’s decision. It is beyond peradven<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>ture that the attorney-client privilege is waived when a criminal defendant brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Essentially, the Court’s decision today resuscitates the already-waived attorney-client privilege under the guise of protecting the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel and concomitant right to seek a new trial. What the Court is really protecting, however, is not the right of a criminal defendant simply to seek a new trial, but rather the right to seek a new trial in which he is free to commit perjury without consequences. The attorney-client privilege should not provide a cloak of immunity for such a nefarious purpose. Once the privilege is waived for purposes of an ineffectiveness claim, it should remain waived for purposes of cross-examination in a second trial, rather than act as a shield which prevents the factfinder from being exposed to the defendant’s naked perjury. The purpose of the privilege is to promote <em>candor </em>with one’s attorney; the only situation in which an attorney will be called as an impeachment witness is a situation like this in which the defendant has already abused the concept of candor (by lying to either the attorney, the court, or both) and, therefore, subverted the very basis for assertion of the privilege in the first place. To be succinct, judicial expansion of the traditional attorney-client privilege is inappropriate at best when the very point of the expansion seems to be to facilitate the deception of the judicial system itself by prevaricating defendants. Accordingly, I believe that policy considerations militate heavily against the decision of the Majority.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[217,1840,1146,98]]]'>In sum, for reasons of logic and of policy, I would affirm the judgment of sentence. I respectfully dissent.</p>

To the extent that the Majority rests its decision on the chilling effect on a defendant’s ability to be candid with his attorney in the first instance, I would note again that the unsettled state of the law in this area did not exactly impair appellant from testing out with his attorney the various versions of his defense. Moreover, affirmation in this matter would have no chilling effect whatsoever on the ability of <em>any </em>criminal defendant to be candid with his attorney, since the only purpose behind the Commonwealth’s use of trial counsel as an impeachment witness was to show either that appellant was not candid with his attorney or else that he was not candid with the Court under oath. If appellant tells his attorney the truth and tells the Court the truth on retrial, then there will be no purpose to calling the attorney as an impeachment witness, and the spirit of full candor will be vindicated. By prohibiting the attorney from testifying in these circumstances, this Court necessarily condones one of two things: either a duplicitous relationship between the defendant and his trial counsel or a duplicitous relationship between the defendant and the Court.</p>
