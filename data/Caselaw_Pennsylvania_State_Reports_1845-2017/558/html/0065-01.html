McCurdy bases this argument, in part, upon the assumption that the Commonwealth’s failure to offer evidence relating his blood alcohol level to the time of the accident precludes the use of such evidence in establishing the offense of driving under the influence pursuant to subsection (a)(1).

At the time of McCurdy’s offense, Section 3731(a)(5) provided that the offense could also be established by evidence that the amount of alcohol by weight in his blood was .10 percent or greater based upon a chemical test obtained within three hours after the operation of a vehicle. In amending the driving under the influence statute by adding, initially, subsection (a)(4) and, later, subsection (a)(5), the General Assembly simply allowed the Commonwealth to establish an element of the offense of driving under the influence as a matter of law. <em>Cf.

Understood in this manner, the driving under the influence statute proscribes a single harm to the Commonwealth — the operation of a vehicle under the influence to a degree that renders an individual incapable of safe driving. The fact that the offense may be established as a matter of law if the Commonwealth can produce the necessary chemical test does not constitute proof of a different offense, but merely represents an alternative basis for finding culpability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

We note the significance of the trial court’s charge to the jury in connection with our holding in this regard. Such charge was quite particularly divided according to the various theories of driving under the influence which the Commonwealth invoked against McCurdy. After separately detailing the elements of the (a)(1) and (a)(4) theories, the trial court gave a particularized explanation of the (a)(5) theory, specifically confining its description of the (a)(5) presumption to this context. The trial court thereafter emphasized the differences between the (a)(1), (a)(4), and (a)(5) proofs, for example, in an admonishment to the jurors to "[b]ear in mind that it is the defendant’s blood alcohol level at the time that he was driving, operating or in control that is <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>directly relevant under the first two charges.” The jury was thus provided with an appropriate framework within which to make its separate determinations concerning the (a)(1), (a)(4), and (a)(5) theories, which are reflected upon the completed special verdict form.</p>

The reason that the issue of relation back testimony is important is because in many cases involving DUI charges the police have no direct evidence that a defendant had a particular blood alcohol content at the time of driving, and thus the Commonwealth must rely upon an inference to establish that the defendant did have a certain BAC level at the time he or she was driving. That inference is drawn from a BAC test that is administered after the defendant ceased driving. The problem that exists is that a variety of factors affect when alcohol is <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>absorbed into a-particular individual’s blood, which is when that person feels the effects of the alcohol. A plethora of considerations go into determining how probative a post-driving BAC test is of a person's condition while he or she had been driving. Those considerations include, <em>inter alia, </em>the persons height, weight, metabolism, what they had eaten and how long ago, when they consumed their last drink, and how many drinks they consumed within a particular time frame. <em>See </em>Robert J. Schefter, Under the Influence of Alcohol Three Hours After Driving: The Constitutionality of the (a)(5) Amendment to Pennsylvania's DUI Statute, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20Dick.%20L.%20Rev.%20441" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="100 Dick.

I also note my belief that our Court should address some of the apparent inconsistencies that exist in the law with respect to relation back testimony, as soon as the appropriate case presents itself. As discussed above, most recently, in <em>Shade, </em><a href="/pa/545/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="681 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="465104,7861921" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0347-01,/a2d/681/0710-01">681 A.2d at 710</a>, we held that it was error for the trial court to relieve the Commonwealth from having to present relation-back evidence, and therefore arrested the judgment against the defendant. Yet in <em>Commonwealth v. Yarger, </em><a href="/pa/538/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="538 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="475514" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0329-01">538 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/pa/538/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="648 A.2d 529" data-case-ids="475514,7869540" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0329-01,/a2d/648/0529-01">648 A.2d 529</a> (1994), this Court had held that once the Commonwealth has established that the defendant’s blood alcohol content reflects an amount above 0.10% (without relation-back testimony) it has made a <em>prima facie </em>case under § 3731(a)(4). When read together, the two decisions create an odd result. <em>Yarger </em>allows the Commonwealth to get to the jury without presenting relation-back testimony, however, if a jury then convicts a defendant and there was no relation-back testimony offered by the Commonwealth, then, under <em>Shade, </em>the conviction may not stand. The problems resulting from these two decisions is perhaps best illustrated by a recent Superior Court decision where, based upon <em>Yarger, </em>it reversed a trial court’s decision, based upon <em>Shade, </em>not to admit a BAC test result without relation back testimony. <em>See Commonwealth v. Allbeck, </em><a href="/a2d/715/1213-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="715 A.2d 1213" data-case-ids="11711025" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/1213-01">715 A.2d 1213</a> (Pa.Super.1998), <em>allocatur pending, </em>748 M.D. Alloc.
