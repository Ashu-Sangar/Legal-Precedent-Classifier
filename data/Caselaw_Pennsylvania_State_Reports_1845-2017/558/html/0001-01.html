However, based upon the School District’s use of the word transactions in the Resolution, it arguably also can be read as levying a tax on each parking transaction.

Rather, the tax applies to a limited class of gross receipts: "gross receipts from all transactions in and for the parking of automobiles." Thus, despite the varying texts, the tax in <em>Samuels </em>is virtually identical to the District’s parking lot tax — the only difference being the rate at which the parking transactions are taxed.</p>

Claims of double taxation typically arise in the context of a taxpayer claim that a local taxing authority has duplicated an existing tax levied by the state and has thus exceeded its power under the enabling statute permitting it to enter tax fields not occupied by the state. <em>See, e.g., National Biscuit Co. v.

"In determining whether a tax duplicates another tax and results in double taxation prohibited to local taxing authorities, the operation or incidence of the two taxes is controlling as against mere differences in terminology from time to time in describing taxes in various cases. The incidence of a tax embraces the subject matter thereof and, more important, the measure of the tax, i.e., the base or yardstick by which the tax is applied.

The mischaracterization is analogous to the error of the Opinion in Support of Reversal in focusing too much attention on the red herring in this case — the words "gross receipts.” I believe that this Court’s imprecise statement in <em>Mellon Square </em>that Pittsburgh’s parking lot tax was "computed by taking a fixed percentage of the ‘gross receipts,’ ” when in fact the tax was computed by taxing a fixed percentage of "the gross receipts from all such [parking lot] transactions,” provides a clear example of how "[t]he law dealing with taxation is often illogical and arbitrary and the use of words in different senses results in confusion.” <em>Samuels, </em><a href="/pa/338/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="338 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1199959" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0321-01">338 Pa. at 324</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%2079" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="12 A.2d 79">12 A.2d at 81</a>.</p>

Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the holdings are ambiguous, I must still disagree with the Opinion in Support of Reversal that we must on this account strictly construe the Resolution against the taxing authority. (Opinion in Support of Reversal at 653). The supposed ambiguity does not exist with regard to the subject matter of the taxation. Rather, the supposed ambiguity exists between the Resolution and the Reform Act. It would thus not be a matter of resolving an ambiguity in the tax itself, requiring strict construction in favor of the taxpayer, but instead resolving an ambiguity as to legislative intent in relation to the Reform Act, requiring guidance from the Rules of Statutory Construction.</p>
