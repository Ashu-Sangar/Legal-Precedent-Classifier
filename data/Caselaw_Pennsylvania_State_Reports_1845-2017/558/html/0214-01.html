Thereafter, on July 20, 1993, the trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 5 years 11% months’ to 11 years 11 months’ imprisonment for these offenses. Lantzy filed timely post-sentence motions seeking, among other things, to withdraw his guilty plea and have his sentence modified. He also filed a timely notice of appeal with the Superior Court.

In his petition, Lantzy alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was innocent and that plea counsel was ineffective for advising him to withdraw his original appeal and post-sentence motions in exchange for a modified sentence that was ultimately vacated. At the subsequent evidentiary hearing, Lantzy clarified for the record that he believed that plea counsel had done a “good job,” and that the reduced sentence of four to eight years was “a good deal at the time.” He sought to appeal, however, because, he asserted, the sentencing court had excluded favorable character evidence which, if admitted, might have moved that court to either impose a more lenient sentence or allow him to participate in a work release program. There is scant information in the record, however, to describe the claims Lantzy intended to pursue before the Superior Court when he filed his original notice of appeal after the first sentence was imposed. It is thus unclear whether he had originally sought to challenge only the discretionary aspects of his sentence, or whether he also intended to attack his conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In the accompanying opinion, the court found that, by negotiating a reduced sentence, plea counsel possessed a reasonable basis for his actions designed to effectuate Lantzy’s interests; therefore, Lantzy could not demonstrate that counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The PCRA court further opined that plea counsel’s actions did not prejudice Lantzy, but rather, “it was [Lantzy’s] own actions [in lodging an appeal from the reduced sentence] that led to his current sentence.”</p>

From the repeal of former Section 9543(a)(2)(v), which occurred in connection with the 1995 amendments to the PCRA, the majority inferred that the General Assembly intended to narrow the availability of post-conviction relief in conformity with the act’s express purpose, namely, the provision of relief to persons who are innocent or are serving illegal sentences. <em>See Lantzy II, </em><a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">712 A.2d at </a>290 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542).</p>

Were the "sole means” directive to be subordinated to a limitation based upon "guilt or innocence,” several unreasonable, or at least impractical, results would follow.

Additionally, such an interpretation would inject a highly formalistic element into post-conviction proceedings, in which a prisoner’s claim would be denied simply because he failed to invoke the correct form of relief. Indeed, confusion would be likely to result, with defense practitioners erring on the side of seeking dual relief by filing joint <em>PCRA/habeas corpus </em>petitions and allowing the courts to sort out the manner in which the claims are to be adjudged.</p>
