The three men had been friends for ten years. McLaurin and Knight responded that they did not have any money, and Douglas departed. A short time after that Douglas returned with a small caliber semiautomatic pistol and shot Knight twice, killing him. He also shot McLaurin twice, in the upper and lower arm.</p>
    <p id="b492-13" data-blocks='[["BL_492.13",492,[217,2180,1151,152]],["BL_493.1",493,[171,285,1153,529]]]'>Officers Pressley and Jones were on patrol in the immediate vicinity. They heard shots and saw McLaurin running. When McLaurin flagged them down, he said he and Knight <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>had been shot and told them about the shooting. McLaurin was seated in the back of the police wagon and they drove one block to where Knight lay dying. At about 3:07 a.m., Officer Riley arrived and took McLaurin to Temple University Hospital in a police car, and McLaurin described the shooting and named Douglas as the shooter. McLaurin also gave Officer Riley the address of Douglas. While still at the hospital, two hours later, McLaurin also identified a photograph of Douglas, from an array of photographs, and said he was the man who shot Knight and him.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[171,842,1153,366]]]'>Although the police had the address of Douglas, they could not find him there. They encountered Douglas on three occasions, and he managed to escape each time, because he threatened them with a weapon, once a sawed off shotgun or a small caliber semiautomatic handgun he carried in his back pocket. Finally the police apprehended and arrested Douglas approximately one year later, on July 26,1981.</p>

Although McLaurin appeared and testified at the preliminary hearing of Douglas, he did not appear for trial. The Commonwealth made numerous attempts to locate McLaurin, but he could not be found. There are allegations that he was in fear from threats and that he was hiding. The trial court eventually held that McLaurin was “unavailable,” and therefore allowed the Commonwealth to read his preliminary hearing testimony into the record. Besides this, the Commonwealth presented evidence that Douglas admitted to Knight’s mother that he had killed her son and threatened to kill her. The Commonwealth also presented the photographic identification of Douglas on the <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>morning of the crime and the repeated flights of Douglas from uniformed police officers.

His trial counsel was permitted to withdraw, and new counsel filed supplemental post-trial motions, including allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Following a hearing, the trial court granted Douglas’ request for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel; the court did not address other issues raised by Douglas. The grant of a new trial was based solely on a claim alleging that trial counsel was ineffective for extracting from a defense witness that Douglas had a prior criminal record. The Commonwealth appealed to the Superi- or Court, which reversed the grant of a new trial. Douglas then appealed that decision to this Court, which affirmed and remanded to the trial court for consideration of the issues raised but not decided in Douglas’ post-trial motions. <em>Commonwealth v.

The police also contacted McLaurin’s mother, his sister, his girlfriend, his neighbors, the security officers at the housing project, and others to try to find McLaurin, all to no avail.

Hence, I would prospectively hold that it is <em>per se </em>reversible error for the Commonwealth to employ such language.
