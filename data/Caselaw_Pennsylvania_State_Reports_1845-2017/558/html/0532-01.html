In brief, Appellant arrived at the home of Violeta Cintron (“Violeta”) at approximately one o’clock in the morning on January 22, 1986. Appellant had come to Violeta’s house looking for Violeta’s husband, Jose Carrasquillo (“Carrasquillo”) with whom Appellant had conducted drug deals in the past. Appellant requested some cocaine from Violeta. When Violeta was about to hand over the cocaine, however, Appellant announced that he wished to trade methamphetamine for the cocaine rather than pay cash. Violeta refused this offer, and Appellant left the premises.</p>
    <p id="b612-7" data-blocks='[["BL_612.7",612,[241,1318,1152,690]]]'>Appellant returned to Violeta’s house a few minutes later, this time armed with an automatic handgun and demanded the cocaine from Violeta. Raymond Cintron (“Raymond”), Violeta’s brother, dropped Violeta’s one year old son whom he had been holding and began wrestling with Appellant for control of the gun. Several shots were fired in the ten by eleven foot room, hitting Raymond as well as a stereo speaker, a lamp and a wall. Raymond fell to the floor after which Appellant picked him up and fired more shots into Raymond’s body. Appellant fled the scene. While fleeing, Appellant came face-to-face with Dalia Cintron (“Dalia”), one of Violeta’s sisters, and pointed his gun at her as he made his escape. Raymond subsequently died from these gunshot wounds.</p>

On January 25, 1986, Appellant arrived at the home of Richard Campbell (“Campbell”). Campbell, who had been warned <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>of Appellant’s arrival, greeted Appellant with a shotgun; a gunfight immediately ensued in which Appellant was wounded. Appellant was picked up by police a short distance from the Campbell residence. Ballistic tests later revealed that the weapon Appellant used in the Campbell shooting was the same one used to kill Raymond.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[164,634,1159,677]]]'>Appellant was tried before a jury for crimes stemming from the shooting of Raymond; he was found guilty of murder in the first degree, robbery and possession of an instrument of crime. A penalty hearing was subsequently convened. The jury found two aggravating circumstances: that the killing was committed while in the perpetration of another felony,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and the killing created a grave risk of harm to others.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The jury also found one mitigating circumstance: that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The jury determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstance and sentenced Appellant to death. This court affirmed the judgment of sentence on direct appeal. <em>Rollins, <a href="/pa/525/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="525 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1823774" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0335-01">supra.</a></em>

His first claim is that the PCRA court erred when it denied him relief without a hearing.

As Appellant’s issues of trial court error and prosecutorial misconduct were not raised on direct appeal, they are waived. <em>See Commonwealth v.

To overcome this presumption, Appellant must establish three factors. First, he must show that the underlying claim has arguable merit. <em>Commonwealth v. Travaglia, </em><a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="541 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="470782" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01">541 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="661 A.2d 352" data-case-ids="470782,7870893" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01,/a2d/661/0352-01">661 A.2d 352</a>, 356 (1995). Second, Appellant must prove that counsel had no reasonable basis for his action or inaction. <em><a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="661 A.2d 352" data-case-ids="470782,7870893" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01,/a2d/661/0352-01">Id.</a> </em>In determining whether counsel’s action was reasonable, we do not question whether there were other more logical courses of action which counsel could have pursued; rather, we must examine whether counsel’s decisions had any reasonable basis. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 975 (1987). Finally, Appellant must establish that he has been prejudiced by counsel’s ineffectiveness; in order to meet this burden, he must show that “but for the act or omission in <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>question, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” <em>Travaglia, </em><a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="661 A.2d 352" data-case-ids="470782,7870893" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01,/a2d/661/0352-01">661 A.2d at 357</a>. “If it is clear that Appellant has not met the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness standard, the claim may be dismissed on that basis alone and the court need not [initially] determine whether the first and second prongs have been met.” <em><a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="661 A.2d 352" data-case-ids="470782,7870893" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01,/a2d/661/0352-01">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[164,646,1154,416]]]'>Appellant’s first ineffectiveness claim is a broad one. He contends that the inexperience of his trial counsel, in itself, is sufficient to establish that counsel was ineffective. We reject this claim as we have previously stated that the mere inexperience of counsel is not equivalent to ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="537 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="775574" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01">537 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="640 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="775574,7872109" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01,/a2d/640/1251-01">640 A.2d 1251</a>, 1264 (1994).

Appellant is incorrect. All five of these jurors indicated that they could be fair and impartial and would not decide to convict Appellant merely because of the drug-related nature of this crime.

This argument is specious. Dalia had testified that, from her own home several houses away from Violeta’s, she had observed Appellant enter Violeta’s residence, depart the residence, and then return approximately five minutes later; the total time which she observed Appellant from her house was thus “ten to fifteen minutes”. Yet her testimony made it very clear that her face-to-face observation of Appellant was far more limited. Once she heard the shots, Dalia testified at trial, she rushed from her home where she encountered and saw him face-to-face for approximately four seconds. N.T. 3/03/87 at 1352-53.

Specifically, Appellant contends that this aggravating factor would allow a jury to sentence a defendant to death where the killing was the result of a mistake, such as where a killing occurs accidentally in a “robbery gone awry” (which Appellant contends that the jury in this matter found) as opposed to “a planned murder____” Appellant’s brief at 90. This argument is absurd. The only time a penalty phase is convened is when a defendant stands convicted of first degree murder. With all of those defendants, it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the killings were committed with specific intent. <em>See 18 </em>Pa.C.S. § 2502(a) (to find a defendant guilty of murder, the jury must find that the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>defendant had specific intent to kill).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Thus, it would be impossible for a jury to find arbitrarily the aggravating factor of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6) with regard to a defendant who lacked the specific intent to kill as such a defendant would never be the subject of a penalty hearing. <em>Commonwealth v.
