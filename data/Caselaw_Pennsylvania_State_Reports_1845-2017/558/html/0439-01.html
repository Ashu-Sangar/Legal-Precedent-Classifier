DOT asserts that while reasonable grounds are relevant in determining whether chemical test results are admissible in a criminal prosecution, they are not a consideration in determining whether a licensee’s operating privileges were properly suspended for refusing chemical testing. DOT argues that section 1547(b) only requires that it demonstrate that the motorist was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, was asked to submit to chemical testing and refused. It relies on cases where we held that because the suspension proceeding focuses solely on the refusal to submit to chemical testing after being taken into custody, the legality of the arrest for the underlying criminal offense is irrelevant. <em>Glass v.

In <em>Wysocki </em>our Court held that the term “arrest” in section 1547(b) merely referred to the physical act of arrest, rather than to a lawful arrest. Thus the licensee’s operating privileges could be suspended for refusing chemical testing even though the initial stop of his vehicle did not comport with constitutional mandates. We based our decision on the fact that a driver’s guilt or innocence of a criminal offense is not at issue in the license suspension proceeding. We recognized, however, that the plain language of the statute required that the request for chemical testing be supported by reasonable <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>grounds for the officer to have believed the licensee was operating the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

Although section 1547 established an “implied consent” on the part of the motorist, subsection (a)(1) authorizes a request for a breathalyzer test only “if a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person to have been driving, operating or in actual physical control of the movement of a motor vehicle: (1) while under the influence of alcohol ...” Thus, although the fact that the initial stop may have been improper would not necessarily prevent a suspension of license where there was a subsequent refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test, such a suspension will not be allowed if the officer’s request was not supported by reasonable grounds for the officer to have believed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>

Accordingly, as set forth in numerous decisions of the Commonwealth Court, to sustain a suspension of operating privileges under section 1547, DOT must establish that the licensee: (1) was arrested for driving under the influence by a police officer who had reasonable grounds to believe that the licensee was operating or was in actual physical control of the movement of the vehicle while under influence of alcohol; (2) was asked to submit to a chemical test; (3) refused to do so; and (4) was warned that refusal might result in a license suspension. <em>See Finney v.

We recognize that our Court has not consistently included the "reasonable grounds” language in the discussion of the elements necessary to sustain a license suspension under section 1547(b).

We reject DOT’s contention that Appellant had to have driven the car while intoxicated to have reached the location where the vehicle was found. Such a conclusion requires the officer, without ever observing the car in motion or any other indication that Appellant had recently driven the car, to assume that Appellant operated die vehicle, that he was intoxicated at that time and that no one else drove the vehicle or Appellant to the road near the convenience store where the car was parked.</p>
