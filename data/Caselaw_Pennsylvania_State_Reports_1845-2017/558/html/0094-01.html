We decline to do so for two reasons. First, our more recent holding in <em>Sellers v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (HMT Construction Services, Inc.), </em><a href="/pa/552/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="552 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="559441" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0022-01">552 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/a2d/713/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="713 A.2d 87" data-case-ids="11805188,559441" data-case-paths="/a2d/713/0087-01,/pa/552/0022-01">713 A.2d 87</a> (1998), is more closely analogous as the regulations governing the filing of an appeal to the Board of Review in workers’ compensation and Unemployment compensation cases are similarly worded, both specifically referring to a postmark. Second, <em>Miller </em>involves the application of the Rules of Appellate Procedure governing appeals to the Commonwealth Court rather than the agency appeal involved in the instant matters. Pa.R.A.P. 1514(a) dates the filing of an appeal transmitted by mail by the date on a U.S. Postal Service Form 3817 certificate of mailing. Such a certificate of mailing can only be obtained during hours when the post office is open for business and is distinct and separate from a U.S. postmark. A postmark, on the other hand, can be readily obtained by depositing mail in a postal service mail box or at the post office, even if the post office is not open for business. Thus, <em>Miller </em>and the instant cases are distinguishable because they involve interpretations of different rules governing appeals to appellate courts and agency appeals. Further, this Court in <em>Miller </em>went to considerable lengths to find that the appeal there was timely filed. To impose the burden of going through these machinations on the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review would thwart the purpose of the unemployment compensation scheme - the speedy payment of benefits where benefits are warranted.</p>

The filing deadline for the appeal of Tse Teng Lin to the Board was Thursday, June 27, 1996; the appeal was not received until Friday, June 28, 1996. Similarly, the filing deadline for the appeal of Piotr Falkowski to the Board was Tuesday, August 6, 1996; the appeal was not received until Wednesday, August 7, 1996.</p>

Further, it would appear that this is the proverbial distinction without a difference. Unlike the majority, I discern no difference between the standards for adjudicating timeliness applicable to an appeal to the Board from a decision of a referee, and those applicable to an appeal to the Commonwealth Court from a decision of the Board. Given our statement in <em>Miller, </em>that “[w]e have long refused to give overly technical, restrictive readings to procedural rules, particularly when remedial statutes such as the Unemployment Compensation Act are involved,” the majority’s conclusion that our holding in <em>Miller </em>is inapplicable in the context of unemployment compensation is puzzling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
