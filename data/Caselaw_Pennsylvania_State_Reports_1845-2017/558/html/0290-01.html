The ALJ first considered whether the PUC possessed subject matter jurisdiction to allocate costs pursuant to Section 2704(a). Initially, the ALJ found that Section 2704(a) provided for jurisdiction in the PUC to make discretionary cost allocation determinations associated with the relocation of utility facilities at rail-highway crossings. The ALJ expressly rejected the argument that the “mutually agreed upon and paid” term of Section 2704(a) constrained the PUC’s jurisdiction under the facts of this case, because no costs had been <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>paid in conformity with the easement agreements prior to the assertion of PUC jurisdiction.

Moreover, the easement agreement required DHRC to execute and deliver a deed of easement to Sprint; however, no deed of easement was ever executed or delivered.

Bell’s and PECO’s facilities occupied a city-owned right-of-way pursuant to city-issued permits which explicitly stated that the city could direct Bell and PECO, at their sole expense, to relocate their facilities as necessitated by municipal work. Despite the wording of the permits, Bell and PECO sought to have allocated to the city the entire costs of relocating their facilities following the city’s restructuring of the crossing. On consideration of the utilities’ applications, the PUC issued an order directing the city to pay various of the utilities’ costs. The Commonwealth Court, however, applied the dicta from <em>City of Philadelphia I, </em>finding that the permit agreements controlled, and reversed the PUC’s order.</p>

As the relocation of the facilities of AT <em>&amp; </em>T and Sprint was incidental to this legislative purpose, and payment of all or part of their relocation costs from the designated public funds would have eliminated or diminished the incentive available to Delaware, the Commission’s determination that public funds were not available for the relocation of telecommunications facilities was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.</p>

Several of the parties have argued that the cost allocation provisions of the easement agreements create property rights that must be strictly enforced by the Commission and the courts under the federal and state constitutions.

Adherence to the literal terms of this Court’s prior statement would fully undermine the ability of private parties to advance their original intentions related to cost allocation, thus eliminating their ability to contract with any degree of confidence or certainty.

Touching upon these themes, the ALJ stated, “[¡Inherent in AT &amp; T’s and Sprint’s decisions to locate facilities in Railway’s rights-of-way was the risk that any alteration of Railway’s facilities in the rights-of-way might necessitate a relocation of AT &amp; T’s and Sprint’s facilities.”</p>

It merits emphasis that the PUC reviewed the Sprint/Guilford agreement in detail and found it to be of “uncertain applicability and interpretation.” Such finding is clearly supported in the record, as: Sprint’s agreement was with Guilford, not Delaware; Delaware acquired the railway by asset purchase from DHRC’s bankruptcy estate; there is no evidence that any obligations to Sprint passed from Guilford or DHRC’s bankruptcy estate to Delaware; and Sprint failed to record an easement and thus to establish a property interest in the crossing.

Significantly, in this appeal, the Commission, although having limited its jurisdiction to discrete portions of the tunnel, does not question the Commonwealth Court’s decision to require the assertion of jurisdiction over the entire length of the tunnel. Nor does the Commission elaborate upon either its initial decision to limit jurisdiction, or its subsequent decision to acquiesce to the expansion of its jurisdiction. As the agency charged with the duty to protect public safety in the arena of rail-highway crossings, we look, in the first instance, to the Commission’s expert assessment in establishing the physical limits of a rail-highway crossing.</p>
