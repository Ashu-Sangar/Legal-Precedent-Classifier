The answer to this contention is that this court has expressly found that the “relaxed waiver” doctrine will no longer be applicable in post conviction appeals and affords no relief in the context of an untimely PCRA petition. The issue before the court pertains to jurisdiction and not waiver, thus, Appellant’s reliance on the “relaxed waiver” doctrine is misplaced. <em>Commonwealth v.

In fact, Appellant did so on three prior occasions. Moreover, if Appellant had not previously filed a petition for collateral relief, he would still have had a one-year window in which to file a petition under the PCRA. As noted above, the amendments provide for a one-year period in which to file a first petition in those instances in which final judgment predated the effective date of the amendments.

In <em>Burns, </em>the Third Circuit held that a petition for federal writ of habeas corpus is deemed to be filed at the moment a prisoner delivers it to prison officials for mailing. In dicta, the court noted that as part of the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”), a post-judgment one-year period of limitations applied to an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The effective date of the AEDPA was April 24, 1996. The <em>Bums </em>court found that applying the one-year requirement would have required Burns to have filed his habeas petition before September 21, 1996, one year after his judge<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>ment became final, but less than five months after the effective date of the AEDPA’s time restrictions. The <em>Burns </em>court determined that a petition filed on or before April 23, 1997, or one year from the effective date of the act, may not be dismissed for failure to comply with the act’s time limitations. The court opined that to apply the one-year limitation to bar the filing of a habeas petition before April 24, 1997, where the conviction became final before April 24, 1996, would be impermissibly retroactive.</p>

In fact, the amendments to the PCRA actually impose a requirement similar to that found in <em>Burns. </em>As noted above, the PCRA allows for a petitioner’s first PCRA petition to be filed within one year of the effective date of the amendments. As discussed above, this one-year provision did not apply to Appellant because he had already filed three previous petitions.

Additionally, the <em>Lovasz </em>court emphasized that pursuant to the exhaustion doctrine, it was the policy of the federal system that the states should have the first opportunity to address and correct alleged violations of a state prisoner’s federal rights, citing <em>Coleman v.

This court’s King’s Bench powers are, in sum, an exercise of power over inferior tribunals. In many respects it is similar to an exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S. § 726. <em>In re: Assignment of Judge Bernard J.

Appellant fails to understand the basis for invoking this court’s King’s Bench powers. This court is currently entertaining Appellant’s appeal, thus, exercise of the court’s King’s Bench powers is unnecessary. <em>Commonwealth v.

As noted above, this court determined in September 1997 that Appellant had knowingly renounced all collateral and appellate proceedings regarding his conviction and sentence. In the brief for Appellant, counsel for Appellant asserts that Appellant now wishes to pursue collateral review of his case.

The Commonwealth argues that Appellant has no right to file his PCRA petition in light of his formal waiver of all appellate and collateral proceedings.
