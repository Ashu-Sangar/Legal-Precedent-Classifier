The three men attacked the sleeping couple by repeatedly stabbing and clubbing both of them. In the end, Dunne was stabbed to death, but Ogrod withstood the attack and managed to chase the assailants from the house.</p>
    <p id="b153-9" data-blocks='[["BL_153.8",153,[179,1253,1154,689]]]'>The attack on Dunne and Ogrod was the culmination of a conspiracy to kill Ogrod headed by Appellant and Morris (Marvin) Spence. Spence’s discontent with Ogrod stemmed from a soured drug-dealing relationship. Spence and Ogrod had been partners in dealing illegal drugs, but their relationship deteriorated after Spence stole money which Ogrod had given him to purchase drugs. When Ogrod demanded restitution, Spence refused. Appellant’s dissatisfaction with Ogrod resulted from a contentious living arrangement. In the Spring of 1986, Appellant had moved into Ogrod’s house at the invitation of Ogrod’s brother. Ogrod objected to Appellant’s presence at the house, which led to an ongoing dispute between Ogrod and Appellant.</p>

During the meeting, Spence and Appellant offered Carter $5,000.00 to kill Ogrod and his girlfriend. After discussing a plan for the murders, Carter expressed his reluctance, complaining that he was being asked to kill two people for the price of one. Two days later, when Spence went to Carter’s <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>house to finalize the plans for the attack, he met two of Carter's friends, James Gray and Keith Barrett. As the details of the plot were discussed, Carter renounced his decision to participate. Aware of Carter’s refusal to partake in the conspiracy, Gray and Barrett offered to assist in the killings.</p>

Together, the foursome drove to Ogrod’s house in Appellant’s truck, and, after their arrival, Spence, Barrett and Gray entered the house. Once inside, Spence and Barrett went into the kitchen and armed themselves with knives; Gray carried a crowbar which he had found in Appellant’s truck. The three of them went into the basement, where Ogrod and Dunne were sleeping, and attacked Ogrod and Dunne by stabbing and beating them. Following the attack, Spence, Gray and Barrett ran from the house to meet Appellant, who was waiting for them in his truck, and the four men drove off. Although Ogrod survived the assault, Dunne died.</p>

In the penalty phase, the Commonwealth moved the trial record into evidence and argued that two aggravating circumstances existed, namely, that Appellant had conspired to pay another person to kill the victim and that Appellant created a grave risk to another during the killing of the victim. <em>See 42 </em>Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(2) &amp; (7). After finding that both aggravating circumstances existed and that no mitigating circumstances were present, the jury returned a sentencing verdict of death. On April 26, 1990, the trial court denied post-trial motions and imposed the sentence of death for the murder conviction as well as terms of imprisonment for the remaining convictions. On appeal, this Court unanimously affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence. See <em>Commonwealth v.

On appeal, the defendant claimed that the trial court erred by refusing to ask all five of the questions posed by him. This Court disagreed and held that “under the circumstances, where there are not factors present to infuse the case with an enhanced racial sensitivity, and racial differences were not a focus of evidence at trial, the one voir dire question posed by the trial court was sufficiently specific and probing to reveal prejudices which might have bearing upon the case.” <a href="/pa/504/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="504 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1787732" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0358-01">504 Pa. at 364</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="504 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1787732" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0358-01">473 A.2d at 1364</a>.</p>

Appellant also appears to argue that since the trial court asked the venirepersons collectively, rather than individually, whether they had a fixed opinion based on the race of any of the defendants, the venirepersons may have been reluctant to honestly admit to being prejudiced. Thus, according to Appellant, he should have been allowed to repeat the inquiry regarding racial prejudices during each venireperson’s individual voir dire. This claim fails. As noted above, this Court has held that the general method of voir dire employed by the trial court in the instant matter is sufficient to uncover racial prejudices held by the venirepersons and empanel a fair and impartial jury. <em>See Craver, </em><a href="/pa/547/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="547 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="468629" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0017-01">547 Pa. at 30</a>, <a href="/pa/547/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="688 A.2d 691" data-case-ids="468629,468725,7357045,7357144" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0017-01,/pa/547/0016-02,/a2d/688/0691-01,/a2d/688/0691-02">688 A.2d at 698</a>. Moreover, Appellant cites no case law which would require the trial court, after collectively asking a panel of venirepersons about racial prejudices, to revisit the issue during individual voir dire with the venirepersons who had already answered the trial court’s inquiry in the negative. In any event, the record shows that those potential jurors who did not respond affirmatively to the race question during the collective voir dire were excused for cause when their responses during the individual voir dire indicated prejudice or bias. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., 6/27/88, at 543-545.</p>
