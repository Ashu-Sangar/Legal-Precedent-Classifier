Allocatur was granted in the instant consolidated cases to determine the applicability of our decision in <em>Brion. </em>We hold that because the appellants raised and properly preserved the same issue decided in <em>Brion </em>at all stages of the adjudication, and their cases were pending on direct appeal at the time <em>Brion </em>was decided, they are entitled to the benefit of the decision. Accordingly, we reverse the orders of the Superior Court which affirmed the appellants’ convictions.</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[223,1252,1153,790]]]'>The record establishes that Appellant Tony Ardestani solicited individuals to murder his wife. Following an acrimonious separation in June of 1991, Ardestani approached Richard Vecchiola and inquired whether he knew anyone who would kill his wife for $10,000. Approximately one year later, Vecchiola suggested that Ardestani meet Otis Winstead. While en route to Ardestani’s home on July 2, 1992, Winstead saw Detective Elizabeth Hoover and informed her of Ardestani’s plan to have his wife killed. Hoover accompanied Winstead to Ardestani’s residence, but he was not home. Winstead thereafter met with Ardestani to discuss the murder. Later that month, Winstead again met with Ardestani and portrayed Hoover as his partner. At that meeting, payment arrangements and specific plans to carry out the killing were discussed.</p>

Winstead asked Ardestani whether he wanted his wife killed that weekend, and he replied, “Yeah, I guess.” He then gave Hoover <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>and Winstead a description of the victim and directions to her home. As Ardestani and Hoover passed each other in a narrow doorway, Ardestani placed his hand on Hoover’s waist and felt the body wire. Hoover then placed Ardestani under arrest.</p>

The trial court denied the motion and a recording of the taped conversation was played for the jury at trial. Ardestani was thereafter convicted of criminal solicitation. The common pleas court denied post-trial motions challenging the constitutionality of the intercepted conversations and sentenced Ardestani to three to ten years imprisonment.</p>

First, under <em>Blackwell, </em>although the purpose of the new rule announced in <em>Brion </em>was designed to safeguard privacy, this purpose will not be enhanced or furthered by applying the new rule to cases where the interceptions previously occurred under constitutionally permissible circumstances at the time. Prior to <em>Brion, </em>a defendant could not establish that he was entitled to the benefit of a court order based upon probable cause prior to having his conversations recorded in his home, as this Court had not yet determined that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy under such circumstances. Even if a retroactive application of <em>Brion </em>could restore a lost privacy interest, which it cannot, there was no privacy interest in effect at the time police intercepted the conversations at issue. Thus, there is nothing to restore.</p>

Law enforcement officials should not be punished for their inability to predict the future holdings of this Court, especially where, as with <em>Brion, </em>a new decision represents such a drastic departure from past precedent. Furthermore, retroactive application of <em>Brion </em>would place a burden on the courts which would be forced to determine whether evidence which was obtained under constitutionally permissible circumstances should, in retrospect, be suppressed.</p>

Indeed, the evidence at issue undeniably enhances the truth seeking function, as the relevance of appellants’ inculpatory statements to the ultimate issues in the case is undeniable. Thus, retroactive application is not mandated.

Applying the <em>Blackwell </em>factors, this Court first determined that <em>Simmons </em>announced a new rule of law. <em>Cleveland, </em>547 Pa. at 413, <a href="/a2d/690/1146-01" class="citation" data-index="182" data-cite="690 A.2d 1146" data-case-ids="11926131,468712" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/1146-01,/pa/547/0402-01">690 A.2d at 1152</a>.
