On the same day G.C. was admitted to the emergency room, Northumberland County Children and Youth Services (CYS) received anonymous information indicating that G.C.’s injuries were a direct result of serious child abuse. This allegation was later confirmed by a CYS investigation and independent medical evidence. Five individuals were named by the anonymous source as possible perpetrators of the abuse; one of the named individuals was G.C.’s maternal grandfather, David Pursel.</p>

Quite to the contrary, the foster parents’ status reflects the Legislature’s conviction that if possible, a child should grow up with its parents. When under the Juvenile Act a child is found dependent, the court may transfer to the agency only “temporary legal custody” of the child. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(a)(2).

It is the foster parents’ responsibility to help to achieve these purposes — not to subvert them.

It is in the best interests of the child involved that all parties who have an interest in his welfare be heard by the juvenile court. "While returning a child to his natural parents remains an important goal, when a biological parent is unable to care for the child, society must rely upon available resources, including the foster parents, to fill the role and at times to become adoptive parents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">8</a> When a child’s parents are unable <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>to care for him, we should encourage foster families to provide nurturing and supportive homes, and one of the ways to accomplish this is to keep foster parents part of the solution, not to exclude them from custody decisions.</p>

The combined effort of all interested parties, whether they be the agency, the extended family or foster parents, is essential to decide what custody arrangement is best. Simply because a court grants a party standing to seek, or the right to contest, a determination pursuant to the Juvenile Act, does not mean that the court must grant that petitioner relief. <em>See Salemno, supra </em>(where this Court heard appeal of foster parents, but affirmed award of custody to natural mother).

Instead, it is simply my opinion that the statutory framework at issue — the Juvenile Act — unambiguously conveys to “any person,” including foster parents, the right to file a petition concerning their foster children. This clear grant, in combination with the intricate relationship among the best interests of the child, the liberty rights of the foster parents, and traditional notions of standing, compel me to depart from the Majority’s holding and to conclude that foster parents should have standing given the factual circumstance before us. Indeed, the very statutory language that the Majority cites in its opinion to support its conclusion that a foster parent’s relationship is “subordinate” refers to an agency removing a child <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>from foster care only under “appropriate” circumstances. <em>E.g., Crystal D.R., </em><a href="/pa-super/331/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="331 Pa.

It seems clear to me that the “appropriateness” of removing a child from a foster home can only be made after gathering all relevant information about the foster home and by hearing from all parties involved, including the foster parents. Thus, logic dictates that foster parents should have standing and a right to be heard before the court where the court is deciding the “appropriateness” of removing a child from the home of that foster family. Moreover, I believe that when confronted with matters dealing with the custody of children, we can never lose sight of the fact that these provisions should always concentrate on the best interests of the child. To deny standing to foster parents does not promote this guiding principle.</p>

The Supreme Court rejected the argument that the wrong parties brought suit because the State of New York had standing to sue. The Supreme Court noted that the pertinent analysis is whether the particular litigant has a sufficient stake in the action, not whether someone else also has standing or has a greater interest in the outcome of the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 2102.</p>

For example, the Federal Adoption Assistance and Safe Families Act of 1997 (1998 Amendments to the Social Security Act) focuses primarily upon the safety and well being of the child. This Act has veered away from requiring the states to promulgate regulations that attempt a reunification of the child with the family at all costs. <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20671" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 671">42 U.S.C. § 671</a>(a)(15), § 675. While the Federal guidelines keep reunification as <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>an important goal, the Act aims to speed up the adoption of foster children where reunification is not feasible by requiring more immediate permanency planning, including consideration of termination of parental rights. <em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20671" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 671">Id.</a> </em>The laws of most states, including the 1998 Amendments to Pennsylvania's juvenile and adoption statutes, now reflect this goal of speedier adoptions, with its emphasis on the welfare of the dependent child. The 1998 Pennsylvania Amendments continue to place as a primary objective the aim to "preserve the unity of the family whenever possible,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6301(b)(1) (1998 Amendments); however, the new Amendments allow the court to consider certain "aggravated circumstances,” which would mitigate against returning the dependent child to the biological family. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6302, 6334 (1998 Amendments).</p>
      <p id="Aqo" data-blocks='[["BL_209.3",209,[215,2059,1120,271]]]'>Legislation favoring more expeditious adoptions recognizes that many children in the foster care system can never be returned to their natural parents and spend years drifting from home to home. Such instability is emotionally harmful to the child. Thus, the shift of focus from one of reunification to one of permanency planning and adoption. <em>See also </em>Robert G.
