In <em>Spence, </em>the defendant was arrested and held in custody while awaiting trial on a capital murder charge. Prior to the commencement of trial, the Commonwealth filed a petition to extend the Rule 1100 rundate, which the trial court granted. Following his conviction, the defendant filed an appeal, claiming that the trial court erred by granting the Commonwealth’s petition to extend and that he was therefore entitled to have his charges dismissed. The defendant argued that the remedy of dismissal of the charges should be available to capital defendants who are not brought to trial within 180 days. In making this argument, the defendant rationalized that since Rule 1100’s remedy for failing to commence trial within 180 days is release on nominal bail and since bail is unavailable to capital defendants, the only possible remedy for capital defendants not tried -within 180 days was the dismissal of the charges. This Court rejected the defendant’s claim, holding that the remedy of the dismissal of the charges is only available to defendants who are not tried within 365 days of the filing of the criminal complaint.

Following the trial court’s grant of these continuances, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that he had not been brought to trial within the time requirements of Rule 1100.

In his Petition for Allowance of Appeal, Hill presented two issues, namely: 1) whether the Superior Court erred in determining that he was brought to trial within 365 days of his trial; and 2) whether the Superior Court erred in finding that the unavailability of bail renders the remedy of dismissal of the charges inapplicable to capital defendants. On May 18, 1998, this Court denied Hill’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal. Hill then filed a motion for reconsideration, raising only the first issue that he had presented in his petition. On August 18, <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>1998, this Court entered an order, granting the motion for reconsideration, vacating the denial of the petition and granting the petition. Thus, by way of the August 18, 1998 order, this Court granted review of both of the issues that Hill had presented in his petition. Despite the fact that this Court granted allocatur on both of the issues, Hill has failed to provide any arguments in support of the second issue. Accordingly, the second issue has been waived. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Applying our holding to these facts, the time between July 18, 1995 and March 11, 1996 does not constitute excludable time, even though Hill’s omnibus pretrial motion was pending throughout that period.
