At approximately 8:00 p.m. on February 12, 1992, eyewitnesses Jan McCoy and Tammy Stives smelled smoke as they walked down the street towards appellant’s property. They observed appellant, looking “nervous” and “fidgety,” exit a doorway which led from the second floor <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>of the building to the street. McCoy and Stives noted that it was 8:02 p.m. Shortly thereafter, they saw smoke coming from appellant’s property. At 8:05 p.m., an unidentified man triggered a nearby fire alarm.</p>

They estimated that the fire appeared to have been burning anywhere from fifteen to thirty minutes. Firefighters later determined that the fire originated on the second floor of the building where McCoy and Stives had seen appellant exiting, but, because of the extensive damage which extended to an adjacent property, they were not able to determine the fire’s cause.</p>

Police subsequently learned from further investigation that McCoy and Stives had observed appellant leaving the building just minutes before the fire became visible and, therefore, the officers arranged to interview appellant again. At the second interview, appellant initially reiterated his previous statement — that he had not been at the property on the evening in question. When an officer informed appellant that two eyewitnesses reported having seen him leave the building and get into his car, appellant stated that someone was lying and that his car was in the area only because he had eaten at a nearby restaurant.</p>

Corpus delicti, “the body of the crime,” is defined as “a wrong committed by criminal means, and consisting of the occurrence of a loss or injury, and some person’s criminal conduct as the source of that loss or injury.” <em>Commonwealth v. Ware, </em><a href="/pa/459/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="459 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="480994" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0334-01">459 Pa. 334</a>, 365, <a href="/pa/459/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="459 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="480994" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0334-01">329 A.2d 258</a>, 274 (1974). In essence, the corpus delicti rule requires that a criminal conviction may not be based upon the extra-judicial inculpatory statements of an accused unless circumstances demonstrating that criminal activity has occurred have first been established by independent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The purpose of the rule is to guard against a confession leading to a conviction where no crime has actually occurred. <em>Commonwealth v.

This Court, however, proceeded to draw a distinction between the level of proof needed in order to <em>introduce </em>a statement and the level of proof before the introduced statement can be <em>considered by the finder of fact </em>in assessing the defendant’s guilt. In sum, this Court held that the two-tiered approach setting forth two standards of proof as enunciated in <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/101/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="101 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="500855" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0380-01">101 Pa. 380</a>, 386 (1882) was still viable: a statement may be introduced once the Commonwealth establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that a crime has been committed (the corpus delicti) but the finder of fact cannot consider the statement in determining whether <em>the accused </em>committed the crime until the Commonwealth has established <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that the circumstances surrounding the alleged crime were more consistent with the loss having resulted from criminal activity than from non-criminal activity.</p>

One of the problems which arises is the practicality of having the jury, in a single proceeding, make an initial determination about whether the Commonwealth has established beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has occurred before it, at least theoretically, considers separately the defendant’s inculpatory extrajudicial statements as evidence. Although the trial court can instruct the jury how to proceed under these circumstances, the only <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>way to truly follow <em>Reyes </em>and ensure that a jury does not consider a defendant’s statements until after determining that the corpus delicti was proven beyond a reasonable doubt is to conduct a bifurcated trial or have two bodies of finders of fact. Under the bifurcated trial, the jury would first hear evidence about the corpus delicti and determine whether a crime occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, and only after reaching this initial verdict would they hear evidence of the defendant’s confession as proof that he had committed the crime at issue. <em>See </em>Thomas A. Mullen, “Rule Without Reason: Requiring Independent Proof of the Corpus Delicti as a Condition of Admitting an Extrajudicial Confession,” <a href="/citations/?q=27%20U.S.F.%20L.%20Rev.%20385" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="27 U.S.F. L. Rev. 385">27 U.S.F.L.Rev. 385</a>, 396 (1993). However, this approach would unduly complicate the judicial process and expend limited judicial resources. With respect to the latter solution, such a process would require that the trial court first find that the corpus delicti has been found beyond a reasonable doubt before the statement could be presented to the jury. This procedure, however, would unduly interfere with the jury’s role as finder of fact and should not be condoned.</p>

However, the current <em>Reyes </em>solution — that is, that the corpus delicti be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before considering the extrajudicial statements — has proven to be a problematic minority view, shared only by our sister state Louisiana. <em>See </em>Mullen, “Rule Without Reason,” 27 U.S.F.L.Rev. at 390 n. 30 (1993) (“Only two states currently require proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the corpus delicti: Louisiana ... and Pennsylvania”). There is no reason that justifies this undue complication of a two-tiered standard of proof. While states may differ on the level of proof required before a jury can consider the extrajudicial statements, “[i]t is generally held that the evidence other than <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>the defendant’s confession or admission is not required to be such as, independently of the confession or admission, establishes the corpus delicti or the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Corroboration of Extrajudicial Confessions or Admission, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20A.L.R.%202d%201316" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="45 A.L.R. 2d 1316">45 A.L.R.2d 1316</a>, *8 (1997).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
