    <p id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.7",71,[151,677,1155,902]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. Alec H. Cohen died testate on August 2, 1971. In his will, dated September 24, 1966, the decedent directed that his debts be paid; that his wife, Ruth S. Cohen, receive a bequest of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000); that Sol Berman be appointed trustee of his estate for the decedent’s minor children; and that the decedent’s daughter, Barbara S. Goodman, be appointed executrix of his estate. When the executrix filed the first and partial account on May 14, 1973, exceptions were filed by the decedent’s wife and the matter was heard by a master. After the master heard testimony, the decedent’s wife again filed exceptions, which were heard by the Orphans’ Court and an adjudication was made. The court reversed certain findings of the master and affirmed others. This appeal followed from the final decree of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b71-8" data-blocks='[["BL_71.8",71,[150,1609,1150,367]]]'>Appellant, Barbara S. Goodman, first argues that the court erred in reversing the decision of the master which held that a loan, in the amount of $25,000, made by the decedent in 1966, should be paid out of the assets of the estate proper, rather than from insurance policies <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that were assigned to the bank as collateral for the loan on September 7, 1966.

The loans that appellant sought to collect from the estate were made on October 13, 1966 and March 15, 1967, respectively. Appellant first gave notice of her claim on December 18, 1973, when the second account was filed more than six years after the loans were made. The court took the position that the statute of limitations barred the debts under the <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, No. 164, § 2, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3384, which provides:</p>

    <p id="b74-10" data-blocks='[["BL_74.11",74,[230,1517,1162,692]]]'>Appellant did nothing under the above section to toll the statute of limitations. Appellant argued that since she was the personal representative of the estate, she was required to do nothing since she would have been giving notice to herself, a fruitless act. We do not agree with appellant’s position. Section 3384 was designed to give all persons who have an interest in the estate notice of possible outstanding claims. While the letter of the act does not cover the situation in the instant case, the spirit of the law required that appellant give notice of her claim and her failure to do so bars her claim.

In the instant case the court below awarded $1,500 in counsel fees, as well as interest on estate funds that appellant used to pay the bank loan, rather than the proceeds of the insurance policies. Given our resolution that the proper funds to pay the bank loan was the corpus of the estate and not the insurance proceeds as decided by the court below, we reverse that portion of the decree awarding interest on such funds and further reverse the award of counsel fees as no substantial benefit as inured to the estate or beneficiaries as a result of the exceptants’ litigation.
