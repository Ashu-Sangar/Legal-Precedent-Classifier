On May 16, 1974, a jury returned a verdict of not guilty of resisting arrest and guilty of burglary and conspiracy. The court denied post-verdict motions and imposed a sentence of three to ten years imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed the judgments of sentence in a per curiam order. Appellant petitioned this Court for allowance of appeal contending that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to permit him to use an interpreter when he testified in his own behalf.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We agree, reverse the judgments of sentence, and remand for a new trial.</p>

The interpreter was present at all times during the trial. Before appellant took the stand, appellant’s counsel requested at side bar that appellant be permitted to testify in Spanish. He stated that, although appellant spoke some English, he might misunderstand questions because of the emotional strain of testifying. The court denied the request stating that the interpreter would be permitted to <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>aid appellant with particular questions if the court deemed it necessary. Thus, although the interpreter sat near appellant during appellant’s testimony and although he aided appellant with particular words and phrases on eight occasions, appellant was required to testify without the use of the interpreter. This, appellant contends, denied him his fundamental right to testify effectively in his own behalf.</p>

In his opinion denying post-verdict motions, the trial judge stated that using the interpreter would have caused “unnecessary delay.” In fact, appellant’s testimony would have been expedited by using the interpreter, who was present at the time appellant testified, because the long delays caused by appellant’s lack of understanding would have been avoided.</p>
      <p id="b90-7" data-blocks='[["BL_90.8",90,[322,1925,1123,455]]]'>The Commonwealth now argues in its brief that the trial court’s ruling was necessary to allow for proper cross-examination. The use of an interpreter when not required, it argues, gives appellant an extra few seconds to think over his answers. This argument must fail for at least three reasons. First, the Commonwealth cannot now argue a position it abandoned at trial, when it joined in the request for use of the interpreter. Second, it ignores the record, which establishes appellant’s need for an interpreter. Third, the jury must determine the credibility of the defendant, based on his actions throughout the trial, and if he attempted to use such deception it would most probably be apparent to them.</p>

I agree with the conclusion of the majority that due process requires that a defendant, who is incapable of communicating to the court and defense counsel in the English language, have access to an interpreter to assist such a defendant in understanding the proceedings and to assist in his defense. <em>United States ex rel. Negron v. State of N.Y., </em><a href="/citations/?q=434%20A.2d%20386" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="434 A.2d 386">434 A.2d 386</a> (1970). In <em>Negron </em>the defendant spoke no English, <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>and had just recently arrived in this country for his second visit shortly before the homicide of which he was convicted. Moreover, the Suffolk County Court in New York did not appoint a court interpreter to assist the defendant Negron.</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[295,616,1162,807]]]'>In the instant case, appellant was a ten-year resident of the United States and demonstrated a sufficient command of the English language to comprehend the nature of the proceedings and to assist defense counsel. Unlike <em>Negron, supra, </em>a court interpreter was present and permitted to assist appellant whenever he or his attorney re-, quested such help and, in fact, appellant consulted the interpreter eight times during his testimony. Moreover, appellant’s testimony on direct examination, while not phrased in grammatically proper sentences, reveals an understanding of the questions and the effect of his answers. In contrast to appellant’s short answers on cross-examination, appellant’s direct examination reveals a narrative chronology of the events surrounding the burglary.</p>
    <p id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.6",92,[292,1445,1157,308]]]'>Given the confusing nature of translated testimony to the jury, I am of the opinion that an appellate court should not overturn a ruling of a trial judge absent an abuse of discretion. In the facts of the instant case, I find no abuse of discretion and would affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>
