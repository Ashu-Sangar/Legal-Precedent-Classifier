By the terms of his will, dated January 31, 1961, two of the children, Rachel Kimble Yarnall and Jesse Hibbard Yarnall, were appointed executors of the decedent’s estate which included a farm of approximately eighty-one acres in Londonderry Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Under Item III of the will, Edson Booth Yarnall, another child of the decedent, was granted an option to purchase the farm property:</p>

On May 15, 1974, the inheritance tax appraiser for Chester County filed an appraisement which valued the farm at $125,000. One of the executors objected to the latter appraisement and filed a protest with the Department of Revenue pursuant to section <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>1001 of the Inheritance Tax Act, Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, 72 P.S. § 2485-1001. A hearing was then held before the Inheritance Tax Protest Board which rejected the appraisal of the inheritance tax appraiser and determined that the value of the farm, for inheritance tax purposes, was $81,000. Within twenty days of this decision, Edson Booth Yarnall notified the executors of his desire to exercise his option to purchase the property.</p>

Paisley, issue of the decedent and residuary legatees and devisees under the terms of the will, appealed to the Orphans’ Court of Chester County. They requested in their petition that the court set aside the findings of the Board and affirm the value established by the inheritance tax appraiser. The Honorable John M. Kurtz, Jr., by decree dated January 20, 1975, dismissed the petition and sustained the appraisal of the Inheritance Tax Protest Board. <em>See Yarnall Estate, </em>25 Fid.Rep. 151 (C.P.

Nor do they argue that the appraisal of the inheritance tax appraiser constitutes a more just valuation of the property.

Thereafter, Davis properly exercised his option but his offer of $24,000 was refused by Hileman and Goulstone, the two executors, who claimed the price was inadequate.

Our duty in this undertaking is to ascertain, if possible, the intent of the testator from a consideration of <em>all </em>the language contained in the four corners of the will. <em>Hill Estate, </em><a href="/pa/432/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="432 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1919674" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0269-01">432 Pa. 269</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20606" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="247 A.2d 606">247 A.2d 606</a> (1968). It is clear, from the will, that testator intended to favor his son, Edson Booth Yarnall, with an option to purchase the Londonderry farm, while the residue of the estate fell to his surviving issue, per stirpes. The option, itself, was stated in these terms:</p>
    <blockquote id="b144-6" data-blocks='[["BL_144.7",144,[294,1950,1112,260]]]'>“I hereby direct that my said son shall have the opportunity of purchasing [the farm] at the price set for Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance Tax purposes within twenty (20) days after said appraisement is made by the Inheritance Tax appraiser.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[141,431,1154,1240]]]'>The will clearly states that the option price is to be that set for Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance Tax purposes, but it does not provide, in so many words, that that price is to be finally determined by the inheritance tax appraiser. Testator did not identify the appraiser by name in his will or otherwise demonstrate reliance on the appraisal of a particular individual, as was shown in <em>Breisch Estate, supra. </em>Indeed, at the time the will was executed testator could not have known who the “Inheritance Tax appraiser” would be at his death. Furthermore, the testator did not attempt to insure a just and fair valuation which would satisfy both the optionee and himself. <em>See Meyers Estate, supra. </em>Participation of the executors and the optionee in the selection of the appraiser was not provided for and confidence in the result to be reached by the inheritance tax appraiser was not expressed. The conclusion is inescapable that the testator left the decision as to the finality of the inheritance tax appraiser’s valuation in the hands of the interested parties. The appeal taken to the Protest Board was not foreclosed by the will and the Board’s reappraisal of the farm is properly the option price under the terms of the will.</p>

On this appeal, appellants contend that the optionee forfeited his option to purchase by failing to notify the executors of his desire to purchase the farm within twenty days after the appraisement was made by the inheritance tax appraiser. We have already decided, however, that the testator did not intend that the inheritance tax appraiser settle, conclusively, the value of the real estate for purposes of the Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance Tax. He allowed for appeal and obviously intended that notice be given after the price was settled.

Nor can I agree that the 20 day post-appraisement period for exercising the option was “obviously intended” to include the period following the decision of the Protest Board. (Opinion of the Court, ante at 926). Certainly it can be argued with some degree of plausibility that the inheritance tax “appraiser”, as referred to by the testator, is a person distinct from the Protest Board or any other tribunal which may review the appraisal valuation, and is known to be distinct by anyone with a minimal experience in such matters.</p>

Stated another way, the term “inheritance tax appraiser” could as well refer to the entire machinery or process for determining the tax as to a single official in the process. In the absence of any extrinsic evidence to the contrary, it seems to me more reasonable to conclude that, had he thought about it, the testator would have intended the tax appraisal as finally determined to be the figure which should govern. Such a final figure would be the one which would return a fair value to the estate if the option were exercised, and at the same time would be a figure which would neither bestow a windfall upon nor exact a penalty from the optionee, depending upon whether the initial appraisal figure was low or high.</p>
