The Commonwealth Court believed that a possible conflict could arise if it directed enforcement in accord with the original terms of the order and the order was subsequently modified by the EHB. The court suggested that modification of the original order could serve as a defense in any contempt proceeding. 23 Pa.Cmwlth. at 390, n. 4, <a href="/citations/?q=352%20A.2d%20565" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="352 A.2d 565">352 A.2d 565</a> n. 4. No such conflict need arise, however, as the Commonwealth Court can frame its enforcement decree so as to take into account the possibility that the consent order may be modified. Assuming the court fails to do so, the better course would be to seek modification of its decree, rather than risk a contempt citation.
