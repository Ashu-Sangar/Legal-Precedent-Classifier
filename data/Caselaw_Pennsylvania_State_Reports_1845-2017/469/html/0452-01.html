Hazel was the duly elected district justice of the peace. His term of office was to expire January 5, 1976. As a consequence of this expiration date, and without regard to any vacancy in the office, the process of electing a district justice of the peace was set in motion on February 18, 1975.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> By letter of that date, the Secretary of the Commonwealth notified the Delaware County Board of Elections that the office was to be filled at the November 5, 1975, municipal election and that each eligible party was to select its nominee at the May 20, 1975, primary election. On or about March 5, 1975, relator filed the necessary petitions to become a candidate for the office in question on both the Republican and Democratic primary ballots. On March 10, 1975, respondent also cross-filed nominating petitions for that office. On the same day, March 10, 1975, Frank T. Hazel, the incumbent, resigned his commission.</p>

The Governor forwarded the nomination to the Senate for confir<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>mation. The primary election was held, resulting in the nomination of relator as the Republican Party candidate and of respondent as the Democratic Party candidate. On June 2, 1975, the Senate confirmed the appointment, and on June 24, 1975, respondent assumed the office of district justice of the peace. On June 24, 1975, relator filed a complaint in quo warranto in the Supreme Court, seeking to have the appointment of respondent declared invalid. On September 25, 1975, we filed a per curiam order dismissing the complaint without prejudice on the ground that it was premature.</p>

We disagree. Such a construction would seriously distort the constitutional scheme embodied in section 13 because it would allow the election machinery to be halted a few days or weeks prior to the municipal election. An incumbent, sensing defeat in the upcoming municipal election, could resign just prior to the municipal election, could be appointed to fill the vacancy for a term “ending on the first Monday of January following the next municipal election more than ten months after the vacancy occurs,” and could, thus, avoid facing the voters for two more years. Indeed, respondent’s interpretation, if carried to its logical extreme, would allow an incumbent, after losing an election but before expiration of his term, to resign and be appointed, thereby voiding an already completed election. Thus, respondent’s reading of section 13(b) would ignore the mandate found in section 13(a). Such was certainly not the intention of the framers of the Judiciary Article nor of the voters who adopted it.</p>
