    <p id="b199-7" data-blocks='[["BL_199.8",199,[137,786,1155,478]]]'>This appeal arises from a final decree in equity which dismissed the complaint of appellant, Richard Jones, who sought an accounting from appellee, the New Pittsburgh Courier Publishing Company (the “New Courier”). Appellant is the court-appointed receiver of Pittsburgh Liquidating Corporation, formerly the Pittsburgh Courier Publishing Company (the “Old Courier”). In 1966, the Old Courier sold the New Courier all of its assets for fifty percent of the New Courier’s profits until 1976.</p>
    <p id="b199-8" data-blocks='[["BL_199.9",199,[137,1294,1152,692]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. The Old Courier, a prominent black newspaper, had serious financial problems. Out of a total debt of over one million dollars, the newspaper owed the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) more than one hundred thousand dollars in unpaid taxes by 1966. Pursuant to the collection provisions of the Internal Revenue Code <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">
        <em>1</em>
      </a>
      <em>, </em>the IRS obtained liens on all of the Old Courier’s assets and was preparing to sell all of the assets to collect part of the unpaid tax bill. At the urging of members of the black community, the IRS agreed to postpone the sale so that a plan could be arranged that would allow the paper to continue operating.</p>

The assets transferred to the New Courier remained encumbered by the IRS liens. The New Courier agreed to supply periodic financial reports to the IRS, as the fifty percent interest in future profits would first be used to pay the tax debt of Pittsburgh Liquidating.</p>
    <p id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[287,767,1156,258]]]'>The New Courier, however, failed to make a profit during its early existence.

On December 17, 1968, the IRS levied on all encumbered assets and left a Notice of Seizure at the office of the New Courier. One of the assets was described in the Notice of Seizure as:</p>

    <p id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.8",204,[250,876,1167,858]]]'>In sustaining the validity of the federal tax sale, the chancellor found that the Internal Revenue Service had complied with the notice requirements of section 6335(a) and (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Despite the finding of the chancellor, which was affirmed by the court en banc, the majority reverses the decree because it concludes that the Internal Revenue Service failed to comply with the mandatory notice of seizure requirement of section 6335(a). The majority decides as a matter of law that appellant was entitled to notice of seizure. It then concludes that appellant did not receive notice, a finding properly for the fact-finding court. Although the chancellor found that the notice requirements were fully complied with, he made no specific findings with respect to who was entitled to notice of seizure or whether notice was received by the proper party.</p>
    <p id="b204-7" data-blocks='[["BL_204.9",204,[247,1755,1159,314]]]'>Because of the inconclusiveness of the record, I would vacate the decree and remand for further proceedings on the notice of seizure issue. On remand, appellee should also be permitted to litigate those defenses which were offered but not resolved by the chancellor during the initial proceeding challenging the validity of the tax sale.</p>
