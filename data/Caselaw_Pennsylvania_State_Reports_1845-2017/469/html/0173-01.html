I ask that his argument be denied as without merit. As you know, Section 9.1 of the Human Relations Act authorizes the Commission to proceed in a Common Pleas Court when in a housing case the housing under question threatens to be disposed of before the Commission has an opportunity to complete its processes of investigation, consultations and public hearing so in order to render the property in question still existent, in order not to have the case be rendered moot, the legislature provided in Section 9.1 for going into Common Pleas Court. It’s true we went into Common Pleas Court to seek that injunction. The Common Pleas Court denied it. By no means does the act indicate that when you go into Common Pleas Court and seek an injunction you thereby do so at the peril of having your case thrown out of Court if the Common Pleas Judge in his discretion . . . elects not to grant the injunction.</blockquote>

Thereafter, Mr. Wilson, as the zoning board’s solicitor, advised the board in legal matters concerning appellants’ case.”</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b226-6" data-blocks='[["BL_226.7",226,[312,1161,1118,636]]]'>“In the case at bar, ... we are presented with a governmental body charged with certain decision-making functions that must avoid the appearance of possible prejudice, be it from its members or from those who advise it or represent parties before it.

While no prejudice has been shown by this conflict of interest, it is our opinion that such a procedure is susceptible to prejudice and, therefore, must be prohibited.”</blockquote>

It is clear that <em>Horn </em>describes a situation which is completely different than that encountered in this case. In <em>Horn </em>the attorney involved was: (1) making objections to the evidence offered by his opponent, and then ruling on his own objections; (2) offering evidence to which his opponent objected and then ruling on the objection to his proffered evidence; and (3) advising the hearing panel concerning the law during the post-hearing process of deciding the merits of his opponent’s case. In this case, PHRC’s gen<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>eral counsel argued the merits of motions made by his opponent and asked that they be denied. So far as the record shows, and it is clear that counsel for the Feesers would have objected had the record not accurately reflected what transpired at the hearing, there was no consultation between PHRC’s counsel and the hearing panel. Each motion was decided by the panel on the basis of the arguments presented by both counsel in open session.</p>
