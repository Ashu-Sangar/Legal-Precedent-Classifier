In that court’s view, the gravamen of the complaint was that meter maids, because of their sex, were denied the same employment benefits enjoyed by police officers. Accordingly, the court reasoned, the propriety of the Commission’s order turned on whether the complainants were in fact serving in the capacity of police officers and thus deserving of equal treatment. The court concluded that complainants do not perform those functions commonly associated with the responsibilities of a police officer. It held, accordingly, that the complaint was without merit. In addi<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>tion, the court held that the Commission could not, in the instant proceeding, declare the meter maid ordinance to be null and void because the complainants, as beneficiaries of the ordinance, lacked standing to contest its legality.

The central premise upon which the complaint rests is that the meter maids are, in truth, police officers. If this premise has not been established then it follows that complainants have demonstrated no entitlement to a police officer’s employment benefits; the mere fact that a newly established non-police position has been assigned exclusively to females would not be an adequate ground to bestow upon those female employees the attributes of employment which are enjoyed by police officers.</p>

      <em> As </em>Judge Rogers put it in his opinion for a unanimous Commonwealth Court, “the title of policeman [may] be properly applied to one who performs services critical to public safety in the investigation and detection of serious <em>crimes </em>— a person trained, equipped (with . gun, handcuffs, badge of office and motor vehicles) and actually engaged in the detection of persons suspected of crime.” <em>Beaver Falls City Council et al., v.

The primary responsibility of the meter patrol officer, in contrast, is to ticket those automobiles which are found to be parked overtime at parking meters. Although they are sometimes asked to look out for stolen vehicles and have, on occasion, assisted in the transportation of female prisoners, meter maids are in no way trained or equipped to engage in the investigation of persons suspected of committing serious offenses. The fact that meter maids do enforce the city’s parking ordinances does not convert them to police officers. In <em>McNitt v. Philadelphia, supra, </em>we considered whether a fire marshall who was responsible for the investigation of possible arson offenses may, for that reason, be said to be a police officer. We observed that “fire marshalls, mine inspectors, factory inspectors, boiler inspectors, and milk inspectors are all charged with law enforcement duties, but they help enforce laws affecting only <em>special </em>subjects, while a policeman’s duty is the enforcement of <em>all laws </em>whose violation affects the peace and good order of the Community.” <em>Id., </em><a href="/pa/325/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="325 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="1172301" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0073-01">325 Pa. at 76</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=189%20A.%20300" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="189 A. 300">189 A. at 301</a>. On this basis we concluded in <em>McNitt </em>that fire marshalls are not policemen. For like reason, meter maids cannot be considered police officers simply because they are engaged in the enforcement of a limited, specialized type of traffic regulation.</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[232,2056,1162,318]],["BL_569.1",569,[152,333,1157,591]]]'>The Commission, however, urges that the complaint was not bottomed on the contention that the complainants were police officers; it concedes that “Beaver Falls could have created the lower-status meter patrol officer position to perform duties previously performed by patrolmen if the new positions were in fact, as well as on <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>their face, sex neutral.” (Appellant’s brief at 12). The Commission contends that the Commonwealth Court misperceived the problem and it urges that we direct our attention to the discriminatory nature of the meter maid ordinance. The Commission argues that the ordinance as written impliedly limits employment opportunities for women on the Beaver Falls police department and was designed to preclude women from employment on the all male force. In essence the Commission portrays the ordinance as an extension of preexisting discriminatory hiring policies of the police department.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[156,947,1154,530]]]'>The simple answer to the Commission’s assertion is that the complainants have not alleged that they were denied employment on the Beaver Falls police force. Indeed, neither Morrell nor McConahy ever applied for employment as a police officer nor did they seek by their complaint to be installed in such a position. Rather they seek to elevate their <em>current </em>jobs to the status of police officer and thereby attain the attendant benefits. For the reasons stated above, the complainants are not entitled to such relief.</p>

Although the impact of that ordinance on female employment opportunities is facially beneficial, the Commission asserts that the enactment serves to discriminate against women. It attempts to analogize the ordinance to those protective statutes which have been enacted to insulate women from physically demanding jobs,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> unwholesome employment atmospheres <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> or like requirements or conditions of employment which legislators have misguidedly perceived as having a deleterious effect <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>on women. While the Commission quite correctly points out that women have successfully attacked such statutes under the applicable fair employment laws, its argument overlooks the vital distinction between protective statutes and the ordinance here in question.</p>
    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[254,646,1157,974]]]'>Protective statutes impose legal limitations on the type of work which a woman may be allowed to do, regardless of individual qualifications or capabilities. These restrictions are based on stereotypic assumptions about female workers as a class and as a result may be attacked by members of that class. The Beaver Falls ordinance, however, in no way serves to restrict the employment opportunities of the female worker. It does not preclude a woman from applying to the police department for employment as a police officer and it does not restrict the scope of responsibilities which a woman could assume were she hired for that position. The arguable taint of the ordinance lies in its expressed exclusion of males. There was, however, no male complainant before the Commission who sought redress of this wrong. Thus the Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that the viability of the ordinance under § 5(a) of the PHRA was not properly in issue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Rather, we have here an attempt by a city to economize by severing from the police department certain functions once within the scope of its operations by the creation of a new job category which <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>has been made available to women only.

In reaching its conclusion, the Commission compared the terms, conditions and privileges of employment of meter maids and police officers. The Commission found that although there were some differences in their duties and responsibilities, there were sufficient similarities to justify the comparison.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Although meter maids are not by law members of the police force, the Commission found that they are “de facto” members of the police department. Meter maids’ duties have essentially consisted of patrolling parking meters and writing tickets for parking violations. However, meter maids have occasionally performed other police duties, including searching of female prisoners, aiding in the escort of female prisoners to prison or female patients to hospitals, directing traffic, observing for stolen cars, and apprehending runaway children. Although complainants do not generally perform the same duties or responsibilities as police officers, the Commission determined that male patrolmen sometimes perform the same tasks as meter maids.</p>

The Commission ordered the city to create two positions on the police force for “meter patrol officers” with duties identical to those of meter maids and to hire complainants to fill these positions. These officers were to be given “full civil service status.” Meter patrol officers were to be entitled to the same working hours as police officers and were to receive overtime pay and vacation leave on the same basis as others on the force. The order further provides that the salary paid the new meter patrol officers be increased by the same percentage that the salary of the lowest paid patrolman on the force had increased between 1966 and the date of the order.

To this end the section outlaws such policies and stands as a guarantee that a woman’s qualifications for the position she seeks will be evaluated with neutral objectivity. This statutory imposition of neutral employment requirements does not in itself, however, assure equal opportunities to the victims of past discriminatory practices; such persons still remain shackled by the already suffered deprivations of seniority rights, access to training programs, promotions and the like. Occasionally, a facially neutral employment policy incorporates as a criterion for employment a qualification which a fe<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>male has been precluded from attaining by virtue of an abandoned discriminatory policy. <em>In such an instance the impact of the past discriminatory practices is perpetuated and the former victim is deprived of equal employment opportunity just as surely as if she were the current object of an overt discriminatory </em>practice(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>

If the City Council of Beaver Falls intended to perpetuate a policy of an all-male police force by creating a “special” meter maid position for “women only,” they have effectively done it in this case. The majority opinion advises the council that if its new “position” is good enough to attract women and to keep them in their place, then so long as the women do not apply for jobs on the police force, the system is protected.
