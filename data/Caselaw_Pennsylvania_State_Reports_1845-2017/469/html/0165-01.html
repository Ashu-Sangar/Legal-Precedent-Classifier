Apart from the fact that it is not entirely clear from the record whether the agreement alleged by the wife to have been made was in writing, this particular statute of frauds is not a bar to suit; it is a defense upon which a party may, if he chooses, rely, but which he may elect to forego and which is therefore waived if not raised in a responsive pleading such as an answér, or a reply to new matter.
