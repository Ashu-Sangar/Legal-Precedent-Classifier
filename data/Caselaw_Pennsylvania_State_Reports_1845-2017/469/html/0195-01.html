The Commonwealth produced evidence at trial to establish that Stanley Hoss, then an inmate at the Western Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh, in concert with several other inmates lured the victim Walter Peterson, a captain of the correctional officers at the institution, into the basement recreation area of the prison and viciously murdered him. The testimony indicated that Captain Peterson was restrained while he was being punched, struck repeatedly with chairs about the head and slashed with razors to an extent that when other guards were able to gain entrance into the area, Peterson had been completely mutilated and “looked like a piece of raw meat.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The entire incident was witnessed by another guard who was in the observation area adjacent to the recreation area and separated by iron bars.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Death resulted from the multiple injuries of the scalp, face and upper neck area.

See <em>Commonwealth v. Hoss, supra. </em>As has been indicated, the bulk of the publicity associated with the incident occurred within ten days of the event.

Immediately upon their selection, the jurors were sequestered and thus isolated from any publicity that might have occurred during the trial. The trial court was also extremely liberal in his rulings on challenges for cause and the allowance of jurors to be excused by agreement.

Defense counsel challenged the juror for cause, which the court refused. Defense counsel did not use a peremptory challenge to disqualify the juror. As counsel did not appeal the denial of his challenge for cause, I do not reach the merits of the trial court’s ruling.</p>
