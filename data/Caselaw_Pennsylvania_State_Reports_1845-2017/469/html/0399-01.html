The record discloses that Catherine Johnson and her husband, Carl, were closing their pharmacy at approximately 8:30 p. m. when appellant approached them. Carl Johnson was carrying an attache case containing the daily receipts from the pharmacy. An altercation ensued between the appellant and the Johnsons in which appellant attempted to snatch the attache case from Mr. Johnson’s hands. During the resulting struggle appellant stabbed Mrs. Johnson three times. She died later that evening.</p>

He contended that he frequently purchased drugs from the Johnsons without a prescription, and that in this instance he was merely returning to the store to pick up some barbiturates purchased earlier that day. According to appellant, when he asked for his pills, Carl Johnson stated that they were locked in the attache case. In order to retrieve the pills, appellant attempted to take the case from Mr. Johnson which precipitated the strug<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>gle.
