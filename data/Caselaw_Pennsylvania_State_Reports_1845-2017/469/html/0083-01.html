The officers could see that Jones was bleeding and therefore transferred him to a nearby hospital. Jones died on February 18, 1973, of complications resulting from two gunshot wounds of the body.

Upon arriving at the hospital Detective Reice learned that the victim was unconscious and in critical condition and that he could not be interviewed. Subsequently, Detective Culbreth, also of the Philadelphia Police Department, went to the hospital, arriving at <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>approximately 9:15 a.m., January 27, 1973.

Police arrived at the scene less than thirty minutes after the shooting, and discovered decedent on the floor near his bed moaning and bleeding from a neck wound. The investigating officer testified that, in response to his inquiry as to what happened, the decedent stated “I was shot by Jim Dandy [appellant].” The victim was then rushed to the hospital where, five and one-half hours later, he died from the gunshot wound.

Furthermore, the utterance was anything but spontaneous.

This we decline to do. Nothing in declarant’s statement indicates any sense of impending death, and furthermore, the evidence presented by the prosecution showed that the wounds that the decedent had suffered did not normally result in death.
