At trial Mrs. Hamilton, the widow of the victim, testified that, shortly after the argument had ended and her husband, Leon, was passing the Turner home on the way to his parked car, he was physically attacked by Geary Turner. Appellant’s brother, William Turner, and the Hamilton’s son, Leon, Jr., joined the fight. Both Mrs. Hamilton and her son testified that Leon Hamilton had no weapon at the time of these events. Both also testified that they saw appellant himself strike the victim several times. A neighbor, Mr. Spalding, testified that he saw appellant strike Leon, Sr. directly between the eyes with a baby cart wheel still attached to its axle, a blow which knocked the victim unconscious. After being thus felled, Mr. Hamilton was taken to the hospital, where he died several days later without having regained consciousness.</p>

Both claimed that Leon, Sr., while engaged in fighting Geary Turner, had “pulled” a knife, and it was only then that William Turner had knocked Leon down, causing Leon to hit his head sharply on the curbstone as he fell. In the defense version of the fracas, it was this blow by William which ended the fighting; the victim never regained consciousness after hitting the curb.</p>

Where the record on appeal clearly shows that there could have been no reasonable basis for a damaging decision or omission by trial counsel, then of course the judgment must be vacated and appropriate relief, such as allowing the filing of post trial motions or the ordering of a new trial, granted.<a class="footnotemark">5</a> Where, on the other hand, it is impossible to tell from the record whether or not the action of trial counsel could have had a rational basis, the appellate court will vacate the judgment, at least for the time being, and remand for an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel may state his reasons for having chosen the course of action taken.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">6</a> Neither of these remedies, however, is appropriate if from the record it is apparent that the actions claimed to constitute ineffectiveness were in fact within the realm of trial tactics or strategy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">7</a> A finding of ineffectiveness of counsel cannot be made “unless we con [elude] that the alternatives not chosen offered a potential for success substantially greater than the tactics actually utilized.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

      <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>It was no part of the defense in this case to dispute that the victim died of head injuries; the defense was merely that William Turner, and not Geary Turner, the appellant, had struck the blow which caused those head injuries. Thus the decision of counsel to stipulate to the medical report was fully in accord with the defense theory. Indeed, the admission of the report rather than the presentation of the live testimony of the doctor who prepared it may well have been advantageous to the appellant. On its face, the report did no more than list the physical findings on which the conclusion as to the cause of death was based and to conclude that that cause was craniocerebral injuries. Had the doctor testified in person, he could have been examined by the prosecution as to whether the injuries the doctors had observed could have been inflicted, as the defense asserted, by the victim hitting a curbstone in a fall from a standing position. Without such evidence, the outcome of the case turned solely on the credibility of the two sets of witnesses as to how the last blow suffered by the victim had been inflicted. Even now appellant does not argue that any testimony which might have been given by the physician would have supported his version of the victim’s death in any respect or that any later injury caused that death. The bare assertion at this time that the calling of this witness would have “offered a potential for success substantially greater than the tactics actually utilized” is insufficient to justify a remand for an evidentiary hearing on this point.</p>
