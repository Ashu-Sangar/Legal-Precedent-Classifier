Utilizing a factual analysis the Court held that the mere fact that the case involved a black defendant and a white victim did not suggest a significant likelihood that racial prejudice might infect the trial, and therefore the need to question prospective jurors specifically about racial prejudice did not rise to constitutional dimension.</p>
