The defendants also filed a complaint against additional defendants, who then filed an answer and new matter raising the statute of limitations as a defense. The plaintiff replied to this new matter and admitted that the “issue and hold” instructions had been given to the prothonotary.

Thus, in the instant case, it is clear that if appellant validly commenced her action so as to toll the running of the statute when she filed her praecipe on August 28, 1969, her action is not barred by the statute of limitations, since she effectuated service of a writ reissued well within two years from both the date when she filed her original praecipe in August and the date <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>when she had the writ reissued the following April. The trial court, however, in sustaining appellees’ preliminary-objections held that appellant nullified her apparent commencement of the action by the “issue and hold” instructions her attorney gave the prothonotary, since these instructions had the deliberate effect of frustrating timely notice to appellees that an action had been brought against them.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[265,789,1159,1262]]]'>We note that it has become a relatively common practice throughout the Commonwealth for attorneys to file a praecipe with the prothonotary to toll the statute of limitations but then, whether because settlement negotiations are in progress or because more time is needed to prepare the case, to delay or prevent service upon the defendant. Depending upon the process obtaining in a particular county, this can be accomplished by instructing either the prothonotary or the sheriff to hold the writ, by personally retaining the writ and not delivering it to the sheriff for service, or by neglecting to pay the sheriff his fee. It is clear that the various courts which have been presented with the question have reflected a wide division over whether such action, or inaction, on the part of the plaintiff should be deemed to nullify the effect of the original filing.

Appellant in the instant case filed her praecipe with “issue and hold” instructions on August 28, 1969. For the reason stated above, We believe appellant and her attorney were entitled to rely on <em>Peterson </em>for the proposition that the mere filing of the praecipe in trespass, even if the plaintiff deliberately delayed service, was sufficient to toll the running of the statute of limitations for an additional two-year period. Since she subsequently effectuated service well within this additional period, she is consequently not barred by the statute of limitations from pursuing her action. This, however, does Pot preclude relief to appellees under the non-pros doctrine if the trial court should find, after an appropriate hearing, that appellant unreasonably delayed the prosecution of her action and that appellees were prejudiced thereby.
