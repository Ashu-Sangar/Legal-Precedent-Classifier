The plaintiff, Boldt Machinery &amp; Tools, Inc. [hereinafter “Boldt”] is a seller and distributor of industrial machinery and tools (lathes, drill presses, etc.) in an area comprised of western Pennsylvania, southwestern New York, and eastern Ohio. The defendant, Glenn Wallace, was employed by Boldt as a salesman in 1959 and was assigned a sales territory composed of portions of northwestern Pennsylvania and southwestern New York. On February 9, 1973, Wallace voluntarily terminated his employment. A contract entered into by the parties at the time Wallace was hired by Boldt contained a clause (paragraph 24) which provided:</p>

Boldt contends that Wallace’s activities on behalf of Tri-State constitute a <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>breach of the restrictive covenant contained in paragraph 24, <em>supra, </em>of the contract between the parties. The chancellor agreed, and enjoined Wallace “from directly or indirectly selling or attempting to sell or distributing or attempting to distribute any items regularly sold by the plaintiff in the western Pennsylvania, southwestern New York and eastern Ohio areas for a period of five years from the date of this Order, even though the items he sells may be of different quality or purchase price than those sold by the plaintiff.” Exceptions to the chancellor’s adjudication were dismissed by a court en banc, and this appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">2</a> In this Court Wallace argues that he has not violated paragraph 24, and that, in any event, the restrictive covenant contained in that paragraph is unenforceable as an impermissible restraint on trade.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[278,1223,1165,801]]]'>(1) Wallace first argues that he has not breached his promise to refrain from competing with his former employer. He contends that, as used in paragraph 24, the term “items” means “the same items”, i. e., machinery of the same make and model as machinery he sold for Boldt, and that the machinery he is now selling for Tri-State is “more expensive, much larger and performs a completely different function than the machinery he formerly sold. .” (Appellant’s brief, p. 6). The chancellor read the term “items” more broadly, however, construing it to mean “similar items” or all machinery in competition with the machinery which Wallace sold for Boldt; he found that some of the machinery Wallace now sells, without specifying which, is competitive with machinery he formerly sold.</p>
    <p id="b551-3" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[175,321,1152,1348]]]'>
      <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a> We agree with the chancellor that appellant’s interpretation of the term “items” is too narrow. Paragraph 24 is to be interpreted in light of its obvious purpose, the protection of Boldt against a loss of customers and business as a result of Wallace’s efforts on behalf of another seller of industrial machinery. <em>Bangor Peerless Slate Co. v. Bangor Slate Co., </em><a href="/pa/270/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="270 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1066050" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0161-01">270 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%20190" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="113 A. 190">113 A. 190</a> (1921); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 228 &amp; Comment <em>c </em>(Tent.Draft No. 5, 1970); Restatement of Contracts § 236 (1932).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> So viewed, the words “any items regularly sold by [Boldt] ” must be read as relating to any machinery which is competitive with the machinery regularly sold by Boldt, rather than items which are identically and completely alike. At trial, Boldt offered evidence that it and Tri-State sold some of the same brands of machinery and solicited many of the same customers, and that Tri-State had taken accounts from Boldt in the past. Wallace himself admitted that he was now calling on some of the same customers he had solicited for Boldt, and that he was now selling some of the same “small tools” he had sold for Boldt. Our review of the record satisfies us that there was ample evidentiary support for the chancellor’s finding that some of the machinery Wallace now sells is in competition with machinery he sold formerly.</p>

A post-employment restraint on competition is enforceable if it is ancillary to an employment relationship between the parties, is designed to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer, and is reasonably limited in duration and area. <em>Sidco Paper Co. v.

But this argument is based upon too restrictive a view of the interests an employer may legitimately seek to protect by means of such restraints. As we recently iterated, an employer has a protectible interest in the customer goodwill developed by its employees. <em>Sidco Paper Company v. Aaron, <a href="/pa/465/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="465 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1712666" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0586-01">supra </a></em><a href="/pa/465/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="465 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1712666" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0586-01">at 591-594</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="465 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1712666" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0586-01">351 A.2d at 252-54</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The instant record contains evidence that while he was employed by Boldt, Wallace regularly had direct, personal contact with Boldt’s customers at the customers’ places of business, that this contact was an important element in making sales of machinery, and that Wallace’s calls on the trade constituted <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>the only contact between Boldt and many, although not all, of its customers in Wallace’s sales territory. We are satisfied that the chancellor was justified in concluding that paragraph 24 protects Boldt’s interest in customer relationships developed by Wallace. The absence of a formal specialized training given to Wallace does not deprive this interest of protectibility.</p>
    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[204,737,1149,633]]]'>Wallace also attacks the duration of the restraint as too long and the area within which competition is prohibited as too widespread. The reasonableness of the temporal and geographic aspects of a restrictive covenant must be determined in light of the nature of the employer’s interest sought to be protected. The time should be no longer and the area should be no greater than are reasonably necessary for the protection of that interest. Helpful observations as to the permissible duration of a provision designed to protect the employer’s interest in customer relationships are contained in Professor Blake’s article:</p>
    <blockquote id="b553-5" data-blocks='[["BL_553.6",553,[252,1410,1104,942]],["BL_554.1",554,[312,322,1108,95]]]'>“In determining whether a restraint extends for a longer period of time than necessary to protect the employer, the court must determine how much time is needed for the risk of injury to be reasonably moderated. When the restraint is for the purpose of protecting customer relationships, its duration is reasonable only if it is no longer than necessary for the employer to put a new man on the job and for the new employee to have a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate his effectiveness to the customers. If the selling or servicing relationship is relatively complex, a longer period may be called for. Courts seldom criticize restraints of six months or a year on the grounds of duration as such, and even longer restraints are often enforced. When the selling relationship is important but still simple, as when consumers’ goods are being sold by house to house calls over a route, a very short period, <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>however, might provide adequate protection.” Blake, <em>supra, </em>note 1 at 677-78. (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[265,449,1155,88]]]'>At another point the following additional comment is made:</p>
    <blockquote id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.6",554,[310,575,1112,748]]]'>“Frequency of contact may also control or affect the permissible period of the restraint. Paradoxically, if the contact is less frequent, a longer period of restraint may be reasonable. Here the controlling idea is that the employer should be given a reasonable period of time in which to overcome the former employee’s personal hold over the client, usually by putting another man on the job. The employer’s new representative should be given a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate to the customer that he will perform satisfactorily and to establish a working relationship. Thus, the less frequent the contacts, other factors being equal, the longer the period needed by the new employee.” Blake, <em>supra, </em>note 1 at 659. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>

The chancellor enforced this provision to its full extent. In so doing we are of opinion that the chancellor erred. An employer’s interest in the customer relationships developed by an employee whose contact with customers occurred at the customers’ premises extends no farther than the sales territory to which the employee was assigned. Blake, <em>supra, </em>note 1 at 680; see <em>Albee Homes, Inc. v.

Even if an employer writes <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>a covenant which constitutes an illegal restraint of trade, the employer need not be concerned.

It is not a difficult task for an employer to write a legal restrictive covenant into the employment contract. Employers have no incentive to do so, of course, so long as this Court says to such employers: “Write any covenant you wish — if it’s illegal, we’ll act as your counsel and rewrite it.” The rewriting, of course, takes place after a period of time during which the illegal restraint of trade has already intimidated the employee.
