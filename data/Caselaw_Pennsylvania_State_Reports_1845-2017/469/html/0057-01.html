Further, the Williams family had communicated to the court concern for Tony’s emotional well-being through an attorney. The attorney had advised the court that Williams had suffered and was still suffering emotional trauma from his experience. Furthermore, the court was advised the entire Williams family had moved from the area in which the killings had taken place because of the effect the experience had on “Tony.” The attorney had asked the court to consider these facts when Williams was called to the stand.</p>

Yet, when counsel objected they did so generally and did not challenge or even ask to know the facts which caused the family such concern that they would contact an attorney to communicate with the court. If counsel had reason to doubt Williams would have difficulty testifying because of his emotional state, they should have requested an in-camera hearing to question Williams concerning his ability to testify with the spectators present. We specifically reject the notion that the trial court was required to withhold action on the request for the exclusion order until Williams was on the stand and manifested he was unable to testify. Such a position would not only subject the witness to further emotional trauma which was sought to be avoided, but it would further the possibility that the witness would not be able to testify.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

These exemptions served to protect the interests underlying Knight’s and Powell’s right to a public trial. Both groups could be expected to act as a restraint against judicial power, and the press would be helpful in reporting matters to the public generally so that persons having knowledge of the events might voluntarily come forward and testify. <em>United States v.

The reason such an opinion is allowed is that, although the jury is capable of drawing its own conclusion as to mental capacity, see McCormick, Evidence §§ 11, 12 [Hereinafter: McCormick] the jury should be allowed to hear the general opinion of the non-expert because his general opinion merely represents a shorthand version of his total observations, all of which may not be easily expressed as separate and distinct factual observations; thus, the rule is one of convenience. But further, a witness may often find it impossible to relate all of his observations because of the many subtleties involved in observing a person’s manner and demeanor which are not easily reducible to concrete expression but are as important as other observations; thus, the rule is also one of necessity. McCormick, § 11; Feldman, Pennsylvania Trial Guide, § 7.82. Thus, the rule which allows a non-expert to express a general opinion is wholly justified on the grounds of necessity and convenience.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

In a related argument advanced by Powell only, he asserts that the scope of the order was impermissible because it excluded his brother and sister. Powell cites <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Paylor v. Cavell, </em>supra, in support of his position. There the Superior Court stated: “ . . . at the very least an accused is entitled to have his friends, relatives and counsel present.” We agree an order should generally not exclude the family and friends of an accused, see <em>Commonwealth v. Burton, </em><a href="/citations/?q=459%20Pa.%20551" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="459 Pa. 551">459 Pa. 551</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="330 A.2d 833" data-case-ids="481016,481066" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0549-01,/pa/459/0550-01">330 A.2d 833</a> (1975), but we need not now determine whether relatives and friends can ever be excluded because of the circumstances here involved. A trial court cannot be expected to know who are the relatives and friends of an accused without being informed, and thus the court instantly could not have been expected to know Powell’s brother and sister were affected by the order. Nor could the court have been expected to state its exclusion order by including a phrase to exempt family and friends because persons not even remotely connected to Powell might have then remained and the court would have had no way of knowing <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>if they were in fact friends and relatives. Nor can it be expected that a court will conduct a voir <em>dire </em>with spectators; to the contrary, assuming the circumstances could not or did not justify the exclusion of Powell’s relatives, counsel should have brought to the attention of the court the fact that relatives were present and informed the court who they were so that the court could avoid the possibility of error in excluding them. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>supra.</p>

Knight and Powell reason from this that <em>a fortiori </em>a layman may not express an opinion on mental capacity. Since the doctor could not express an expert opinion as to the ultimate issue she, like a non-expert, was incompetent to express any ultimate opinion. But such incompetency refers only to an expression of an ultimate opinion as to legal sanity and not to an opinion which is based on observable facts at the time of the relevant events and which does not attempt to advise the jury on the ultimate determination of the issue.

We do not think expressions of general opinions as to mental capacity by non-experts overly influence the jury’s deliberations and ultimate determination. Jurors today are more sophisticated than ever before, and, as a result, there is now less danger than ever before of them accepting a witness’s opinion as determinative. McCormick, §§ 11, 12. Thus, a non-expert may express a general opinion as to mental capacity where the facts and observations on which his opinion is based are stated.

We note the opinion as to mental capacity as it related to an effective waiver of constitutional rights was based on observations made at the time of the waiver; while, the officer’s opinion as to mental capacity as it related to sanity and mental capacity to form specific intent to kill was based on observations made a few hours after the commissions of the crimes. But the time lapse between the officer’s observations and the period about which he stated his opinion was only a few hours. Moreover, the defendants were recounting the circumstances of the killings when the officer made his observations and the jury was made aware by the testimony that the observations were made subsequent to the killings.

Both Knight and Powell are entitled to a new trial because of the prejudice created by allowing the interrogating police officer to state that in his opinion both defendants “ . . . knew what they did . knew when they did it . [and] knew what they were doing . . .” The majority opinion concludes that this witness, a witness not qualified as a psychiatric expert, should nevertheless be allowed to express an opinion as to a defendant’s mental capacity because the expression of such an opinion was justified on grounds of “necessity and convenience.” While I have grave doubts as to the validity of such a rule, even if we were to accept it as the law of this Commonwealth, the result reached by the majority would remain in error. As acknowledged by the majority opinion, the mental capacity of each defendant was clearly at issue in this case. Before it could reach a verdict, the jury had to decide at least two questions concerning the defendant’s respective <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>mental capacities: first the jury had to decide whether or not the defendants possessed the requisite degree of sanity to be guilty of criminal homicide at all; if the jury concluded that the defendants were sane, and therefore capable of committing a criminal homicide, it still had to decide whether or not the defendants possessed sufficient mental capacity to form the intent to commit murder in the first degree. While it is true, as stated by the majority opinion, that the testifying police officer did not say specifically that, in his opinion, appellants “knew the nature and consequences” of their actions nor did he state they knew the “difference between right and wrong,” his expression of opinion as to their mental capacities came sufficiently close to intruding upon the jury’s exclusive function of making these determinations that it should not have been allowed into evidence.</p>
    <p id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[263,1209,1166,903]]]'>The majority concludes that the “rule of convenience and necessity” was satisfied in this case because the testifying officer merely used a “shorthand version” of expressing his total observations, “all of which may not [have been] easily expressed as separate and distinct factual observations . . . .” The majority continues, however, to state that prior to the making of the statement in question, the testifying police officer “stated the observations he had made which led him to conclude as he did.” Having thus stated what he observed while questioning the defendants, the issue of whether or not the defendants had requisite mental capacity was adequately presented to the jury for its decision, and no “rule of convenience” was served by allowing the officer to state his conclusion as to their mental capacities. For this reason alone the officer’s conclusion should not have been allowed into evidence.</p>

The majority states that “it would have been very difficult for the officer to express the demeanor, degree of coherence, and other <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>such factors which form the basis of his opinion in a sufficiently clear manner to enable the jury to have the full benefit of the officer’s observations without the use of an opinion.” This statement is at odds with the purpose of the criminal process. It is the duty of the prosecution, through its witnesses and evidence, to establish <em>facts </em>upon which a jury may make its determination. The prosecution should not be allowed to use opinion evidence simply because the subject is difficult to prove. Police officers are experienced in testifying in court and often are called upon to give factual descriptions of a person’s demeanor; of a person’s coherence or lack of coherence; of a person’s difficulty or lack of difficulty in walking or standing, or in performing various other functions. There was therefore no need for the officer here to state his opinion as to the mental capacity of the defendants.</p>
