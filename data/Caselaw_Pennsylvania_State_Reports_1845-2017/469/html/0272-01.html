The trial court did not certify that determination of the issue of liability “involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion” or that “an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter”; it made no certification of any sort. Moreover, the appellant did not petition the Superior Court for a discretionary allowance of appeal, and the Superior Court never entered an order allowing the appeal. <em>See </em>Superior Court Rule 53. Appellant and the courts below have at all times treated the order of the court of common pleas as a “final order” from which appellant was entitled, to appeal as a matter of right. In so doing, they were plainly mistaken, and I <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>cannot agree that this Court should ignore the error by pretending that an order which clearly does not comply with Section 501(b) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, <em>supra, </em>does in fact do so. (See footnote 1 of the opinion of the court, <em>ante </em>at 148).</p>
