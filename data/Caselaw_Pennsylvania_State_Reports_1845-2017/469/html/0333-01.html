We have held that a prosecutor may not inject “his highly prejudicial personal opinion of appellant’s credibility into evidence, thereby clearly and improperly intruding upon the jury’s exclusive function of evaluating the credibility of witnesses.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The prosecutor’s remark in this case is a bit more subtle than in the usual case; he does not comment directly upon the defendant’s credibility but rather surmises that Joyner’s own lawyer must doubt his story because the lawyer emphasized a different defense. As the Commonwealth explains in its brief, “This comment was designed to point out the in<a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>consistency between counsel’s argument that appellant’s will was overborne and appellant’s own testimony that he had given no confession.” This may be the explanation of the remark, but it does not detract from the prejudicial nature of what was said. The defendant is not bound by a single defense at trial; he may offer as many alternative defenses as he so chooses, and they need not be consistent. The prosecutor’s comment was thus completely gratuitous.</p>

The Commonwealth, in its brief, admits that certain of “the language complained of here might be considered to involve excessive implications of opinion and belief by the prosecutor, especially under recent opinions of this Court.” It contends, however, that the remarks were provoked by the summation of defense counsel which had gone before: “Any breaches of propriety by the prosecutor were no more than response in kind.” We have reviewed the defense counsel’s summation in its entirety and have found nothing in it to justify the comments and remarks by the prosecutor. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoltzfus, </em><a href="/pa/462/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="462 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="485206" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0043-01">462 Pa. 43</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="462 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="485206" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0043-01">337 A.2d 873</a> (1975).</p>
      <p id="b381-8" data-blocks='[["BL_381.9",381,[222,2085,1111,299]]]'>The Commonwealth also contends that the cautionary passage in the court’s charge that the jury was to ignore any expressions of personal opinion and belief made by counsel and that they were to decide the case strictly on the basis of the evidence before them was sufficient to “protect the interests of justice.” In light of the nature of the objectionable comment, we do not believe the instruction was adequate to undo the harm.
