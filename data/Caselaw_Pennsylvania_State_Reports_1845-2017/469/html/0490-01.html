Prior to the trial, appellee had unsuccessfully contested the legality of his arrest by way of a pre-trial motion to suppress prejudicial evidence obtained during the asserted illegal detention. After conviction the trial judge sentenced appellee to a term of imprisonment of six to twelve months. Thereupon, pursuant to the Act of October 17, 1969, P.L. 259, § 18, as amended, Act of July 14, 1971, P.L. 224, No. 45, § 1, 17 P.S. § 711.18 and the Pennsylvania Constitution, Sched<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>ule Art. V, § 16(r)(iii), appellee appealed his conviction as a matter of right to the Court of Common Pleas and demanded a trial de novo. On September 8, 1972, when trial was to begin, appellee requested a relitigation of the suppression motion which had previously been denied in the Municipal Court. Acting in accordance with General Court Regulation 72-7, the trial judge refused to hold a second evidentiary hearing on the issue. Appellee was subsequently tried and again convicted of possession of narcotics and after the disposition of post-trial motions appellee was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than six nor more than twelve months. As has been stated, on appeal to the Superior Court the judgment of sentence was reversed and a new trial awarded. The ruling of the Superior Court was predicated on the belief that General Court Regulation 72-7 was in conflict with the Constitution and therefore invalid.</p>

To determine whether, in fact, there is a conflict between General Court Regulation 72-7 and the constitutional provision, we are called upon to determine the intention of the people in their adoption of this provision. In its analysis of the intended meaning of the phrase “trial de novo”, the majority of the Superior Court focused its attention upon the words “de novo”. See <em>Commonwealth v. White, supra, </em><a href="/pa-super/228/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="228 Pa.

However, to avoid conflict with the constitutional right of trial by jury, an unfettered right to a trial with jury was provided for those litigants who were not satisfied with the disposition of the Municipal Court.

The purpose for holding a hearing on the admissibility of certain evidence prior to trial rather than during the course of the jury proceedings is to prevent the uneconomical use of the jury’s time, and as a matter of convenience to the court and to the litigants. The hearing, however, need not necessarily be held “pretrial.” Cf. <em>Swenson v.

Rule 323(b) requires that applications to suppress evidence be submitted to the court not later than ten days prior to the beginning of the trial session or the day the case is listed for trial, <em>except </em>in the case where “the opportunity did not previously exist, or the interests of justice otherwise require.” In these situations, Rule 323(b) permits the trial court to hold a hearing on the suppression motion <em>during trial. See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa-super/229/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="229 Pa.

Surely an accused on trial in the Municipal Court would have the same right to present a motion to suppress during trial in cases where “the opportunity did not previously exist, or the interests of justice otherwise require.” Under the majority’s reasoning, an application to suppress in the Municipal Court which is not considered “pre-trial,” but which is considered under the exception during “trial” would, of necessity, have to be re-litigated prior to the trial de novo in the Court of Common Pleas. To allow re-litigation of the motion brought <em>during “trial” </em>in the Municipal Court pursuant <em>to the </em>exception, while not allowing the re-litigation of the motion brought “pre-trial” would be a denial of equal protection, and furthermore just doesn’t make sense.</p>

By refusing to allow re-litigation of the pre-trial motion to suppress, the majority forces the defendant, against whom the Municipal Court judge has admitted evidence challenged at a pretrial suppression hearing, to proceed to the de novo trial carrying the burden of the adverse determination of admissibility of evidence. In so doing, he is denied the “full range of constitutional guarantees” normally available in a jury trial. Such a defendant is also prejudiced by the prior proceedings because he or she is not allowed to proceed to the de novo trial “with the slate wiped clean.”</p>

Bonser, </em><a href="/pa-super/215/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="215 Pa.

I cannot agree that no prejudice occurs. Several differences exist between Municipal Court trials and trials in the Court of Common Pleas. Although the majority is correct in its assertion that the Municipal Court is a court of record, and that its judges are fully capable of making determinations of fact and of law, proceedings before the Municipal Court are largely of a summary nature, the case load of the Municipal Court is considerably larger than the Court of Common Pleas, and, because of the nature and the number of the cases involved, the amount of time and effort spent in preparation for any individual case is necessarily much less than is spent in preparation for a criminal trial in the Court of Common Pleas. In many respects, the trial in Municipal Court can be viewed simply as a <em>dress rehearsal </em>for the yet to come trial in the Common Pleas Court. <em>See e. g. Ludwig v. Massachusetts, </em><a href="/us/427/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="427 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6180144" data-case-paths="/us/427/0618-01">427 U.S. 618</a>, <a href="/us/427/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="427 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6180144" data-case-paths="/us/427/0618-01">96 S.Ct. 2781</a>, <a href="/us/427/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="427 U.S. 618" data-case-ids="6180144" data-case-paths="/us/427/0618-01">49 L.Ed.2d 732</a> (1976). Even if an accused is convicted and sentenced in the Municipal Court, an “appeal” to the Court of Common Pleas will vacate the judgment and result in the automatic grant of a new trial.</p>

This fact is also recognized by the different rules concerning suppression hearings held in the Municipal Court and those in the Court of Common Pleas. The Municipal Court rules provide that a suppression hearing is to be held on the same <em>day </em>the trial is to begin and immediately prior thereto. This rule is consistent with the summary nature of the proceedings in Municipal Court, proceedings geared to the speedy disposition of minor criminal cases. On the other hand, the rules governing suppression hearings in the Court of Common Pleas provide that an ap<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>plication to suppress must be filed at least <em>ten days </em>prior to the scheduled commencement of the trial. Moreover, applications to suppress may be presented orally in the Municipal Court while such motions to the Court of Common Pleas must be written. Thus, it can be seen from the rules of the two courts themselves that the same investigation and preparation is not contemplated in the Municipal Court that is contemplated in the Court of Common Pleas. What may have been adequate representation at a hearing before a Municipal Court therefore might not be effective assistance of counsel if the Municipal Court’s suppression hearing was binding upon a criminal defendant at trial in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
