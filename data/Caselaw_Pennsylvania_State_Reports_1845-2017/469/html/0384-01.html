All three checks were from Pofit’s personal account and drawn on a local bank. The $100.00 and $400.00 checks were paid to petitioner as attorney’s fees in connection with his representation of Pofit.

Beginning in October of 1974, after he realized that P. J.

J. Hydraulics, Inc. Pofit wrote to petitioner on November 5, 1974, requesting the return of the entrusted funds, but received no reply to this letter.

The fact is that Pofit entrusted the money to Mr. Leopold, as his attorney, for the purpose of settling the potential claims of P. J. Hydraulics, Inc., and for that purpose alone. Any other employment of those funds was violative of the fiduciary relationship established between petitioner and his client. Clearly, Mr. Pofit had a legal right to the return of the money which had not been used in the settlement of any claims made by P. J. Hydraulics, Inc. It follows that petitioner had no legal claim to the possession or use of the funds beyond the terms agreed to with his client. Here, we find it appropriate to emphasize that this petitioner’s failure to make any recognizable effort to restore the misappropriated funds to his former client smacks of an irremissible indifference to his ethical obligations. We conclude that the flagrant nature of this petitioner’s violation of the trust and confidence placed in him by his client merits disbarment.

Such proceedings are not law suits between parties litigant but rather are in the nature of an inquest or inquiry as to the conduct of the respondent. They are not for the purpose of punishment, but rather seek to determine the fitness of an officer of the court to continue in that capacity and to protect the courts and the public from the official ministration of persons unfit to practice. Thus the real question in issue in a disbarment proceeding is the public interest and an attorney’s right to continue to practice the profession imbued with the public trust.” <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em><a href="/pa/463/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="463 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1708047" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0472-01">463 Pa. 472</a>, 478, <a href="/pa/463/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="463 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1708047" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0472-01">345 A.2d 616</a>, 619-20 (1975).</p>
