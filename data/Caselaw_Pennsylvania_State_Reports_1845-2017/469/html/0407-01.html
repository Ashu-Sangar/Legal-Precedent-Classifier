On March 20, 1975, the court below sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment of not less <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>than ten years nor more than twenty years in a state correctional institution.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[180,452,1154,316]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. On September 25, 1972, appellant was indicted on a general charge of murder in connection with the slaying of his wife, Mary Diane McLaughlin. Appellant fled Pennsylvania, was arrested in Arizona, and later was extradited to Pennsylvania on November 30,1973.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[179,799,1155,369]]]'>On December 20, 1973, appellant entered a plea of not guilty to a general charge of murder. At the time of appellant’s plea he was represented by Thomas Morgan, Public Defender, Clearfield County, and Barry Tumpson, private counsel retained by appellant’s mother. Subsequently, appellant was represented by private counsel only.</p>
    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.7",449,[178,1201,1153,260]]]'>In March, 1974, appellant wrote to Judge John A.

On April 1, 1974, the court refused to discharge counsel.</p>
    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.8",449,[177,1492,1153,309]]]'>On July 30, 1974, appellant appeared before Judge Cherry for the purpose of entering a guilty plea pursuant to a plea bargain arranged by appellant’s counsel and the district attorney of Clearfield County. However, appellant refused to plead guilty and the court set trial to commence for the next criminal term.</p>

The court granted defense counsel’s motion. The results of the psychiatric evaluation revealed that appellant was competent. On November 27, 1974, appellant, represented by counsel, entered a plea of guilty to a general charge of murder. The guilty plea was entered pursuant to an agreement between the <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>district <em>attorney and </em>defense counsel. By the terms of the plea agreement, the Commonwealth certified that the charge rose no higher than murder in the second degree.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[270,492,1163,261]]]'>After a guilty-plea-colloquy and the Commonwealth’s presentation of two witnesses to the shooting, the court below accepted the guilty plea to murder in the second degree, but deferred sentencing pending a presentence investigation.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[272,783,1160,261]]]'>Subsequently, appellant renewed his efforts to have defense counsel removed and replaced by the public defender’s office.

A summary of the testimony shows that appellant wished to plead not guilty and that he believed that he had possible defenses to the shooting. The testimony also reveals that on numerous occasions appellant attempted to dismiss his privately-retained defense counsel. The court below denied the motion to withdraw the guilty plea and on March 20, 1975, entered judgment of sentence. This appeal followed.</p>
