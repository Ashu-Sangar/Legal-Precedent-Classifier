The Commonwealth Court held that it has equitable jurisdiction of such suits. For the reasons which follow, we have concluded that the instant action was initiated for the purpose of enjoining an <em>arguably </em>unfair labor practice and that therefore jurisdiction of the grievance is in the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board [hereinafter “the PLRB” or “the Board”]. Accordingly, we shall reverse the decree of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Their complaint alleges the following facts: On January 5, 1973, the PLRB certified the Joint Bargaining Committee of the Pennsylvania Employment Security Employes’ Association and the Pennsylvania Social Services Union, both affiliated with the Service Employes International <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>Union, AFL-CIO [hereinafter collectively referred to as “the union”], as the exclusive representative, for the purposes of meeting and discussing<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> wages, hours and conditions of employment, of a bargaining unit of which appellants are members. On January 22,1973, the union and the Department entered into a “memorandum of understanding,” which contained a “maintenance of membership” or “union security” provision <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and provided for dues deductions from the pay checks of those union members who authorize such deductions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The memorandum of understanding expired on June 30, 1973.

The plaintiffs-appellants there are thirteen “rank and file” employes of the Department of Public Welfare. Their complaint alleges the following facts: On January 4, 1972, the union was certified as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit of which the plaintiffs are members, for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. On June 1, 1972, the Department and the union entered into a collective bargaining agreement which included a “union security” or “maintenance of membership” clause <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and a provision for dues deductions from the pay checks of union members.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> This agreement expired on June 30, 1973. Between July 1, 1973, and July 26, 1973, the plaintiffs resigned from the union and the deduction of dues from their wages was stopped. On or about July 26, 1973, the union and the Department entered into a new collective bargaining agreement which provided, as had the prior agreement, for maintenance of membership and union dues deductions. In March, 1974, the Department informed these plaintiffs also that their resignations from <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>the union were ineffective because they had not been made within the designated period prior to expiration of the first agreement and that dues deductions would resume retroactively to the dates deductions had been terminated. Again, this course of action is alleged to have been in fact adopted by the Department.</p>

Section 401 of the PERA, note 1 <em>supra, </em>43 P.S. § 1101.-401 (Supp.1976). We are of opinion that the deduction of union dues from employes’ salaries, if done without valid authorization by the employes affected, arguably constitutes an interference with or a restraint upon their right to refrain from joining or assisting in employe organizations of which the employes do not wish to be <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>members.

Although interlocutory, the decree of the Commonwealth Court overruling the defendants’ preliminary objections is rendered appealable by the Act of March 5, 1925, P.L. 23, § 1, 12 P.S. § 672, because the decree involves a determination of a question of jurisdiction over the cause of action. Appellate jurisdiction is in this Court by virtue of Section 203 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, § 203, 17 P.S. § 211.203 (Supp.1976).</p>

The Commonwealth Court expressed doubt as to whether the appellees would have standing to initiate proceedings in the PLRB inasmuch as their complaints allege that they are no longer union members. The PERA was expressly designed, however, to protect the rights of <em>all </em>public employes, not merely those who are union members. See Sections 101 and 401 of the PERA, 43 P.S. §§ 1101.101 &amp; 1101.401 (Supp.1976). Many of the unfair practices listed in Section 1201 of the PERA, 43 P.S. § 1101.1201 (Supp.1976) are applicable to nonmembers of unions. Moreover, Section 1302 of the PERA, 43 P.S. § 1101.1302 (Supp.1976), provides that “any interested party” may initiate proceedings in the PLRB. Accordingly, under the allegations of their respective complaints, the appellees would have standing to proceed before the PLRB.</p>
