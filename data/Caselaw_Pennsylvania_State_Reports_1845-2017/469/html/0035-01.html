    <p class="author" id="ArC" data-blocks='[["BL_77.5",77,[231,450,310,34]]]'>PER CURIAM.</p>
    <p id="b77-4" data-blocks='[["BL_77.6",77,[185,511,1151,1075]]]'>On April 9, 1975, appellant Richard Morgan was convicted of criminal contempt in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County and sentenced to three months imprisonment. A direct appeal from the contempt conviction was timely filed with this Court on April 29, 1975.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> However, the transcript of the contempt proceedings was not available to appellant until after he had filed his brief with this Court due to the failure of the trial court stenographer to transcribe the notes of testimony. Although appellant had the opportunity to request leave of court to withdraw his brief and file another brief addressed to the substantive issues, he failed to do so. Rather, he chose to rely upon his original brief which directed its argument to the unavailability of the transcript. Thus, the sole question presented on appeal is whether the failure of the stenographer to timely transcribe the notes of testimony deprived appellant of his right of appeal and requires a reversal of the conviction. Under the facts of this case we do not believe the requested relief is the appropriate remedy.</p>

Moreover, it is the responsibility of the state to see that the transcript is made available to appellant so that he may effectively pursue his appeal rights. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, the instant case is easily distinguished from those prior decisions upon which appellant relies.</p>

In each instance, the appellant was effectively denied his right to an appeal because there was no way to reconstruct the lower court proceedings. However, in the instant case the complete record is now available and appellant has failed to show any additional resultant prejudice beyond the delay itself. Under these circumstances, the interests of justice would not be served by reversing the conviction without a full consideration of the merits of the appeal.</p>
