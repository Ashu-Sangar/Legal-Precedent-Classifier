However, accepting the most charitable view of the Commonwealth’s evidence, at best the testimony would only support a criminal conspiracy to commit an assault and not a criminal conspiracy to commit a felonious homicide for which he was in fact charged.</p>

Further there was no testimony to suggest that appellant had a weapon upon his person or was aware that any of his associates were armed. Since in my judgment appellant did not conspire to commit a felonious homicide he similarly should not have been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, there being no basis upon which to predicate vicarious liability.</p>
