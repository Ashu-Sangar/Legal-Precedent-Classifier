The issues raised in this appeal relate to the correctness of these legal conclusions. In order for these conclusions to be understood, however, it will first be necessary to recite the uncontested factual findings of the Commission. This is done in Part I of the Opinion.

    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[191,1028,1151,754]]]'>Prior to the “phase-out” of the coil department in General Electric’s Pittsburgh Apparatus Shop, Agnes Stokles, Mary Kush and Anna Katynski had been employed in that department as coil tapers <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> for continuous periods ranging from thirty-six to twenty-two years. The position of coil taper, like all positions in the Pittsburgh shop, was classified by two methods. The first was through a job hiring classification system which consisted of a number preceded by an “R” prefix [hereinafter “R rating”]. The lowest hiring classification was an R-4, the highest R-25. The R classification both denoted one’s base pay and also determined one’s ability to transfer to equivalent R rated positions or to bump into equivalent or lower rated jobs.</p>
    <p id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.7",337,[191,1803,1152,422]],["BL_338.1",338,[283,328,1159,309]]]'>Each job within the shop had a range of maximum and minimum R classifications which could be assigned to it. Within the coil department there were four such subdivisions of R classifications. These were designated from highest to lowest by the letters “A”, “B”, “C” and “D” respectively. Within the coil department of the Pittsburgh shop all female employees had been hired as coil workers C or D and none had an R rating in excess <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>of R-9. All but three male employees, on the other hand, were employed as coil workers A or B and had R ratings in excess of R-ll. As a consequence they enjoyed more advantageous transfer and bumping rights. The three named complainants were all coil workers C with an R-9 classification.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[282,666,1160,909]]]'>In addition to the bumping and transfer privileges mentioned above, there were two methods through which an employee in the Pittsburgh shop could broaden his or her base of work experience. The first method allowed employees in lower rated positions to bid on unfilled vacancies in higher rated positions. Only one woman had attempted to exercise this bidding right prior to 1969 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>, and no woman has made such an attempt since General Electric initiated during that year a policy of actively encouraging female employment. The complainants contended that females did not bid for such jobs because it was commonly understood that all jobs other than that of coil taper were “male” jobs to which no female would be assigned. The Commission found, however, that while such an attitude may have existed, it was not the result of any overt or passive policy on the part of General Electric.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.6",338,[276,1603,1160,532]],["BL_339.1",339,[234,317,1151,316]]]'>The second method of obtaining broader work experience was through “road work” which was assigned by departmental supervisors from time to time to various employees within the coil department. “Road work” consisted of trips to outlying General Electric facilities to repair electrical equipment which was too large to bring back to the Pittsburgh shop. In making these repairs employees received training in skills which they would not have otherwise obtained within the coil department. Significantly, with one exception, women <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>were never invited to engage in such road work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>Gener-al Electric attempted to justify this exclusion on the ground that the female employees seemed engrossed in their work and that they would not have been capable of undertaking the assignments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Commission found that this procedure had a “disparate impact” on females.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[234,654,1153,647]]]'>At the end of 1970 General Electric decided to phase out the coil department. At that time the department employed twenty-one female and twenty male employees. The company offered to transfer the employees to a new operation in Ohio or to attempt to find positions for them elsewhere in the Pittsburgh shop. Lay off and transfer decisions were to be made in accordance with the local labor-management contract. This provided: “Lay-offs and transfers due to lack of work will be made in accordance with the length of continuous service within the affected occupational group. However, ability will be given consideration.”</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.6",339,[236,1322,1149,206]],["BL_340.1",340,[268,323,1159,1026]]]'>During the early part of 1971 General Electric completed the phase-out of the department. Of the twenty-one female employees, sixteen were laid off, four were offered part-time positions and one retired.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Of the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>twenty male employees, sixteen were transferred into full time positions, three bumped into full time positions and one was laid off. Most of the males who bumped or were transferred into other positions by General Electric had less seniority than the women who were laid off. New of the men had ever held, even temporarily, the job positions to which they were transferred. Transfer decisions were, in many instances, based upon a supervisor’s personal familiarity with experiences which the male employees had had outside of their employment at General Electric. These experiences were not reflected in the employees’ official record but were nevertheless relied upon to determine whether a male employee had the aptitude or experience to fill a given opening. No effort was made to ascertain whether any of the female employees had similar job-related experiences which did not appear on their records. In other instances, General Electric retained male employees because of the training they had received during various road work assignments.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[264,1390,1160,969]],["BL_341.1",341,[211,329,1148,198]]]'>It was on the basis of this evidence that the Commission concluded that General Electric had engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the Act. In particular, the Commission concluded that General Electric violated the Act by failing to take affirmative action to dispel an erroneous feeling among its employees that certain jobs were for males and certain jobs were for females; by retaining the female employees in the lowest job classifications and thus limiting their rights to bump; by failing to ascertain the females’ general work experience and qualifications for available positions on an equal basis with male employees; by training males to fill positions for which they had no previous experience while failing to offer females the same opportunities to be trained for new positions; and by following general procedures during the phase-out which had a disparate impact upon the female employees’ job opportunities. The Commission also concluded that <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>the statutory requirement of proving that the complainants were the “best able and most competent to perform services required” was not applicable under the circumstances of this case.</p>

In the instant case the complaints undertook no such showing. The Commission ruled that where the discriminatory practice consists of a failure to evaluate a female worker’s qualifications and where there is evidence that experience was not the employment criterion the “efficacy” of the “best able” requirement of Section 5(a) is “vitiated”. Relying on two previously decided cases which had cast the burden on the complainant, the Commonwealth Court disagreed. <em>G. C. Murphy Company v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Human Relations Commission, </em>12 Pa.Cmwlth. 20, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20356" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="314 A.2d 356">314 A.2d 356</a> (1974); <em>Romain v.

In doing so we are, of course, required to ascertain as best we can what the legislature intended to express in the italicized language quoted above. In this process we are to be guided by the directive of the legislature in the Act itself that “[t]he provisions of [PHRA] shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.” Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, <em>as amended </em>43 P.S. § 962.

    <p id="b342-8" data-blocks='[["BL_342.7",342,[242,1540,1158,801]]]'>Thus approached, the choice of placing on a complainant the burden of proving the superiority of his or her abilities as part of establishing a prima facie case, on the one hand, or of requiring an employer to assert the “best able” proviso in defending a challenge to an employment decision becomes relatively easy, for we must adopt a construction which, without doing violence to the language of the statute, best promotes the goal of equal employment opportunities. We believe that the legislature intended that it is the employer who should shoulder the burden of demonstrating that the complainant was not “best able and most competent to perform the services required.” This conclusion is supported by two principal considerations, one conceptual and the other pragmatic.</p>

Fair employment laws embody an attempt to reconcile two distinct and, at times, competing social interests — the interest in ending all vestiges of discrimination, and the interest in promoting an efficient and productive economy. Employment decisions must not, of course, be allowed to be made on the basis of a person’s sex, and decisions so based must not be permitted to be justified by perfunctory resort to claims of economic efficiency. But just as surely fair employment laws were never intended to interfere with employment policies which maximize efficiency and productivity simply because those policies have an unintended discriminatory impact.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

General Electric alleged that such evidence was irrelevant to prove the violations which were charged. The Commission ruled that evidence of practices which took place subsequent to the effective date of the sex amendment to Section 5(a) (July 1, 1969) was admissible to establish the substance of the charge, notwithstanding that such evidence might pertain to events which occurred prior to the discriminatory acts here complained of; evidence of practices which pre-dated the effective date of the amendment was admitted for the limited purpose of establishing the state of mind of the complainants as to whether certain jobs were commonly considered to be “male” jobs. The Commonwealth Court concluded that to the extent that the Commission relied upon evidence of practices which pre-dated the Act it acted improperly. In its view, evidence of such practices is relevant only to establish those types of violations which are akin to á conspiracy to thwart the purposes of the Act in contemplation of its passage by the legislature.

To this end the section outlaws such policies and stands as a guarantee that a woman’s qualifications for the position she seeks will be evaluated with neutral objectivity. This statutory imposition of neutral employment requirements does not in itself, however, assure equal opportunities to the victims of past discriminatory practices; such persons still remain shackled by the already suffered deprivations of seniority rights, access to training programs, promotions and the like. Occasionally, a facially neutral employment policy incorporates as a criterion for employment a qualification which a female has been precluded from attaining by virtue of an abandoned discriminatory policy. In such an instance the impact of the past discriminatory practice is perpetuated and the former victim is deprived of equal employment opportunity just as surely as if she were the current object of an overt discriminatory practice.

It seems apparent that without such an inquiry General Electric could not have engaged in any meaningful, objective appraisal of the costs which would have been involved in a training program for women.

Road work assignments gave employees valuable experience, but normally resulted in a slight loss of income during the assignment period. Because most assignments lasted no more than a few days, the decrease in income did not generally deter employees from accepting these assignments. The only assignment which was ever offered to a female employee was for a five week period. It was rejected by the employee because she felt the loss of income would have been too great. No female worker has ever been offered the more usual one to two day road work assignment.</p>

A fair employment law is a limited corrective strategy and the societal interests in efficiency is a major limitation. The interest in efficiency is compromised not only when the employer is required to take an ‘unqualified’ worker but also when he is not allowed to choose the ‘best worker’. Thus, in the employment context if the individual’s non-performance under the criterion indicates a lower productivity than that of another applicant (for example the applicant for a secretarial job who cannot type at all or cannot type as well as the best applicant), this criterion cannot be deemed the functional equivalent of [a racially based criterion] regardless of the individual’s lack of responsibility for his non-performance. Past discrimination — the causal explanation that releases the individual from responsibility for his non-performance — becomes relevant only if the criterion is not indicative of productivity.”</blockquote>

Technically, the evidentiary issue before us is whether evidence of practices which pre-dated the sex amendment is admissible for the limited purpose of establishing complainants’ state of mind. For the reasons which follow in the text we conclude that such evidence is admissible for this <em>limited </em>purpose because it could properly be introduced for the broader purpose of proving <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>the substance of the charge.

General Electric has argued in the alternative that the Commission did not rely on this theory in its evidentiary ruling that it limited the admissibility of pre-1969 evidence to prove the “state of mind” of the complainants, and that in disregard of this limitation the Commission relied substantively on evidence of pre-1969 practices in reaching its conclusions of law. The nub of General Electric’s argument is that many of the alleged discriminatory practices both post-dated and ante-dated the sex amendment to Section 5(a). This argument, however, proves too much. To the extent that these practices were continued past the effective date of the amendment, they could be considered by the Commission consistently with their evidentiary ruling. As there is nothing in the record which suggests that the Commission did not indeed rely upon these post-enactment practices, we see no reason for disturbing the Commission’s decision on this basis.</p>

The Commission concluded that General Electric “violated the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act by failing to take affirmative action to dispel an acknowledged, albeit erroneous, feeling amongst its employees that certain jobs at respondent’s facility were for males and certain jobs at respondent’s facility were for females.” Such a conclusion, however, is in the teeth of the Commission’s own well-supported finding of fact that “although the <em>atmosphere </em>at General Electric may have induced a chilling effect on the proclivity of females to bid for higher rated positions, there is insufficient evidence for finding that this was the overt or latent policy of respondent in this regard.” As we have pointed out earlier in this opinion, the past practices of an employer are of no consequence in a challenge to a present policy unless those past practices were themselves discriminatory.
