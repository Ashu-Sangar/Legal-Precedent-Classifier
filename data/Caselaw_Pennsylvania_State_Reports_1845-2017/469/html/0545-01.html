I think they’re going to hold the place up or either burglarize the place, because when they seen [sic] me they ran up the alley.” The officers went across the street and searched the alley but their search was fruitless. As they came out onto the street a woman from the dress shop in question stated that three men had been “hanging around” outside the store and had entered the adjacent alley. The police informed her of their search and assured her they would maintain surveillance of the premises. The officers proceeded toward their patrol wagon at which point three men, two of whom were carrying suitcases, appeared on the steps of <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>the entrance to the alley <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> whereupon Officer King said, “Hold it gentlemen, I’d like to speak to you.”</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[261,457,1160,744]]]'>The two males with the suitcases dropped them and all three ran down the stairs and across the sidewalk to a car parked at the curb. With guns drawn the police ordered the men to halt and they complied. The three were then instructed to place their hands on the roof of the vehicle. Officer Berry proceeded to frisk Carter while King retrieved the suitcases. King opened the blue suitcase and discovered various automatic weapons, hand guns, explosives and ammunition. The three were placed under arrest. Additional help was summoned and a third officer arrived who “frisked” Holder and retrieved a P-38 pistol and an ammunition clip. The suspects were placed in a police vehicle and taken to the police station.</p>
    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[250,1264,1166,941]]]'>The suppression court found sufficient basis for an investigative stop and frisk by the officers. Moreover, the court concluded that the arrests occurred only after the gun was taken from Mark Holder as a result of this frisk, and the subsequent search of the suitcases was permissible as incident to the lawful arrests. However, the notes of testimony from the suppression hearing contradict these findings. The officers’ testimony clearly indicated that the revolver was not recovered from Holder’s waistband until after the officers had opened the suitcases and discovered their contents. Therefore the seizure of the gun could not have provided the legal basis for the search of the suitcases. At post-trial motions, the court en banc upheld the legality of the arrest on the theory that the suitcases were abandoned by the suspects and the contraband recovered therefrom provided probable cause for the arrests. We agree.</p>

Reviewing appellant’s response in context with other statements elicited during the course of the interviews, it is clear this comment merely reiterated his adherence to a revolutionary philosophy which he had consistently maintained. Up to the point of the challenged utterance, appellant’s remarks could only have been interpreted as an admission of a participation in the conspiratorial design of the group to which he belonged. He consistently denied actual participation throughout the questioning. Taken in context, the statement “Fundamentally, I did” could only be construed as another way of stating his participation in the conspiratorial design and thus did not supply the prosecution with any further information it had not already received.</p>

Later that night, Grier spent several hours unsuccessfully leafing through pages of po<a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>lice photographs in an attempt to identify the man.

One of the avowed purposes of this organization was to arm themselves against the local police and gain retribution for various acts which they believe the police had perpetrated against the community. Moreover, the Commonwealth sought to prove that the incident in question was in fact committed by appellant and his organization through a carefully orchestrated conspiratorial scheme, intended to be the first of several such attacks upon the local police department.</p>

It was also their contention that he was still attempting to elude the police when he was apprehended and they offered the fact that an alias was given by him at the time of his arrest to support this inference. It is therefore their view that his possession or at least his association with those <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>in possession of such sophisticated weaponry at the time of his arrest, was indicative not only of his participation with the group at the time of the arrest, but in addition it established the continuity of his relationship from the time of the incident. When we consider the inaccessibility to the average member of the public, the type of weaponry found, and the unlikelihood of a newly formed association with the group after the event, particularly during a time when appellant was attempting to keep his whereabouts unknown to police officials, we must conclude that the court below properly deduced that a jury could reasonably infer that the possession of these weapons rendered the Commonwealth’s desired inference Of appellant’s participation in the conspiratorial design more probable than it would have been without the introduction of such testimony.

He also asserted that his flight to New York was not associated with a sense of guilt, but rather occasioned by his fear that he would be unjustly set upon by the police because of his former associations with the group. The possession of these weapons, approximately 18 months after the events, shows that he was not a mere minion who had become disenchanted and attempted to sever <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>any former relationships but rather it is clearly indicative of one who continued his close and integral association during the time that he was able to allude the police.

In his closing argument, the prosecutor used appellant’s admission to support his theory that appellant was a conspirator in the Von Colin slaying. As used by the prosecution, appellant’s statement was not, as the majority asserts, a mere reiteration of his prior admission that he was a member of the Black Unity Council. Rather, the statement permitted the jury to infer from appellant’s own words what he had unequivocally denied in his earlier statements to the police, i. e., that he had participated in the killing. In the light of the court’s charge and the prosecutor’s closing argument, appellant’s statement that “fundamentally” he killed Von Colin might have convinced the jury that even if appellant was not the man who fired the fatal bullet, he had encouraged the crime, shared in the intent to commit it and thus was guilty as an aider and abettor.</p>

This Court has held that where a defend- and initially denies his involvement in a crime to the police and afterwards, following a period of unnecessary delay between arrest and preliminary arraignment, admits complicity, a nexus between the admission and delay is established requiring suppression of the statement.

A more general formulation of the <em>Futch </em>inquiry involves a single determination whether a “nexus” exists between the unnecessary delay and the challenged evidence. See e. g., <em>Commonwealth v.

In those cases, the statements taken from the accused after unnecessary delay were essentially a reiteration of prior untainted admissions and thus did not further prejudice the accused. Here, appellant’s statement, taken after 26 hours of unnecessary delay, differed substantially from his prior statements and seriously prejudiced his position.</p>
