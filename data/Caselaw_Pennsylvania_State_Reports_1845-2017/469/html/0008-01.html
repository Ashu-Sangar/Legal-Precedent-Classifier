The presentment was submitted to a regular indicting grand jury which returned indictments on January 3, 1974. Shelton sought and obtained a discovery order requiring the Commonwealth to make available certain information. Because the discovery order was in apparent conflict with a previous court order impounding certain materials, the discovery order was subsequently modified to require Shelton to apply for clarification of the impounding order before discovery would be allowed.</p>

The Commonwealth filed an answer to Shelton’s pretrial motions on September 20, 1974 and a hearing was held on October 9, 1974 in order to dispose of the motions.

That opinion stated, inter alia, that “judicial delay” was not only an insufficient basis on which to imply an exclusion, but it was also an insufficient basis on which to grant an extension pursuant to section (c) of the Rule. Therefore, in order to properly dispose of the Commonwealth’s argument, we must first consider whether or not “judicial delay” may serve as the basis for the granting of an extension pursuant to section (c) of the Rule, and, if it may, under what circumstances such “judicial delay” justifies the granting of an application for an extension.</p>

The “Commonwealth” in the context of the Rule clearly refers to prosecutorial officers and not to the judiciary. Literally read, the Rule quite simply does not attempt to solve the problem of eliminating delay due to the judiciary; rather, it attempts to eliminate delay due to lack of due diligence on the part of prosecutorial officers. Furthermore, if “judicial delay” does not justify an extension, then in a situation where because of the unavailability of a judge or a court before whom to commence trial at a time prior to the expiration of the mandatory period, the Commonwealth despite the exercise of all due diligence would be unable to effectuate a prosecution. Such a result would render the due diligence exception a nullity and is therefore contrary to the rule of construction that requires “[e]very [rule to] be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 2; Act of November <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>25, 1970, P.L. 707, No. 230, added December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, No. 290, § 3, 1 C.P.S.A. § 1921(a).

Thus, in any given case, if the “judicial delay” is determined to be an insufficient basis for the granting of an extension, then the Commonwealth will still have time in which to commence trial because the mandatory period will not have yet expired where the application for an extension is timely. Finally, our ruling is preferable because by having the Commonwealth seek an extension the trial court will be notified of the “judicial delay” and can then take steps to cut down on these delays and thereby further protect the right of an accused to a speedy trial.</p>

Although no written complaint was actually filed because of the manner in which the proceedings were initiated instantly, the Comment to Rule 1100 clearly points out that a complaint within the meaning of Rule 1100 includes “special documents used in lieu of a complaint to initiate criminal proceedings in extraordinary circumstance; namely, the presentment of a grand jury . . when submitted to [a] subsequent indicting grand jury.” See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silver, </em><a href="/pa-super/238/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="238 Pa.

Time computations are made in compliance with the Act of November 25, 1970, P.L. 707, No. 230, 1 C.P.S.A. § 1908, and although the precise number of days between the submission of the presentment to the indicting grand jury and the filing of Shelton’s written application for dismissal cannot be determined from the record because the date of submission does not appear in the record, two hundred and ninety-one (291) days lapsed between the date the indictments were returned and the date on which Shelton filed his written motion. Thus, since submission of the presentment necessarily occurred prior to the returning of the indictments, a period of at least two hundred and ninety-one days lapsed between submission and the filing.</p>
