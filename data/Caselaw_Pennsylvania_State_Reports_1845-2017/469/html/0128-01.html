Graham collected the debt, but at the first account the executors failed to include this amount. A surcharge of the executors for this amount was sought. After a review of the record in the court below this Court found that no finding of fact was made by the court below as to why the money had never been collected from Graham and thus the Court could not determine whether the executors had committed negligence. Since none of the assets of the estate were distributed no surcharge was ordered and the case was remanded for a new account, subject to the following:</p>

This result is mandated for many reasons.

Second, appellant notified the executor of his claim and interest and the executor assured appellant that he would be notified at the proper time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Third, the executor of the Stephenson Estate and the executor of the Bittinger Estate are one and the same.

And this occurred after representations were made to both the <em>Stephenson Estate </em>and the appellant for a number of years that they both had a legitimate interest in the <em>Bittinger Estate. </em>We find it inexcusable in this case, where the executor of both estates is the same bank, that the <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>
