      <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>Tlie evidence is clear and convincing and gives us no room to doubt that defendant was justly found guilty. The victim, one Victoria Smolinski, also known as Marie King and Billie Mack, maintained a house of prostitution at 442 Oakford Court, Scranton. At the time of this crime, and for some months prior thereto, she had as inmates of the house three girls, Betty Labos, Virginia Costello and Barbara Newell. These girls had entertained many men in the house during the day and evening of November 27, 1930, which was Thanksgiving Day; and at about 12: 30 A. M. on November 28, 1930, the last visitor having left the house, the three girls were together in the front room downstairs when they heard Marie King scream, “Don’t, Biff, please don’t, Biff, don’t.” The girls were terrified and in doubt what to do, but almost immediately the defendant came down the stairs, walked through the room in which they were, then through the rear room and out the back door, which he did not close after him. They knew him well, having seen him frequently in and about the house, visiting Marie King, over a period of months. Although the room in which they were was dark, they saw him plainly as he came down the steps with the light at the top of the steps shining down upon him, and walked past them and through the rear room in which there was a light. Their identification of him was positive. They had heard Marie King call the defendant “Biff” on many occasions. It was testified by others that he was sometimes called by that name. When the witnesses reached the second floor, they found Marie King lying dead in the rear room in a pool of blood, with a knife at her side.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[271,2026,1152,370]],["BL_173.1",173,[122,328,1158,867]]]'>The defendant was at this house at about 6 o’clock on the evening of November 27th and had dinner there with the deceased. He admitted having returned to the house at about 11: 45, claiming that he had done so to get some money she had promised him. He asserted that he entered the house by the rear door and passed into the front room, and that she joined him. He said she gave <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>him thirty-five dollars and that he left the house almost immediately because she complained of having a headache and asked him to go home. He was not seen going upstairs. Two of the girls, Virginia and Betty, saw him enter the house about 11:30, and saw him with Marie King in the front room. These girls later went upstairs with men, and Betty said that when she went upstairs a second time, she noticed that the defendant and deceased had left the front room, and she testified that when she reached the second floor, Marie King called out to her from the rear room on that floor to “use Virginia’s room.” It was after this witness had returned to the first floor and joined the other girls, and after the last visitor had departed, that the girls heard and recognized Marie King’s voice screaming, “Don’t, Biff, please don’t, Biff, don’t.”</p>
    <p id="b173-3" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[127,1206,1155,751]]]'>The police made a thorough inspection of the premises shortly after the murder. They found all the windows on the second floor closed and nailed. It is obvious that no one entered or left the house by way of those windows. They also found that the only way to reach the second floor was by means of the staircase down which the witnesses testified they saw defendant come. These same witnesses, the inmates of the house, testified that after Barbara Newell had let the last visitor out of the house, shortly before they heard Marie King scream, they and those upstairs, meaning Marie King and Kosh, were the only people remaining in the house. They did not then know he was upstairs but they learned that fact when they saw him come down.</p>

When the defendant was searched after he surrendered to the police at 2 o’clock the same morning, <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>thirty dollars in bills, together with a silver dollar, was found in his clothing. Betty Labos testified that she had handed to Marie King a silver dollar on the previous day, November 27th. The defendant insisted that he had received the silver dollar found on him from Marie King several days before the crime, and that he had kept it because she told him to keep it as a “lucky piece.”</p>
    <p id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[283,709,1153,1023]]]'>Marie King was brutally murdered. There were twenty-five knife wounds on her body, one of which went right through the heart, severing the aorta, which is the main artery leading to the heart. That was the largest and the mortal Avound. The knife found by the side of the deceased was identified as having come from the kitchen of a lunch room which defendant visited less than two hours before the murder. . He insisted that he had remained in the front part of that building and had not gone into the kitchen. The identifying witnesses Avere all connected with the lunch room and were positive in their identification. One of them, the cook, testified that he was accustomed to use the knife in his work, and that about midnight he had occasion to use it and had been unable to find it after diligent search. The defendant had ordered a cup of coffee and a package of cigarettes. He did not pay his bill but told the waiter he would see him later. It is apparent that he did not have any money at that time.</p>
    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[280,1744,1152,532]]]'>There was no eyewitness to the killing. HoAvever, this testimony, while circumstantial, is almost conclusive. It could hardly be stronger, without an eyeAvitness. But the evidence is not entirely circumstantial, for there Avas proof of a confession as well. Stanley Kroptavich, a prisoner in the Lackawanna County Jail during the time the defendant was held there pending trial, testified that he had there become closely acquainted with the defendant and that defendant had told him that he had killed Marie King Avith a knife.</p>

Kosh denied that he went upstairs on the night <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>in question. He stated that he left the house a few minutes before twelve. He claimed he walked about the streets for a little while, then went to the Lackawanna Railroad Station for the purpose of using the lavatory, read a newspaper there, and at about 12:30 went to “Jen Duffy’s” house of prostitution, where he went upstairs with a girl named Patsy. He claimed that after this girl learned his name she told him the police were looking for him, and that he then took a taxicab, went to a lunch room and purchased a sandwich and some cigarettes, and then took another taxicab to the city hall, where he gave himself up.</p>
    <p id="b175-3" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[151,990,1156,536]]]'>It is significant that Kosh was wholly unable to confirm his account of his movements by any witnesses. Even the girl Patsy was not produced as a witness. His own unconfirmed story of his movements from the time he left the house of Marie King until his appearance at the police station, almost two hours later, is all there is in the record on the subject. When he was questioned by the police at the time he gave himself up he refused to give any information, and said he would do his talking in court.</p>

This is proven beyond peradventure by the fact that on February 2,1926, at Syracuse, New York, he pleaded guilty to an assault in the first degree on his wife, committed on January 14,1926, for which he was sentenced to from five to ten years in the Auburn Penitentiary. That was a murderous assault, he having shot his wife twice. At the time of this trial he was twenty-six years old. His criminal record, which is Commonwealth’s Exhibit No. 17, shows that when he was but ten years of age he was twice charged with being guilty of larceny and paroled in the custody of his parents, and that in later years he was frequently arrested for that offense and others, including burglary, to which latter charge he pleaded guilty on December 23, 1922. His criminal record, <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>started at a very early age and continued since, proves conclusively that for years he has been an enemy of society and a dangerous man.</p>

The sole basis fox'' this motion seems to have been the statement by the witness on cx’oss-examinatioxx that his mother had become insane after being injured in a train robbery.</p>

The competency of the witness to testify was not questioned either befox*e or during his testimony or at the time it was concluded. A motion to strike out his testimony was not made at any time. If a party knows before trial that a Avitness is incompetent on account of his mental condition he xxiust make his objection before the witness has given any testimony, and if the incompetency appears on the trial an objection must be interposed as soon as the incompetency becomes apparent (see People v. Enright, <a href="/ill/256/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="256 Ill. 221" data-case-ids="4711198" data-case-paths="/ill/256/0221-01">256 Ill. 221</a>); but we do not rest our decision on these procedural considerations, since defendant’s coxxnsel claim to have been taken by surprise by the testimony of the witness.</p>

Some of these touch on an alleged possible connection with the crime of one Jimmie Mack, with whom Marie King and the inmates of the house lived when not present in the bawdyhouse. The defendant complains of the action of the court below in sustaining an objection to an offer to show by the defendant that Marie King had told him that she feared Jimmie Mack and that he would kill her if he learned that she was giving money earned in the house to the defendant. The alleged purpose of the offer was to show by inference that this fact may have been conveyed to Jimmie Mack, and that would supply a motive for the killing of Marie King by some other person than the defendant. The action of the court in refusing the offer was entirely proper, as there was no evidence in the case tending to connect Mack with the crime, and in the absence thereof this proposed testimony of defendant would at most create a bare conjecture. In Com. v. Bednorciki, <a href="/pa/264/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="264 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="1048480" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0124-01">264 Pa. 124</a>, the defense offered to prove that a third person had made threats against the deceased and that this third person was in the vicinity of the crime when it took place. The court rejected the offer on the ground that there was nothing to connect the third person with the crime, and his action was held proper. The evidence here was similar but even weaker than that which was there offered, and á doubt founded on such evidence would not be reasonable.</p>
    <p id="b181-4" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[157,2099,1157,316]],["BL_182.1",182,[267,344,1155,640]]]'>Similar considerations apply to the refusal of the court to allow a witness to testify that a few days after the murder she was asked by Jimmie Mack to clean the floor of the house, and that when she reported that she was unable to remove the blood stains from the' linoleum, he told her to tear off the portions contain<a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>ing the stains. She was allowed to testify as to what she did, for the purpose of showing changes in the premises, but was not allowed to state that she acted at the instance of Mack. This, like the evidence mentioned in the paragraph next preceding, was of such slight probative value that it was properly rejected. There was testimony to show that Marie King operated the house for Mack, and that he derived whatever profit resulted from its operation, and that he was called by one of the inmates and came to the house immediately after the commission of the crime. His interest in the premises was that of a proprietor.</p>

A close examination of the record shows that most of these questions were subsequently answered in her cross-examination. It is true that she was not permitted to state whether her parents were married when she was born. This question came clearly within the condemnation of the rule forbidding the impeachment of witnesses by matter calculated to humiliate and degrade: Com. v.

In the former case, this court said, at page 104, “A vicious practice had at one time a considerable hold in some states (and to some extent still has in modern England) under the pretense of ‘letting the jury know who the witness is’ of allowing indiscriminate attacks upon the general character <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>and private life of adverse witnesses.
