The action was brought by plaintiffs, husband and wife, to recover damages from the defendant, and the following facts were developed by the plaintiffs at the trial:</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[137,610,1152,372]]]'>At about 11:30 o’clock P. M. on March 31, 1928, one of the plaintiffs, Mrs. Double, was run into and seriously injured by an automobile owned by the defendant. She was walking home at the time, along the edge of the state highway near Chicora, in Butler County. The automobile was being driven by Emerson Double, and he had in the car with him five boy friends.</p>
    <p id="b291-6" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[137,995,1152,370]]]'>Emerson Double was just under eighteen years of age, and had been engaged at odd jobs around the farm of the defendant since he was twelve years old. He was paid one dollar per day for his services. His duties consisted of doing whatever he was told to do, and when requested he drove the automobiles of the members of the family. He was a licensed driver.</p>
    <p id="b291-7" data-blocks='[["BL_291.6",291,[138,1377,1153,371]]]'>The automobile involved in the accident was a Ford runabout, with a box body three feet by five feet attached. It is variously referred to in the testimony as a runabout and a truck. There Avas no name or markings of any kind on it. It was used by the defendant for light hauling, at which times it Avas driven by Emerson Double, who carried the key for the car.</p>
    <p id="b291-8" data-blocks='[["BL_291.7",291,[138,1759,1154,639]]]'>Upon these facts plaintiffs rested their case, claiming that they had created a presumption that at the time of the accident the person in charge' of the automobile was the servant of the defendant and was using it in the •course of his employment and on defendant’s business. They offered no direct evidence as to this, but having shown the ownership of the machine to be in the defendant, and that the driver was employed by him, sought to derive from these facts, and these alone, not only that the person in charge was the defendant’s servant, but also that he was at the time engaged on his master’s business.</p>

This evidence further shows that Emerson Double did not have any authority to take the car out on the night of the accident, and that he did so for his own pleasure and convenience. This is shown by the fact that after he had taken the machine from the garage, he gathered up five boy friends and drove them to a skating rink five or six miles out in the country.
