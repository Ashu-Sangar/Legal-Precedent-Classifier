On receipt of this petition, the commissioners, by resolution, directed surveys, plans, and estimates of the road to be made, and authorized the necessary steps to be followed under the law to take over and improve the road. A petition was later presented to the court of quarter sessions setting forth all the facts required by the Act of May 11, 1911, P. L. 244. It further stated that the township had agreed to pay one-half the cost of construction. Notice of the hearing before the grand jury was given according to law and that body approved the project. No exceptions having been filed during the period fixed therefor and no one appearing to object, the appliéation was approved by a decree nunc pro tunc, entered as of 1923. The court then authorized and directed the county to make the improvement.</p>

Counties and townships do not have common law powers to build or improve roads. When they act in such matters they must point to an act of assembly for authority. In the present instance this authority is found solely in the Act of 1911. The title to the Act of 1917 authorized “boroughs, towns and townships to enter into contracts to aid in the construction......of roads,” and the act used the words “contract,” “with the commissioners,” to “construct an improved highway,” “under the provisions of the Act” of 1911. Thus the authority of the counties to contract was still limited by the Act of 1911, and the legislature, by the Act of 1917, intended the authority contained therein, as it relates to counties, to be taken in connection with the limitations imposed by the Act of 1911.</p>

How could the county formally bind itself to do an act, when the indispensable prerequisite to the doing of this act was the obtaining of the approval of the grand jury and the court of quarter sessions? Upon proper exceptions taken, the court might disallow the petition, and the county would be helpless to carry through the proceedings. If the township had so desired, and, since it had ample notice of all these proceedings, it might, by suitable exceptions, have presented weighty reasons which would have resulted in the disallowance of the project. The county did not even <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>possess the power of eminent domain prior to approval by grand jury and court, nor could the county invite proposals, accept bids, or award contracts for the construction until such approval had been obtained, as section 12 of the act discloses. When, however, the approval of the grand jury and the court has been obtained, section 3 of the Act of 1911 declares that the application shall be approved, and then, with the emphasis of a command, that “the court shall thereupon order the said improvement shall be made and constructed ......; and thereupon......any extension, alteration, etc......., as set forth in said proceedings, shall remain absolute.” From this it appears that, when once the court and grand jury have acted, <em>the county is bound by an order of court </em>to carry through the proposed improvement, unless a subsequent order relieves them, though at no time prior thereto was it free to contract with the township in respect to it; the county, thus situated, has no choice but to proceed, but appellee would have us hold that the township could then withdraw its offer. The authority so to act after the county has obligated itself must appear by plainer and more emphatic words than shown by the several acts of assembly.</p>

These steps would, in law, be an acceptance of the township proposal, and the township would be conclusively bound when the proceedings thus instituted were favorably concluded.

It was not necessary to make such reference. It was only necessary to take official steps to “construct an improved highway” along the route indicated in the township resolution. Under the county resolution, the proper officers took these steps by making a survey, plans, specifications, and estimates of cost, and thereupon petitioned the proper court, setting forth all these matters and asking for the authority provided by the act. The court and grand jury gave such authority, after considering these proceedings together with, — as is more important for this case, — the averment in the petition, with the original resolution of the township attached, that Center Township had agreed to pay one-half the cost. The petition to the court, as an official act, completely evidenced the county’s acceptance of the township’s offer.</p>

It provided the “court shall thereupon order that said improvement shall be made and constructed, in accordance with the plans and surveys accompanying said application;” See section 3 of the Act of 1911. From this it is clear that the township had no voice in the matter of building the highway. How the road was to be constructed, that is, what plans, specifications, or alignments, etc., were to be used, was determined solely by the Act of 1911 and its supplements. Section 2 of the Act of 1917 recognizes this. On that account, under the law, the county was not obliged nor permitted to enter at any time into a formal contract with the township covering the subject-matter of the Act of 1911, as supplemented by the Act of 1917. It may be well to say that, while as between individuals dealing with similar business matters, something should be known of the cost, etc., before entering into a con<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>tract, yet the State in dealing with its property in the hands of its agents has determined otherwise.</p>

But here the township did nothing, though it had notice at all times of the proceedings before the court and the action of the county in relation to the contract. This was the effect of the notice given through the newspapers under the court’s direction. There can be no doubt that the commissioners, when they acted, followed the order of the court to improve the road under the plans and specifications then submitted at equal cost to the County of Greene and- the Township of Center, and let a contract; it was then too late for the township to avoid its responsibility, even if it might have attempted to do so, which it did not.

Apparently this agreement can be entered into after the county highway has been constructed to the borough limits, and, as section 18 says, “where the failure of said borough to improve said highway within its limits would leave a break or unimproved section in such a continuous highway.” Then according to this section 18 “proper officials of the borough [can] enter into an agreement with the county commissioners” to build a road “which will connect the two ends of such highway or highways.”</p>

L. 291. These contracts with either borough or township authorities can be made before or after the grand jury and court of quarter sessions have approved the proposed road. It is not at all unusual for agents to enter into contracts subject to the approval of their principals or of coordinate authority, just as, for example, the president of the United States enters into treaties (contracts) with foreign governments subject to the approval of a coordinate branch of the government, to wit, the United States Senate. The majority opinion asks, “How could the county formally bind itself to do an act, when the indispensable prerequisite to the doing of this act was the obtaining of the approval of the grand jury and the court of quarter sessions?” The answer to that query is that the county did not have to formally bind itself by contract with the township to build a road before the necessary approval of the grand jury and the court of quarter sessions was obtained but it could enter into a contract, definite in all its terms, with the township whereby both the county and the township would be bound to share the cost of the road in the event that the grand jury and the court of quarter sessions later approved the proposed road; or the county commissioners could wait until such approval had been obtained and then enter into a contract with the supervisors providing for the township’s bearing a share of the cost of the highway. If the township refused to enter into such a contract after the approval of the court and grand jury had been obtained for the proposed road, and the commissioners then felt that they had been misled by the expressed willingness of the township supervisors to enter into negotiations leading to a contract to pay a proportion of the cost of the road through the township, it would be a simple matter for <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>the county commissioners to petition the court and ask that the previous order made at the commissioners’ request for the construction of the proposed road be vacated. The better practice undoubtedly would be for the commissioners and township supervisors first to enter into a formal and definite contract to share the cost of the construction of the road through the township, and in that contract to provide that it would not be given legal effect until the approval of the proposed road by the court and the grand jury had been obtained.</p>

The first case lays down this principle at page 401: “The question to be decided under section 20 of the [Practice] Act, which provides only ‘a substitute......for the common law demurrer’ (Hutchinson Baking Co. v. Marvel, <a href="/pa/270/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="270 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="1065994" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0378-01">270 Pa. 378</a>, 381), is not whether the statement is so clear, in both form and specification, as to entitle plaintiff, without amendment, to <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>proceed to trial, but whether, upon the facts averred, it shows, as ‘a question of law,’ that plaintiff is not entitled to recover.” It is obvious to me in the case now before us tliat as a matter of law plaintiff under the facts averred was not entitled to recover. The court below was right, I think, in so ruling. The second case holds that even if a statement of claim in trespass is insufficient yet if it is evident that a better statement of facts could show an enforceable claim, the court should grant plaintiff leave to file a further statement of claim within a limited time. However in the second case this court agreed with the court below that recovery could not be had even under the facts set forth in plaintiff’s petition to file an amended statement. The plaintiff in the case now before us makes no claim that any material fact was omitted from its pleadings, and it is not evident that any better statement of facts was possible. On the contrary it is evident that plaintiff’s action was brought on a contract that never existed. If the case had proceeded to triál on a nonexistent contract, it would have been the duty of the trial judge to give binding instructions for the defendant.</p>

This furnishes further proof of the fact that if the resolution passed by the township supervisors on February 5,1919, can be construed as an offer to pay one-half the cost of improving the 12,140 feet of Oak Forest Road which in the resolution the supervisors declared the county commissioners contemplated taking over for the purpose of improving and reconstructing the same, this “offer” was never accepted by' the commissioners in <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>terms identical with it.
