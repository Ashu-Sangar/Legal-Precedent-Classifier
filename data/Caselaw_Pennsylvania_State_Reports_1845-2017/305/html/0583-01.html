To hold that such thing could be done would be to create a simple device to defraud creditors.</p>
    <p id="b613-3" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[118,714,1153,861]]]'>However, under the authorities noted, as the judge of an orphans’ court possesses equity powers, equitable principles will prevail, and we will regard that as being done which should have been done. When land of an estate is sold in another state and the surpluses remitted to the executor or administrator in this State, such fund is liable to the claims of domiciliary creditors, and the balance will be distributed according to law in the state where the land is located: Well’s Est., supra. In this State the surplus from a sale of land for the payment of debts, after debts are paid, is distributable as the real estate would have descended or has been disposed of by will: Dyer v. Cornell, <a href="/pa/4/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="4 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="401911" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0359-01">4 Pa. 359</a>; Pennel’s App., <a href="/pa/20/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="20 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="972313" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0515-01">20 Pa. 515</a>; Buck’s Est., <a href="/pa/256/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="256 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1030727" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0359-01">256 Pa. 359</a>; Hubert’s Est., <a href="/pa/181/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="181 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="891422" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0551-01">181 Pa. 551</a>; Large’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Pa.%20385" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="54 Pa. 385">54 Pa. 385</a>; Wentz’s App., <a href="/pa/126/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="126 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="968875" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0541-01">126 Pa. 541</a>, 551.</p>

Van Horn, <a href="/pa/265/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="265 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="1051892" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0549-01">265 Pa. 549</a>, 556; hence there was no necessity for further administration. This conclusion ignores what took place when the land was converted. It may be the administrator, without court authority, has paid these debts, but the fact remains debts existed when the fund was raised, and that would fix the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court. Appellees argue that the claim of the administrator Wesley W. Wolfe for his administration of so much of that estate is a live unsettled claim and it is not known if the parties who signed the' agreement are all the heirs. However this may be, these funds having been earmarked in the bank’s custody as the prop<a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>erty of the estate, it is asking too much of that custodian to assume the liability incident to paying them out without an adjudication of the estate through the proper statutory channel where all possible interests may appear and be heard.</p>
    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[269,606,1152,854]]]'>Appellant relies on Parsons v. Miller, 189 Illinois 107, where the heirs had agreed that the proceeds of real estate sold in West Virginia by a trust should be distributed by the law of Illinois, but it is not in point. If these were all the facts in this case, of course that decision would be persuasive, but they are not. The facts here bring the instant case under the decisions we have cited. We do not attempt to distribute the surplus from the sale of the real estate in North Dakota according to the laws of Pennsylvania; we recognize the rule that a surplus arising from the sale of lands in another state after paying domiciliary creditors must be distributed in accordance with the law of that state. No doubt in case of intestacy, the heirs, here appellants, are the proper parties to receive the funds. See Well’s Est., supra.</p>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[267,1473,1153,853]]]'>The court below in its adjudication finds that, after a lapse of 35 years, there could be no claims against the estate, and we held in Trestrail, Admr., v. Johnson, Sheriff, <a href="/pa/298/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="298 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1120352" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0388-01">298 Pa. 388</a>, 392, that an administrator d. b. n. could not take from the administrator of an estate moneys collected by him or standing to his credit as administrator, for this would interfere with the statement of the account and deprive the estate of the means of reimbursement for payménts made and for services rendered. We do not outline the procedure but at present we do not see how the appointment of an administrator d. b. n. of Charles S. Wolfe’s Estate can be avoided. However, defendant cannot be charged with conversion of the funds and bonds of the estate, and the court below was correct in refusing appellants’ motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</p>
