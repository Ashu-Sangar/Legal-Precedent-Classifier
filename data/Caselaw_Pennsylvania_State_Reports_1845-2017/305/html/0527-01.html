The defendant, to the contrary, contends that the true intent and meaning is and was that payments should be made to plaintiffs quarterly at the rate of $20 per pound per annum based upon tests of the first minute pressure in six-inch casing, such tests to be made quarterly for the purpose of determining the royalty due for each quarter.</p>

Their testimony was to the following effect: that shortly before the making of the lease large producing wells had been drilled on neighboring property and that representatives of the American Natural Gas Company called on them several times for the purpose of negotiating a lease; that these representatives proposed a flat rate which plaintiffs refused demanding a pound pressure basis; that the representatives advised them that a flat rate would be more to their advantage, as the company might reduce the pressure by pumping the wells if they leased on a pressure basis, which would diminish their payments under the lease, and that then <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>they conceived the idea of leasing at a flat rate, this rate to be determined, however, once and for all, by the result of the first pressure test.

He and others testified that it was the custom or usagé in Indiana County “that wells which are based upon a minute pressure gauge and royalty paid for quarterly, such tests are taken at the middle of the quarter in which the payment is due.” He stated this custom was followed where the lease has no express provision when a test shall be taken; and that the custom had existed <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>to Ms knowledge for more than fifteen years, and was well known to those in the oil and gas business.

With this we cannot agree. It seems to us that the phrase might well bear either the meaning ascribed to it by the plaintiffs or that ascribed to it by defendant, and that it is necessary to resort to extrinsic evidence to remove the doubt.

DeHaas, <a href="/pa/98/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="98 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="496889" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0292-01">supra,</a> there was a contract to erect certain dams “in a good and sufficient manner, as flood dams should be built in such streams......” It was held that parol evidence was admissible to explain the understanding of the parties at the time of the ex<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>ecution of the contract as to how the dams were to be built. This court said: “To us it seems obvious that, in order to make this intelligible to a jury, some explanation was necessary, either from experts or from the understanding of the parties expressed at the time of the making of the contract, but of these two methods of arriving at the meaning of this agreement, the latter was the better, as being the interpretation given to it by those most interested, hence, the one which would be the most likely to express their intention.” In Edmonds v. First Nat. Bank, <a href="/pa/215/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="215 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="948297" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0547-01">supra,</a> a written contract provided that the plaintiff was to do all the work on a certain building which was “properly brick work.” The obligation to do all the brick work was made clear by the agreement, but what was “properly brick work” was not. It was held competent in aid of the construction of the writing to admit parol evidence to prove the understanding of the parties at the time in respect to it. The ambiguity here is of the same nature, and the evidence was “properly received, not to vary the writing, but to explain the meaning of doubtful terms”: White Heat Products Co. v. Thomas, <a href="/pa/266/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="266 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1056022" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0551-01">266 Pa. 551</a>. It was also clearly proper to admit evidence of the extrinsic circumstances surrounding the parties at the time the agreement was made: Meigs v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/164/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="164 Pa. 597" data-case-ids="860282" data-case-paths="/pa/164/0597-01">164 Pa. 597</a>; Garvin v.

Since the interpretation of the expression depended on the effect of parol testimony, it was a question for the jury: Laidley v. Rowe, <a href="/pa/275/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="275 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1075665" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0389-01">275 Pa. 389</a>. See also Phila. v.

This evidence came into the case on cross-examination of defendant’s witnesses for the purpose of contradicting their testimony. Whether the evidence had this effect was a question for the jury. It was also offered for the pur<a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>pose of rebutting any idea of a well-established custom or usage, as testified to by the same witnesses.

Northern Coal &amp; Iron Co., <a href="/pa/162/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="162 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="856741" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0114-01">162 Pa. 114</a>; Advance Industrial Supply Co. v.

    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[299,1161,1154,1075]]]'>It is hard to escape the thought, that on November 17, 1926, when defendant by its assistant general manager wrote to plaintiffs, the company then regarded the consideration under the lease as having been fixed by the first minute pressure taken upon the completion of the well. The letter says: “Your refusal to change the royalty provision has caused us to reconsider the matter. We will now pay the royalty as provided for in the lease......” The assistant general manager, who wrote the letter, testified: “Q. You wanted a different basis than was provided in this lease? A. Yes. Q. And Mr. Laney refused to change that basis? A. Yes.” This letter and testimony is truly significant and would seem to be almost conclusive that at that time the defendant did not believe that the lease provided for quarterly pressure takings and payments based thereon, but desired to change to that basis. The fact that defendant apparently placed that construction on the contract was strong evidence that the words were intended to have the meaning alleged by plaintiffs.</p>
