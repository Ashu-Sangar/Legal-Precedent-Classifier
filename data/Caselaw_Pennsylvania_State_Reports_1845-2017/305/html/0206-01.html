The bill alleged attempts by defendants to induce plaintiff’s workers to join defendant union, though knowing that by so doing the workers would violate the terms of the written “individual contract” under which they were respectively employed by plaintiff. A preliminary injunction was issued, which after answer and hearing was made permanent. Budenz, who was not an employee of plaintiff, nor a member of either the national or local organizations, alone has appealed.</p>

Briefly stated, the controlling findings are: Plaintiff company does not recognize any labor union, and employs approximately 700 persons, of which number, 241 men and women are workers in its hosiery mill. On June 20, 1929, plaintiff requested each of its employees to sign what the pleadings refer to as an “individual contract.” The terms of this contract were: that the signer was not a member of the American Federation of Full Fashioned Hosiery Workers, or affiliated with it or similar organizations, that if the signer concluded to join an organization of the character of the bodies referred to, he would withdraw from plaintiff company’s employ and not before that time make efforts to unionize the other employees, and that he understood plaintiff company was to “run non<a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>union, and agrees with me that it will run non-union while I am in its employ.” The court found that the hosiery company practiced no fraud or duress in inducing its employees to sign the agreement, and that each signer was afforded full opportunity to read and understand the contract before adopting its terms.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[291,680,1153,804]]]'>The court found that Budenz, an attorney-at-law residing in the City of Rahway, New Jersey, and White, the secretary of the Reading Branch, Local No. 10, as representatives of the American Federation of Hosiery Workers, of which defendant union is a branch, visited Nazareth and by addresses, both spoken and written, at meetings attended by plaintiff’s employees, induced a number of the company’s employees to violate their agreement with plaintiff and enroll in defendant union, and that they, Budenz and White, published and distributed pamphlets among plaintiff’s employees, which the court found were for the purpose of unionizing such persons, inducing them to violate their contracts and exciting the minds of Nazareth citizens against plaintiff company.</p>

Appellant himself was one of the pickets and his claim that defendant’s actions Avere legal and peaceably persuasive was not sustained by the chancellor.</p>

Throughout, defendants had knowledge of the contracts and their terms. These contracts were mutually binding; their provisions and the method of their procurement, upon the facts as found, were not against public policy. As this court said in Flaccus v. Smith, <a href="/pa/199/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="199 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="922910" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0128-01">199 Pa. 128</a>, 136, “The appellee had an unquestioned right, in the conduct of his business to employ workmen who were independent of any labor union, and he had the further right to adopt a system of apprenticeship which excluded his apprentices from membership in a union. He was responsible to no one for his reasons in adopting such a system, and no one had a right to interfere with it to his prejudice or injury.” In American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council et al., <em><a href="/citations/?q=257%20U.S.%20185" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="257 U.S. 185">257 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=257%20U.S.%20185" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="257 U.S. 185">U. S. 185</a>, 209, the court said of labor unions, “they may use all lawful propaganda to enlarge their membership,” but “the principle of the unlawfulness of maliciously enticing laborers still remains and action may be maintained therefore in proper cases...... The elements to sustain actions for persuading employees to leave an employer are first, the malice or absence of lawful excuse, and, second, the actual injury.” The chancellor’s findings, amply supported by the evidence, establish both these elements. Appellant’s contention that the measures resorted to in this case were lawful simply because they stopped short of physical violence or coercion through fear of it, is not sustainable. Such violation of plaintiff’s legal and contractual rights as to the facts here show it to be, — irrespective of the fact that breaches of the peace by defendants were not shown, — a violation entitling plaintiff to equitable relief, as has been held where other combinations were formed to procure con<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>certed breaches of contract by an employer’s employees: Flaccus v.

As we have frequently and recently said, where the findings of the chancellor are affirmed by the court in banc, which is the case here, and upon appeal such findings appear to be supported by proof sufficient to require their submission to a jury in a trial at law, we will not disturb these findings: Foley v. Barnett, <a href="/pa/303/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="303 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1130074" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0218-01">303 Pa. 218</a>, and cases there cited.</p>

He contended below and here that the contract between plaintiff and its employees was illegal and unenforceable. This was a mistake. The fact that neither party thereto was bound for any definite term, but only while the relation voluntarily continued, does not vitiate the contract. Plaintiff had exactly the same right to refuse to employ union members, whether for a definite or an indefinite term, as its employees had to refuse to enter its employ for such term, except as members of the union. Plaintiff had the same right, unless controlled by a contract, to refuse to continue in its employ those who had become union members, as its employees had to refuse to continue in its employ unless it discharged all but union members. It follows that plaintiff’s agreement that --“If at any time while I am employed by the Kraemer Hosiery Co. [plaintiff] I want to become connected with the American Federation of Full Fashioned Hosiery Workers’ Union, or any organized labor body, I agree to withdraw from the employment of said company, and agree that while I am in the employ of that company I will not make any efforts among its employees to bring about the unionization of that factory against the company’s wishes,” was a valid and binding contract, and appellant’s oft-repeated contention to the contrary is wholly in conflict with the decisions of this and other appellate courts. That agi’eement did not pre<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>vent the employees from later becoming members of the union — their right so to do, is, on the contrary, distinctly recognized, — but merely required them to withdraw from plaintiff’s employment should they thus change their status; and it did not prevent them from making efforts to unionize the factory, — for their right to do this is also distinctly recognized, — but simply inquired them, so far as concerned making such “efforts among its employees,” to refrain from so doing “while I am in the employ of that company.” Assuming plaintiff was privileged, as Ave have shown it was, to have its factory operated exclusively by non-union employees, the regulations quoted Avere, according to the decisions of this and other appellate courts, both reasonable and proper to that end, the employees were without right to violate them while their employment continued, and appellant and those associated Avith him were not privileged to combine together, as admittedly they did, to induce the employees to breach their respective contracts.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[121,1423,1158,972]],["BL_238.1",238,[280,323,1155,696]]]'>On the other hand, appellant was free to act, by peaceful persuasion, at a proper time and in a proper way, by the spoken, written or printed word, to induce employees who had signed those agreements to withdraw from plaintiff’s employ and affiliate with the union, and, as already stated, their contracts recognized that privilege. Had this been the course pursued an injunction could not properly have been granted. Appellant also had the right, at a proper time and in a proper Avay, to point out to plaintiff’s employees that their contracts, Avhether legal or illegal, were unwise, and hence the employees should exercise their privilege to “withdraw from the employment of said company.” This much is secured to the citizen by the constitutional provision that: “The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.” This declara<a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>tion is no higher, however, than the one which sustains the inviolability of legal contracts, and hence any attempt, by speaking, writing or printing, wrongfully to induce an employee to break his contract with his employer, thereby causing irreparable injury to the latter, malíes the one so acting “responsible for the abuse of that liberty.” It is not always easy to determine when speaking, writing and printing becomes an actionable abuse, especially in labor troubles, but, as we have already pointed out, this difficulty does not exist in the present case. We accordingly approve the granting of an injunction against appellant, but modify the final decree as regards him, so that it shall provide as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b238-3" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[277,1031,1155,750]]]'>“That appellant, Lewis Francis Budenz, his agents, servants, employees and every of them, be and they hereby are perpetually enjoined and restrained from using threats or intimidation, from sending libelous and scandalous letters, pamphlets or newspaper, and from picketing plaintiff’s plant in combination with others, for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce employees of the Kraemer Hosiery Company, plaintiff, while still in its employ, to become connected with the American Federation of Full Fashioned Hosiery Workers, or any of its local branches, or with any other organized labor body, or for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce them to make efforts to bring about the unionization of plaintiff’s factory.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[277,1793,1150,96]]]'>As thus modified the decree of the court below is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at appellant’s costs.</p>

    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[144,447,1158,1900]]]'>I am of the opinion that the so-called individual contract considered in connection with or as part of the contract arising from the relation of employer and employee is not a contract as that term is understood in law. What it attempts to do lacks the important element of consideration. The promises of both employer and employee are illusory. Neither employer nor employee binds himself to any fixed term of employment, nor to the wages to be paid. Although the employer promised to run his plant nonunion while the employee was in his employ, and' the employee agreed not to join the union while he was in his employ, either could terminate the employment at will. “A promise to employ as long as it suits the employer is insufficient consideration. And in any case where a promise in terms or in effect provides that the promisor has a right to choose one of two or more alternatives, and by choosing one will escape without suffering a detriment or giving the other party a benefit, the promise is insufficient consideration.” Williston on Contracts, volume 1, section 104, page 219. No legal damage could be predicated on the fact that an employer decided to run a union shop, or, on the converse of it, a non-union shop. Everything attempted to be protected or guaranteed by the individual contract existed without it as a lawful right appertaining to the relation of employer and employee, if and when either of them attempted to exercise any of the lights intended to be thus protected. Reducing the elements of such relation to writing does not add anything to their force or validity. Since the so-called individual contract added nothing to the employee’s or employer’s right in their relation as such, and did not take away any right from either while in that relation, it created no property right that differed in any way from the ordinary relation of employer and employee.</p>

      <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>A similar view as to such contracts appears to be the ground on which the recent New York labor disputes were decided. See Exchange Bakery and Restaurant, Inc. v. Rifkin, <a href="/ny/245/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="245 N.Y. 260" data-case-ids="1979772" data-case-paths="/ny/245/0260-01">245 N. Y. 260</a>. While there was no promise on the part of the employer to run his shop nonunion, apparently this difference was of no moment, as appears from Interborough Rapid Transit Co. v. Lavin, <a href="/ny/247/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="247 N.Y. 65" data-case-ids="1983688" data-case-paths="/ny/247/0065-01">247 N. Y. 65</a>, at page 79: “Though the plaintiff’s employees are prohibited by the plaintiff from joining that association or union, the union may, despite the prohibition, attempt to recruit its members from those employees at least where the prohibition is not part of a contract of employment for a definite term.”</p>
    <p id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[251,1042,1154,1015]]]'>Something is said concerning an employee secretly joining the union and continuing his employment under such individual contracts; while so doing he would be acting under a lie, and it was urged that courts should recognize this abuse of the relationship of employer and employee and enforce the terms of this agreement. It may be that such a situation could arise; but such a promise amounts to no more than the implied promise in every contract of employment that the employee while in service will conduct himself in a gentlemanly way toward his employer and his work. Such promise does not create a right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution nor does the power of the court extend to the punishment of such wrongs. Courts cannot take cognizance of acts of this kind; if they did, there would be no limit to the volume of their business. It is only when a lie hurts in terms of legal damage that the constitutional inhibition may be invoked or that courts will act.</p>

That is not denied. Nor would such concerted action to do a lawful act be an unlawful conspiracy. If, however, the means employed to attain their ends is legally condemned, the original act as well as subsequent ones would have all the elements of an unlawful conspiracy.</p>

It is not denied that appellant, with others, in their concerted action to organize a union, agreed to use as one of the methods the articles complained of, and to circulate them directly among the employees. They were singled out as the persons to be directly acted on by the method above stated, and by mailing copies to them. Appellant Budenz does not deny writing the articles nor does he deny the purpose or effect intended by the articles. Defendants were out to form a union and they used the most convenient means at command. The articles were intended to create dissatisfaction and unrest among the workers, to hold the officials of the Kraemer Company up to ridicule, to cause the employees to feel that it would be beneath their <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>position as men and women to associate with or work for the men mentioned in these articles, and ultimately to organize a union in the plant so that the employees could be fully protected in all their rights. The articles were abusive at times, also at times unfair, and in certain instances parts were untrue. We are then not left to conjecture as to the actuating influence which caused some of the employees to join the union. This was done by at least seven, and when they were discharged from employment for that reason, as the employer had a legal right to do, the natural result followed. The rest of the employees, or the greater part of them, twenty only remaining of 240, walked out in sympathy with those discharged.</p>

To secure a complete severance of the relation of employer and employee, close down the plant or secure recognition of the union, the strikers commenced a series of acts which have been held by this court and by the Supreme Court of the United States to be unlawful. These acts are described by the court below as follows: “.....The employees that remained faithful.....were annoyed, not by the defendants, it is true, but by other employees of the hosiery company who were out on strike and these latter endeavored to have......the employees who remained at work......leave the employment of the hosiery company. The influence that was brought to bear upon them was by applying opprobrious and vile expressions to those who remained at work, and, in addition to these matters, those on strike picketed the company’s plant, and, by expressions which the pickets used, tried to dissuade those who remained at work from continuing in their employment. In some cases violence was resorted to, but the element of violence up to the time of the hearing was inconsequential.”</p>

Among those <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>picketing were William Montplaisir and Joseph Reinert. These two men were named by Reinert as the ringleaders of the union movement within the factory, and, while the movement was in progress, Budenz, with knowledge of their activity, met them at the home of Reinert, where the situation was discussed. We need not repeat all the testimony on this subject or the evidence as to threats, vile names and other matters that took place.</p>

All these acts are within the preventive power of an injunction, and it is such acts which should be restrained. While appellant was not personally present at all the picketing or other acts mentioned above, the strike and the acts which followed are the natural and logical result of a combination which became unlawful because of the means used to secure the end desired. The appellant was as much responsible for these unlawful acts as though he had actually participated in them.</p>

[Our acts of assembly] recognize the right of bodies of men to combine and to refuse to work for insufficient wages, or because of inhuman, offensive or unjust treatment, and to procure others to do likewise. Such combinations have elsewhere been declared lawful.

The company claims that the men made as much under <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>the two-machine system as under the one-machine system, but several employees referred to this new system as a “wage cut” or a “wage reduction,” and there was an employee’s testimony that “nobody was in favor of it.” Defendant Earl White, of Reading, a representative of the American Federation of Full Fashioned Hosiery Workers, after first going to Nazareth on his own accord to make a field investigation, went there in April, 1929, by invitation of a part of the workers of the Kraemer Hosiery Mill. A meeting of workers was held at Easton.

So what was the use of reading it?” Employee Joseph Reinert testified that “there was a pile of them [i. e., these individual contract forms] on the desk,” and President Schmidt said to the men that “it will be a long vacation if you don’t sign it.” Many of the employees were married men with families to support. On June 20, 1929, many of these men, given the choice of signing the contracts or losing their jobs, signed the contracts. Some of the signers were under twenty-one years of age. Some refused to sign the contract and were discharged.</p>

He replied: “Holding public meetings, in order that the people of Nazareth might understand just what the issues were...... I didn’t get that far when the injunction came along. These public meetings were designed to create public sentiment in the community.” In a letter dated September 27,1929, addressed to President Schmidt of the plaintiff company and offered in evidence, Mr. Budenz said: “We believe that the fair way to meet the various issues raised is by the American method of discussion and debate. We are satisfied that the ‘yellow dog’ contract......cannot be defended in any American forum. We know full well that the long and inhuman hours for the night force are incapable of defense, as also are the wage scales at the Kraemer Mill.

When millions of men are out of work, the loss of his job means to the wage-earner a threat of starvation for himself, his wife and children. It often means the sacrifice of a home which he has acquired by years of labor and frugality. It means inability to properly clothe and educate his family. Even in prosperous times the threat of losing a job is a powerful compulsion. To a man who resides in a small town the loss of his job means that he must separate himself from his home and his friends and seek sustenance among strangers. When most labor was unskilled, the loss of a job was not a serious matter for a new one was usually at hand. In these days of specialization, the loss of a job is to a wage-earner a calamity.

Those employers who frankly recognize the right of employees to unite and to make their united voices heard in matters affecting the conditions of their employment are, according to my view, not only in harmony with the spirit of the age but are showing farsighted self-interest, for reactionism always begets radicalism.</p>

In a battle of ideas the agencies of government should always be neutral. Ideas should be fought out in a fair field. Truth is the best antidote for error.

In the appellees’ paper book appears the following statement: “Even assuming that the individual contract termed the ‘Yellow Dog’ contract was obtained by duress, and further assuming that it is against public policy, we contend that in this action no advantage can be taken of these facts, since none of the employees who signed the contract are parties to the action, and the general rule is well-established and laid down in 13 C. J. 508 as follows: ‘The defense of illegality, although open to the parties and those claiming under them, cannot, as a general rule, be invoked by third persons.’ The defendants in this action are third parties, entirely unrelated to the contract, and therefore they have no standing to invoke the illegality of the contract, whether it be illegal on account of having been obtained by duress, or whether the contract is illegal as against public policy.” An examination of the cases cited in the footnote to this principle in 13 Corpus Juris discloses that it applies to cases not in the remotest degree analagous to the case before us. However, the sentence unquoted by appellees, though immediately following in Corpus Juris the sentence quoted, is most pertinent to the present case. It reads as follows: “This rule is of course subject to an exception, where it is attempted to assert rights based on the contract, where the illegality of the contract appears from plaintiff’s own showing, or where the interests of the person asserting the invalidity are affected.” Among the cases cited in the footnote to the second sentence of that paragraph in <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>13 Corpus Juris, section 458, page 508, is the case of Cumberland Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v.

The defendants are being enjoined from exercising fundamental rights on the theory that the plaintiffs had “property rights” in the contract invoked and harm to this “property” might result from defendants’ discussions. The law should no more recognize these anti-union contracts than it recognizes “white slave” contracts. Both contracts are at war with public welfare. If a union organizer cannot go to Nazareth, Pa:, and by speech and writing endeavor to create public opinion favorable to unionism because an employer of 241 workmen in that town has a property right in an anti-union individual contract signed by those workmen, it follows that a union organizer cannot go to Philadelphia or any other large city and endeavor to create sentiment favorable to unionism if an employer of a few workmen in that city has a property right in an anti-union contract signed by those employees. It follows also that a mother could not, without running the risk of being enjoined by a court of equity, advise an affianced daughter that her contract to marry was undesirable and improvident. The other contracting party might contend that he had a property right in that contract, and that his prospective mother-in-law should be enjoined from any attempted interference with it. Employers of labor have no peculiarly sacred rights in their contracts with employees and courts of equity cannot in order to protect such contracts infringe on the constitutional rights of others.</p>

If Budenz cannot say, write or publish anything which might result in the Kraemer employees while still in the company’s employ becoming members of the American Federation of Full Fashioned Hosiery Workers, then any <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>speech by -whomsoever made or any newspaper by whomsoever published which might have the same result is equally subject to injunction.

The decree of the court below does not even mention picketing. Apparently, the picketing charged in this court’s opinion and in the concurring opinion is picketing by appearing at the gates of the Kraemer plant and distributing the pamphlets known as “The Nazareth Hosiery Worker” to the employees. This is not picketing. The very essence of picketing is the attempt to induce employees to strike. The court below completely exculpates the appellant, Budenz, from this charge, saying in his fourth finding of fact: “There is no evidence that Mr. Budenz counseled any of the employees of the Kraemer Hosiery Company to strike in the present controversy.” The majority opinion refers to “picketing brought about by the printed matter issued by defendants.” The concurring opinion says that “Budenz,..... in addition to writing these articles and publishing and circulating generally the newspaper in which they were published,......personally appeared at the gates of the plant and distributed them to the employees as they left the plant.” I hold that if Budenz distributed these pamphlets to the employees as they left the plant he did only what he had a perfectly lawful right to do, but ac<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>cording to the opinion and decree of the court below he did not even do that much. The court below said: “The first of these pamphlets was distributed by hand and from house to house, Mr. Budenz talcing part in the distribution, but after the passage of an ordinance, prohibiting the distribution of printed matter within the Borough of Nazareth without a permit being obtained from the chief burgess, and license fee paid, on September 3, 1929, the last three issues were sent through the United States mail.” If this constitutes “picketing,” it is certainly lawful picketing. Picketing, i. e., persuasion of workmen to strike, is not unlawful unless it is accompanied by threats or abuse. This court held in 1894 in Cote v. Murphy et al., <a href="/pa/159/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="159 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="850165" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0420-01">159 Pa. 420</a>, that the right of workmen to quit work and “by all lawful means, such as reasoning and persuasion,” to “prevent other workmen from working for less” was “clear.”</p>

When Budenz was on the stand in this case he was asked if he had written in the Nazareth Hosiery Worker a statement that the [individual] contract is against the basic idea of Americanism, that men and women should be free to have such political and economic beliefs as they wish to have. He answered, “Yes.” He was then asked, “Is that your conviction?” He answered, “Absolutely.” He was then asked, “Upon what is that conviction based?” He answered, “Upon my understanding of the whole principle and philosophy on which this Republic stands, <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>which is contained in the real American idea of democracy, freedom of speech, press and assemblage, freedom of one man to do and join that which he wishes, provided he commits no unlawful act.” I uphold Budenz in his assertion of his right to freedom of speech, press and assemblage as he exercised that right, for I find nowhere in' the record any evidence that in the exercise of that right he committed any unlawful act.

I could not do so even if I considered the individual contract legal, instead of utterly illegal and void, as I do hold it. To enjoin the dissemination of ideas because they may result in a breach of some contract is to my mind a doctrine both novel and utterly impracticable in application. If this is the law, a manufacturer of automobiles or of any other product who advertises his product as superior would be subject to injunction at the instance of a competing manufacturer, because some person who had contracted to buy the latter’s product might as a result of that advertising breach his contract. By the same legal logic, anyone publicly proclaiming the wisdom of an exclusively vegetarian diet would be subject to an injunction at the instance of any meat dealer whose contract to supply meat to a customer might be breached upon that customer’s conversion to vegetarianism. Furthermore, as I have already pointed out, the individual contract in this case would not be breached unless the employee <em>both </em>joined the union <em>and </em>remained in plaintiffs’ employ, and plaintiffs could prevent this breach simply by dismissing the employee.</p>

      <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>What plaintiffs sought to and did restrain by injunction was nothing more or less than Budenz’s public advocacy of trades-unionism because eventually this advocacy might result in the growth of trades-union sentiment in and about plaintiffs’ plant, and this might lead to the unionization of the plant, with higher wages and shorter hours for the employees and some possible diminution of the employer’s profits. An injunction against this public advocacy is to my mind insupportable. I think Budenz’s right to say and publish what he did and to do what he did is embedded in the fundamental law of both the State and the nation. The decree appealed from is in effect an injunction against Budenz’s ideas, not against his acts, for not a single unlawful act did or could the court below find against him. That decree should therefore be entirely reversed and set aside, for ideas are not subject to injunction. Ideas have far reaching effects. Some of these effects may be good and some may be evil, but it is opposed to progress and contrary to the spirit of our institutions to entrust any official with the arbitrary power to say what ideas shall be liberated and what ideas shall be suppressed. As Justice Holmes said in his dissenting opinion in Gitlow v. New York, <a href="/us/268/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="268 U.S. 652" data-case-ids="13126" data-case-paths="/us/268/0652-01">268 U.

Hallis, in his recently published work on “Corporate Personality” (pages 242 and 243) profoundly observes: “Law is not static. It is in its nature evolutionary and dynamic, for it has its foundation in the evolutionary and dynamic process of social history. It is born of a struggle for right which is the real scene of all legal formation, and it is, therefore, in the adjustment of competing claims that its true function lies. Law is conditioned by the ac<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>tual nature of the wills which impel the social machine as well as by the normative demands of juristic idealism. Whereas it always has a moral background because it is always an attempt at just law, it is also an empirical phenomenon, because it derives its sanction from those whom it governs.”</p>
