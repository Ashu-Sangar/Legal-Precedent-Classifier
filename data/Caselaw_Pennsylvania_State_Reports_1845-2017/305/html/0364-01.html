The plaintiff had knowledge of this as early as June, 1918. In 1920 a committee of two of the directors of the coal company was appointed to consider plaintiff’s complaint. No action was taken in the matter by this committee. The plaintiff filed this bill on March 21, 1930. In it he set forth that the coal company and the mining company had entered into an arrangement whereby the mining company was given the use of the coal company’s established business, good will, its equipment, etc., to the benefit of which all four stockholders of the coal company were entitled, whereas by the arrangement the benefit of this went to the other three stockholders and directors of the coal company who were at the same time partners in the mining company. He prayed that the coal company render an accounting for all its transactions with the mining company since the year 1917.</p>

In the prayer of plaintiff’s bill, he asks that the three directors of the coal company, who are interested in the mining company or their legal representatives state an account<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>ing showing all payments of money received by them through the mining company.

    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[280,1167,1152,914]]]'>The court below held that the laches were fatal and dismissed the bill saying, inter alia, “The general principle is that nothing can call forth the court of chancery into activity but conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence: Kinter v.

The doctrine is founded on the equity maxim that ‘equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber upon their rights.’ Its object is in general to exact of the complainant fair dealing with his adversary, and the rule was adopted largely because, after great lapse of time, from death of parties, loss of papers, death of witnesses and other causes, there is danger of doing injustice, and there can no longer be safe determination of the controversy. ‘Laches is not to be imputed to a party from mere lapse of time alone; it is an implied waiver, arising from knowledge of existing conditions and an acquiescence in them.’ ”</p>

Persons against whom actions may be threatened have claims to judicial consideration as well as those who threaten such actions; both are equally entitled to have the controversy between them promptly adjudicated while witnesses are still available and memories are undimmed by long intervening years. In 21 Corpus Juris, page 210, laches is defined as an “inexcusable delay in asserting a right; an implied waiver arising from knowledge of existing conditions and an acquiescence in them; such neglect to assert a right as, taken in conjunction with lapse of time more or less great, and other circumstances causing prejudice to an adverse party, operates as a bar in a court of equity; such delay in enforcing one’s rights as works disadvantage to another.” In the first volume of Story’s Equity Jurisprudence, section 529, that learned jurist says: “In matters of account, although not barred by the statute of limitations, courts of equity should refuse to interfere after a considerable lapse of time from considerations of public policy.” In Hammond v. Hopkins, <a href="/us/143/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="143 U.S. 224" data-case-ids="6138766" data-case-paths="/us/143/0224-01">143 U.

Coggins, <a href="/pa/244/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="244 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1003448" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0228-01">244 Pa. 228</a>, an order dismissing plaintiff’s bill was affirmed by this court on the lower court’s opinion in which appears the following: “Laches is not excused by simply saying: 'I did not-know.’ If by diligence a fact can be ascertained the want of knowledge so caused is no excuse for a stale <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>claim.

Superior Ct. 316</a>, as follows: “ ‘It is a general rule that laches or staleness of demand constitutes a defense to the enforcement of the right or demand so neglected...... The doctrine is based in part on the injustice that might result from the enforcement of long neglected rights, and the difficulty, if not the impossibility of ascertaining the truth of the matters in controversy and doing justice between the parties, and in part on grounds of public policy, its aim being the discouragement, for the peace and repose of society, of stale and antiquated demands’: 21 C. J. 212, 214.” Justice Walling also quotes with ap<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>proval the following: “ ‘It is well settled that a party who seeks to avoid the consequences of an apparently unreasonable delay in the assertion of his rights on the ground of ignorance must allege and prove, not merely the fact of ignorance, but also when and how knowledge was obtained, in order that the court may determine whether reasonable effort was made by him to ascertain the facts’: Hardt v. Heidweyer, <a href="/us/152/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="152 U.S. 547" data-case-ids="3574734" data-case-paths="/us/152/0547-01">152 U. S. 547</a>, 558.”</p>
