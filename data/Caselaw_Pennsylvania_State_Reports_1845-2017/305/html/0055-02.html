Lorch was president, and Louis Lorch, secretary and treasurer. These two officers requested a loan of $100,000 for the corporation from the bank. The loan was refused. They then suggested to the bank that their wives would guarantee the payment of the proposed loan. This suggestion was also declined on the ground that married women cannot be accommodation endorsers as provided in the Act of June' 8, 1893, P. L. 344. Some days later, on January 14,1921, the Lorch Brothers and their respective wives called at the bank, the women sat in one part of the directors’ room and their husbands and officers of the bank, in another part of the same <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>room. One of the bank officers there stated to Louis Lorch that the law prevented a married woman from guaranteeing the debt of her husband, evidently referring to the Act of 1893. The following plan was then evolved by the bank officers and the Lorch Brothers for the securing of the desired loan and making their wives guarantors of its payment: Mrs. Althea E. Lorch subscribed for five hundred shares of the 8% cumulative preferred capital stock of Lorch Brothers Company, at $100 per share, for which she delivered her promissory note for $50,000. Lorch Brothers Company, by its president and treasurer, then endorsed and delivered to the bank Althea E. Lorch’s note and expressly declared that it was “collateral security for payment of the note made by George E. Lorch, Louis Lorch and John H. Wagner to it, dated January 14, 1921, in the sum of One hunddred thousand dollars ($100,000), payable in four months.” Lorch Brothers Company also “assigned and transferred to the Bank of Pittsburgh, N. A., the foregoing subscription agreement to be held as collateral security upon the terms and conditions expressed in the agreement of January 14, 1921, under which the noté received is pledged.”</p>

She did so without any examination or explanation. The loan of $100,000 was then made to the corporation,-^-papers similar in character to those signed by Althea E. Lorch having been signed by her sister-in-law, Minna Lorch, wife of Louis Lorch. No stock as provided for in said stock subscription was ever tendered to the defendant and no demand was ever made upon her for the payment of the note until after the <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>bankruptcy proceedings, nearly four years later.

The question here is whether or not the execution of the note and stock subscription by the defendant was a bona fide transaction or simply a part of a plan or device for permitting the defendant, a married woman, to become surety for another. The case was submitted to the jury after a careful charge in which the trial judge said: “The question which to my mind is a question of fact in this case......is this: Was this arrangement and the acts of the parties which Avere done pursuant to it a plan or device adopted by the parties to this transaction to evade the effect of the Act of 1893, without any intent upon the part of the parties to this arrangement that this subscription agreement should be a binding and valid subscription to stock, or, to put the matter in another way, was this subscription agreement made in good faith by the parties to it,......or was it a plan or device by which the parties sought to evade the effect of the Act of 1893?” Under the facts of the case, the jury were justified in finding that this was a device or plan to evade the Act of 1893, and the jury rendered a verdict accordingly.</p>

Lorch, a married woman, promised to subscribe for $50,000 worth of stock in the Lorch Brothers Company and promised to pay Lorch Brothers Company for the stock $50,000 at the Pittsburgh Bank, both she and the bank well knowing at the time that this subscription agreement and promissory note were to be assigned to the bank at once as security for a loan to Lorch Brothers Company. The bank officials were active in contriving this design so as to support with the wife’s credit the loan made to her husband’s company, and the stock subscription agreement and the $50,000 promissory note had no other purpose to serve than the illegal one just stated. The Act of 1893 forbids a married woman to become surety for another. What the law said she could not do, the defendant under the guidance of the bank and for the benefit of the bank and her husband’s company attempted to do. Thinly disguised as it was in form, the contract was in substance one of surety, and as such was void under the law of the Commonwealth. Plaintiff’s action on it therefore cannot be sustained.</p>
