This street runs east and west, and the main tracks of the railroad run north and south at that place. At a point twenty-five feet bouth of the center of Border Street there is a switch leading from the northbound main track to a pull-out track, which is east of that main track and runs parallel wi ;h it a considerable distance. One hundred and forty feet south of the center of Border Street there is a switch on this pull-out track leading to a spur or team track, which runs for a short distance on the east side of the pull-out track. At the time of the accident there was standing on the pull-out track a string of coal cars and on the team track a cattle car.</p>
    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[276,996,1154,1132]]]'>The principal witness fcr the plaintiff was Albert J. Wise, decedent’s brother-in-law, who was riding with him on the front seat of the automobile at the time of the accident. He testified that Lamp stopped the ear about eight feet from the nearest track at a line marked in white paint on the pavement, the usual stopping place, <em>%nd </em>listened. He claimed that in the direction from which about four hundred feet, and and that then they looked a their view from that point the train approached, was that then there was no train in sight. He said a view for a greater distance was ing and the cattle car on cars on the pull-out track. prevented by a station build-the team track and the coal He stated that Lamp changed gears and proceeded toward the tracks at a speed of about two or three miles an hour and that when the front wheels of the automc bile had reached the first rail of the nearest track, he (Wise) saw the train for the ;hen about three hundred feet who tried to get across but first time, and that it was away. He warned Lamp, failed, and the train struck the left rear corner of the automobile, just as it was leaving the track,</p>

Since he was seated six <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>feet back from the front of the automobile, the meaning of his testimony is that at a point six feet back from the nearest rail, he had an unobstructed view south for a distance as far as his eyes could carry. However, he did not say that his view did not steadily increase as he approached the track from the place where the automobile stopped, eight feet back of where he stated he had an unobstructed view. He admitted that the train ran for about one hundred feet in plain sight before he saw it.</p>
    <p id="b545-3" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[135,833,1152,363]]]'>Another witness for plaintiff, Pyle, stated that it was not until he went up to the first rail and stood on it that he had a wholly unobstructed view down the track, and that then he could see for a half mile.

This plan, the accuracy of which was not questioned, shows conclusively by mathematical demonstration, that if the cattle car was on the team track and the coal train on the pull-out track as testified by plaintiff’s witnesses, and the station building located as shown on the plan, that they could not possibly obstruct the view from a point ten feet back on Border Street, or from any intermediate point between that and the nearest rail; and further, it shows beyond any doubt that the view south from these points was as far as the eye could reach. This plan also shows that the main tracks extend in an almost straight line and that a very slight curve to the right and close to Border Street improves the vision looking south for one approaching the crossing as Lamp did. There is not a word of testimony in the plaintiff’s case to show that if decedent had looked for the train as he approached the track, he would not have had a constantly increasing view from the time he started his car, until he was six feet from the nearest <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>rail. Wise testified lie had a point six feet from the rai an unobstructed view from , when the front wheels were entering the track. He did not deny that his view increased constantly, if he had looked, from fourteen feet from the rail — where he was sitting when the car stopped -until he was six feet from the rail — when the front wheels of the car started to cross. All that Wise stated the car entered the track— -that “he saw clear down as was that it was not until when he was six feet back-far as his eyes could reach</p>

It is vain for a man to say his auto was struck in the back when the only injury thereto is at the side near the front wheel, or to insist the colli ñon was at one place when the broken glass and other unmistakable evidences thereof are at another.

Even assuming decedent did, in fact, stop at a greater distance from the track, any obstruction by reason of the house would have disappeared as he approached and before he reached the first rail. While it is not the province of this court to decide disputed questions of fact, and we are bound to give plaintiff the benefit of all favorable inferences which may be drawn from the testimony of his witnesses, yet we are not required to believe what physical facts demonstrate to be untrue, and when an infallible mathematical test is applied to the testimony of a witness and he is found to be mistaken in a material matter, it would be a travesty on justice to allow the jury to believe such testimony and permit them to render a verdict based thereon: Lessig v.
