L., 83, prohibits the corporation from passing through <em>inter alia, </em>any dwelling house in the occupancy of the owner or owners thereof without his, her, or their consent. This necessarily includes such curtilage connected therewith as is necessary for its reasonable enjoyment as a dwelling house for the owner and his family.</p>

That the said property is greatly improved, and was used by complainants’ parents as a place of residence and dwelling house from 1854 until their demise, and since that time has been so used by complainants as their dwelling house, homestead and residence^ and is now actually occupied by them as a dwelling house, and is not kept for rent, and has not been kept for rent at any time since the acquisition of title by complainants, and that all of said land is necessary to the enjoyment of said dwelling house. That the said defendant is a corporation incorporated on the second day of January, A. D. 1883, by filing articles of association in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, according to the provisions of an Act of Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, approved April 4th, 1868, entitled “ An Act to authorize the formation of Railroad Companies,” with authority to locate and construct a railroad, beginning at a point on the railroad of the “ Connecting Railroad Company, betyreen Thirteenth street and Ridge avenue; thence extending to and terminating in, at or near Chestnut Hill, in the Twenty-second ward of the city of Philadelphia.” That by virtue of said authority defendant proposes constructing a line of railroad for continuous use and operation between said points. That your orators are informed and believe that the company defendant intends to take part of their property, above described, for the purpose of constructing said railroad. That the said company defendant has notified complainants that it intends to take part of their said premises, by a right of eminent domain claimed by it, and against their consent, for the uses of said road to be constructed by it. That upon March 31st, A. D. 1883, the company defendant, under the provisions of an Act of Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, approved April 9th, A. D. 1856, (P.

D. 1849, and the several supplements thereto, as fully as if said powers were specially incorporated in said charter.” That the said Act of February 19th, A. D. 1849, section 10, (P.

    <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.8",537,[159,887,1171,1022]]]'>It certainly does not mean that the prohibition extends only to preventing the railroad from actually passing “ through ” the dwelling house. When the latter is occupied by the owner thereof, the statute gives it all the protection necessary for its reasonable enjoyment as a dwelling for the owner and his family. This necessarily includes some curtilage connected therewith. The exact extent of that curtilage cannot be defined by any arbitrary rule as to distance. As each case arises the right of the owner and occupier of the dwelling house, against hostile location of a railroad, must be determined by a consideration of what is necessary for a reasonable and proper enjoyment of the house as a residence in view of its location and surroundings. Tested by that rule we do not think the location of the railroad in question is in conflict with the statute. The land to be taken is one corner of the rear end of the lot. It is 155 feet from the nearest portion of the house. It does not interfere with the use or enjoyment of any adjacent outbuildings, or ornamental structures of any kind, nor with any shrubbery or beautified lawn. It in no manner prevents access to the street, nor causes any substantial objection to the occupancy of the building as a dwelling house. In so far as it causes injury or damage to the house or lot, the appellants are entitled to recover compensation under the statute.</p>
