    <p id="b53-6" data-blocks='[["BL_53.4",53,[214,1049,1174,474]]]'>The body of the bill was amended so as to set forth that appellee was incorporated as “The Cecil Township Natural Gas Company,” and its charter recorded April, 1884, in the office for recording deeds in and for Washington County. It appears from the charter, a copy of which is made part of the bill, that “said corporation is formed for the purpose of supplying natural gas to the public for lighting, heating, manufacturing, and other purposes, and supplying the same to said Cecil Township.....and such persons, partnerships, and corporations residing therein or adjacent thereto as may desire the same.” The charter discloses no other purpose.</p>

It is not claimed that appellee has any such authority outside its charter, and on the authority of Penn Fuel Company <em>v. </em>Common<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>wealth, (<a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20425" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 425">15 W. N. C. 425</a>), we think it has none under its charter. While we did not undertake to pass upon the validity of the charter involved in that case, we held that it gave the company no authority to supply natural gas for either of the several purposes mentioned therein. An inquiry, as to whether certain powers are or are not granted by a charter, is not open to the objection that the validity of a charter cannot be assailed in a collateral proceeding. Such inquiries are expressly authorized by the Act of June 19th, 1871, (Purd. 288, pl. 39), which provides that “In all proceedings in courts of law or equity of this commonwealth, in which it is alleged that the private rights of individuals, or the rights or franchises of other corporations are injured or invaded by any corporation claiming to have a right or franchise to do the act from which such injury results, it shall be the duty of the court in which such proceedings are had, to examine, inquire, and ascertain whether such corporation does in fact possess the right or franchise to do the act from which such alleged injury to private rights, or to the rights and franchises of other corporations results; and if such rights or franchises have not been conferred upon such corporation, such courts, if exercising equitable power, shall, by injunction at the suit of the private parties or other corporations, restrain such injurious acts. And if the proceedings be at law,, for damages, it shall be lawful therein to recover damages for such injury as in other cases.”</p>

We think not. As owner of the land traversed by the public road, he has a right to use it and the land on which it is located for any purpose that will not impede or interfere with the public travel. By appropriating land for the specific purpose of a common highway, the public acquires a mere right of passage with the powers and privileges incident to such right. The fee still remains in the land owner notwithstanding the public have acquired a right to the free and uninterrupted use of the road for the purpose of passing and re-passing; and he may use the land for his own purposes in any way that is not inconsistent with the public easement. He may, for <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>example, construct underneath the surface passage ways for water and other purposes, or appropriate the subjacent soil and minerals if any, to any use he pleases, provided he does not interfere "with the rights of the public. In other words, the only servitude imposed on the land is the right of the public to construct and maintain thereon a safe and convenient roadway, which shall at all times be free and open for public use as a highway. It is in view of this servitude that damages may be awarded to the landowner. Laying and maintaining a pipe line, at the ordinary depth under the surface, necessarily imposes an additional burden on the land, not contemplated either by the owner or by the public authorities, when the land was appropriated for the purpose of a public road. It is a burden, moreover, which to some extent, at least, abridges the rights of the landowner in the soil, traversed by the road, and hence it is a taking within the meaning of the constitutional provision requiring just compensation to be made for property taken, injured, or destroyed. (Const. Art. XVI., sect. 8.) In some cases it is possible the injury may be consequential as well as direct. The constitutional provision embraces both.</p>

There is no reason why this should not be the rule with respect to public roads in the rural districts.

The appellee is or claims to be a corporation, and they are peculiarly the subjects of equitable jurisdiction and control, especially when they attempt to exceed their corporate powers.
