And in the notes to this case in 2 Am.

Pardee thereupon agreed to become responsible to Markle, for the acts and omissions of Grier in the conduct of the business from 1st January, 1881, until 1st April, 1881, and executed and delivered to Markle the contract of indemnity, which is the subject of this suit. On the 1st April, 1881, Pardee, Markle <em>&amp; </em>Grier dissolved, Grier retiring from the firm, and thereafter the business was conducted by Pardee &amp; Markle.</p>

The total amount, therefore, drawn by Grier prior to January, 1881, was $22,311.67, and the amount afterwards drawn, during the period for which Pardee was responsible under his covenant of indemnity, was $24,924. In partial repaj’ment of these overdrafts, Grier, on 30th June, 1881, deposited to the credit of Pardee &amp; Markle with Barker Brothers &amp; Co., $13,000, and on 4th August, 1881, with the First National Bank of New York, $8,000.</p>

In support of this, the defendant’s counsel offered to prove by Pardee that he had no knowledge or suspicion of Grier’s conduct in the affairs of the firm ; that Markle gave him no information concerning it; that if he had known or suspected it, he would not have made the covenant to indemnify Pardee.' This, it was contended, was admissible, because it already appeared by the evidence of A. M. Eby, a clerk in the banking house of Pardee, Markle <em>&amp; </em>Grier, that Markle at the time did suspect Grier, and knew of <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>some alleged “irregularity,” or “discrepancy” in the account of one of their New York correspondents. The exercise of the utmost good faith is certainly expected between partners in their dealings with each other, and if it had been shown that Markle fraudulently concealed facts, which in good faith he should have communicated to Pardee, the offer might have been received, but there was no such evidence. It is very clear that Markle regarded Grier with suspicion ; but of this .Pardee could not have been ignorant, for it was upon this ground, admittedly, that Markle expressed his unwillingness without indemnity to continue the business. There is some •evidence that, in November, 1880, there was an alleged discrepancy in the account of one of the New York correspondents, of which Eby informed Markle, but it was spoken of as a mere “discrepancy,” which had not been investigated or explained, and if Ebjr himself had an3r suspicion of the transaction being of an irregular and fraudulent character, he did not communicate his. suspicion to Markle. The admitted fact, however, that Markle declined, without indemnity from Pardee, to continue the business under Grier’s management, was the plainest possible expression, and the clearest notice of his want of faith in Grier, and that Markle had some real or supposed cause of suspicion concerning him. Marble’s instructions to Eby, given prior to his taking voyage to Europe to look after his interests, and regulating his conduct with the cashier and Grier, were given in the presence of Pardee; there is an entire absence of proof of an3' effort or intention to conceal anything. The assignments of error, so far as they relate to the exclusion of this evidence, are, we think, without merit.</p>
    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[261,1649,1179,216]]]'>The defendant’s further contention is, that the deposit of $13,000 with Barker Brothers &amp; Co., 30th June; 1881, and of $8,000 with the First National Bank of New York, 4th August, 1881, already referred to, were applicable, in his relief as a ■surety, to the overdrafts, made after the 1st January, 1881-</p>

He had a clear right, in the first instance, to apply these payments as he pleased, but he does not appear to have exercised or to have attempted to exercise that right. He may have intended to pay the overdrafts for which Pardee was responsible, but if he did, he should have signified that intention at the time, either to the creditors or to the banks, through the medium of which the respective payments were made. The intention of a debtor in such a case, may be manifested by express direction, or it <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>may be evidenced by circumstances or acts which will demonstrate the fact as plainly as words. Here, however, nothing whatever was either said or done, and no circumstances are shown, from which an intention to apply the payments specially can be inferred.</p>

As therefore there was no actual appropriation by Grier, the debtor, either expressly declared or to be inferred from the circumstances, and as the considerations which ordinarily control the direction of the creditor are entirely wanting, it belonged to Pardee &amp; Maride, under some restrictions, to apply the payments in their own interest. It is plain, however, that whatever they, or either of them, may have intended, no actual specific appropriation was by them at any time made, and the right being thus lost to both parties, it passes to the law, which will apply the payments, according to the intrinsic justice and equity of the case.</p>

So, “ where a general pajnnent is made without application, by either party, and there are divers claims, S02ne of which a2’e but imperfectly and partially secui'ed, the court will apply it to those debts for which the security is most precarious:” Greenleaf, 534; Reed <em>v. </em>Ward, <a href="/pa/22/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="22 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="413755" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0144-01">22 Pa.
