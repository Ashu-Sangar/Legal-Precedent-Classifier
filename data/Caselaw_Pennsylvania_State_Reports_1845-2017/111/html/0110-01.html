Prior to this purchase from Shaw, David Shafer prepared his grounds for picnics. Some fifteen or sixteen years before the damage complained of, he constructed a drain and a sidewalk along the lower side of the road, and carried the entire drainage of the road and hillside down to the land of Shaw. Shaw acquiesced in this manner of draining. Subsequently Shafer purchased the land of Shaw.

Shafer died seized of the Shaw land now held by his daughter, and until his death he continued 'the drainage as he first arranged it.</p>

Our rights are fixed by the necessities of the 'case, and neither of us can interfere with the rights of the other. The party below could not construct a bulkhead which would throw the water back upon me and make a ditch or a pond upon my land; nor could I collect the water which ordinarily would flow in small quantities along a considerable line into one stream, and cast that upon my neighbor in a body, because that might be seriously injurious to him, while it would, of course, if done at all, be for my benefit at his expense. Neither of us are permitted to do those things. We are compelled to leave the water shed as we find it, or protect ourselves upon our own property. In the one case the party below would be at liberty to collect the water in any way he chose upon his own land and divert it as he saw fit, if it did not injure some of his neighbors, and so the party above would be at liberty to'collect it in one stream and cast it off in some other mode than the ordinary provision-of nature, .provided he saw that no injury was done to his neighbor, who would otherwise have received the water in small quantities. The same rule applies to the construction of a road that applies to the occupants of respective pieces of land. It would be a rather unusual roadway that could be constructed without accumulating the water beyond what would ordinarily be the case if it flowed over the land, as it remained unbroken — as found in nature. In order to protect the roadbed it is necessary to have water tables upon either side; and along the side of the hill, as this seems to have been, it would be necessary to exclude the water from the bed of the road and throw it upon either, side, and in that way water would be accumulated beyond the ordinary fall of water flowing over the surface of the ground. Those who maintain a public highway are no more at liberty to disregard the laws of nature and the results of their own acts than an individual, and they are liable if they do. If they create a-stream — temporarily, it may be, during a rain storm — upon the side of the road, they can not cast that over upon any neighboring ground without reference to the rights and interests of the people abutting upon that load.

I do not understand them to be more than phrases used by witnesses. We have the testimony of two witnesses that it did not go down Mr. Shaw’s ground at all in the first instance, but that it flowed off at certain points on property which is now the property of Mr. Glendenning, which was then Mr. Shafer’s, and that there was no other place that the water, if cast off the ground of Mr. Shafer, could flow down, except where it is said to go now. But that does not make any difference. It does not make any difference whether that is the lowest point on the road. That may have been the proper place for this water to be cast off in this road, and the law of the land has provided for that contingency. But that contingency is not to cast the water on your neighbor without making compensation. The road law provides that the supervisor shall have power and authority to enter upon any lands or enclosures, and cut, open, maintain and repair all such drains or ditches through the same as they shall judge necessary to <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>carry the water off said road. The law provides for the very matter which is involved here, but there is no evidence that the supervisors took upon themselves the exercise of the power and the duty cast upon them by the road law, to provide a place upon which this water should be wasted. When they did that, then the property holder would have a right, not to close it up, but a right to compensation.</p>

Shafer was the father of the plaintiff and was her predecessor in the title. The defendants proved by several witnesses that while Shafer was the owner, and several years before his death, he closed <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>up a drain which turned the water from the road upon a portion of the premises then owned by him; that the effect of closing this drain was to stop this flow of water and to turn it down the public highway until it reached the place where it was discharged upon the Shaw lot, where the washout occurred. Hence the defendants contended that the injury of which the plaintiff complains was in reality caused by the defective drainage made by her predecessor in the title; that by thus stopping'up said drain he had fixed an easement or servitude upon tins property, which was visible to the eye, and that his successor in the title took it subject to such servitude; hence that his declarations made at the time the drain was changed were competent evidence against the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[183,957,1160,1364]]]'>The theory of this branch of the defence is based upon mistaken premises. David Shafer imposed no servitude upon his property. On the contrary he prevented the water from flowing upon his land and turned it back, as before stated, upon the public highway, in Killbuck township, if he had turned the water upon his land there would have been more show of reason in this proposition. It is said, however, that the effect of this action on his part was to carry the water along the gutters or water tables of Beaver road, upon a down grade, until with its large accumulations it was discharged upon the Shaw lot. Conceding this to be so, what follows? As his right to stop this drain was never questioned in Mr. Shafer’s life time nor since, we must asgume that it was lawfully done. It may be he thought that more than his share of the water was discharged upon his land, or he may have done it, as was stated by some of the witnesses, to keep his lot dry for picnic parties. Be that as it may, he stopped the flow of the water over his land by closing the drain, without objection from the municipal authorities, and turned it down the road. He was not responsible for its further flow. It was the business of the township to look after that. Shafer was not bound to follow it up and see where it went to. Nor had the township any more right to throw it upon the plaintiff’s land further down the road than upon the land of any other citizen. Moreover, it was the business of the municipal authorities to protect his land from any such injurious overflow. The fact that Shafer bought the Shaw lot afterwards, and that it has now come into the possession of the plaintiff, in no way affects the case. She has the same right to have her property at this point protected as any other citizen would have if he owned it. We see nothing to justify the admission of Mr. Shafer’s declarations in evidence.</p>

It may be that after collecting the water in the highway for this long distance, it might be an expensive thing to turn such a volume of it across the road at this point.

    <p id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[215,1489,1164,645]]]'>The first thought suggested by this ruling is that the plaintiff may not recover the full amount of damage, if any, she has sustained. If this be so, there must be error, somewhere. Either the charge must be incorrect, or a mistake has been made in joining the two municipalities in one suit. If the injury be their joint act the plaintiff is entitled in a suit against both to recover the full amount of loss she has sustained. For a tort committed jointly the law will not apportion the guilt or responsibility of the tort feasors, but holds them all for what the most culpable ought to pay : McCarthy <em>v. </em>De Armit, 1 Pennypacker, 297. The rule laid down by the learned judge was that the jury should find only for the injury done by the least culpable of the defendants. This is the rule when punitive damages are claimed, and as such damages were not claimed in this case, it does not apply.</p>

They were,both actions for polluting a stream of water; the acts of the respective defendants were clearly several, and it was ruled that one defendant could not be held for the tan or coal dust thrown into the stream by another defendant. In the case in hand the borough of Bellevue collects its water and carries it along <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>the road until it reaches the line between the borough and the township. There the borough discharges it upon the highway in Killbuck. If the latter receives it without objection, then the township becomes responsible for its further flow. I am unable to see how the borough can be held liable to the plaintiff, for water poured, not upon her land, but upon Kill-buck township. But as this point was not raised it will not now be decided.</p>
