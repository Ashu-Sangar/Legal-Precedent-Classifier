The property in question, it is conceded, belonged to one Robert Lemmon, to whom it was conveyed by William Henderson, in November, 1841. Robert Lemmon died on the 2d day of June, 1871, unmarried, and, neither his father nor mother living, he left as his heirs seven brothers and sisters. One of them was Thomas, who has since died. The defendants are his children. The plaintiffs are the descendants of five of the other six heirs. If there was no more than this in the case your verdict should be for the plaintiffs for their claim. The defendants claim title to this property through their immediate ancestor, Thomas Lemmon, the brother of Robert Lemmon, deceased, prior owner. They offer in evidence a paper executed and acknowledged on the 26th day of September, 1861, and recorded on the 7th day of June, 1871, a week after the death of Robert Lemmon. In that paper Robert Lemmon makes in form, first, a conveyance of all his property, real, personal and mixed, wherever it may be (or an assignment of it, whatever you see fit to call it)', to his brother, Thomas Lemmon, in consideration of $1,000, and reciting a condition, “Subject, nevertheless, to the right of redemption of the aforesaid property, both real, personal and mixed by the said grantor, Robert Lemmon.”</p>

A mortgage is where the property is pledged for the payment of a debt, and it is in our state immaterial in what form it may be. It might be an absolute deed on its face, and not contain a word in relation to it being a mere pledge for money, and the grantor being entitled to the property on the payment of the money. Nevertheless it may be shown, by oral testimony, that instead of being a deed of absolute conveyance, it was simply a mortgage, a pledge as security for money, to belong to the grantor again when he repaid the loan. Now, I incline to think that this is but a mortgage, and if the money was repaid, or settlement had, the property reverted tQ the original grantor, Robert Lemmon. I do not deem it necessary, however, to decide that question, because if it were a mortgage, and Robert Lemmon paid it in his lifetime, or before he became a lunatic (and it is not pretended he paid it afterwards) the property reverted to him. If it were a conditional deed, under which he had a right to redeem the propert}-, as said in this paper, and he did that in a reasonable time, no time being mentioned, he was entitled to the property in equity, and all <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>he wants is a proper declaration from the grantee, Thomas Lemmon, that it belonged to him. [Now, unless it were redeemed in the lifetime of Robert Lemmon, I do not think there is evidence sufficient for you to find that it has been redeemed by the yearly rents and profits over and above necessary repairs and improvements for the enjoyment of the property, so that I do not deem it a matter of very great importance in the view I take of this case, whether this is to be called a conditional deed or a mortgage.] If Robert Lemmon satisfied the condition, which would be the repayment of the amount advanced, with any necessary expenses, whether it be a mortgage or a conditional deed he is entitled to the property, and if that was not done, if the deed ever was delivered and went into effect, as it is presumed, he was not entitled to the property, or these parties under him. Now, both Robert Lemmon and Thomas Lemmon are dead. There is but little evidence on either side as to what the actual transactions were between them. It seems that prior to this conveyance Thomas Lemmon, the brother, having a family, lived on the farm, and he lived on it afterwards, and up to the time of Robert Lemmon’s death, and his death. Robert Lemmon, it seems, did not live on the farm, perhaps he made his home there in part — washing was done, some witnesses say, but he lived in the neighborhood the most of the time, working for some farmer for wages. He was supervisor at one time, according to the evidence of Mr. Himmelwright. Some one spoke, of the amount of wages he got on the farm — not very much, but he had no family. It seems, from the evidence, that his intellect became impaired, and the finding of the jury indicates that that occurred away back in 1864, three years after this assignment or mortgage, or whatever it may be. We have in evidence the proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas by which Robert Lemmon was declared a lunatic.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[193,1839,1172,605]],["BL_76.1",76,[262,407,1178,1331]]]'>Thomas Lemmon, the brother, and the ancestor of the present defendants, through whom they claim, is the petitioner in that case. He filed a petition alleging that his brother Robert was a lunatic, stating his relations, and stating that he owned a farm of 110 acres, more or less, in East Deer township. The evidence indicates, and it is conceded, that the tract in dispute is the only land that Robert Lemmon ever owned there. On that petition, signed by Thomas Lemmon, and sworn to by him, the court appointed a commission and proceeded to summon a jury before him, and according to their proceedings they had before them Thomas Lemmon, among others, and on their testimony the jury found that Robert Lemmon owned the farm in East Deer township, of the annual value, clear of taxes, &amp;e., of $100. <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>Thomas Lemmon was duly appointed committee to take charge of the personal estate of his brother. Robert Lemmon, and he gave bond conditional for the faithful performance of his duty. [Now that petition, inquisition and report, and the bond, would be conclusive on Thomas Lemmon as to the income of that estate, and he is bound to account for it from that time as the committee of Robert Lemmon. He was not in any hostile position to Robert Lemmon after that, up to his death. It would be conclusive on him, I think, as to the income of that farm, but this proceeding is not conclusive on him as to the title to the land, because he may have made a mistake.] It seems to the court, however, to be very strongly, presumptive evidence, that prior to that time Robert Lemmon had redeemed this farm and owned it, and Thomas Lemmon did not own it at that time, but it is for the jury to determine. If it had not been redeemed before that time I incline to think, and so charge the jury, that there is no evidence of a redemption thereafter that would, by the proceeds of the farm, over and above repairs and improvements, entitle the plaintiffs to recover. If the jury find from the evidence that the land was redeemed, they will find for the plaintiffs for the undivided five sevenths of the land in dispute.- The defendants are entitled to one seventh of it in any event. Parties not represented maybe entitled to another one seventh; the parties, plaintiff, can only get five sevenths of the land in dispute, and their proportional titles would have to be settled in another proceeding. If they do not find it was redeemed, the}’ will find for the defendants generally. If they find it was redeemed, their verdict will be for the plaintiffs for the undivided five sevenths of the land described in the writ, with six cents damages and costs.</p>

We took the position in the court below that the condition in that deed, “ subject, nevertheless, to the right of redemption of the aforesaid property, both real, personal and mixed, by the said grantor, Robert Lemmon,” if'it were not void for uncertainty, had no other effect than to make the transaction a conditional sale. In order to constitute a mortgage the relation of debtor and creditor must exist and remain between the parties. “ Where there is no debt or obligation to pay there can be no mortgage: ” Haynie <em>v. </em>Robertson, <a href="/ala/58/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="58 Ala. 37" data-case-ids="8489898" data-case-paths="/ala/58/0037-01">58 Ala. 37</a>. “ If land be conveyed in consideration of a pre-existing debt due from the grantor to the grantee, and it is the understanding of the parties that the debt shall survive, the deed is a mortgage, but the debt must survive. It is not enough that- the evidence of it remain in the grantee’s hands if the liability be gone: ” Todd <em>v. </em>Campbell, 8 Casey, 250. “An absolute conveyance and a separate agreement to reconvey, though executed simultaneously and as parts of one transaction, may or may not constitute a mortgage, and equity is not concluded by the form, but will have regard to the actual facts. The test is the existence or non-existence of a debt. If, after the transaction, <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>no debt remains, there is no mortgage, but a conditional sale: ” McNamara <em>v. </em>Culver, <a href="/kan/22/0661-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="22 Kan. 661" data-case-ids="590069" data-case-paths="/kan/22/0661-01">22 Kan. 661</a>.</p>

    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.8",78,[256,1011,1170,976]]]'>Leaving out of view the claim of defendants, based on the deed of September 26, 1861, the plaintiffs, as next of kin and heirs at law of Robert Lemmon, deceased, were entitled to recover the undivided five-sevenths of the land embraced in this action of ejectment. Title in Robert Lemmon prior to date of the deed and heirship of plaintiffs to five-sevenths of any real estate of which he died seised appear to have been conceded by defendants; but their contention was that the deed aforesaid is an absolute conveyance, and hence it vested in Thomas Lemmon, under whom they claim an indefeasible estate of inheritance. On the other hand, plaintiffs contend that it is a defeasible convejmnce or mortgage given to secure payment of the $1,000 therein, named; that Thomas Lemmon was, therefore, merely a mortgagee in possession, and as such, he and those claiming under 'him have long since received from the net rents, issues and profits of the land, more than sufficient to pay the sum for which it was pledged as security. They accordingly requested the court to instruct the jury that the deed was a mortgage, and not an absolute conveyance. That request should have been granted. The instrument, on its face, is clearly a mortgage. The conveyance is expressly subject to the right of redemption by the grantor, Robert Lemmon.</p>
    <p id="b78-7" data-blocks='[["BL_78.9",78,[253,1998,1166,300]]]'>This reservation, or defeasance clause, is what gives character to the instrument, and reduces it to a mere security or mortgage; and there is nothing in the evidence <em>dehors </em>the instrument, to show that it is or was intended to be anything else. This materially affects the relation and rights of the parties, and hence the error into which the court fell in refusing to charge as requested was not immaterial.</p>
    <p id="b78-8" data-blocks='[["BL_78.10",78,[251,2298,1163,129]],["BL_79.1",79,[201,410,1164,775]]]'>A mortgagee in possession, as was Thomas Lemmon the grantee in the defeasible deed, must account for the rents, issues and profits of the mortgaged premises, so that the net <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>proceeds thereof may be applied to payment of the sum for which the property was pledged as security. If the same be fully paid the mortgagor is entitled to possession ; if not, the mortgagee has the right to retain possession until out of the rents, issues and profits, or otherwise, the residue is paid. This equitable right of redemption in the mortgagor may be enforced in an action of ejectment, which, under our system of jurisprudence, is an equitable action, and may be employed as a substitute for bill to redeem. In such cases it is the duty of the jury, under the direction of the judge sitting as a chancellor, to ascertain how much the mortgagee in possession has realized from the rents, issues and profits. If they find he has received, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have realized enough to pay the sum secured, a general verdict for plaintiffs should be rendered; if not, a conditional or special verdict should be found, in such form that, upon payment of the residue, the mortgagor may, without unnecessary delay, obtain possession of the premises.</p>
    <p id="b79-6" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[201,1185,1163,162]]]'>In the case at bar, the course of trial should have been similar to that above indicated; and, mainly for the reason that it was not so, the judgment must be reversed and a new venire ordered.</p>
    <p id="b79-7" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[201,1357,1168,903]]]'>In September, 1869, eight years after the alleged conveyance, Thomas Lemmon, the grantee named therein, presented his petition to the court, setting forth that his brother Robert was a lunatic, seised of a farm, &amp;c., and incapable of managing his estate. The inquest awarded on that petition found Robert was a lunatic, and had been for five years then past; that he was possessed of a tract of land worth $3,500, and of the yearly value of $100, clear of taxes, and that his next of kin were the petitioner and others. This inquisition having been approved and duly confirmed by the court, Thomas Lemmon was appointed committee, and as such gave approved security for the faithful discharge of his duties. It is very evident the land mentioned in the petition is the same that is described in the defeasible deed of September 26, 1861, and, in the absence of explanation, the averment in the petition as to ownership of the land, shows conclusively that it was not then claimed or owned by Thomas Lemmon, the petitioner. In connection with the fact that he makes no mention of any incumbrance, it is also strongly persuasive that he then had no claim on or interest in the land as mortgagee or otherwise ; but it is not conclusive.</p>
