Pursuant to the contract the plaintiff furnished the defendant the machinery therein designated, and placed it in position in their mill under the superintendence of Justice J. Hendrickson, who was the inventor of the rolls in the contract mentioned. That part of the machinery called the Hendrickson bran roll was unsatisfactory to the defendants, who selected a Dawson roll in platfe of it. The plaintiff accordingly removed the former and substituted the latter, which cost the plaintiff $175 more than the Hendrickson bran roll.</p>

On 21st October, 1882, the mill thus refitted and with the Dawson roll, was set running under the management of Hendrickson, who was a millwright, and in conjunction with the defendant’s chief millei’, who was unacquainted with the system of which the new machinery was part. The mill was run for several hours daily for four or five days, changes being made in the adjustment of parts of the machinery. The machinery had wholly failed to do that for which it was designed, in this respect, that very much less flour and very much more bran was produced by it than by the old machinery it had superseded. On the 25th or 26th of October, Hendrickson admitted he could do no more, and proposed to the defendant miller that one Morgan, said by him to be experienced and familiar with the system for which the machinery then in the mill was intended, should be sent for to work it. The defendant’s miller objected on the ground that-he had actual knowledge of the incompetency of Morgan. On the following day John Cleaver asked Hendrickson what should be done; the latter proposed they should call upon Bullock.</p>

Bullock at his office. Bullock then insisted that the machinery had not been tested, and asked that Cleaver should allow him thirty days for this purpose, saying that it could not be properly tested in less time. He also stated that period was allowed him by the contract of July 6th. Cleaver declined to allow any further trial of more than a day and the use of 100 bushels of wheat. Bullock refused to accept such trial on the ground that a day would be wholly insufficient, and but one thirtieth of what would be requisite. Subse<a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>quently to this interview no trial of the machinery was made, and neither Bulloclc nor Hendrickson, on his behalf, liad, after 31st October, any control over the mill and its machineiy.</p>

He declined to receive and did not intermeddle with them, and on the 29th day of November, 1882, he brought this suit.

Cleaver should not be obliged to pay $750, until the machinery had been run at least thirty days, and had been so run that they were satisfied, or ought in right reason to be satisfied with it. And also that in order to produce such satisfactory operation, C. K. Bullock should have a 3-easonable time to adjust and'try its working.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-7" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[174,1083,1160,387]]]'>From the facts found it is obvious that what took place at the interview of October 31st, 1882, is of the first importance in coming tó a legal conclusion in respect to the issue. This is not affected by what took place between Hendrickson and the defendants’ miller with 3-egard to the offer of the former to have Morgan operate the machinery. The objection made to the offer was a reasonable one, and both the suggestion and objection were before the interview between the parties to the conti-act and which took place partly in consequence of this.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-8" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[175,1470,1165,341]]]'>At this interview Bullock insisted that Hendrickson’s trial had been insufficient to test the machinei-y, and he demanded of Cleaver a further time for this purpose, saying that a proper, trial could not be made in less than thirty days, and that the contract gave him so much for the purpose. To this demand, Cleaver offered a further ti-ial of one day (with the requisite wheat) and 33.0 more. Bullock refused to accept because it was but one thirtieth of what he said was necessary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-9" data-blocks='[["BL_459.7",459,[175,1813,1160,248]]]'>Under the interpretation given to the contract, Bullock was entitled to a reasonable time within which to try. by change and adjustment to bring the machinery into working condition. The contract did not fix either thirty days or any time for this, and in asserting that it gave him thirty days, Bullock was in error.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-10" data-blocks='[["BL_459.8",459,[176,2070,1162,337]],["BL_460.1",460,[266,394,1158,378]]]'>There Was nothing in the evidence produced to induce the belief that the offer of one day was made in consequence of-the demand for the number which Bullock asserted he was entitled to have under the contract. The offer is not a-natural consequence of such assertion, and it should not be presumed, therefore, to have been made in consequence of it. Bullock’s error was consequently an unimportant one, and the gist of the matter to be resolved is whether Bullock was or was. not <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>entitled, to time for a further trial in addition to that which had been made. This depends in a measure upon the cause of the failure of the machinery. If it resulted from unfit or defective mechanism or plan, no trial beyond that had was needed. If, however, it resulted from the want of proper arrangement and adjustment of serviceable and fit machinery, a further trial might and probably would disclose the course that should be taken to bring the machinery into working order.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Avvj" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[264,783,1162,1225]]]'>On behalf of the defendants it was urged that if Hendrickson, the inventor of the machinen1-, could produce no other results than those he had exhibited, there was no need for further trial and the evidence of defective plan or mechanism was complete. If no evidence had been produced, this contention might well stand. Testimony was brought forward, however, from which the fact has been found that the failure before described might be entirely caused through unskilful or faulty setting of the bran rolls, and without fault of the mechanism itself. The mere fact, therefore, that the inventor of the machine had failed to make it work, together with the further fact that the Hendrickson breaks were never subsequently used in mills is, in view of the finding last stated, insufficient to warrant the belief that no further trial would have shown results different from those shown by the inventor, and the fact that the results of his trial might be produced without fault of the machinery, justifies the conclusion that a further trial might reveal through different adjustments a correct working of it. Bullock was therefore entitled to further trial, and the remaining question is, was one day a sufficient time where the defects are those that can be remedied by changes and adjustments. The facts found show that a much longer time is generally necessary, and the one day offered was not, therefore, a reasonable time, and the refusal was a violation of the plaintiff’s right under the contract; it prevented, and the defendants’ subsequent removal of the machinery from the mill, made impossible any effort of the plaintiff to bring the machinery into a satisfactory working condition.</p>

    <p id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.8",463,[161,657,1169,986]]]'>Bullock contracted to furnish Cleaver certain machinery for a mill and put the same in operation, the price to be paid in three instalments, the last “when machinery has been run thirty days and proves satisfactory.” They stipulated that the machinery should be put in under the personal supervision of Mr. Justice J. Hendrickson who was the inventor of Hendrickson’s three-roll gradual reduction mill. The machinery was put in the mill under Hendrickson’s supervision, and the first two instalments of the price were paid. When completed, October 21st, 1882, the mill was set running under the management of said Hendrickson and Cleaver’s miller, was tried four or five days, and “ during that time between one hundred and one hundred and fifty bushels of wheat were used, and fifty per centum of this was lost or wasted on account of the failure of the machinery to perform its work.” “The wheat wasted in the trial given of the machinery, was more than the usual total loss on the trial of a new mill.” “The principal loss was not in the quality of the flour but in the production of too much bran, a defect which could only be remedied, if at all, by the adjustment of the break-roll alone and not by the numerous changes and adjustments in the whole machinery, sometimes necessary to bring the mill up to its full capacity of high grade flour.”</p>
    <p id="b463-7" data-blocks='[["BL_463.9",463,[156,1644,1167,471]]]'>After said trial Hendrickson admitted he could do no more. Bullock demanded thirty days for testing the machinery, said it could not be properly tested in less time, and alleged that period was allowed him by the contract. Cleaver refused his demand and offered to allow a trial of one day and the use of one hundred bushels of wheat, which was rejected “ on the ground that a day would be wholly insufficient, and but one thirtieth of wheat would be requisite.” Just there offers to put the machinery in working condition ended. Soon after Bullock declined to take out the machinery, and Cleaver took it out and shipped it to him.</p>
    <p id="b463-8" data-blocks='[["BL_463.10",463,[154,2115,1167,301]],["BL_464.1",464,[281,414,1158,129]]]'>Some other facts were found by the Referee proper to be considered for a right understanding of the contract and Acts of the parties, but none which changes the terms of the written agreement. Although Cleaver had thirty days after the machinery was ready to start, to ascertain it' it would work satisfactorily, good faith required that Bullock should have reasonable time and opportunity to make proper tests and <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>remedy defects, if any; arid a refusal of such opportunity would be strong evidence that Cleaver believed the contract had been substantially performed.</p>
    <p id="AVe" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[274,543,1165,716]]]'>The inventor of Hendrickson’s three-roll gradual reduction mill was to supervise the work, and he did. In the trial he made, more wheat was wasted than the usual loss on the new mill. For five days after the inventor had pronounced the mill ready to use, he was endeavoring to discover and remedy its faults, and failing, he quit. Then the plaintiff insisted that not less than thirty days more were requisite, notwithstanding the fact that the principal loss was in the production of too much bran which defect could only be remedied, if at all, by adjustment of the break-roll alone, and not by numerous changes and adjustments in the whole machinery. He refused to take a day for testing and trial. Had the plaintiff believed the mill was not worthless and was offering in good faith to discover and remedy defects he could have taken the day and in that time probabty have found the defect, if not applied the remedy. There was no reason why the defendant should submit to further loss of time and waste of wheat.</p>
    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[271,1268,1166,802]]]'>This case is unlike Albert <em>&amp; </em>Co. <em>v. </em>Frick &amp; Co., 1 Pennypacker, 132. Frick sold to Albert an engine and boiler warranted to be of best work and material and to perform satisfactorily. Albert received the machinery, retained and used it, and the jury found that Frick substantially performed the contract; but there were some slight defects. The court charged that if a party contracts to do work or to furnish machinery or other things to another and performs substantially, but fails in some slight particulars, the other party who receives the benefit and enjoj's the fruits of such performance is liable for the price, deducting what loss or damage he may have sustained by the deviations from the contract. That instruction accords with the well settled rule. And it was remarked, “ If the defendants ascertained that the engine was not what was contracted for, they might' have rescinded the contract, they might have refused to keep the engine on the ground that it was not according to warranty, and then they might look to the plaintiff for the damages for not furnishing one according to the contract.”</p>
    <p id="b464-7" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[271,2079,1163,343]]]'>Here the defendant within proper time notified the plaintiff to take away the machinery, and on his neglect or refusal to take it promptly, sent it to him. ‘ The fact is notin the case that Hendrickson’s three-roll gradual reduction mill could have been made to work successfully, but instead, it had never been tried before nor was it used afterwards. We think it clear that upon 'the facts found by the Referee the plaintiff is not entitled -to .-recover the unpaid instalment.</p>
    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.3",465,[184,399,1167,258]]]'>
      <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>The Referee found that the plaintiff did work and labor for the defendant beyond refitting the mill under the contract, to value of $267.57, and that he was entitled to $175 because of the purchase of the Dawson roll. Also that the defendant advanced moneys for the plaintiff amounting to $294.24. There is no dispute respecting these items.</p>
    <p id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[441,656,908,129]]]'>Judgment reversed, and judgment is now entered for the plaintiff, Charles K. Bullock, for $162.34 with interest from July 17th, 1884.</p>
    <p id="b465-7" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[183,828,1167,729]]]'>[Note. — The object of a “break” machine, in the “gradual reduction ” system of milling, is to give the wheat-berry its first “ cracking or breaking ” after the berry leaves the cleaning machinery. The “stuff” or “ feed ” is then taken through “spouts ” and “ conveyer's ” to the “ bolts ” where the “ separations ” are made and then returned sometimes again to the “ break-rolls,” to be re-cracked, or carried to other parts of the mill, such as “bran-rolls” ; then to the “purifiers,” where the solid and hard inner part of the berry is separated from other parts of the berry, making what are called “ middlings.” The “ middlings ” are ground on rolls and make the best or “ patent flour,” this being the object of the “ gradual reduction system,” of milling as distinguished from the old or burr-stone system. In the “gradual reduction system” of milling different grades of flour are being made during the process of separating the “middlings” or best portions of the berry, which, when ground, make “patent flour.”]</p>
