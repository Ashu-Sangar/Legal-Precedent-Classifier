In that letter no other description is given by the depositee. Up to this time Dr. Gibson had not seen any bond, or known anything about their number or their value.

He finds a package which purports to be bonds, upon which his name is endorsed. It is not given to him, because he has not this letter or certificate of deposit sent by the bank.

To be sure, at one time in the bank, in April, 1880, the examiner is understood as handing him the bonds, but he did not take possession, and not until April, 1880, did he even know the number of the bonds; at all events, he did not take the numbers of the bonds until after that time, after the bank had been in the hands of a provisional receiver.] (Twelfth assignment of error.)</p>

The defendant, by virtue of his special plea filed in this case, cannot be permitted to controvert its own certificate and say that after it had received the bonds of plaintiff, it allowed some unknown person to change them. The plea is <em>non eepit in modo et forma, </em>and property in <em>alio </em>may be pleaded, but such plea must be sustained by indisputable evidence. The defendant interposing it must connect himself satisfactorily therewith or the verdict should be against him, and hence it was error to admit the testimony of Wm. Thorp and others to controvert the bank’s own certificate that it had received the bonds on special deposit, supplemented as it was by the fact that the amount of bonds corresponding in amount, and indorsed with the name of Dr. Wm. Gibson, were found in its vaults. As between Mr. Gibson and the bank it mattered not whether these very bonds had been formerly hypothecated to Berringer, or whether Mr. Thorp had other bonds at the time of the Gibson loan. The fact that Mr. Gibson was the <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value of $9,000 Shenango &amp; Allegheny Railroad bonds, without notice of any <em>mala fides, </em>on May 23d, 1878, entitled him to hold them against any other person. The possession of the bank was his possession. This was settled by the court in the case of Gibson <em>v. </em>Lenhart, 5 Out., 522, and the admission of all evidence to. the contrary by the learned court below is claimed to be error.</p>

St., Rep. 522) that the plaintiff was a <em>bond fide </em>holder for value of the $9,000 of bonds of the Shenango &amp; Allegheny Railroad Company in controversy, and that the possession of the bank was his possession; in other words, that the delivery of the bonds to the bank for the plaintiff was a delivery to him, as the bonds were negotiable and passed by delivery, it would seem clear that the plaintiff’s title thereto was good against all the world. That his case miscarried in the court below was manifestly due to errors upon the trial.</p>

We have the admission of the bank in the shape of its certificate, signed by its duly constituted officers, that they held for account of the plaintiff $9,000 of the bonds of this company. It also appeared that said bonds were in an envelope with the plain<a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>tiff’s name indorsed thereon; that upon one occasion the coupons were cut off by a bank officer and. the proceeds (1315) placed back in the envelope, which sum the receiver after-wards paid to the plaintiff. The defence now set up is that a portion of these bonds had been previously pledged by Thorp to one Berringer as security for a loan made by the latter to Thorp and Reynolds, and a considerable amount of evidence was received under objection to prove this fact. We are of opinion that all this evidence should have been excluded. There was neither allegation nor proof of any <em>malafides on </em>the part of the plaintiff; nor that he had- any knowledge of such pledge when he made his loan upon the faith of the bonds. Under such circumstances his title was good, and it will not do for the bank now to set up that the bonds in the package are not the original bonds pledged to the plaintiff. If they are the same bonds the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and the bank is estopped from alleging that they have been changed in the bundles. We are of opinion that all of the evidence referred to in the first nine specifications of error should have been excluded.</p>
    <p id="b647-6" data-blocks='[["BL_647.4",647,[197,1269,1170,560]]]'>The plaintiff’s fourth point should have been affirmed without qualification. There was also plain error in that portion of the charge embraced in the twelfth assignment, in which the learned judge instructed the jury that the plaintiff never had the possession of the bonds until they were delivered to him by the sheriff upon the writ of replevin. On the contrary, he had the legal possession of them all the time after they had been delivered to the bank, for the possession of the bank was his possession. So much was distinctly said in 101 Penn. St. Rep., at page 529. The remaining assignments of error relate to portions of the charge referring to the evidence alluded to. As all this will be excluded on the next trial, a further discussion of it is unnecessary.</p>
