In 1873, that portion of the township was included by the lines of Monongahela City, as fixed by Act of Assembly, and since that time this road has been kept up by the city, but without any change of its character or plan.</p>

The fourth, on the. river side of the roadway and east of the culvert, was between three and four feet at the highest point next the culvert wall, and gradually diminished as it reached toward the level ground.
