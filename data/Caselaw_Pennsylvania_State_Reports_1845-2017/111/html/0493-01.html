William Lewis, the plaintiff in error, was appointed, by the Orphans’ Court of Delaware county, guardian of the estate of his niece, Emily Lownes. The latter was the daughter of his sister Emily, by her former husband, Phineas Lownes, who died in the year 1856. Lewis was in partnership with Lownes at the time of the decease of the latter. After the death of the latter, his capital had been continued in the concern by his widow, who was his executrix and sole legatee, until the year 1867, when she dissolved the partnership, which was re-formed between her brother and her second husband, M. E. Parker, to whom she transferred $35,000 out of her capital, which he contributed as his share of the capital of the new concern. The business was carried on under the firm name of Lewis &amp; Parker until the 31st day of December, 1877. At that time Parker retired, and his interest was ascertained to be some $41,000, for \jhich notes were given. The business has ever since been carried on by J. William Lewis individually. Prior to the bringing of the present suit all these moneys, together with some $24,000 additional, had been paid by Lewis to Parker.</p>

Later in the year 1879, M. E. Parker entered into the patent medicine business with said Browning, which was continued uutil the year 1881, when it was dissolved. It proved very unfortunate, and-caused the insolvency of Parker. As guardian of said Emily, Lewis collected some $4,800 from the estates of herMeceased grandfather and uncle. This amount, in January, 1877, by reason of an allowance of seven per cent, interest, of the compounding of interest and of the non-charge of commissions, had increased to $5,982.07. These <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>moneys, from time to time, were deposited with the firm of Lewis <em>&amp; </em>Parker, by said Lewis.

This note included the said $4,226 and the $5,982.07, less, a small sum which had been paid to her to reduce the debt to the even amount of $10,000.

What was her understanding at the time ? I do not' think that in her testimony -she throws any light-Upon what her thought was as to what she was doing at the time she signed it. She said she signed the release. She said she was requested the day before by her mother, and T think she admits that Mr. Lewis came there-the night before, to get her tugo to Chester -in the-morning,-and to sign his-release-as guardian.

Was she imposed• upon and was a worthless debtor substituted for a inairwho was solvent? -You have heard the testimony in regard to Mr. Parker's circumstances at that time, •and as to his circumstances for years afterwards. You have also heard the family relations that then existed between them. As to'her knowledge of what was done,'you have her receipts of interest. Whether her explanation- satisfies you that she did'not know'whether she signed for interest or not, Ido not'know. You'have also-the testimony of her sister that she spoke about her father having the money in 1881, and 'the testiiuony-of her'brother that she: spoke of-her father having the money in 1879, and you -have also the admitted fact by herself that she did receive a note from her father in <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>1874 or 1876, and. a note afterwards in 1876. Why .she should •have received'that note from her father and-not from Mr. Lewis, if she still held Mr. Lewis, is a fact for you to consider, and whether it is-possible for her to have held the note of Mr. ■Parker for so many years and not have examined it or .n.ot • ha-ve known whose note it -was is another fact.for-you to.consider. You are also to remember that she brought suit against Mr. Parker. She made an affidavit .in that suit. The effect .of.bringing that suit against Mr. Parker is for you to consider.

The court did not err in stating the law as to the effect of the release. It will be observed that the release of the guardian did not bear an important part in the inquiry. It was not an essential aid, whether obtained fairly or otherwise, as it could not operate in this action as a defence. It was introduced by the defendants, but was only pertinent in the development of the history of the girl’s fortune, for it made no difference here whether Lewis was released or not. Mrs. Browning was identifying and following her money after it had left her late guardian. She had, therefore, in one sense, accepted his account and investment of it, and thus had gone <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>beyond him and made demand of the real debtor, just as she would have done had he put the money out on mortgage and then terminated his trust.

He has voluntarily forgone that protection, and bound himself by his own figures. He has determined precisely to what extent he owed his ward. He relies on his release. Nor is he attacked here as guardian. It is not that the ward wants to know the amount of her estate, to charge him with it.

In such a case, although the investment may have been originally made in the name of the guardian, equity would, we think, compel the use of his name for the benefit of the ward in an action instituted for its recovery. In the case at bar, there was evidence of such a settlement, accompanied by a release to the guardian from all liability as such. As the ward was confessedly entitled to the balance exhibited by the account, and no relinquishment of it to Lewis was contemplated by way of gift or gratuity, and as no part of that admitted balance was by him then or afterwards paid, although payment was therein expressly acknowledged, the release would, in the first instance, be taken as executed upon the footing of an equitable assignment of the then actually existing investment. And if Mrs. Browning, at the time of the release, did not know that she. held the note of Parker for §10,000, or that Parker by a transfer from Lewis had become the custodian of the fund formerly in Lewis’s hands; if she executed the release upon, the faith of representations of Parker and also of Lewis that.they, and not Parker, were immediately responsible to her for the moneys in their hands, the defendants would, in view of Parker’s- intervening insolvency, be precluded from denying the representations so made, by means of which she was misled to her injury.</p>

The learned Judge says: “If Mr. Lewis had imposed upon her, had got her to sign the release not knowing what she signed, had used fraud or deception it might not be good; or if there was any fraud practiced upon.her, but it is now for you to consider as to whether she deliberately signed that release.

    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[260,743,1173,1157]]]'>Now the, suit is not brought against Lewis, as guardian, nor otherwise in his individual capacity, but. against the firm, of, Lewis,&amp;. Parker., If the release was induced by. artifice and. fraud*,the responsibility of the guardian,would remain, as ,if it had, never been executed, and the plaintiff’s, right of. action, would be against him in his official capacity. This suit, therefore., as we have said, is,necessarily founded upon an accept: anee of the settlement and the release of the guardian, which; together are in the nature of a renunciation of the trust, and opérate as. an assignment of the fund, to the <em>cestui que trust. </em>The jury found for the plaintiff,, and this, under the charge, was equivalent to a finding that the settlement and release were affected with fraud, and were, upon, that- ground, of no binding force-or effect whatever. If the release, in the absence of fraud, operated to discharge Lewis not only as guardian, but from all liability whatsoever, a. verdict for. the plaintiff as against Lewis' must necessarily have resulted from, a, conviction in the xninds of the jurors that the settlement, or, t.he release, or both, were upon the- ground of fraud wholly invalid. But in our view of the case- th.e plaintiff, to sustain her suit,.is bound to accept the guardian’s settlement, and to ratify the-release; her failure so to do is necessarily fatal to her recovery; if she repudiate the settlement she must, resort to-the Orphans’ Court, which alone has jurisdiction to determine the amount of her estate in. the hands.of the guardian;, whilst the, acceptance of the release i.s the-evidence of her- right, independently of her guardian, to recover it.</p>
