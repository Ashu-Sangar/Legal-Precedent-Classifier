She at <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>once agreed to go, and shortly afterward moved into a small house, which he built for her on the farm, where she remained with her son Horace, with the exception of two or three short intervals, until the fall of 1884. William undertook to supply her with necessaries. On April 28th, 1883, William induced his mother to sign an agreement which pui’ports to release all claim on the part of Mrs. Springer under her husband’s will; and in consideration thereof William undertakes to allow his mother to occupy the little house, keep her in flour and meat, and keep a cow for her if she wishes one, pay all taxes and keep up repairs, and pay her $36 a year during her life, with a right of rescission of the agreement after thirty days’ notice. The supplies furnished by William gradually decreased in quantity until his mother was compelled to appeal to the neighbors for help, and those to whom she appealed saw every evidence of destitution. She had previously run bills at the store as long as her credit lasted, was then sued, and attachments served on William and Henry.

    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[255,833,1166,472]]]'>- Upon a careful reading o£ this will, we have arrived at a different conclusion. We do not understand that the testator' intended by this.clause to carve from the widow’s life estate,any additional interest in the land for William, or that the life estate should be determined, and the fee take effect, at any time anterior to the -widow’s death ; the 'language of the will is, that William “is to have the-refusal 'of renting the farm,” which plainly implies a recognition of the continuance of the-widow’s title after the provision'shall take effect; and this implication is greatly strengthened by- the fact that he is to have the refusal of renting the farm “Tropa-his mother.”</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[255,1304,1167,259]]]'>The testator intended, without doubt, just what he said, that-William should occupy as a tenant under his mother, and that her éstate in the land should continue through life. It is quite improbable, w'e think, that he should have meant that his wife, kfter her son’s majority, would lose her management and control of the farm, or her right to regulate its production.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[255,1562,1167,854]],["BL_297.1",297,[234,419,1172,690]]]'>; Under this clause, as we understand it, no additional beneficial interest in the land passed to William. He acquired under it a merely personal right or privilege, which the widow by her acceptance of the will, in' a certain contingency, at the proper time, was bound to respect.- The acceptance of the devise was an engagement on her part to comply with the-provisions of the will respecting.it; and in the event of her refusal she would, we think, have been liable in an action for. the injury sustained. When William arrived at the age of twenty-one years, he exercised the option given him ; he signified his willingness to take the farm on the terms of the will, and with his mother’s approval entered into the possession, and conducted the operations of the farm. The relation of. landlord and tenant thereafter subsisted between. them — not under the will, perhaps, but by the agreement implied from the conduct of the parties, pursuant to its provisions. All the' remedies incident to, or springing out of that relation, both at £he common law .and by'statute, attached at the instant it existed, as in other cases. In the absence of any agreement, otherwise,' $he tenancy was from year to year only, and, if <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>William, from indolence, want of capacity, or other cause, had failed to conduct the work of the farm from year to year in a .reasonably successful manner, upon proper notice she would have had an undpubted right to resume the possession under the statute. It was competent, of course, for the parties, by writing; to provide for a term of years, and for the widow, in a reasonable way; to regulate the manner and'extent of the cultivation, the kind of crops, to provide for the division of the products, and the delivery of her share. She was the landlord and her son the tenant, and. their rights were regulated accordingly. As long as William, in carrying on the affairs of the farm, did his duty in a reasonable and substantial manner, he had a right to-be-retained as a tenant. If improperly excluded .and denied his privilege, he had his remedy, but he had no present interest'd! the land under the will, during the lifetime of his mother.</p>
