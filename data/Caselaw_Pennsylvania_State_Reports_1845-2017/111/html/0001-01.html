The opinion is by Mr. Chief Justice Tilghman. tie reviews the English decisions prior to the Revolution, and the American cases since, which relate to the power of the court to discharge a jury after they are sworn in a capital case, and then says: “I grant that in case of necessity they may be discharged; but if there be anything short of absolute necessity, how can the court, without violating the constitution, take from the prisoner his right to have the jury kept together until they have agreed, so that he may not be put-in jeopard]7 a second time?” He further adds: “ I think myself safe in asserting that there is no evidence of any instance since William Penn obtained his charter from Charles II., in which a jury was discharged without the consent of the prisoner, in a capital case.” He closes his opinion by saying: “For my own part, thinking that their blood would be upon us if they were convicted of murder in the first degree on a second trial in this court, I am of opinion that they should be discharged from this indictment.”</p>
    <p id="b20-6" data-blocks='[["BL_20.4",20,[277,1270,1173,345]]]'>Mr. Justice Duncan also filed an opinion entirely concurring with the Chief Justice, and adds: “ There is, at this day, a settled and uncontroverted rule, that in case of life or member, a jury sworn and charged, cannot be discharged before they give a verdict, unless with the consent of the prisoner, and where it is for his benefit, or in cases of extreme necessity, and if a jury is otherwise discharged, it clearly amounts to an acquittal of the prisoner.”</p>

In discussing the justice and reason of the rule he says: “Why it should be thought that the citizen has no other assurance than the arbitrary discretion of the magistrate for the enforcement of the constitutional principle which protects him from being twice put in jeopardy of life or member for the same offence, I am at a loss to imagine. If discretion is to be called in, there can be no remedy for the most palpable abuse of it, but an interposition of the power to pardon, which is obnoxious to the very same objection? Surely every right secured by the constitution is guarded by sanctions more imperative.” In that case the first jury had been discharged, without the consent of the prisoner, by reason of the sickness of two of the jurors. This court, thinking the illness was produced by reason of the jurors being kept without food or refreshment, and believing if the same had been furnished the health of the jurors would have been sufficiently restored, held there was <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>no sufficient cause for their discharge, and that it was a bar to a second trial for the same offence.</p>

And for all purposes of future protection it is the same to the prisoner as an acquittal, unless it was done with his own consent, or demanded by some overwhelming necessity, such, for instance, as the sickness or death of a juror.”</p>

Thus the constitution of 1776, framed by the convention over which Benjamin Franklin presided, declared “trials shall be by jury as heretofore.” As if to emphasize the thought, and make the right more secure, the constitution of 1790 changed the language, and declared “that trial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate.” These precise words were retained in the constitution of 1838, and are repeated in the constitution of 1874. The question is, Was it error to overrule the prisoner’s plea of former jeopardy, when he was called before the second jury? It may be conceded that a person on trial for a capital offence ought not to be asked to consent to a separation of the jury: Peiffer <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <em>supra. </em>To this conclusion the court came on the next day after permitting them to separate. The prisoner had not withdrawn his consent to that separation. He had not, and did not, interpose any objection to the continuance of his trial before that jury. If it had gone on before them, and he had been convicted of murder in the first degree, <em>non </em>constat, that he would have assigned that separation to avoid the effect of the verdict. The commonwealth could not.</p>

Leg. Jour., N. S., 107. It is neither proven nor alleged that the jurors were subjected to any improper influence during their separation. If the conviction had been for the lesser grade, the separation of itself alone would not have been a fatal error.</p>

If his consent gave any validity to the separation, it remained in full force. He had not in any manner attempted to supersede or impair its effect. If his consent was of no validity, then the error in permitting the separation was that of the court, and the prisoner was not responsible therefor.</p>

It was the action of the court alone, and to retrieve what the court thought was its previous error. If the right to discharge the jury for an error made by the court existed at that stage of the trial, we cannot see why the same right might not again be invoked, if a similar error had been committed near the close of the trial. If the right to so discharge be conceded to exist, then a person may, for the same offence, be put in jeopardy of life for an indefinite number of times.</p>
