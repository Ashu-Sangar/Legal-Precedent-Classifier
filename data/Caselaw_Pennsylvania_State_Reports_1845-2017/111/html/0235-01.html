Mc-Neill was returned as having a majority of 31 votes. On December 16th, 1882, certain voters in the district filed a petition contesting the election. Among other grounds of contest it was alleged that in certain districts of the First, Third and Fourth wards, of Allegheny, the election had been held outside of the geographical limits of the district. A motion to quash the petition as to these allegations was made, and overruled by the court. A commissioner was appointed, and after more than two years of taking testimony the «case was certified to court, and upon agreement every allegation of fraudulent voting was abandoned, and the contest was placed upon the election being held outside of the election districts in certain precincts of the First, Third and Fourth wards before alluded to. The court by its decree rejected from the count all votes cast in these precincts, filing the following opinion:</p>

Was a legal election held in Kilbuck township.</p>

The places indicated for the four districts above were not within the boundaries of the respective districts, but were in certain <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>rooms of the public school building in adjoining districts of the same wards.</p>

These questions are conclusively answered by the language of the state constitution. That instrument provides that “ every male citizen twenty-one years of age, possessing the following qualifications, shall be entitled to vote,” and necessarily any citizen not possessing each and all of the prescribed qualifications shall not be entitled to vote. The third of these essential qualifications contains the answer to the above questions. It says, “ he (the elector) shall have resided in the election district <em>where he shall offer to vote </em>at least two months immediately preceding the election.” The elector, to possess this qualification, must reside and offer to vote in one and the same district. He who resides for two months before an election in one district, and offers to vote and votes in another, cast an unauthorized ballot.</p>

This qualification was adopted from the former Constitution, the time of the prescribed residence being increased from ten days to two months. The similar provision of the former Constitution has been passed upon by the Supreme Court, in Chase <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20419" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Wright 419">5 Wright, 419</a>. The court say of this provision, which was an amendment of the prior Constitution, “ construing the words according to their plain and literal import (and we must presume that the people of Pennsylvania construed them so when they adopted the amendment), they mean undoubtedly that the citizen possessing the other requisite qualification is to have a ten days’ residence in an election district, and is to offer his ballot in that district.'.....The amendment introduced not only a new test of the right of suffrage, to wit, a district residence, but a rule of voting also. Place became an element of suffrage for a two-fold purpose. Without the district residence no man shall vote, but having had the district residence the right it confers is to vote in that district. Such is the voice of the Constitution. The test and the rule are equally obligatory. We have no power to dispense with either. Whoever would claim the franchise which the Constitution grants must exercise it in the manner the Constitution prescribes.” <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>Again, the legislature by resolution of 26th April, 1844, undertook to amend the former Constitution, and to authorize a citizen, who had removed from his district to another within ten days before an election, to vote in the district from which he had removed, thus attempting to permit an elector to vote in a district in which he did not reside. This resolution came before the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, in Thompson <em>v. </em>Ewing, 1 Brewster 103, and the court, upon the authority of Chase <em>v. </em>Miller, ruled that the resolution was unconstitutional. So satisfactory and convincing were these decisions that the resolution of 1844 has been omitted in Purdon’s Digest of the laws of the state.</p>

We may say, by way of caution, that no Act of Assembly confers upon the election officers the right to hold an election at any place but that designated, and that the law provides ample and speedy remedy whenever a reasonable occasion -arises. In the present case many of the citizens and some of the election officers knew that the polling place would be uncomfortable, in ample time to have made it suitable at a trifling expense. Under such circumstances the question involved here should not have been permitted to arise.</p>
