Her mother and testator’s wife were sisters. Testator and his wife had no children, and becoming attached to claimant they took her into their family to educate, clothe and maintain as their own child. They sent her to school until she was about twelve years of age. ' Testator’s wife in the meantime carried on the business of a dressmaker, and as claimant had grown old enough to be useful in the work of the household, she was taken from school and required to perform the labor and services of a domestic servant. It did not appear that any regularly employed servant did the work of the household for any length of time after claimant was taken from school. Nor did it appear that she ever received any compensation or wages in addition to her clothing and maintenance. Testator’s wife was severe and exacting in the treatment of her niece, and on one occasion when the latter was about fourteen years of age severely punished her, when her mother entered the house and protested against such treatment of her child, and declared she would not permit it, and would take her away. Testator was present and pacified claimant’s mother by stating that if she would permit her to remain with him and his wife he would see that she was treated differently; that she should have a good home as long as he lived, and at his death he would provide for her, and that she should never want as long as she lived.</p>

Upon their return to this county they again commenced housekeeping, and claimant, although married, returned to their home and performed the services of a domestic. Her husband being a seaman was frequently absent. This was repeated frequently during the 3rears subsequent to the marriage of claimant, and the testator and wife on many occasions expressed their gratitude for the services of claimant bestowed upon them. The former more than once declared his intention of providing liberally for claimant in consideration of what she had done, and promised so to do, not only in her presence but to other persons who communicated to her the declarations made by him, and also those of his wife, ratified and adopted by him. Notwithstanding these promises and assurances testator on December 13th, 1881, executed his will, bequeathing to claimant only the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, his wife having died a few days prior to the date of the will. On June 26th, 1882, he sailed for England, and died there April 11th, 1883.</p>

Both of which positions could not be sustained. But it is a claim to recover damages for the non-performance of a promise and agreement of testator, in consideration of which claimant rendered during a series of years valuable and meritorious services. And that contract, as proved, was not only to amply compensate claimant, but to such an extent “ that she should never want as long as she lived.” The making of the original promise was proved b3r a single witness, it is true, but she was reliable, trustworthy, disinterested and unimpeached. She is corroborated by proof of subsequent declarations and acknowledgments of such a promise made both by the testator and 1ns wife ; those b}r the latter communicated to him and adopted by him.

And in regard to the promise in this case by testator, it would be equally valid if made after the services had been performed.

This was to provide-for her at his death, “ that she should never want as long as she lived.” There was no evidence upon the subject, but the evident intention of testator was to provide for her a reasonable livelihood,.having in view the magnitude of his own estate, and the probable station in life of claimant. He intended to keep her from penury and want.</p>

But, as was said by Judge Strong in Graham <em>v. </em>Graham, 10 Casey 481, such cases are “ always dangerous, and, when they rest upon parol evidence, they should be strictly scanned. Especially wdren an attempt is made, under cover of a parol contract, to effect a distribution different from that which the law makes, or that which the decedent has directed by his will, should it meet with no favor in a court of law. .....Such contract may be enforced only when it is clearly proved by direct and positive testimonjq and where its terms are definite and certain.”</p>

She remained with him as a member of his family for about eighteen years, when she married and removed to her husband’s home in Vineland, N. J., though' at various subsequent times she returned with one or more of her children, and made visits of greater or less duration. Her marriage took place about ten years before the decedent’s death. The parties appear to have been in comparatively humble circumstances; and when the claimant, who was only six years of age when she became a member of the family, grew old enough, she assisted her aunt in doing the work of the house, and finally, it would seem, during the latter years of her stay attended to it altogether herself. She now claims that the decedent promised, in consideration of her services, and of her remaining with him for the time she did, to make such provision for her by his will as would support her for life.</p>

She continued to do that until she was married. I left there in 1864. She was about fourteen years of age then. I heard an interview between her mother and Mr. Heathcote, in reference to Annie, a week or two before I left......Her aunt had been beating her, and her mother came in and she said she would take her away; that she would not have her daughter treated that way; that she had been made a slave of all her life ever since she was there. Her uncle stepped up and said if she should let her stay that things would be different; that she would have a good home as long as he lived, and at his death he would provide for her; that she should never want as long as she lived. Annie’s mother agreed to let her stay, and she stayed until she was married. After I left, Annie had to do the housework and sew, too......This conversation occurred about twenty years ago.”</p>

Bearing in mind the principles already stated which govern cases of this character, the fair interpretation of the contract testified to is that the claimant should “stay with” the decedent as long as he lived as the consideration of his promise to furnish her with a home while he lived and provide for her at his death. She did not do this, but left him and went to her own home, where she resided at the time of his wife’s death and of his own. Having thus voluntarily put an end to the contract the obligation ceased, and neither party was bound by it any longer. Compensation for services theretofore rendered, if it could be demanded at all, could only have been under a <em>quantum meruit </em>upon an implied contract; and such claim, when the decedent died, was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

Finding her in great distress of mind, Mrs. Heathcote asked her the cause. ■ Her reply was that it was because of her great anxiety as to what would become of her daughter, who, in the event of her death, “ would be left without any means for her sustenance or anything of that sort.” To this Mrs. Heathcote answered, “ If that is all, you need .not trouble yourself, Annie will be provided for amply. Mr. Heathcote and I have agreed that this shall be seen to, that Annie will be cared for.” “This,” Dr. Ingraham testified, “ seemed to quiet Mrs. Elkton very much, and she subsequently recovered from her sickness, not dying for a considerable length of time after that, and then of a different disease.”</p>

As she was the niece by marriage of the decedent, and was taken into his family when only six years of age, and was fed, clothed and maintained by the decedent as one of his family during all the period of her stay with him, nothing less than an express contract would be sufficient to sustain a recovery. The only direct evidence of such a contract is found in the testimony of Mrs. Dukes. The appellant being about the age of fourteen years, a conversa<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>tion took piace between her mother and her uncle, the dece* dent, in the presence of the appellant, in the following circumstances, as testified by the witness: “ Her (the appellant’s) aunt had been beating her, and her mother came in and she said she would take her away ; that she would not have her daughter treated in that way; that she had been made a slave of all her life ever since she was there. Her uncle stepped up and said, if she would let her stay that things would be different; that she should have a good home as long as he liveck and at his death he would provide for her; that she should never want as long as she lived. Annie’s mother agreed to let her stay, and she staid until she was married. After I left Annie had to do the housework, and sew too......This conversation occurred about twenty years ago.” The <em>literal </em>meaning of these words leaves the contract upon which the claim is founded in a state of entire uncertainty in its most material part, and that is as to the length or continuance of the service which the appellant was to render. How long was she to stay? Was it one month, one year, until her marriage, or during the life of the uncle ? It is simply impossible to answer this question. A species of compensation is alleged to have been fixed, to wit, a good home as long as he lived, and a provision for her at his death, so that she should never want as long as she lived. Supposing this rather indefinite compensation to be sufficiently certain to abide the test of the decisions, what was to be done by the appellant in order to entitle her to it ? Admittedly, she was to render service, but how much service? Just here is the difficulty. The contract itself ought either to specify the amount of service to be rendered, or at least ought to afford the means of ascertaining or defining with some sort of precision the consideration which was to be given for the compensation claimed. If this is not done the law has no standard by which to measure the performance by the claimant of her part of the contract. Where such is the ease the alleged contract is hopelessly uncertain and cannot be enforced.</p>
    <p id="b483-8" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[174,1978,1174,474]],["BL_484.1",484,[253,404,1180,989]]]'>While the <em>literal </em>meaning of the words of the coutract as testified to by Mrs. Dukes, leaves it in such a condition of uncertainty, an implied meaning might be reasoned out that the appellant was to stay with the decedent as long as he lived, because, according to the witness, he said she should have a good home as long as he lived, and at his death he would provide for her. But if such was the meaning of the parties a still more serious difficulty arises from the fact that the appellant never performed her part of such a contract. When she was about twenty-three years of age she married and left the decedent’s family and lived with her husband. <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>This was about ten years before the death of the testator. She rendered some service at irregular intervals afterwards, but of 'course this could not come within a contract for continuous service. So much of the claim as would be due upon a <em>quantum </em>meruit, before the appellant’s marriage, is barred by the statute of limitations, and thus the claim is left without any adequate support of testimony to sustain it. There was other testimony of declarations and admissions by the (Jecedent, but none of it relieves the case of the radical difficulties we have indicated. It was of the usual kind always found in such cases. None of the declarations were made to the appellant or in her presence. Some were expressions of gratitude for the services of the appellant, and some were expressions of an intent to provide for her at testator’s death. In so far as they related to services rendered in the past, they could not constitute a contract relation, they were at most but the assertions of an intent to make a testamentary provision, and this, of course, depended upon the mere will of the testator. He did make some small provision for the appellant in that way, and so far as that circumstance is an indication of the testator’s intent in all he had said, it disproves instead of proving, the theory that he supposed he was under a contract obligation.</p>
    <p id="b484-5" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[248,1395,1174,677]]]'>The case comes almost literally within the decision of this court in Pollock <em>v. </em>Ray, 4 Norris, 428. Thus on p. 432 we said: “If the declarations had been to the effect that if the plaintiff would remain with him until his death he would then do well by her, or pay her wages, there would be some plausibility in the contention that there was a mutual contract ; she to serve him until his death, and he either to provide for her by will or pay her wages. It might possibly have been sustained under the case of Thompson <em>v. </em>Stevens, 21 P. F. S., 161. This was not, however, pretended to have been the contract. Had she remained until his death it might perhaps have been implied. But in point of fact she left his service ten years before his death. There was no engagement on her part to remain a day. She might have left immediately, and her ease would have stood as strong on the evidence as it is now.”</p>

The testimony in that case was quite as express and positive as in this. As to the length of service it was very definite, but as to the compensation it was indefi<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>nite and uncertain, and for that reason chiefly it was held to be insufficient to sustain the claim.</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[199,493,1164,384]]]'>Claims of this nature against dead men’s estates, resting entirely in parol, based largely upon loose declarations, presented generally years after the services in question were rendered, and when the lips of the party principally interested are closed in death, require the closest and most careful scrutiny to prevent injustice being done. We cannot too often repeat the cautions we have so frequently uttered upon this subject, and we feel that,, the present occasion is one which demands both their repetition and their application.</p>
    <p id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[459,877,905,129]]]'>The decree of the court below is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
