St., 349</a>, there seems to be a dictum by Mr. Justice Read that the check of the donor on his banker is the proper subject of a donation <em>causa mortis, </em>but the question was not before the court. Moreover, in one of the cases cited to support this dictum (Boutts <em>v. </em>Ellis, 31 Eng. L. Eq., 174), the cheek was paid before the donor’s death, and in the other case (Harris <em>v. </em>Clark, 3 Comstock, 93-114), it was held by a majority of the court that such a check unaccepted is not valid as a gift <em>causa mortis. </em>And in Rhodes <em>v. </em>Childs, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20Pa.%2024" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="64 Pa. 24">64 Pa. St., 24</a>, where the dictum is cited as authority, the donor was payee in the check, which was the subject of the gift, and the money appears to have been drawn prior to his death by the donee. These cases then cannot be considered authorities in point. It is argued however, that as this check was not payable until six months after the drawer’s death, it was not revoked, as by its terms it could not be'paid or accepted in bis lifetime, and that its delivery therefore made it a valid gift of the money specified in it, either <em>inter vivos </em>or <em>causa mortis. </em>The principal case relied upon to support this argument is Lawson <em>v. </em>Lawson, 1 Peere Williams, 441. In that case A., during his last illness, drew a bill upon a goldsmith for the payment of one hundred pounds to his wife, with a written indorsement that the money was to buy her mourning, and although it was not paid or accepted during A.’s lifetime, it was held that it was a valid <em>donatio causa mortis, </em>because it was evident he intended the authority should be exercised after his death. But it seems clear under later English authorities that the bill was a testamentary disposition, and not a gift <em>causa mortis.</em>

In Frew <em>v. </em>Clarke, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20Pa.%20178" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="80 Pa. 178">80 Pa. St., 178</a>, it is said that no form of words is necessary to make a valid will. The form of the instrument is immaterial if the substance is testamentary. In Turner <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20Pa.%20132" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="51 Pa. 132">51 Pa. St., 132</a>, it is said that the essence of a will is that it is a disposition to take effect after death. And in Kellcher v. Neman, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Md.%20440" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="16 Md. 440">16 Md., 440</a>, that when an instrument does not operate <em>inter vivos, </em>but is made to depend for its whole operation upon the death of the maker to consummate it, then it can only take effect as testamentary. It is immaterial that there are no directions to the executors to pay the money; this not being one of the requisites of a testamentary paper. Moreover, it has been expressly ruled in England that checks of this kind are testamentary. In Bartholomew <em>v. </em>Brown <em>v. </em>Henley, 3 Philimore, 317, three checks which the testator indicated by indorsements on the margin of his check book were not tobe paid until after his death, were held to be testamentary, and were admitted to probate as a codicil to his will. In Gladstone <em>v. </em>Tempest, 2 Curties, 650, the testator drew two checks on his banker in favor of two of his servants, and delivered them sealed up with the direction that they should be presented after his death, and they were admitted to probate as part of his will by the Ecclesiastical Court. See same (Walsh <em>v. </em>Gladstone, 1 Phillips’ C. C., 293), where the Court of Chancery held the legacies given by the checks were revoked by testator’s subsequent will. In Jones <em>v. </em>Nickolay, 2 Robertson, 288, it was held that a paper was admissible to proof as a codicil to a will, which was in the form of an order on a banker to pay at twelve days’ sight a sum of money to a certain person, duly executed, but containing no reference to the will. And it was said that a paper clearly not intended as a part of the will of a testator, not on the face of it testamentary, yet, where it was not to have consummation till after his death, was part of his will if not revoked by subsequent acts.</p>

There it is held that a present bond to pay a sum of money at the obligor’s death, and delivery renders it perfect as a present obligation and is irrevocable. But the reasons for this conclusion were that the bond was an executed contract, and that the seal imported a consideration which made it strictly <em>debitum in presentí solvendum in futuro, </em>and in Carey <em>v. </em>Dennis et al., <a href="/md/13/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="13 Md. 1" data-case-ids="1860723" data-case-paths="/md/13/0001-01">13 Md., 1</a>, it is held that where bonds were executed by a father and delivered to a third party, with instructions to deliver them to the obligees, his sons, in case he died without a will, that they were testamentary.</p>
