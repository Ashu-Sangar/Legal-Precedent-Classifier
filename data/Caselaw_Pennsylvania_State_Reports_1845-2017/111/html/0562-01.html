These cases determine that it is the duty of a Referee, under this Act, to reduce his decision to writing, “ stating separately and distinctly the facts found, the answers to any points submitted in writing by counsel, and the conclusions of law.” In Butterfield <em>v. </em>Lathrop, 21 P. F. S., 229, which was a reference under a similar statute, it was held, that “the finding must contain the facts as fully as a special verdict, and we regard this as the proper rule. A special verdict is one by which the facts of the case are put on the record and the law is submitted to the judges: 2 Bouv., 780 ; it follows that the judgment is but the conclusion of the law upon the facts thus found.</p>
    <p id="b577-10" data-blocks='[["BL_577.12",577,[196,1835,1173,563]]]'>A garnishee in an attachment execution is in no worse position as to the attaching creditor than he would be as to the defendant. Every defence he- has against the defendant’s claim he can interpose to the attachment. Every act of defendant releasing him is valid as against the attachment. The attaching creditor is in no superior position to the defendant. A long line of cases decides this. See Riddle <em>v. </em>Etting, 8 Casey, 412; Patten <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 Id., 299, etc. And see an analogous case to the present: Dougherty <em>v. </em>Hunter, 4 P. F. S., 380, in which it is held that a certain receipt was a satisfaction of an account. If there was no fraud or collusion, creditors could not set aside the settlement and satisfaction. The rights of creditors rise no higher than the defendant’s.</p>

The uncorroborated testimony of a single witness contradicting a writing, which writing is corroborated by the other party’s testimony, is not sufficient to overthrow the Avritteu instrument. See Phillips <em>v. </em>Meily, 10 Out., 536.</p>

It is his duty “ to hear and determine.” The Referee occupies the same position as a court hearing a cause Avithout a jury: Act of May 14th, 1874, Br. Purd. Dig., 1473. The Act of April 22d, 1874, § 2, Br. Purd. Dig., 1364, pl. 59, provides: “The decision of the court shall be in Avriting, stating separately and distinctly the facts found, the answers to any points submitted in writing by counsel, and the conclusions of Irav.”</p>

No bill of exceptions was tendered, nor is it claimed that any was tendered.</p>

    <p id="b578-9" data-blocks='[["BL_578.12",578,[245,1794,1177,519]]]'>The report of the Referee in this case is fatally defective. There is no such separate and distinct findings of facts and conclusions of law, as Ave have again and again said are essential: Marr <em>v. </em>Marr, 103 Pa. St., R., 463 ; Sweigard <em>v. </em>Wilson, 106 Id., 207. It is not enough that by going carefully through the entire report we might be able to separate the Referee’s findings from the testimony which he cites, and the arguments Avhich he adduces in support of his views. It is the busiuess of the Referee to separate them. It was held in Butterfield <em>v. </em>Lathrop, 71 Pa. St. R., 225, that the finding must contain the facts as fully as a special verdict, and this was said in Sweigard <em>v. </em>Wilson, <em>supra, </em>to be the proper rule.</p>

There is no finding as to what composed those items, beyond the folloAving: “No bill of particulars was pre<a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>sented to the Referee, but from the testimony taken and the arguments of counsel, the following appeared to be the items of dispute.” It would be straining a point to say that this was a finding of anything, and if it is, we are left in the dark as to whether it is based upon the evidence in the cause or the arguments of counsel. It utterly lacks the certainty and precision of a special verdict. It is not enough to say what the facts “ appear ” to be.</p>
    <p id="b579-6" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[177,757,1181,303]]]'>The Referee then proceeds to a discussion of the respective items of dispute, and so far as he has found the facts in regard to them, his findings are interwoven with portions of the testimony, the respective contentions of counsel and his own arguments ahd thoughts in regard to them ; whereas, the findings of facts should have been separate, following the -necessary discussion of the case.</p>
    <p id="b579-7" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[179,1062,1179,606]]]'>The conclusions of law, if stated at all, are only stated inferentialty, and in connection with the findings of facts. The principal matter for the Referee’s decision was whether a full settlement between the garnishee and the defendant had been made. A receipt in full was produced in evidence, which receipt was disregarded by the Referee, without any satisfactory finding of either law or fact in regard to it. While a receipt of this kind is not conclusive, yet it is always prima: <em>facie </em>evidence of a settlement, and should only be set aside for weighty reasons, especially after a lapse of years, and the reasons should be fully and clearly stated. Fraud, accident or mistake would be sufficient to avoid such an instrument, but in such case the cause of avoidance should distinctly appear.</p>
