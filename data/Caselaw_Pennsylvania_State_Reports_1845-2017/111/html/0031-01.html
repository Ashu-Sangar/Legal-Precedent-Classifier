      <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>The court, Hart, P. J., filed the following opinion: — The note in suit being for part of the consideration to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff for the grant to them in the lease of date June 18th, 1885, of the right to mine and excavate for natural gas, the plaintiff cannot recover upon it, if it be true, as claimed, that he had previously, to wit, on the 11th day of December, 1880, leased the same lands to the Niagara Oil Company, with the exclusive privilege of boring and mining for natural gas, as well as for petroleum. The whole ease, therefore, hinges upon the construction to be put upon the last mentioned lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b47-6" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[195,909,1176,520]]]'>The language of the lease in question is that the lessor “has granted,, demised and let unto the party of the second part ” (The Niagara Oil Company) “the sole and exclusive right of mining and excavating for petroleum, rock or carbon oil, <em>or other valuable volatile </em>substances.” Does this last expression-other valuable volatile substances — include natural gas? In my judgment it does not. Gas is not, either in the popular or the chemical sense of the word a “volatile substance.” Ether, alcohol, the essential oils and some other substances, mostly fluids, are said to be volatile, because they readily pass into a gaseous or aeriform state, or exhale their particles, as musk for instance, on simple exposure to the atmosphere.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b47-7" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[193,1425,1179,253]]]'>See Webster <em>'in verbo. </em>„ Petroleum is, more or less, volatile. Amer. Cyc. Vol. 7; Encyc. Brit. Vol. 18. And it was for petroleum and <em>other </em>substances having similar <em>volatile proper</em>ties, that the plaintiff by his lease of December 11th, 1880, granted to the Niagara Oil Company the exclusive right to search and mine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b47-8" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[190,1687,1176,430]]]'>But natural gas not being, in any proper sense of the term, “ volatile,” cannot be considered as intended by the parties to be included in that lease. It follows that-the plaintiff had still a good title to all the natural gas underneath his farm when he granted to the defendants the right to mine for it by the lease of June 18th, 1885, as set out in the case stated. There is, therefore, no failure of consideration and the defendants are bound to pay the full amount of the note in suit, and judgment must accordingly be entered on the case stated in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

It is true the contract we are called upon to construe is in writing, and if the facts were all admitted it would be our plain duty to determine the rights of the parties under it. But the main controlling fact in the case is whether natural gas is a volatile substance, partaking of the nature of petroleum, rock or carbon oil. This is not a question of law; it is one of fact, and the whole case hinges upon it. So far from this question of fact being conceded, or agreed upon by the parties, it is the bone of contention; the one side vehemently contending that natural gas is a volatile substance; the other that it is not. If the words “or other'volatile substances” contained in the lease from Buchanan to the Niagara Oil Company were technical words, and had a fixed meaning, it would have been well enough to ask us to construe them. But they have no well defined legal meaning; the3&gt;- create an ambiguity, and their construction becomes a mixed question of law and fact, in which the court, and if necessary, a jury, must'have the aid of scientific men. Speaking for myself, I do not know with the certainty that should mark judicial action, whether natural gas is a volatile substance or not, and I do not propose to unite in a decision of a question which I do not thoroughly <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>understand. It is true an examination of the scientific authorities cited might lead us to a conclusion, but the application of general theories and definitions to a particular subject might in a matter of science result in error, to the, injury of the rights of others. We are the more disposed to move with caution in this matter for the reason developed upon the argument that this case, of slight importance as regards the immediate parties to it, incidentally involves the rights of others to a very large amount.</p>
