The change of possession must be <em>bona fide, </em>not colorable — clear, unequivocal and exclusive. The rule is intended to prevent fraud, and avoid the danger to creditors, by giving a man a false and delusive credit . . . and how is it possible that a change, merely for a single night or day, can answer the purpose, and advise the public of the change of ownership in the property. It is not sufficient that the assignor give to the assignee a delivery, which may be symbolical or constructive, or a temporary delivery, and then take the articles back into his own possession, and keep and use them just as before.
