A. Balph, Henry P. Ford et al. The defendants were indicted for conspiracy and assault, and the ground upon which the removal was asked was that the defendants could not have a fair trial in Warren County for certain reasons set forth in the said petition. Without entering into detail, it is sufficient to say that the case arose out of a conflict of jurisdiction between the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County and the Court of Common Pleas No. 2, of Allegheny Countj'', in regard to the appointment of a Receiver, culminating in the appointment of such officer by each court, and an attempt by each to enforce its own orders and decrees. So far did this proceed that the Court of Warren County discharged upon habeas corpus a person adjudged guilty of contempt by the Court of Allegheny County, and who was in custody under an attachment. The petition further averred that a fair and impartial trial before a judge and jury of Warren County could not be had because of the excitement and prejudice existing against them in said county, not only on the part of the public generally, but by the jurors likely to be empannelled in the cause, and the judge before whom the case would be tried.</p>

He says: “ If it had been material to produce the statement of the judges, I see no reason why it should not be produced, as the time was ample. I see, therefore, no reason for continuing the cause. As the matter strikes me, a statement of the judges in opposition to the affidavit would not be material. If what Mr. Derringer says in his affidavit be true that two of them (the judges) <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>expressed themselves in such a manner as to render a. trial before them very unfair to the accused, it would be very improper for them to try this cause. If his statement against them be false we may well suppose the feeling which that statement would make in the breast of those judges. "We cannot control human nature, and when a judge has a man before him who has made a false charge against him, it is almost impossible to administer justice fairly. I think it would be very unfair under these circumstances to expect either of these judges to try the cause. They should be the last ones to whom to apply. Whether the affidavit be true or false, it seems to me a good reason for asking them not to decide.”</p>

They existed in prior constitutions, and conferred no additional power. The third is a limitation of our power as formerly exercised, by taking away a portion of our original jurisdiction. That it was intended to sweep away the court of <em>nisi prius </em>in which our original jurisdiction had been generally, if not wholly exercised, was not left open to conjecture, as it is expressly declared by the 21st section of the 5th Article, that “the court of <em>nisi prius </em>is hereby abolished, and no court of original jurisdiction to be presided over by any one or more of the judges of the Supreme Court shall be established.” <em>It </em>is contended that this language, in connection with the 3d section of Article 5 takes away all our powers as justices of the Oyer and Terminer. We do not so understand the constitution, nor does it so read. Conceding for the purposes of this case that w'e may no longer try a case brought into this court, at <em>nisi </em>

      <em>prius. </em>it is begging the question to say we may not try it at all. The constitution must be so read as to give effect to all its parts, and when it distinctly says that the judges of this court shall be <em>ex officio </em>justices of the Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery in every county in the state, it means something. It is not an idle phrase inscribed for mere sound, or to fill up space. It was not new; it was taken literally from the constitution of 1838. It was known to the convention that this court had in several cases placed a construction upon this clause. It is sufficient to refer to a single case : Com. <em>v. </em>Ickhoff, 9 Casey, 80, in which it was distinctly held that “ each of the judges of this court has power to hold a court of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery in any county of the state.” It was said by Chief Justice Lowkie : “ This is a cause in- the Oyer and Terminer, and the president judge, within whose jurisdiction it falls, represents to us that there is a legal impediment that prevents him hearing it, and asks us to send one of the judges of this court to try it. We think that we are bound to do so. We know of no legal or constitutional authority for any judge of the Common Pleas to hold a court of Oyer and Terminer out of his district, and when such a court is held by judges of the Common Pleas it requires two to make a quorum, the president being one. But the jurisdiction of this court extends over the whole state, and its judges are, by virtue of their office, Justices of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery in the several counties; and the judges of the Common Pleas cannot hold an Oyer and Terminer, or Jail Delivery Court, while the Supreme Court or any of them are sitting in the same county for criminal trials: Const., Art. V., §§ 4, 5. This makes it appear plain that each judge of this court has power to hold a court of Oyer and Terminer, or of General Jail Delivery, in any county of the state. They are severally justices for this purpose, and no quorum being established, each of them has full and equal authority to hold such courts. Any of them sitting in the same county excludes the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas judges, and this can mean no less than that any one of them has jurisdiction, and therefore excludes all other jurisdictions that are not superior.”</p>
    <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[206,2079,1170,301]]]'>That the same power exists now is beyond all controversy. From all that has been said it would seeim to be clear that the only change which the constitution makes in our powers in criminal cases, is to prevent our trying indictments in the <em>nisi prius. </em>That court is dead without the hope of resurrection. But each judge has the power to sit and try indictments in any county of the state.</p>

It is not strictly speaking original jurisdiction. A certiorari brings up a record for review; it is not the commencement of an original suit. The general powers of supervision over criminal cases inherent to the King’s Bench, and expressly conferred upon this court by statute, means something more than the trial of the case before a jury. It means in its broadest sense that wé shall see that every man charged with crime shall have a fair and impartial trial; that where it is made clear to us that a man cannot have such a trial, either from an excited and inflamed condition of the public mind in the county where the indictment was found, or from feeling or prejudice on the part of the judge, or any other sufficient cause, we shall issue our certiorari, remove the record into this court and send it down to another county for trial, and if necessary before one of the judges of this court. That it is a power to be exercised with extreme caution is admitted. That it may be abused is possible. But I can readily imagine circumstances in the future which would make the exercise of this power the only barrier between a good citizen and gross oppression. If the people shall be of opinion that it was unwisely conferred, or that it is being improperly exercised, they can change it by a modification of the fundamental law. The mere knowledge that such a power exists in this court it is believed will make its frequent use unnecessary.</p>

A statute may provide that said court may review interlocutory orders and judgments, as well as final judgments, but a provision that the court shall retain the cause for trial after such review would be void. Appellate jurisdiction is a continuation of the judicial power which has been executed in the court of original jurisdiction, it involves only a review, and if no error be found the judgment of the inferior court stands. But in case of reversal, if the proper judgment cannot be pronounced without the taking of additional testimony, or another trial to determine the facts, the appellate court settles the questions which were raised in the record and remands the cause to the court having original jurisdiction for further investigation and adjudication. If the appellate court also had original jurisdiction of such cause the case would be different.</p>

The provision is plain, in negative words, and there is no ground for avoiding it by construction or interpretation. Being a part of the organic law of the Commonwealth, it repeals prior repugnant statutes. It cannot rightfully be nullified by prior statutes or judicial decisions. No legislation is necessary to carry the repeal into effect. The direct security of rights, and the positive prohibition of acts, where legislation’ is not manifestly contemplated for the enforcement thereof, are valid and effective from the adoption of the constitution: In re Grape Street, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20W.N.C.%20377" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="13 W.N.C. 377">13 W.

    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[256,622,1170,730]]]'>None of the prior constitutions contained a limitation and prohibition of original jurisdiction. That of 1776 provided that the Supreme Court, besides the powers usually exercised by such courts, should have certain powers of a court of chancery, “ and such other powers as may be found necessary by future.General Assemblies, not inconsistent with this constitution.” And similar provision was in the constitutions of 1790 and 1838. Under all of them the power of the legislature to confer original jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court was unrestricted. That power was liberally exercised, as maybe seen in the opinion of the court in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Simpson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Grant%20439" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Grant 439">2 Grant, 439</a>, and in the dissenting opinion by Justice Rea.d, in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Frowenfield, <a href="/grant/3/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="3 Grant 99" data-case-ids="229190" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0099-01">3 Grant, 99</a>.

This provision was in the constitution of 1838; and it is in the present, with the modification that the judges of the Court of Common Pleas, learned in the law, shall be judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Since 1790 there has been the same constitutional provision respecting the extent of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and that “the judges thereof shall, by virtue of their offices, be justices of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery in the several counties.” By virtue of the constitution a Court of Oyer and Terminer exists in each county. It is not a creation of the legislature. The judges of the Common Pleas, by virtue of their offices, are judges of the Oyer and Terminer, but their duties and powers as judges of that criminal court are the same as if they were not also judges of another court. The Oyer and Terminer has original jurisdiction iii criminal cases, and its judges have no greater power respecting its business than they would have if not also judges of the Common Pleas, or of the Supreme Court. When one or more of the judges of the Supreme Court act as judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer in any county, they exercise the duties <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>and powers of judges of that court, neither more nor less, and their proceedings and judgments are subject to review by the Supreme Court, same as if said criminal court was held by any other judges thereof.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[197,591,1179,1642]]]'>I have referred to the questions of jurisdiction, believing they bear on the propriety of granting the petition of the defendants. If no error be shown in the proceedings of the Court of Quarter Sessions which ought to be corrected at this stage, it seems to me that the main result of interference by the appellate court will be delay. I believe that a court for the correction of errors cannot rightfully delay a trial in the court of original jurisdiction, when no error appears to have been committed. If it can, the state of the law relative to the trial of criminal causes, since the adoption of the present constitution, is no better than it was before. As the law stood before, this court could bring up causes from the inferior criminal courts and try them. In Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Simpson, supra, Justice Black said: “It is clear that we have the power of bringing criminal cases into this court for trial by certiorari, but we ought not to have it. It has never yet been exercised for the punishment of offenders, but it has often had the effect of screening them from justice. Of the numerous removals which have been made in fifty'years, not one has resulted in conviction; and nine out of ten have never been tried......I make these remarks in the hope of calling to the subject the attention of that department of the government which alone can give a remedy for what I am sure is a great evil.” The legislature gave no remedy, but the consti-' tution of 1874 did by prohibiting this court from exercising original jurisdiction, except in the cases therein named. What is that remedy worth if this court may delay the trial in the proper court ? Is it not notorious that delay in bringing an offender to trial tends to his acquittal? During the delay the prosecutor may become weary, or satisfied, or the Commonwealth’s witnesses lost; and then the offender will be ready for trial, and the District Attorney learns that he cannot adduce evidence to convict. In my opinion no certiorari should be issued by this court to arrest a trial and bring up a' cause before final judgment in the court below, except for such error as must be corrected before the alleged offender could have a fair trial on the merits, and that such error ought to be shown prima facie at the time of application for the writ.</p>

There being no error in the record, there is no cause for the writ: Cases have been cited which were removed into this court prior to 1874, where a court of <em>nisi prius </em>was ordered to be held in the proper county for the trial; all such cases were when this court had original jurisdiction, and before the court of <em>nisiprius </em>was abolished.</p>
