At that time there were two persons of that name, father and son. On April 10th, 1811, George Wallace the elder entered into an agreement of sale of the said land with one Boyle Irwin, reserving a perpetual ground rent of $165; George died in 1812, leaving a will which contained the following clause, referring to the land in question :</p>

The plaintiffs claim to recover the rent falling due on the first day of April in each year, from 1865 to 1882, inclusive, at the rate of $156 per year. The original grant, upon which rent was reserved, embraced about eight acres, and covered all the ground lying between what is now known as Penn Aveuue and the Hill, which according to the subsequent plot of the city of Pittsburgh, is embraced between Seventeenth and Nineteenth streets; the ground now charged, however, is part thereof only, being a lot seventy-eight feet front and one hundred feet deep, situate on the corner of Penn Avenue and Harrison street, which now is, and during the period stated, has been, in the possession and actual occupancy of the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b181-8" data-blocks='[["BL_181.8",181,[235,1656,1161,761]]]'>In order that the plaintiffs may recover, it must appear that they are legally invested with the title of George Wallace, and that the defendants hold as the assignees of Boyle Irwin. The title, it is admitted, was originally in one Thomas Hutch-ins, who on the 19th September, 1785, conveyed to George Wallace. On the 10th of April, 1811, George Wallace, by a contract in writing, agreed to sell and convey the eight acres hereinbefore mentioned to Boyle Irwin, in consideration of an annual ground rent reserved, of $165, payable annually forever. At the date of the conveyance by Hutchins, and of the agreement to convey upon ground rent, there were two persons known as George WaLlaee, father and son, whom for convenience of reference we may designate as George Wallace the elder and George Wallace the younger, respectively. George Wallace the elder, having previously made his last will and testament in writing, died, in the month of August, 1812. In his said will, which was afterwards duly proven, there is a clause as follows:</p>

    <p id="b182-4" data-blocks='[["BL_182.4",182,[257,751,1155,257]]]'>On the 14th November, 1812, George Wallace the younger, instituted a common law action of partition, in the Common Pleas of Allegheny County, against the remaining heirs and devisees of George Wallace the elder, deceased; in his precipe he described, inter alia, as part of the estate held in common by the heirs and devisees aforesaid, the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b182-5" data-blocks='[["BL_182.5",182,[259,1007,1152,128]]]'>“Also one piece of land on the township road in Pitt township, leased on perpetual lease to Boyle Irwin, containing eight acres.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b182-6" data-blocks='[["BL_182.6",182,[246,1135,1168,980]]]'>George Wallace the younger was the demandant or plaintiff in the proceedings; the partition was made and the purparts allotted to the parties as devisees under the will of George Wallace the elder, which was the common source of their title. George Wallace the younger could not, therefore, have been ignorant of the provisions of the will; he knew that his father claimed the beneficial ownership of the premises mentioned, and the right to charge him with the valuation thereof in the distribution of his estate, in the event of his acceptance of the title. When, therefore, George Wallace the younger, afterwards, formally, and'in writing, embraced the same premises in his precipe for partition, described it as a part of his father’s estate, caused it to be valued, and to be allotted to his brother Charles as such, without objection on his part, he certainly precluded himself from afterwards denying the title which he thus asserted. The judgment <em>quod qoartitio </em>fiat, the execution thereof under the writ <em>de partitione </em>facienda, and the award of the purparts, taken with the agreement of the heirs, and the final'decree that the partition made remain firm and stable forever, form a record of events, in the history of this title, which George Wallace or his heirs, even to assert the truth, would not now be permitted to gainsay.</p>

During all that period it was paid to him, or upon his order. Charles Wallace himself seemed to recognize the right of George to receive the rent, by presenting to Irwin from year to year, the order of George Wallace for the same. By the last will and testament of George Wallace, the younger, Jane Wallace, his widow, was entitled to all his personal estate, absolutely, and to “ the rents, issues, and profits, arising from every description of • real property ” during her life. After his death, his widow received these rents, regularly and uninterruptedly, from the year 1826 to 1864, a period of thirty-eight years, without objection and without claim, on the part of Charles Wallace, who all that time resided in the city of Pittsburgh, and continued there to reside, until his decease in the year 1877.</p>

But there is no evidence of any adverse claim on her part until the date of this deed, and then she asserts that she “is <em>now </em>invested with the right in fee simple.” It must be observed, too, that Jane Wallace entered into the enjoyment of the rents at the death of her husband; that the deed is executed by her, expressly “as the widow of George Wallace, deceased,” and its recitals are only as to his title. As by her husband’s will she was clearly entitled, and there is no evidence whatever of any other title in her, she will, we think, be presumed to have taken and to have held and received the rents as such devisee.</p>

The ground of the presumption, in such cases, is the difficulty of accounting for the possession and enjoyment, without presuming a grant or other lawful conveyance.
