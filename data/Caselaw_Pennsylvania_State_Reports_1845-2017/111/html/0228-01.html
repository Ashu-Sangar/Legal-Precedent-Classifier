But the mere fact that the bargain is a very hard or unreasonable one, is not generally sufficient, <em>per se, </em>to induce these courts to interfere, and indeed it will be found that there are very few cases, not infected with positive or actual fraud in which they do interfere except where the parties stand in some very peculiar predicament, and in some sort under the protection of the law from age, or character, or relationship.”</p>

The words “ subject to the conditions hereafter mentioned ” are express in their terms and constitute the legacy to the widow, an express charge upon the land of Henry Springer, and gives the Orphans’ Court exclusive jurisdiction.

The law presumes from the relation of mother and son that the latter had influence over the former. Express proof of influence need not be made-; it is implied from the relation: Whelan <em>v. </em>Whelan, 3 Cowen, 537, Story’s Eq., § 312. The facts were all fairly submitted to the court, and the findings of the court are as binding as if they had been found in the same waj^ by a jury : Gibson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/25/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="25 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="975800" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0193-01">25 Pa.

The appellant complains that the court erred in “making the decree against the respondent generally instead of <em>de terms” </em>We contend that the court made a proper decree in this case. The amount found to be due to the widow is under the circumstances of the case a personal liability as well as a lien on the land : Hoover <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 Barr, 355; Lobach’s case, <a href="/watts/6/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="6 Watts 167" data-case-ids="1846069" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0167-01">6 Watts, 167</a>. But if in the opinion of this court, the court below should have indicated the nature of the writ or limited the operation of the decree to the land, the decree is properly amendable in this court, and can be amended <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>or a new decree made by this court. This court can reform the decree of the court below and declare how it should be executed, as it did in the case of Hart <em>v. </em>Homiler Exr’s., <a href="/citations/?q=23%20Pa.%2043" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="23 Pa. 43">23 Pa.

The land itself is evidently the source whence that portion of the provision, made by testator for the benefit of his widow, was intended to come, and hence it is a charge thereon, notwithstanding appellant by accepting the devise may have made himself personally liable to perform the condition subject to which the land was devised. Compliance with that provision having been uujustly. refused, it was the duty of the court to ascertain the value of the grain and fruit that should have been contributed by appellant’s <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>farm, and by its decree enforce payment thereof.

The testimony on that subject discloses a case of gross misconduct on the part of appellant, in attempting to overreach his mother by taking advantage of her weak and helpless condition, such as no court of equity can sanction or encourage. The facts found by the learned judge were clearly warranted by the evidence and the conclusions drawn therefrom are correct..</p>
