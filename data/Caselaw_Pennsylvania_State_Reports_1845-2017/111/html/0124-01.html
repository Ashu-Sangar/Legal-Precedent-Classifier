Otto Hess, in August, 1875, was a bona fide and valid sale. The levy was upon the lease of two ice ponds, ice houses, etc., each with an outfit for marketing the ice, consisting of horses, harness, wagons, etc. At the sale, the lease of Chartiers creek, with-a horse and wagon and some twelve hundred to fifteen hundred tons of ice, were purchased by Felix X. Lang, who transferred his purchase to George C. Hess, a brother of the execution debtor. The similar establishment and outfit, at East Liberty, were purchased by Thomas McCoy, who, being in the fish and oyster business in the city of Pittsburgh, turned over his purchase to Catharine Hess; McCoy to have as much ice as he wanted in his business during the year. George C. and Catharine Hess then <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>carried on the business together until in the fall of the same year, when George C. also transferred his purchase to Catharine for the sum of $50.

    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[234,667,1175,809]]]'>The plaintiffs below contend, that as Catharine Hess has not shown that she had any separate estate, or means of her own, the transfer to her by McCoy was in legal effect a transfer to the husband, as respects his creditors. It is certainly true, that in Pennsylvania, a married woman cannot buy personal estate upon credit, unless she is the owner of a separate estate, .in which case she contracts upon the credit of such estate. If she purchases property with borrowed money or on credit, her husband’s creditors may seize aiid sell it as his : Pier <em>v. </em>Siegle, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20480" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 480">15 W.

So, also, property bought by a married woman upon her individual credit, and subsequently paid for solely with the profits of business in which she engages therewith, is to be regarded as the property of her husband, and subject to execution by his judgment creditors: Leinbach <em>v. </em>Templin, <a href="/pa/105/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="105 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="454253" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0522-01">105 Pa.

The transaction is not very fully developed in the testimony; a more detailed and particular statement of the facts may, perhaps, put that matter beyond doubt, but as the case is now presented the true nature of the transaction is certainly somewhat indistinct. If Thomas McCoy, after his purchase, chose to make a gift of the goods to Mrs. Hess, with a reservation of such part of the ice as he might require for use in his business during the year, he had a right to do so, and Mrs. Hess had an undoubted right to receive them as a giff, and to hold them as her own, not only as against her husband, but as against his creditors, subject only to the reservation.</p>

If there was no agreement upon the part of Mrs. Hess to pay McCoy any specific sum, or to deliver to him ice in any quantity or amount, definite or indefinite; if the ice' and outfit were a gift, and no personal obligation was assumed for the price, but McCoy simply reserved the right to take as much of the ice as he wanted from time to time during the year, in his business, and did take of it as he needed, the technical relation of debtor and creditor would not subsist between them. The reservation, if there was one, could not form the consideration of a contractor convert that which was intended as a gift or gratuity into a sale: Riegel <em>v. </em>Wooley, 1 Weekly Notes, 310 is somewhat analogo'us in principle. In that case, Bedford made a gift of the stock in a store to his married sister, Mrs. Wooley, requesting her, out of the proceeds, to pay off some of Bedford’s outstanding notes, which subsequently she did. This court said in that case' that the question was-properly submitted to the jury, and that the verdict settled the fact that Bedford made a gift and not a sale to his sister; that the provision that certain debts should be paid out of the proceeds of the goods, being found to be a mere condition attached to the gift, by which so much was devoted to the payment of these debts of the donor, did not make the gift of the remainder a sale, but that the transaction was simply a gift, subject to an appropriation of a certain portion to others.</p>

We think the cause should have been submitted to the jury, under proper instructions, to determine from the oral proofs the true nature of the transaction, according to the meaning and intention of the parties.
