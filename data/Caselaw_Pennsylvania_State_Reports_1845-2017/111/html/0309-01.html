The duties and powers thus placed on the Controller relate to only four officers designated by name, for the County Auditors were so restricted by the Act of 1834. This is the extent of the power conferred by the 18th section of the Act of 1861. With regard to the officers named in section 48 of the Act of 1834, the report required of the Controller by the Act of 1861, shall have the same effect as the report of the County Auditors.

    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[231,939,1180,1066]]]'>The contention is that the Act of 1861 places all county officers whose duties involve the receipt of moneys of the county within the provisions of the Act of 1834 relating to County Auditors. Extensive powers are vested in the Controller over the acts of all such officers, which powers are plainly set forth in the statute. But it is nowhere set forth that the report of the Controller shall have the same effect as the report of County Auditors as to all such officers. That the clerk has been made a salaried officer,'and the fees he receives belong to the county, is no reason for a forced construction of the statute so that his accounts may be finally adjusted by the Controller performing duties of County Auditors under the Act of 1834. If this could be done, in bounties where the statute relating to County Auditors continues in force, should the prothonotaries and clerks of the courts be paid by salary and the fee's become the property of the respective counties, the accounts of such prothonotaries and clerks could be legally settled by the county auditors without additional legislation.’ To this we cannot agree. The courts have no right to inject the words “ prothonotary and clerk of the court ” into the 48th section of the Act of 1834. If unnamed subjects can be embraced within a statute which names its subjects, by implication, the limit of implication would be the notions of the Judge as to what should have been named.</p>
