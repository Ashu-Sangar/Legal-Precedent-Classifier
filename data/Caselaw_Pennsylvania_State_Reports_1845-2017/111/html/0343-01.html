Young Rummell was employed by the defendants as “ dragger down ” in their spike mill: in that capacity it Avas his duty to drag heated pieces of billets of old iron rails out of a furnace and place them a few feet distant in a train of ten pairs rollers by which they were reduced to spikes. The rollers were so constructed that the head rollers Avere wider apart than the others as the billets passed along the train; the train was protected along its sides Avhere the cogwheels were exposed when in motion, with guard boards two feet high, extending from the second pair of rollers to the loAver end of the train, but the cogwheels of the two head pairs of rollers Avere left unprotected and the cogs were exposed when the “ draggers down ” were required to work. When a hot billet was started it would sometimes stick at the first rollers, and an appliance called a gate had to be opened to let it pass on ; this had to be done promptly, as otherwise the billet would cool and the rollers might be broken by it, and there was always another billet ready to start. The gate was betAveen the first and second <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>rollers, where there was no guard board, and the person opening the gate would step to one side of the rollers and open the gate by throwing off a ring from the top of the two iron rods extending perpendicularly above the rollers. This done the billet would pass into, the second pair of rollers. The gate had then to be at once closed. To do this it was necessary to stand beside the cogs in rapid motion and reach over, catch the gate rods with his hands, draw them together and replace the ring. This duty was dangerous on account of the revolving cogs being exposed and the liability of the “ draggers’ ” clothing to be caught therein; had the guard boards extended three feet further, so as to cover the cogs on the first two pairs of rollers, as they did the other, the danger of being caught would have been avoided. It appeared that the duty of opening and closing the gates was more especially that of the roller boss, but that the “ draggers ” were accustomed to perform it and regarded it as part of their duty. On the day before mentioned, about 4 o’clock in the morning, while the mill was dark and not provided with sufficient light to show clearly the movements of the machinery, Rummell, who was on duty, while opening the gate had his trousers caught by the cogs, was drawn in to the machinery and had his leg terribly crushed by the revolving cogs. It also appeared by the plaintiff’s evidence that Rummell’s immediate employment was by one Richards, the roller boss, who paid him his wages, and that he had been employed in the defendants mills about five days before the day of the accident.</p>

The plaintiff was, at the time of the injury complained of, an operative or laborer in that mill; he was employed by Wm. Richards, the roller boss, and was paid by him, but whether he was directly in the defendant’s employ, or indirectly as the assistant of Richards, he may be treated as their employee. He was engaged in the work of the defendants, upon their machinery, and the de<a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>fendants were themselves operating the mill. The right of the roller boss to employ assistants'is clearly shown, and as it does not appear that he was an independent contractor, it is unimportant that the amount of his compensation was’measured by the number of tons manufactured. The plaintiff was not a trespasser, he was in tire rightful discharge of the duties of a valid employment. The relation of master and servant is fairly inferable from the proofs, and the defendants are, therefore, bound to the performance of all the duties, and are entitled to the pi’otection which that relation affords.</p>
    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[214,842,1183,565]]]'>The plaintiff entered the defendant’s service on Tuesday, 6th March, 1881, and received the injury at four o’clock of the following Friday morning; he was seventeen years of age, and had no previous experience in the business in which he was employed. His duty was to drag heated billets of iron from the furnace, and to place them in a train of ten pairs of rollers, by means of which they were finally manufactured into spikes, he was designated or known in the mill as a “dragger down.” Two “ draggers down ” served each train of rollers and they were required to move with rapidity ; the heat and exertion were such that the “ turn ” did not exceed one hour, and when the turn was over, another pair supplied their places, and the work ■was continued by alternation.</p>
    <p id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[213,1406,1184,954]]]'>The rollers were kept in motion by a combination of cogwheels at the end, extending all along the sides of the train. When the billet was placed in the first pair, it would, in some instances, stick fast, and an appliance called a “gate ” must be opened to allow it to pass through; this gate was between the first and second pair of rollers. The person operating it was obliged to step quickly to the space between the ends of the first and second pair of rollers, where the cog-wheels were in rapid motion, and. with a pair of tongs provided for the purpose, throw a ring from the top of two iron rods, extending perpendicularly above the rolls. The billet passing into the second pair of rollers, the gate must be closed at once, in order to admit another, which owing to this unusual delay was in waiting. To close the gate it was necessary to reach over the cog-wheels, arid with both hands catch the gate rods, draw them together, and replace the ring. To avoid delay, and to prevent injury to the rollers, this movement must be executed quickly. The gate was in general opened by the roller boss or one of his assistants, but sometimes when they were absent, or otherwise engaged, it was opened by the “ draggers down,” one of whom, by the very nature of their employment, was always present.</p>

    <p id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.4",362,[253,629,1181,1555]]]'>At the time of the injury, George Rummell, Jr., the plaintiff, placed a heated billet in the first pair of rolls; it stuck fast; the roller boss was not there at the time; Rummell opened the gate, and whilst in the act of closing .it, was caught in the cogs and very seriously" injured. It is argued that the plain tiff, by the terms of his employment, was not charged with the opening and closing of the gate; that he was employed as a “ dragger down ” only; that his duty was discharged in the delivery of the billet into the rolls, and that he Was therefore a mere volunteer in the act from which his injury was received. It appears, however, that he was employ'ed by, and was under the orders and control of the roller boss, whose proper duty' it may have been in this emergency' to relieve the rollers; but Richards, from time to time, allowed the “ draggers down ” to perform this work, especially in his absence, as he was frequently absent in other parts of the mill. The “ draggers down ” appear to have assumed that this was part of their duty, and Richards certainly' did nothing to inform them otherwise; he seems to have stood by on repeated occasions whilst they' did it. The act was one demanding prompt and speedy action, and in the absence of the roller boss, and his general assistants, it fell into the hands of the “dragger down,” who was expected to act at the instant. The scope of his duties is to be defined by what he was employed to perform, and by what with the knowledge and approval of his employer he actually did perform, rather than by the mere verbal designation of his position. Besides, Anthony Myers testifies, that one of the ordinary duties pertaining to the position of “ dragger down ” was to open the gates whenever the billet stuck, and that they were employed in part for this purpose ; and this would appear to conform to the actual • practical management of this part of the mill, and to the apparent understanding of all concerned therein. The jury, under the evidence, would certainly have been warranted in finding that Rummell was not a mere volunteer in the performance of the act from which he received the injury.</p>

    <p id="b363-8" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[227,1882,1177,345]]]'>In the case at bar the plaintiff was employed as a “ dragger down,” and incidentally to that he was charged at times with the duty of opening and shutting the gate. The terms of his employment were general, he might have been assigned to this or any other train of rollers; there was nothing in the nature or terms of his engagement, by which he would be held to have assumed any special or extraordinary risk, he accepted simply such hazards as were reasonably incident to his employment.</p>
    <p id="b363-9" data-blocks='[["BL_363.7",363,[223,2228,1177,217]],["BL_364.1",364,[245,392,1178,734]]]'>There is evidence tending to show that the closing of the gate was attended with danger, that when reaching in, over the rapidly revolving wheels for that purpose, the operator was liable to be caught in the cogs. There is evidence also that this difficulty was easily obviated, by .the extension of the guard rail to cover <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>the point of danger, and that this appliance was reasonably necessary for the safety of the operator, but that in fact the rail was wanting where most required. On the other hand, it was shown that the gate had been open repeatedly and successfully by others without injury, whilst the guard rail ever since the mill was erected was the same as at the time of the accident. Now, an employer is not bound to furnish the safest machinery, nor to provide the best methods for its operation, in order to save himself from responsibility, resulting from its use; if the machinery be of an ordinary character, and such as can with reasonable care be used without danger, except such as is reasonably incident to the business, it is all that can be required: Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Sentmeyer, 11 Norris, 276; Payne <em>v. </em>Reese, 4 Out., 301. Here then, certainly, was a question for the determination of the jury. Was the appliance for opening and shutting this gate, such as we have stated the law requires, to be furnished by an employer, for the use of his employee ?</p>

It is certainly true that the cogwheels were open and fully exposed to view; this is precisely what is complained of; the closing of the gate required the operator to reach over these cog-wheels whilst in rapid motion ; this too was open and obvious; but the danger to be apprehended in closing the gate did not wholly depend upon these, facts which were patent. The safety of the operator depended largely upon the amount of exertion required to accomplish the act in each instance, under these circumstances of danger. A man may at arm’s length perform with reasonable safety an act which would become exceedingly perilous if the effort required were greatly increased. So, too, a strong and vigorous man might, and doubtless would, perform the work with much greater ease, and therefore with much greater safety, than a man of more moderate powers. One of the witnesses testifies that sometimes the gates are “hard to pull,” “you have to pull them together as tight as you can,” from which we may readily infer that sometimes they are harder to close than at other times. Actual experiment only, therefore, could fully disclose to the plaintiff the degree of peril he assumed. The cog-wheels’ in rapid motion were certainly open to the view of the plaintiff, but whether he was liable to be drawn into them depended upon matters with which • he was totally unacquainted, and which he could learn only by actual experiment. He was young and without experience, had only been <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>on duty for four da)m, and had opened the gate but two or three times previous to the injury. The plaintiff cannot be supposed or assumed to have accepted in advance a peril which he could not estimate, and the extent of which for lack of experience he could not have known. Where there is any doubt whether the employee was acquainted, or ought to have been acquainted,with the risk, the determination of the question is necessarily for the jury.</p>
    <p id="AjQ" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[217,746,1168,259]]]'>Assuming, therefore, that the defendants have not provided a reasonably safe appliance for the opening and closing of the gate, we are not prepared to say, as matter of law, under the presentation we have of this case, that the plaintiff cannot recover. The case was one for the jury, and we think the court erred in refusing to take off the nonsuit.</p>
