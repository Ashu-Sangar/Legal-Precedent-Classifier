J., instructed the jury that as against Ewing the plaintiff could recover whatever the jury found he could have obtained for the coal mined out of and the timber cut from his land, together with compensation for an}*- injury shown to have been done to the land by such mining; and reserved the question whether the plaintiffs were “ estopped by the decree in the suit for specific performance from maintaining an action at law for an injury to the property, which was the subject of the equity suit; committed during the pendency of the equity litigation.” The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff for #400.

It was argued that compensation might have been had at law on perfecting the decree for specific performance. The Master of the Rolls, however, was of opinion that if the matter had been before the court at the first hearing, the claim for compensation would have been put in a proper train of investigation; and that as equity once entertained jurisdiction in the case, it was not necessary to resort to the circuitous remedy offered by the law; that, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to relief upon a supplemental bill.</p>

S. 105, Phelps, upon a bill in equity, obtained against Prothero a decree for specific performance of an agreement. Phelps, then complaining that he had been greatly injured through a breach of the agreement after the filing of the bill, and during the pendency of the proceedings thereon, proceeded at law against Prothero for recovery of the alleged damage. The argument of the plaintiffs was that Phelps, having elected to submit his rights to the judgment of a Court of Equity, that court had' full competency, on a decree for specific performance, to award, beyond the immediate relief prayed for, compensation for the damages claimed, and that he was not at liberty to proceed at law for his alleged damages, but should be remitted to the Vice-Chancellor to have an assessment made, if any were in fact sustained. On the other hand, it was contended that Phelps had a clear right to a decree for specific performance in equity, also to recover damages for his loss at law; and that the damages of which he complained, occurring after the commencement of the suit in equity, was not brought in issue in that proceeding. The Lord Justices held that the court, having jurisdiction of the subject matter, the plaintiff at law could not proceed without the permission of the court; that he ought to have submitted his claim for damages to the Court of Equity, which was competent to ascertain them; and they therefore directed an inquiry as to such damages, and restrained the action at law. “It seems to be well settled that a Court of Equity having once had jurisdiction in a suit over the subject matter of it, will not, except by its permis<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>sion, allow resort to any other forum in respect of that subject matter, either when the proceedings are pending in the court or after decree, except in cases where the right to sue at law arises on instruments executed under the decree.

In Reynolds <em>v. </em>Nelson 6 Mad. 290, on the general principle stated, the court, after a decree of specific performance, restrained the prosecution of an action for damages in respect of the non-completion of the contract within the time specified; and in Frank v. Basnett 2 My. &amp; K. 618, the plaintiff, haying obtained a decree for specific performance, the case was referred to a master to settle a conveyance; pending the proceedings, the defendant brought an action for the non-erection of a bridge, which the plaintiff was to erect across a stream : the plaintiff filed a supplemental bill, and the action was restrained.</p>

It is certainly true, as stated in Tams <em>v. </em>Lewis 6 Wr. 410, that a former judgment is not conclusive of anything which was not directly decided by it, or was not material to the decision. Before such effect can be given to it in another suit, it should appear either from the record or <em>aliunde, </em>that it must have rested on the precise question, which it is sought again to agitate.

The contract covered the conveyance of the land as it existed at the time; and the suit, for the specific performance of it, was an action upon the contract in its entirety; if during the pendency of the proceedings, by the act of the defendant, the plaintiff could not have the full benefit of the contract, the latter was entitled to damages, as part and parcel of his claim under the bill.

The action at law, having been brought to recover damages to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of the land disposed of, it was held, that a judgment determines every matter which pertains to the cause of action or defence, or which is involved in the measure of relief to which the cause of action or defence entitles the party, even though such matter may not be set forth in the pleadings so as to admit proof, and call for an actual decision upon it; and that in an action for specific performance to convey real estate, any claim which the plaintiff may have to compensation, on account of defendant’s inability to perform his contract, pertains to the cause of action, and Avhetlier presented by the pleadings or not, is determined by the judgment.</p>
