In therefore carefully applying these legal principles to the case in hand, you need feel no anxiety lest you may be letting go some of the safeguards against crime, but rest content that you are conforming to'the law and sound reason. I had prepared what I shall hereafter read you, before defendant’s counsel had presented their prayer for instruction.

Malice is a legal term, implying much more. It comprehends not only a particular ill-will, but every case where there is a wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty, although a particular person may not be intended to be injured.

It is necessary that the circumstances should take away every evidence of cool depravity of heart or wanton cruelty. Therefore, to reduce an intentional blow, stroke or wounding, resulting in death, to voluntary manslaughter, there must be sufficient cause of provocation, and a state of rage or passion, without time to cool, placing the prisoner beyond the control of his reason, and suddenly impelling him to the deed. If any of these be wanting, if there be provocation without passion, or passion without a sufficient cause of provocation, or there be time to cool, and reason has resumed its sway, the killing will be murder. ..... Insulting or scandalous words are not sufficient cause of provocation ; nor are actual indignities to the person of a light and trivial kind.

Therefore, the burden of reducing the crime from murder to manslaughter, where it is proved that the prisoner committed the deed, lies on him. He must show all the circumstances of alleviation or excuse upon which he relies to reduce his offence from murder to a milder kind of homicide, unless, indeed, where the facts already in evidence show it. But though the homicide without the circumstances of alleviation or excuse, is presumed to be murder it is not presumed to be murder of the first degree; the presumption against him rises no higher than murder in the second degree, until it is shown by tbe Commonwealth to be murder in the first degree. It therefore lies on the Commonwealth to satisfy tbe jury of those facts and circumstances which indicate the deliberate intention to kill, and to prove depravity of heart and conscious purpose, which constitute, as before stated, the crime of murder in the first degree.

A jury must not raise a mere fanciful or ingenious doubt to escape the consequence of an unpleasant verdict. It must be an honest doubt, such a difficulty as fairly strikes a conscientious mind and clouds the judgment. If the mind be fairly satisfied of a fact, on the evidence, as much so as would induce a man of reasonable firmness and judgment to take the fact as true, and to act upon it in a matter of importance to himself, it would be sufficient to rest a verdict upon. I also quote on this point from the great Chief Justice Gibson. “Evidence is sufficient when it excludes disbelief: that is, actual and not technical disbelief, for he who is to pass upon the question, is not at liberty to disbelieve, as a juror, while he believes as a man, it is enough that his conscience is clear.” Or, as another Chief Justice has put it, “The evidence which produces belief in their minds in one capacity, would work the same result in the other.

As I recall it (you will ascertain the facts for yourselves in all questions), the testimony for the Commonwealth is uniform and corroborated by one witness of the defence; that Haymaker and those acting with him came to the neighborhood of the derrick without haste and without the brandishing of pick handles, that there was no, or that the witnesses saw no brandishing of pick handles by those on the board pile, and that no attack or appearance of attack was made by the latter. Of the witnesses for the Commonwealth there was a farmer, a mail boy, and three young men, and possibly others who seem to have had no connection with the claimants of the well. The only diverse' testimony that I remember was that of Mr. Mechling, and a young man, who both were at a distance, according to Mr. Mechling, of about one thousand feet. You will determine the facts.</p>

In a case for malicious prosecution when the advice of counsel is competent evidence to rebut the presumption of malice, who will deny that a third party may prove the advice?

      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>There is no merit whatever in the first assignment of error. .The modification of the defendant’s eighth point covered by the second assignment was entirely correct. The point limited .prisoner’s responsibility to a direct aiding or assisting in the killing. The answer merely modified this by extending the responsibility to aiding or abetting in the common purpose of all, providing the killing was in pursuance of, or an incidental probable consequence of such purpose. We see" no error in this. If there Avas a common purpose to kill and the prisoner Avas present aiding or abetting in that purpose, of course he Avas liable for the act of one of the party he was aiding in carrying out that purpose. Equally true is it that he Avould be so liable if the killing Avas a probable consequence of the common purpose. Thus it is said in 1 Whart. Cr. Law, § 220 (8th ed.) : “ It is not’ necessary that the crime should be part of the original design; it is enough if it be one of the incidental probable consequences of the execution of that design and should appear at the moment to one of the participants to be expedient for the common purpose. Thus where A. and B. go out for the purpose of robbing C., and A. in pursuance of the plan, and in execution of the robbery kills C., B. is guilty of murder.”</p>

The conclusion is absolute that there would be no responsibility of the defendant, a confederate, although the slayer intended his act. The only-premise given for the conclusion is that the defendant intended to hold possession by lawful means, and did not intend to use a deadly weapon upon any who might attempt to dispossess him. But the point includes as part of the intent the determination to hold possession by using as much force as was necessary, and the conclusion ignores the effect of an actual irse of arms by the Avhole party including the defendant in holding possession, and therefore omits a circumstance Avhich may be quite material to its validity.</p>

The last clause of the point is not technically sound, and justifies the remark of the Court. The fourth assignment is not pressed! As to the fifth, it may be said that it is put rather too strongly for an absolute affirmance, but the Court practically affirmed it by referring it to the jury as an expression of views more proper for them than <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>for the Court. The point related to the effect to be attached to loose declarations. This of course was for the jury to consider so far as the application of the doctrine was concerned, and it was turned over to them without denial or qualification. Properly it should have been somewhat qualified, but the omission to express the qualification is no ground for reversal when it gave the defendant the full equivalent of an affirmance. The sixth assignment is disposed of by the answer to the second. We see no error in the part of the charge covered by this assignment. Surely if the killing was an incidental and a probable consequence of the execution of the common purpose, and the defendant was pai'ticipating in the acts, which were being done in the execution of that purpose, he was responsible. Whether he was so participating was carefully left to the jury.</p>

There had been a preliminary hearing as to the facts-of the occurrence which resulted in the death of Hay-maker, and there had been a trial of one of - the persons implicated named Bowser. Some of the jurors had read the newspaper reports of the hearing, and some had read parts of the testimony as published in the newspapers, taken on the trial of Bowser. No one said he had read the whole of the testimony actually delivered on the Bowser trial. Even if a reading of the whole of the testimony in the Bowser case would have disqualified the juror, the evidence does not come up to that test, and therefore was not sufficient as a cause of challenge. But it is very evident that Bowser’s case and the defendant’s case are not the same. One might be guilty and the other innocent. The testimony in Bowser’s case might disclose little or nothing of the facts necessary to convict Weston, and therefore an opinion that Bowser was guilty upon the evidence given to implicate him, would not at all necessitate an opinion as to Weston’s guilt. As every one of the jurors denied the formation of any fixed opinion as to Weston’s guilt, there was nothing to disqualify any of them under our-decision in Allison’s case.
