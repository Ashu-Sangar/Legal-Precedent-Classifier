His will also contained a bequest of $5,000 to the said Arnold for his services as trustee for Mary A. Harper. By decree of distribution the bonds and stocks were awarded to Arnold as trustee for Mary A. Harper. Upon final distribution the fund was not sufficient to pay the legacies of Arnold and Mary A. Harper: <em>Held, (a) </em>That though said bequest of the stocks and bonds to Mary A. Harper created a dry technical trust yet so long as by a decree of a.court of competent jurisdiction the trust exists and the trustee has been awarded the securities, the Supreme Coiu't will not say that there is not a trust of some kind.

Morrow Arnold is founded upon a consideration, to-wit: His services as trustee for her; as, by accepting the trust, he has contracted to perform its duties for the compensation fixed by the testator. But the cases' in which the above rule prevails, appear to be where the consideration or the legacy inures to the benefit of the testator’s estate, as a legacy to a widow in lieu of dower. Here, however, the consideration for the legacy to Arnold does not enure to the benefit of the testator’s estate, but to Mrs. Harper as specific legatee, and if the contest were between him and general legatees not benefited by his legacy, it may be he would not be entitled to preference to them. But as it is between him and a legatee benefited by the consideration upon which his legacy is founded,-it seems that the rule applies, and that his legacy is to be preferred.</p>

But, as the legacy is not conditioned upon him living to execute it, and payment is not postponed until the termination of the trust, the presumption is that the contingency of the death of the trustee before its termination, and consequent inability to exeeute it, were considered by the testator when lie fixed the compensation. The amount of this legacy, then, is the compensation fixed by the testator'for the trustee’s services, notwithstanding these contingencies. And Mrs. Harper being a mere recipient of his bounty, and benefited by the legacy, is not in a position to object to it, and has no equities requiring it to abate. Moreover, if the services which may be rendered are worth more, the trustee could not secure additional compensation. It seems clear, therefore, that this legacy is entitled to preference in payment to Mrs. Harper’s;</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[283,648,1169,773]]]'>There can be no doubt that the intention of testator, however defectively expressed, was to create an active trust for Mrs. Harper. The direction to Mr. Arnold to collect and pay over the dividends, and the liberal provision made for compensation of his service, in this behalf, are inconsistent with any other theory. It was in furtherance of this manifest intention that the appropriation to Mr. Arnold as trustee in distribution on’the’audit of the former account was made. No question was then raised as to the validity of the trust, not to the decree. That decree cannot be collaterally attached; it is conclusive until set aside. It is, therefore immaterial in this proceeding which in respect of that proceeding is collateral: Rhoad’s Appeal, 39 Pa. Stat. 386, whether the trust was defective in its creation or not; the decree of appropriation made it a fact and conclusive here. When Mr. Arnold had accepted the trust he had complied with the condition precedent to his right to demand the legacy given him in that behalf: Harrison <em>v. </em>Rowley, 4 Ves. 232.</p>

A bequest on condition of taking <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>care of testatrix’s house and goods for three months after her death, as in Wilson’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20Leg.%20Int.%20109" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="39 Leg.

N. C., 275</a>, were based on valuable considerations arising after testatrix’s death, and no one can, with reason, doubt that they were properly held to be within the rule of exemption from abatement. The legacy to Mr. Arnold falls within the same class. It was made to him as a conditional offer of so much compensation for his services as trustee, and when he had accepted the appointment his remedy against the estate for the amount of the legacy was as complete as though he had made a similar contract with testator in his life time. It is true, as was suggested by counsel for exceptant, that his acceptance was purely voluntary, but that might with as much force have been said, had a similar contract been made with testator in his life time. The essential fact here is that the legacy was given in consideration of the services and responsibility of the trustee. Had no legacy been given him he would have, been entitled to compensation all the same as well as a preference in payment; the gift of the legacy had the same purpose in view: Guien’s Estate, 1 Ash, 317, and there is no apparent reason why the preference should not continue as against volunteers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[223,1393,1161,637]]]'>The exceptant’s counsel rely on a passage in 2 Williams on Executors, 1364, in support of their position, that in order to entitle a general legatee to exemption from abatement, the consideration upon which it is based must have been in existence at the date of the testator’s death. The case of Blower <em>v. </em>Morret, 2 Ves., 420, cited in the foot note for this qualification of the general rule, does not sustain it. The sole question involved there was’ whether a bequest to a wife in lieu of dower was liable <em>to </em>abatement, and there is not even a.discussion of the question suggested now. And the suggested qualification is entirely inconsistent with the letter and the reason of the rule. The sole test is whether the legacy is based on a valuable consideration, and it is obviously immaterial whether or not the consideration in fact sprang into existence before or after testator’s death.</p>

But there is an additional reason for preference. Mrs. Harper is the beneficiary of the trust fund of which Mi'. Arnold is trustee. Had no testamentary provision been made for compensation, the trust fund must have been liable; this legacy is in relief of the fund, and, therefore, for the -benefit of Mrs. Harper. If less than the full amount of the legacy should be realized, the trustee may have recourse against the trust fund for the deficiency : Guien’s Estate, <em>supra. </em>In answer to this, it is said that Mrs. Harper claims here as pecuniary legatee and not as beneficiary under the trust. There is no merit in this position. She claims under the same will in which the trust is created for her benefit. .

It will present itself on her death, or may perhaps be raised at any time and be determined by the court in proper proceedings for the purpose. There is no rule or principle of law preventing a testator from vesting property in a trustee for the life of his beneficiary,-with provision that it go to her legal representative at her death. The rule in Shelly’s case, and the Statute of Uses, 32 Henry VIII., 10, do not apply to personal property. So that the entire argument and authorities of the appellent-’s counsel as to bequest of the income carrying the corpus or absolute estate in fee, are entirely beside the mark. Among active trusts has always been classed that to receive and pay over the profits to another: Husband on Married Women’s Trusts, 289.

That the compensation of the trustee is, in any event, excessive and out of all proportion to the labor and responsibility involved.</p>
