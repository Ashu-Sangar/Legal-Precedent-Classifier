      <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>It was not claimed at the argument, by counsel on either side, that this language can be so construed as to make the devisees joint tenants of the real estate, with the peculiar incident of survivorship. And, indeed, no such estate, since the Act of 1812, can be created by deed or will, unless, possibly, by the most clear and express terms, as is shown by Thompson, J., in Seely <em>v. </em>Seely, 8 Wr. 434.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[242,712,1172,949]]]'>But it is contended by counsel for the acting executor that the effects of the words “to go to their heirs in equal amounts to all heirs living at the time of their deaths,” is to take the ease out of the rule in Shelley’s case, and to limit the estate devised to the petitioners to a life estate, with remainder over. This is claimed to be, in particular, the force and meaning of the words “ in equal amounts,” as denoting a mode of distribution not according to the intestate law; that is, a distribution <em>per capita </em>instead of <em>per stirpes. </em>It is to be observed, however, that the limitation over, if such it is, is to “their heirs; ” that is, to the heirs of the devisees, and not to those of the testatrix. It would follow, then, that there could be no distribution until after the death of the last survivor of the three nieces (for <em>nemo est haeres viventes'), </em>and that after the death of each of the two, first dying, her interest in the freehold would either be in abeyance, or else would pass to the heirs at law of the testatrix, to be held and enjojmd by them until the death of the last surviving niece. This construction is, therefore, as I think, clearly erroneous, since it not only violates cardinal rules of interpretation, but ignores the manifest intention of the testatrix to make a full and complete testamentary disposition of all her estate, real and personal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b42-7" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[232,1660,1174,775]]]'>The only other construction which suggests itself is that contended for by counsel for petitioners, to the effect that not only do the nieces take a fee simple by the terms of the first part of the devising clause, but that there is nothing in the subsequent portion of that clause which demonstrates any other intention on part of the testatrix. The most probable interpretation of the entire clause I take to be this, that the testatrix gives the residuum of her estate to her three nieces for life, with remainder to their heirs. But as she devises the estate to them “ share and share alike,” that is to say, equally, so she intends that the same equality shall be observed in the transmission to the heirs, and that, as each niece was to take an equal third her heirs were to inherit the same interest, without respect to their number as compared with those who might inherit from either of the other devisees, which is merely equivalent to directing that the heirs of the nieces respectively, should take <em>per </em>stirpes, or, in other words, according to the intestate law.</p>

Certainly nothing is better settled than that a testator, after devising an estate in fee simple, cannot strip it of one of its most essential and valuable incidents, by prohibiting its free alienation by sale, gift, or devise. Although such attempts to clog an absolute fee are frequently made by testators, they are never allowed to succeed.</p>

When used by a testator, the law presumes that he used them in their legal sense, that he intended not individuals, but quantity of estate, and descent.” “ But with us a‘gift to heirs, generally in fee, contemplates descent according to the intestate law:” Nice’s Appeal, 14 Wr. 149. “ Even in a will, supposed to be made when the testator is <em>inops consilii, </em>the word heirs has a fixed sense, which will adhere to it until it is explained away: ” Auman <em>v. </em>Auman, <em>supra; </em>2 Jarman on Wills, 61; Eby’s Appeal, 3 Norris 241; Yarnall’s Appeal, 20 P.
