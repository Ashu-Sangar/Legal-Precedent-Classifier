        "text": "Mr. Chief Justice Mercur\ndelivered the opinion of the Court, January 4th, 1886.\nThe alleged error in this judgment is determined by the construction to be given to the will of David Hopkins. The specific contention is whether Margaret Hopkins took an estate in fee, in the real estate of which he died seised.\nIn the second paragraph of his will he declares, \u201c I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Margaret Hopkins, her heirs and assigns forever, all my property, real, personal and mixed, of what nature or kind soever, and wheresoever the same shall be at the time of my death.\u201d\nIn the third paragraph he declares \u201c My wish is, that after the sale of my real estate by my wife, Margaret aforesaid, without charging my said real estate, that she will, if she has a sufficient sum of money to do so, to give to my daughter Mary\u2019s children as follows.\u201d Then to three named the sum of fifty dollars each, at any time she may deem most suitable for herself; and to one other named, fifty dollars, when he attains the age of twenty-one years.\nThe following and concluding paragraph reads: \u201cMy further request is that at the death of my wife Margaret aforesaid, that she will so divide what \u25a0 she may have among our daughters, Martha and Eliza\u2019s children, share and share alike.\u201d\nIt is unquestionably conceded that the second paragraph of the will standing alone would give a fee to Margaret. On behalf of the plaintiff in error, it is claimed that the estate thus given is changed by subsequent language in the will, so that in lieu of an absolute devise to her, the last paragraph created a trust in her for the benefit of the persons therein named.\nIt is undoubtedly true the intent of the testator, as gathered from the whole will, furnishes the cardinal rule of construction. When that intent is manifested with sufficient certainty and is not in conflict with established rules of law, it must govern: Middlesworth\u2019s Admr. v. Blackmore, 24 P. F. S., 414; Schott\u2019s Estate, 28 Id., 40; Reck\u2019s Appeal, Id., 432; Webb v. Hitchins, 9 Out., 91.\nIn this state the rule is' well settled that words in a will merely expressive of desire, recommendation, and confidence, are not sufficient to convert a devise or bequest into a trust: Pennock\u2019s Estate, 8 Harris, 268; Jauretche v. Proctor, 12 Wr., 466; Second Reformed Presbyterian Church v. Disbrow, 2 P. F. S., 219; Bowlby v. Thunder, 9 Out., 173.\nExpressions of a desire or a wish of the testator as to a specific disposition of his property, standing by themselves alone, may constitute a valid devise or bequest thereof. The rule is different when such expressions are used after an absolute disposition of the property has been made. After an unqualified devise by the testator of his property, no precatory words to his devisee can defeat the estate previously granted : Burt v. Herron, 16 P. F. S., 400; Bowlby v. Thunder, supra.\nThe language in the third paragraph of the will appears to assume that Margaret will sell the real estate, yet there is no direction that she shall do so, and the testator did not appoint any executor. Whether she had a \u201c sufficient sum of money \u201d to comply with his wish appears to have been left to her to decide. No question however now arises as to the gifts therein mentioned. It is merely referred to as aid in construing the last paragraph.\nIn the last the word \u201c request \u201d is used as synonymous with \u201c wish \u201d in the former. The language is \u201c my further \u201d request, thus continuing the use of a word merely precatory. The testator makes no reference to his property nor to the proceeds of property which he has devised to her. His wish or request is that she will divide \u201c what she may have \u201d at her death, among the persons named. This language is sufficiently broad to apply to all her property however acquired. Nothing less than her will duly executed could give effect to the request of David Hopkins. This was an act purely optional with her. We are clearly of the opinion that no subsequent language in the will converted into a trust the property which had previously been devised to her absolutely in fee.\nJudgment affirmed.",

After an unqualified devise by the testator of his property no precatory words to his devisee can defeat the estate previously granted.\nNovember 10th, 1885.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green, and Clark, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 2. of Allegheny 'county: Of October and November Term, 1885, No. 224.\nThis was an amicable action in debt on the following case stated for the judgment of the Court:\nIt is agreed that the following facts be agreed upon in the nature of a case stated for the judgment of the Court: said facts so agreed upon to have the same force and effect as if established by the verdict of a jury after trial, with leave to either party to sue out a writ of error to the judgment of this Court.\nCn the 27th day of June, A. D. 1885, the aforesaid plaintiffs and defendant entered into an agreement under seal, a copy of which is hereto attached and made part hereof, marked Exhibit \u201c A,\u201d whereby the plaintiffs agreed to sell and convey to the defendant all that lot of ground situated in the Sixth ward of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, having a front of 41 feet, 6 inches on the south side of Second avenue, and extending back toward the Monongahela river, preserving the same width, about 60 feet, upon which are erected a frame dwelling house, and also a two-storied brick dwelling house, in consideration of which the defendant covenanted to pay the plaintiffs the sum of $1,600 upon the delivery of a sufficient deed therefor on or before the first day of August, A. D. 1885.\nOn the first day of August, A. D. 1885, the plaintiffs tendered to the defendant a duly executed deed of convejaince of the-lot of ground aforesaid, and made demand of the purchase money, according to the terms of the agreement aforesaid; but the defendant refused to accept said deed and pay the purchase money, alleging that the plaintiffs have no title, which they can convey to the defendant, to the lot of ground aforesaid. The facts upon which the defendant bases his refusal to accept said deed are as follows, as agreed upon as aforesaid, viz.:\nDavid Hopkins, now deceased, was in his lifetime the owner of the lot of ground aforesaid, the same having been conveyed to him by William Hutchinson,-et ux., by their deed, dated December 20th, 1865, and recorded in the Recorder\u2019s Office of Allegheny County, Pa., in Deed Book, vol. 199, page 452.\nThe said David Hopkins died on the 21st day of January, A. D. 1870, leaving to survive him a widow, Margaret Hopkins, and inter alia, the said William W. Hopkins, the defendant, said Martha, now the wife of John Glunt, and said Elizabeth, now the wife of Richard Peters, the plaintiffs in this case; having first executed his last will and testament, a copy of which is hereto attached, and made part of this case stated, marked Exhibit \u201cB,\u201d dated the 16th day of November, A. D. 1869, duly probated and recorded in the Register\u2019s Office of Allegheny county, Pa., in Will Book, vol. 14, page 560. The portions of said will, which are material to this case, are as follows, viz.:\n\u201c I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Margaret Hopkins, her heirs and assigns forever, all my property, real, personal and mixed, of what nature or kind soever, and wheresoever the same shall be at the time of my death......\n\u201c My further request is that, at the death of my wife Margaret aforesaid, that she will so divide what she may have among our daughters, Martha and Eliza\u2019s children, share and share alike.\u201d\nThe said Margaret Hopkins accepted, under the provisions of said will, went into possession after the death of said David Hopkins, and continued in the possession of said lot of ground aforesaid during her life; and on the 26th day of June, A. D. 1876, said Margaret Hopkins died unmarried and intestate, and without having in any manner complied with or attempted to comply with the said request in the will of David Hopkins, deceased, aforesaid.\nThe said Martha Glunt and said Elizabeth Peters (called in said will Eliza), each have issue, several children, who were living at the death of said Margaret Hopkins, deceased, and are still living.\nIt is admitted that the deed tendered by plaintiffs to the defendant was otherwise good and sufficient, if, under the will of David Hopkins, deceased, and by reason of the death of said Margaret Hopkins intestate, as aforesaid, the title to the aforesaid lot of ground is vested in the plaintiffs.\nThis action is to recover the unpaid purchase money under the terms of the agreement aforesaid.\nIt is agreed that judgment shall be entered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant for the sum of $1,600, with interest from August 1st, 1885, if, upon the foregoing facts, the Court be of opinion that the title to the lot of ground aforesaid is in the plaintiffs; otherwise judgment is to be entered in favor of the defendant with costs.\nThe Court, White, A. L. J., entered judgment on the case stated in favor of the plaintiffs for $1,622.40, whereupon the defendant took this writ assigning for error the entering of the judgment in the case stated for the plaintiff.\nWilliam S. Pier for the plaintiff in error.\nThe single question is, Did Hopkins, by his will, raise a trust in favor of the children of two of his daughters or not.\nWhile we are to gather the testator\u2019s intent from the whole will, (Middlesworth v. Blackmore, 24 S., 418) we must ascertain it from the language he has used in it, and every sentence and word must be considered: Turbett v. Turbett et al., 8 Yeates, 187; Seibert v. More, 20 S., 147.\nEverjr word must be made effectual if it is consistent with the rest of the will. Schreiner\u2019s Appeal, 3 S., 106.\nPrecatory words, if clear and positive, are as effectual as words of command. Burt v. Herron, 16 S., 402.\nMontooth Bros., and J. M. Swearinger for defendants in error were not heard."
