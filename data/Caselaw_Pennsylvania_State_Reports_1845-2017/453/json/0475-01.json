        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Nix,\nAppellant, Francis P. Bobko, Jr., was fried jointly with two other codefendants and was found guilty of armed robbery. Following the denial of post-trial motions, appellant was sentenced to a term of not less than five years nor more than ten years imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence per curiam, with Judge Hqeeman filing a dissenting opinion in which Judge Spaulding and Judge Ceucone joined. Commonwealth v. Bobko, 221 Pa. Superior Ct. 100, 288 A. 2d 925 (1972). We granted allocatur and now we reverse.\nThe primary question presented in this appeal is whether a new trial should be granted because of the potential prejudice created by the distribution to the jury of a trial booklet which indicated that appellant and his codefendants were under indictment for charges unrelated to those being prosecuted in the present proceeding. Prior to trial, appellant \u201cmoved to challenge the panel of the jurors on the grounds that prejudicial matter to the defendant has been distributed to them. . . .\u201d This motion was brought after the jury was sworn, but before the taking of testimony. The trial court summarily denied the motion without explanation.\nWe believe that presenting the jury with information indicating that appellant was charged with other crimes is prejudicial error. Certainly, possession by the jury of a list of charges pending against the appellant might well have predisposed the jurors to believe the appellant guilty, thus denying him the presumption of innocence. The prejudice created requires that the conviction be set aside and that a new trial be granted.\nIn Commonwealth v. Trapp, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 384, 272 A. 2d 512 (1970), the Superior Court was confronted with an analogous situation and held that submitting to the jury trial booklets which included information that the accused was charged with other crimes was reversible error. See Commonwealth v. McDaniel, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 20, 268 A. 2d 237 (1970). The Superior Court reasoned in Trapp that the trial court \u201cmight well have prejudiced [appellant] by predisposing the jurors to believe the accused guilty, thus effectively stripping him of the presumption of innocence.\u201d 217 Pa. Superior Ct. at 387, 272 A. 2d at 513 (quoting from Commonwealth v. McDaniel, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. at 23, 268 A. 2d at 238). As the Superior Court pertinently observed: \u201cThe prejudice to the defendant was further aggravated by the fact that the booklets listed other burglaries charged against co-defendant. Jurors are very likely influenced by the maxims of guilt by association and 'birds of a feather flock together\u2019. Almost inevitably, appellant would be tarred with the same brush as the codefendant. The intrusion into tlie trial of other alleged crimes raised issues to which appellant could not realistically present a defense. Clearly, appellant\u2019s association with the other charges and with codefendant tended to show that he was guilty of other crimes and effectively stripped him of the presumption of innocence.\u201d 217 Pa. Superior Ct. at 387, 272 A. 2d at 514.\nThe trial court, in its opinion written following post-trial motions, indicated that it was aware of Commonwealth v. Trapp, supra, but felt that it could be distinguished from the instant case. In Trapp, the defendant, upon learning that the jury had the trial booklet, moved for a mistrial. Here, the appellant made a pretrial motion to challenge the jury panel. The trial judge, in his opinion, pointed out that appellant\u2019s challenge to the array did not conform to the provisions of Rule 1104(b) and (c) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. Pa. R. Grim. P. 1104 provides in pertinent part:\n\u201c(b) Unless opportunity did not exist prior thereto, a challenge to the array shall be made not later than five days before the first day of the week the ease is listed for trial of criminal cases for which the jurors have been summoned and not thereafter, and shall be in writing, specifying the acts constituting the ground for the challenge.\n\u201c(c) A challenge to the array may be made only on the ground that the jurors were not selected, drawn or summoned substantially in accordance with law.\u201d\nEven though appellant moved for a challenge to the array rather than for a mistrial, we are not persuaded that this is a distinction with any legal significance. In our view, the nature and purpose of ajjpellant\u2019s motion was clear and, therefore, the trial court should have addressed itself to the merits of the objection. As the dissenters in the Superior Court ably point out: \u201c[T]he fact that appellant sought relief by bringing a motion to challenge the jury panel instead of a motion for mistrial is not material. First, insofar as a motion for mistrial would have been timely, if made at the time that the challenge to the jury panel was made, there is no reason for the trial court to deny relief to the appellant on the basis that the challenge to the jury panel was not timely. Second, even if the motion to challenge the jury panel was improperly framed, the trial court still recognized the true thrust of appellant\u2019s pretrial objection and should have passed on the merits of such objection.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bobko, 221 Pa. Superior Ct. 100, 104-05, 288 A. 2d 925, 926-27 (1972) (dissenting opinion).\nAs further justification for its refusal to grant appellant\u2019s motion, the trial court indicated that appellant \u201coverlook[ed] the use of voir dire to determine actual prejudice\u201d -which resulted from the distribution of the trial booklets to the jurors. However, this suggested use of voir dire to determine whether the jury-had been prejudiced against the appellant does not take into account the fact that the jury had already been sworn when the appellant discovered that the booklets had been distributed and thus the opportunity for voir dire had passed. See Pa. E. Crim. P. 1106, 1107 and 1100.\nLastly it cannot be claimed that this error was harmless. The courts of this Commonwealth have been acutely aware of the prejudicial effect of the introduction of other offenses and have limited its use to those situations where the State\u2019s interest in the probative value far exceeded the prejudice to the defendant. See generally, Commonwealth v. Bighum, 452 Pa. 554, 307 A. 2d 255 (1973); Commonwealth v. Allen, 448 Pa. 177, 181 n.2, 292 A. 2d 373 (1972); Commonwealth v. McIntyre, 417 Pa. 415, 208 A. 2d 257 (1965); Commonwealth v. Bell, 417 Pa. 291, 208 A. 2d 465 (1965) ;Commonwealth v. Wable, 382 Pa. 80, 114 A. 2d 334 (1955); see also, II Wigmore \u00a7300-373 (3d Ed.). Here where no purpose was served by supplying this information to the jurors we see no justification for the prejudice that resulted to the defendant. Jurors are selected for a specific period of time and are required to serve in any cause during that period for which they are chosen.\nThe order of the Superior Court, affirming the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Le-high County, is reversed and a new trial granted.\nThe practice of distributing trial booklets, which are official publications prepared on behalf of the county, has been discontinued in Lehigh County.",
