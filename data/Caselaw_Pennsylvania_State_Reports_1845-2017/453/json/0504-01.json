Pursuant to a degree of guilt hearing on February 20, 1969, appellant was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This direct appeal followed. We now affirm.\nAppellant argues that: he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, Ms guilty plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily, he was deprived of due process of law at the degree of guilt hearing, and he was not \u201cproperly and fairly\u201d advised of Ms right to appeal.\nHaving thoroughly reviewed all aspects of the trial record and the proceedings on record we conclude that appellant was not denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel, Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A. 2d 349 (1967). The record also conclusively establishes that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was entered both knowingly and voluntarily, Commonwealth v. Butler, 446 Pa. 374, 288 A. 2d 800 (1972). We have considered appellant\u2019s other allegations of error and find them to be equally without merit or substance.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
