Tingle, 451 Pa. 241, 301 A. 2d 701 (1973), Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A. 2d 417 (1972).\nAs for the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation that our decision in Futeh, supra, should not apply to any arrest made prior to the date of that opinion, we find this contention to be without merit. Our decision in Futeh merely interpreted Rule 118 of Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, which became effective May 1, 1970. The principles announced in Futeh were the law in this Commonwealth after the effective date of Rule 118.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Eagen dissent.\nMr. Justice Nix took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCompare the predecessor to Rule 118, Rule 116(a), which became effective January 1, 1965.",
