        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nJohn Joseph Grzyminski and Richard Larry Griffey were convicted by a jury in a joint trial in Bucks County of conspiracy and attempted burglary. Post trial motions were denied and a prison sentence of one to five years was imposed on Griffey on the attempted burglary conviction. Sentence was suspended on the conspiracy conviction. Griffey filed an appeal in the Superior Court which unanimously affirmed \u201cthe judgment\u201d without opinion. We granted allocatur and now reverse.\nFrom the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at trial, the jury was warranted in finding the following facts:\nOn January 25, 1968, after consuming a quantity of alcoholic beverages, James Tirendi and the appellant, Griffey, decided to \u201cpull a heist\u201d and under threats of physical violence from Tirendi, Ernest Boerner accompanied them and drove them in his automobile. The three proceeded to pick up John Grzyminski at his residence, after which the group stopped at a gas station where Tirendi stole a sledge hammer. Following this, the group drove around for awhile and about midnight Tirendi directed Doemer to stop in front of the Lincoln Musical Bar in Trevose, Bucks County, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going for a drink and case the joint and then we\u2019re coming out again.\u201d\nWhile in the establishment, Tirendi questioned the bartender about a T.Y. set located behind the counter and after the bartender left their presence, Tirendi remarked to Grzyminski, \u201cI\u2019m coming back for that T.Y. later tonight. \u201d \u201cOne of the boys\u201d also said in the presence of the four \u201cthat cash register looks like its pretty hard to break into\u201d to which Tirendi replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, I\u2019ll smash it on the floor, if I have to.\u201d\nAfter leaving the Lincoln Musical Bar the four visited another bar in Bristol where they stayed until \u201cclosing time\u201d. Shortly after 2:30 a.m. on January 26th, the four drove back to the Lincoln Musical Bar. The automobile pulled in a driveway and stopped behind some cabins on the rear of the property. Tirendi and Griffey then alighted from the vehicle and proceeded in the direction of the building in which the bar was located. The two returned to the automobile several times and on one such occasion said, \u201csome people were in there . . . and they would wait for awhile. ...\u201d Later on the lights in the bar went out and Tirendi and Griffey again exited from the automobile and proceeded towards the rear of the building. Shortly thereafter, the two ran back and Tirendi excitedly told Doemer to start the car. The manager of the bar called the state police and the four were apprehended shortly thereafter. Scratches were found on the metal plate of the lock in the door on the rear of the building.\nTestifying in his own defense, Griffey disputed important portions of the Commonwealth\u2019s testimony. He stated, inter alia, that when the automobile returned to the Lincoln Musical Bar at 2:30 a.m. on January 26th, he had no prior knowledge of Tirendi\u2019s plan to commit a burglary; that after the automobile pulled onto the bar property, Tirendi then informed him he was \u201cgoing to get the T.V.\u201d and Griffey told him \u201cit was a crazy thing and let\u2019s go home\u201d; that he and Grzyxninski continued to try to dissuade Tirendi \u201cfrom going in there\u201d and urged him \u201cto go home\u201d, bxit Tirendi refused to listen; that before Tirendi left the automobile the last time, Griffey saw \u201cthe barman at the window\u201d and the only reason he accompanied Tirendi to the rear of the bxxilding was to \u201cshow him there\u2019s somebody in the place\u201d and convince him he shoxild go home; that when Tirendi again refused to listen and started xip the stairs at the rear of the bxxilding, Griffey turned and started back to the automobile alone; that he then heard a scream and Tirendi came running back to the axitomobile. Griffey\u2019s testimony was corroborated iti materia] part by Grzyminski.\nThe trial court refxised a specific request to instruct the jury on the law concerning the effect of a co-conspirator\u2019s withdrawal from a conspiracy before the xxxxla-wful agreement is carried out, stating Griffey\u2019s testimony merely manifested \u201ca shift of mind while the thing was going on\u201d. We conclxide, under the circumstances, this was error and of such proportion as to require a new trial.\nAs stated before, Griffey was convicted of both conspiracy and attempted burglary and, needless to point out, these crimes are separate and distinct. Where two or more enter into an agreement or plan to perpetrate a burglary, the crime of conspiracy is complete. However, a conspirator may escape criminal responsibility for the burglary itself if he withdraws from the conspiracy before the burglary is committed or attempted and provided his withdrawal is communicated to his co-conspirators in sufficient time to allow them to withdraw. Cf. Commonwealth v. Doris, 287 Pa. 547, 135 A. 313 (1926). In other words, in order for the withdrawal to be effective, it must occur before the commission of the burglary becomes so imminent that its avoidance is out of the question. Commonwealth v. Doris, supra.\nThe credibility of Griffey\u2019s testimony was for the jury. The jury had the alternatives of believing it completely, believing a portion thereof, or rejecting it in toto. Commonwealth v. Hornberger, 441 Pa. 57, 270 A. 2d 195 (1970). If the jury believed Griffey when he testified he attempted to dissuade Tirendi before the latter proceeded towards the building to burglarize it, and that Griffey did nothing thereafter to encourage or aid in the commission of the crime, this would constitute a withdrawal from the burglary, and a communication of Griffey\u2019s withdrawal to Tirendi in sufficient time to permit Tirendi\u2019s withdrawal also before he proceeded to commit the crime. The issue should have been given to the jury with proper instructions.\nThe order of the Superior Court and the judgment of the trial court imposed on the burglary conviction are reversed, and a new trial is ordered on this charge.",
