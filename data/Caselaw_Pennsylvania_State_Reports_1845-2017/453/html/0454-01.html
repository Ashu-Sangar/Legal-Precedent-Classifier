A hearing was held on the complaint and the chancellor issued a decree nisi, denying appellant relief. Exceptions to the adjudication were argued before the court en banc which denied the same in an adjudication filed November 25, 1969. From the final decree thus entered, this appeal followed.</p>

The name “Drag Fair” has been used by appellant in its business operations since the year 1951. Moreover, appellant has used the “Drag Fair” in advertising for approximately fifteen years in newspapers, trade magazines, radio, television and spends in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per year on advertising. Further, the lower court found that appellant did not own or operate any stores in Pennsylvania<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and in fact, appellant’s only advertising in the Commonwealth was in the classified section of various news media for employment of pharmacists.

The lower court found that at the time of incorporation, appellee’s principals were aware of other businesses trading under the name “Drug Fair” but were not aware of the nature or extent of that use and did not specifically know of appellant’s chain. The court further found that appellant, through its attorney, first notified appellees of its interest in the name “Drug Fair” approximately six weeks after appellee was incorporated but delayed bringing suit until five months after the opening of appellee’s first store, a delay which was prejudicial to the appellee.</p>

The uncontradicted evidence adduced at trial shows that at the time of appellee’s incorporation appellant made no sales in Pennsylvania, operated no stores in Pennsylvania and did no retail advertising in Pennsylvania.

Here, <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>there is no evidence to establish that the “Drug Fair” name had a secondary meaning in Pennsylvania.

For example, in <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Lakeland Grocery, Corp., supra, </em>the court found, in addition to a showing that the name “Food Fair” had a secondary meaning, that “the defendant deliberately and knowingly appropriated the plaintiff’s name for its own business and actually imitated the character and style of the signs by which the plaintiff’s business was made known to the public.” <a href="/f2d/301/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="301 F.2d 156" data-case-ids="244470" data-case-paths="/f2d/301/0156-01">301 F. 2d at 163</a>. With respect to this practice of intentionally capitalizing on another’s goodwill, the court stated: “The existence or non-existence of good faith on the part of the second user of the trade name is a powerful factor in determining whether the name is entitled to protection in an area to which the business it identifies has not actually extended. Indeed, it is pointed out in Nims on Unfair Competition and Trademarks, Section 218b, page 649, that to some extent the emphasis of the inquiry has been shifted in determining whether a trademark or trade name is entitled to extra-territorial protection, so that in some cases much more stress is placed upon the question of good faith and much less on the extent to which the name is known in a given area.” <a href="/f2d/301/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="301 F.2d 156" data-case-ids="244470" data-case-paths="/f2d/301/0156-01">301 F. 2d at 162-63</a>. Similarly, in <em>Golden Slipper Square Club v. Golden Slipper Restaurant &amp; Catering, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/371/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="371 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1237107" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0092-01">371 Pa. 92</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20734" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="88 A.2d 734">88 A. 2d 734</a> (1952), this Court enjoined the use of the name “Golden Slipper” by a non<a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>competing business upon a finding that the name was adopted with the specific intention of trading upon plaintiff’s reputation.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[205,481,1155,264]]]'>In the instant case, however, the record is devoid of any evidence which tends to show that appellee, in appropriating the name “Drug Pair”, intended to trade upon appellant’s reputation. There has been absolutely no showing of bad faith on the part of the appellee.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[206,754,1157,970]]]'>Notwithstanding appellee’s good faith and the failure to establish a secondary meaning, appellant alleges that it has a right to relief because appellee’s incorporation under the name of Drug Pair, Inc. and registration of the fictitious name “Drug Pair” creates an unfair and unreasonable limitation on appellant’s plans to expand in Pennsylvania. Apparently, appellant believes that it is entitled to enjoin the use of the name “Drug Pair” in market areas where it is not doing business if a possibility exists that its business may eventually expand into such markets. As the court below pointed out, this novel contention is simply not the law. We have found no authority, and appellant has not suggested any, which would permit the owner of a trade name to enjoin its use in an area where it has acquired no secondary meaning solely on the theory that the effectiveness of future expansion efforts might be impaired.</p>

This assertion is untenable. As we have repeatedly emphasized throughout this opinion, appellant has failed to establish that the name “Drug Fair” has a secondary meaning in any part of Pennsylvania. Certainly, it is neither rational nor logical to enjoin the use of the name in an area where appellant is not actually doing business and where the name “Drug Fair” is not even known to the consuming public.</p>
