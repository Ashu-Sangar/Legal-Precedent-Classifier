In response to defense counsel’s request for an offer of proof, a side-bar conference was held. The district attorney informed the court that Bartlett had earlier given a confession to the police implicating appellant, and that the Commonwealth hoped he would repeat the substance of this statement in the jury’s presence. Bartlett’s attorney was in court and informed the trial judge at side-bar that several hours earlier his client had expressed his intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The district attorney admitted that “there is a strong possibility, probability, that if Mr. Bartlett did take the stand he would take the Fifth Amendment.

The Supreme Court has recently given its imprimatur to warrantless scraping under a suspect’s fingernails “to preserve the highly evanescent evidence” thought to be there. <em>Cupp v. Murphy, </em><a href="/us/412/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="412 U.S. 291" data-case-ids="6172131" data-case-paths="/us/412/0291-01">412 U.S. 291</a>, 296, <a href="/us/412/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="412 U.S. 291" data-case-ids="6172131" data-case-paths="/us/412/0291-01">93 S.

Whereas the percentage of alcoholic content in the bloodstream begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops and a person can easily scrub his hands to destroy incriminating evidence, the blood type of an individual never changes.

The suppression testimony of the Coroner fails to bear out this position: “Q. Now what happened when Herman Davenport came into the room? A. I said we wanted to take a blood test of him. Q. Did he say anything? A. He did not. Q. What did he do, if anything? A. He sat there until we got the syringes and tubes ready, and the corpsman, or whoever the man is that works in the dispensary, asked him to put out his arm and took the blood sample. Q.

This burden cannot be discharged by showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.” We recognize that in <em>Bumper </em>the police misrepresented to the defendant’s mother that they had a valid warrant to search her home and that no such tactic of deception was employed by the police here. The distinction, however, is irrelevant. It is obvious that appellant’s holding out his arm, without being told either the authority for the doctor’s actions or the purpose for which the blood sample was being taken, constituted mere acquiescence, and not a knowing and intelligent waiver of defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Johnson v.

The Supreme Court later amplified the “plain view” doctrine as follows: “The doctrine serves to supplement the prior justification—whether it be a warrant for another object, hot pursuit, search incident to lawful arrest, or some other legitimate reason for being present unconnected with a search directed against the accused—and permits the warrantless seizure. . . .

Interpreting a legislative grant of immunity for witnesses compelled to testify before federal grand juries investigating alleged violations of the federal narcotics laws, the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Reina v. United States, </em><a href="/us/364/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="364 U.S. 507" data-case-ids="6172368" data-case-paths="/us/364/0507-01">364 U.S. 507</a>, <a href="/us/364/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="364 U.S. 507" data-case-ids="6172368" data-case-paths="/us/364/0507-01">5 L. Ed. 2d 249</a> (1960), dismissed appellant’s contention that the privilege existed so long as part of his sentence remained to be served. It was held that immunity statutes need only safeguard against future <em>prosecutions </em>in order to comport with the Fifth Amendment. Wigmore had earlier taken the same position. 8 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>(3d ed. 1940), §2279. Various state courts have gone beyond this constitutional minimum and have viewed the privilege as not so easily lost. In addition to the waiver-by-conviction position, it has been held that (1) conviction must have been <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>followed by sentencing; (2) the full sentence must have been served; or (3) sentence must have been imposed and the time for direct appellate review expired. See generally, 9 ALK 3d 990 (1966), and cases cited therein. It is clear that the Commonwealth could have successfully forced Bartlett to testify only by application of the conviction rule. Pennsylvania courts have heretofore not taken any position on this question, and in light of our holding, we need not do so today.

Although admitting that probable cause existed and that the results of the second test would be identical to those of «the first, defense counsel nevertheless opposed this application as prejudicial, since it was made after the motion to suppress and so close to trial. The court deferred its ruling on this application pending resolution of the motion to suppress. As the initial search was ultimately upheld, the warrant never was considered. Whether or not the warrant is valid is, of course, not a question on this appeal.</p>
