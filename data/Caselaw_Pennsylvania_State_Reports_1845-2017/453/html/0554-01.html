In January of 1958 the appellee Borough of Akron filed an application with the Commission in which it sought a certificate of public convenience authorizing it to furnish water service to the public within a designated portion of West Earl Township, Lancaster County, an area adjacent to but outside of the corporate limits of Akron. The Commis<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>slon granted that certificate. On May 4, 1367, one Mahlon Zimmerman, the owner of a tract of land adjacent to the Akron-served area in West Earl Township, filed a complaint with the Commission in which he charged, in sum, that the Borough of Akron had unlawfully refused to extend water service to his land. The Borough filed with the Commission a preliminary objection, questioning the power of the Commission to order an extension of service beyond that area served under the certificate of authority issued in 1958. The Commission denied the motion and entered an order setting August 30, 1987, as a hearing date.</p>

This latter object was achieved at common law by issuance of the extraordinary prerogative <em>writ of prohibition </em>from the high courts of Westminster (King’s Bench, Exchequer, and Common Pleas). This Court, which by statute possesses all the powers of the Court of King’s Bench,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> has carefully delineated the difference between the <em>power </em>to grant the writ and the <em>propriety </em>of granting the writ.

The writ of prohibition is one which, like all other prerogative writs, is to be used only with great caution and forbearance and as an extraordinary remedy in cases of extreme necessity, to secure order and regularity in judicial proceedings if none of the ordinary remedies provided by law is applicable or adequate to afford relief. It is a writ which is not of absolute right but rests largely in the sound discretion of the court. It will never be granted where there is a complete and effective remedy by appeal, certiorari, writ of error, injunction, or otherwise.” Applying that standard in <em>Garpentertown, </em>we refused to interfere with a proceeding before the State Mining Commission in which a disputed jurisdiction was asserted over the Turnpike Commission, observing that the statutory provision of an appeal from final orders of the Commission, an appeal in which jurisdictional as well as other errors <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>might be corrected, made it unnecessary to invoke the extraordinary remedy of prohibition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> It is true, however, that prohibition can be utilized to prevent the assertion by an inferior tribunal of a <em>clearly </em>erroneous claim of jurisdiction.

        <em> </em>The difference between the question earlier presented by the Commission’s appeal (jurisdiction, or power to entertain the action) and that presented today is well expressed in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Mandebino, then a Judge of the Commonwealth Court: “Akron, of course, had every right to file a complaint before this court as an equity court <em>aslcing </em>for an injunction. As pointed out by the majority opinion, this court has subject matter jurisdiction over such a complaint under the Public Utility Uaw. . . . While that section does give this court subject matter jurisdiction, it does <em>not </em>say anything about changing the time-honored rules for granting an injunction. It does not give this court statutory authority to grant injunctions without the normal prerequisites which a court of equity demands before stopping a legal proceeding already in progress.” (Emphasis in original.) <a href="/pa-commw/2/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="2 Pa.
