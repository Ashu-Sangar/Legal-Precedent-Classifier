On September 20, 1971, Mr. Alfred Cory, Executive Secretary of the <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>Association, wrote a letter to Mr. James Moock, an International Longshoremen’s Association International Vice President, offering to extend the existing collective bargaining agreements with the various Longshoremen’s unions until the end of the Presidential Wage and Price Freeze, November 12, 1971.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[193,679,1155,481]]]'>On September 21, 1971, Mr. Moock wrote a letter to Mr. Cory stating that the various ILA Locals in Philadelphia intended to continue working after October 1, 1971, based on extensions of the existing collective bargaining agreements.

The release was disseminated to various newspapers and other publications.</p>
    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.7",104,[191,1607,1155,590]]]'>In issuing the injunction, the chancellor relied on the fact that the Local Unions knew of the press release and chose to remain silent, thus luring users of the port to believe that a contract had been reached. The chancellor concluded on the basis of his findings, that as a matter of law, the Local Unions were estopped to deny the existence of the agreement stated in the press release and the press release would be treated as if the locals had signed a contract to extend the original contract between the Association and appellants beyond September 30, 1971.</p>

Since contracts between these unions and the Association cannot become valid unless and until the contracts are ratified by the membership, see <em>Warrior Constructors v. International U. of Op.

We also note that the release approved by Mr. Moock was issued by the director of the Association. The Association cannot claim it was misled into relying upon a press release which its director had issued. The Association also argues that the users of the port, in reliance on the press release, were lured into thinking that a contract had been reached. However, it is the users of the port who make up the Association. In determining the existence of a contract in the field of labor law, the normal rules of contract law apply. <em>F. W.

The petition and the rule to show cause were served upon officers of the local unions and another hearing was held on the evening of November 9, 1971. At the conclusion of this hearing, the chancellor found as a fact that the officers of the locals were taken by surprise with regard to these pickets and that they had made a good faith effort to correct the situation. Accordingly, he did not hold their officers in contempt and did not <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>invoke any of the fines he had imposed in his decree of October 25. However, he found that the members of the longshoremen locals, although they knew the meaning of his original decree and had been specifically advised that it required them to cross the picket lines, nevertheless refused to cross the picket lines. The chancellor then issued a decree providing for conditional fines on both appellants and their members, should they thereafter continue to refuse to cross picket lines. The local unions on behalf of their members appealed at No. 176.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[177,910,1157,966]]]'>On November 12, 1971, the Association moved for assessment of fines for civil contempt alleging that members of the International Longshoremen’s Association Local No. 1271 had continued to engage in work stoppages of November 10 and November 11, in violation of the injunction. After a hearing the chancellor found that, in fact, there had been work stoppages in violation of his previous decree. Since his November 8 decree established a formula by which there would be an assessment of $5,000 for each pier not worked for a whole day, the court used that formula to determine the amounts of the fines even though there was no evidence that the same seafarers unions were doing the picketing on November 10 and November 11 that had been picketing previously. By the formula, the court reached a total figure of $70,000, which was assessed against the union. The union has appealed the fine at No. 178.</p>
