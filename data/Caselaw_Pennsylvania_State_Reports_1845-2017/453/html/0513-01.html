The Commission responded by petitioning this Court for a writ of prohibition against the judge below and the entire Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.

At the direction of this Court the Commonwealth Court proceeded with a hearing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and on December 12, 1972, entered an order directing the production of the requested documents subject to certain restrictions as to their use by the Commission. Alleging the denial of an opportunity to participate in the action before the Commonwealth Court, the present appellants petitioned this Court for relief. On February 5, 1973, this Court remanded the cause to the Commonwealth Court with the direction that they: (a) determine whether the appellants were real parties in interest and had standing; and (b) if it was decided that appellants possessed standing, to allow them a hearing <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>upon the merits of the controversy.

This is so because, unlike a judicial subpoena, tbe Crime Commission<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> is not given power to enforce compliance.

Therefore, the premature initiation of equitable proceedings by the appellants is in effect a nullity and it is incapable of divesting the Commission of its legal right to elect to proceed to seek enforcement in the forum of its choice as provided under the statutes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Accordingly, we believe that jurisdiction was properly assumed by the Commonwealth Court.</p>

They argue in support of this finding that the records sought to be obtained under the challenged subpoena consist of the personal and confidential records of them as individuals and members of a class who have a substantial and particular interest in the subject matter of the action. Further, they stress that the Police Commissioner is merely the custodian of these records and that in any action seeking disclosure of the information contained therein they are the real parties in interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Illustrative of their peculiar interest in avoiding the indiscriminate disclosure of the information contained in the requested documents, the appellants cite that the exposure of their pictures, names, addresses, and badge numbers could lead to reprisals by persons whom they had arrested during the course of their employment. They also note that the requested information would contain a record of infractions that they may have committed and for which they <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>have already received appropriate disciplinary action. Release of this information at this time, it is argued, would serve only to cause unnecessary embarrassment and in the case of the former employees, create unnecessary problems with reference to their present employment. The appellants also contend that the release of these requested documents would amount to a breach of a number of their constitutional rights and that only through intervention would they be able to assert these rights.</p>
    <p id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[149,875,1151,482]]]'>We note that an enforcement proceeding before the Commonwealth Court is an original action, <em>Pennsylvania, Crime Commission Petitions, </em><a href="/pa/446/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="446 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="1941728" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0152-01">446 Pa. 152</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20494" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="285 A.2d 494">285 A. 2d 494</a> (1971), and under Rule 117 of the Commonwealth Court, the Rules of Civil Procedure apply in original actions. Thus, whether or not appellants should have been permitted to intervene in this subpoena enforcement proceeding depended upon whether they qualified ás intervenors under Pa. R. C. P. 2327, which provides:</p>
    <p id="Ae45" data-blocks='[["BL_575.6",575,[149,1367,1149,152]]]'>“At any time during the pendency of an action, a person not a party thereto shall be permitted to intervene therein, subject to these rules if</p>

      <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>Clearly, appellants are unable to qualify under subsections (1) through (3). No judgment is entered in a subpoena enforcement action. The court will merely enforce an interim procedural order, imposing no civil or criminal liability upon the individuals seeking to intervene. Also, since there is no “property” now in the custody of the court, none of the appellants will be “adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court. . . .” Nor could the appellants have joined as an original party in the action to enforce the subpoena, or have been joined therein, since they do not have actual custody of the documents being subpoenaed. The documents involved are physically possessed by the Philadelphia Police Department.</p>

Appellants contend that the outcome of the subpoena enforcement action “may affect [a] . . . legally enforceable interest . . .” which they have in the proceedings. The Commission, argues to the contrary that the appellants lack standing to intervene in the judicial enforcement of the Commission’s subpoena because they have made no showing at all of any “legally enforceable interest” in the requested documents.</p>

The result is a flexible although uncertain rule whose application in a given case calls for the careful exercise of discretion and a consideration of all the circumstances involved.” 3 Goodrich-Amram, Standard Pennsylvania Practice §2327-7 (footnote <em>omitted); see Pennsylvania </em>

In effect, appellants’ desire to intervene is grounded upon the fact that production of the requested documents will facilitate an investigation having a general purpose to which they object. In our view, an individual’s general interest in avoiding investigation does not, standing alone, afford him standing to object to the enforcement of a subpoena issued to a third party. Such a general interest is not of sufficient magnitude to allow intervention.</p>

There is nothing in the record to indicate that such will be the case or that past Commission hearings have had any harmful effects upon witnesses appearing before the Commission.
