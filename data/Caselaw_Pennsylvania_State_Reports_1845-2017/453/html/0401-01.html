It is generally a main bronchus tumor. </em>Q. Excuse me doctor, just to clear my own thinking here. You’re talking about cancer in general? A. In general not related to asbestos, in general.

Utter. Both taken on the same day but one taken in the posteri- or anterior projection and the other taken in the lateral projection. The films have two significant abnormalities. <em>The first abnormality is the appearance of a mask lesion rather nodular in outline located peripherally in the right upper lobe </em>and well seen also on the lateral projection. <em>Its peripheral nature is beautifully demonstrated by clear lung between the hilar structures, the central bronchi in other words, and the lesion itself. </em>This is similarly demonstrated on the lateral projection where again the main bronchi area seemed to be several inches away from this peripheral neoplasm, lesion.” (Emphasis added) The carcinoma in Cecil Bambrick’s lungs, according to Dr. Selikoff, was also peripherally located. Dr. Selikoff offered the following testimony with respect to the records of Mr. Bambrick’s hospitalization: <em>“I was interested to read in Dr. Fite’s report lohen he talks about interpretation of his historical findings. He talks about the fact that it’s an epidermoid carcinoma which is another way of saying aquamus carcinoma, but he was struck by its peripheral location, he says the peripheral location in the lung parenchyma is somewhat atypical for a primary carcinoma of the lung however, </em>on the assumption that no other epidermoid <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>carcinoma has been identified in other parts of the body the primary palmonary nature of this lesion may be assumed. <em>In other words what Dr. Fite is saying is that there is am, awfully unusual place for a lung cancer. </em>Could it have been coming from somewhere else, this is very unusual for an ordinary lung cancer and it is. <em>Most of the, usual lung cancers are central in location, the asbestos lung cancers are usually peripheral </em>.in location although they may assume different forms that location is significant.” (Emphasis added)</p>

The Superior Court affirmed the decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Board denying the claim, and in language bearing upon the decision here, expressed its view about the quality of evidence necessary to sustain a claim under Section 108 (n) : “The burden of proof under [§108(n) '| is a heavy one. [The claimant] must prove that the disease, in this case, lung cancer, is a hazard of his employment and that he was exposed to it; that cancer is a disease which is peculiar to the industry or occupation; and that it is not common to the general public. ...

The underpinnings of the <em>Scott </em>decision, and the position urged upon us by the appellees here, is that the legislature intended Section 108 (n) to apply only to the discovery of new diseases having their genesis in the claimants’ occupations. This interpretation severely limits the usefulness of Section 108(n) as a vehicle for compensation in situations like this one where the decedent’s fatal diseases, though not enumerated elsewhere in the act, are nonetheless generated by an occupational hazard. A more reasoned analysis of Section 108 (n), and one which we adopt in this setting, is that cancer can be an occupational disease, though it exists in the general public, if it may be shown by competent evidence that a claimant’s cancer is peculiar to the claimant’s occupation by its causes and the characteristics of its manifestation. Our review of this record indicates that appellants have shown by competent medical evidence that the decedents’ fatalities were caused by “occupational diseases” as that term is defined by Section 108 (n) of the Occupational Diseases Act.</p>

These findings of fact by the compensation authorities are correct and should govern the disposition of these cases. See <em>Bambrick v. Asten-Hill Mfg. Co., </em><a href="/pa-commw/5/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="5 Pa. Commw. 664" data-case-ids="1849315" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/5/0664-01">5 Pa.

    <p id="b467-3" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[172,760,1149,795]]]'>I therefore agree with only that portion of the majority’s mandate which reverses the Commonwealth Court’s order and reinst ates the Board’s award. In doing so, I do not accept the majority’s construction of sections 108(1) and 301 (e) of The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 566, §§108(1), 301(e), as amended, 77 P.S. §§1208(1), 1401 (e) 1952). The majority’s disposition of the dependency benefit claims of Margaret Utter and Alice Barn-brick can rest solely upon its interpretation of Section 1208(n), The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, as amended, Act of February 28, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1095, §1, 77 P.S. §1208 (n) (Supp. 1973). By construing sections 108 (1) and 301 (e), the majority decides an issue it need not reach.</p>

I would reinstate the Workmen’s Compensation Board’s award of compensation benefits for disability suffered by decedent, Robert Utter, during his lifetime.</p>
