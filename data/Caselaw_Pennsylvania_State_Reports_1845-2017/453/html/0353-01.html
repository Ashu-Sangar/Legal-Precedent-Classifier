      <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>The facts as found by Judge McDevitt in his adjudication are not disputed. They may be summarized as follows: From the time of its incorporation in 1934 until the mid-nineteen sixties, the Association had been purely private in character, deriving its fundsi from membership dues and contributions from individuals and charitable organizations such as the Community Chest and the United Fund. Until the revolution in the field, of constitutional law relating to criminal procedure which began in the early part of the last decade, the Association could function adequately with the moneys so received. Commencing with the historic decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em><a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">372 U.S. 335</a>, <a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">9 L.

Initially the Association was successful in obtaining significant financial assistance through grants from the Ford Foundation, the National Defender Project of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the United States Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) and voluntary contributions of the City of Philadelphia. Thus, by 1967, the combined budget for Association operations, including representation of juveniles, had risen to $600,000; of this amount $152,000 came from the City.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.6",413,[165,1043,1148,937]],["BL_414.1",414,[183,323,1152,436]]]'>In 1968 the still increasing need for legal defense services and the termination of contributions previously received for limited time periods from the Ford Foundation, OEO and the National Defender Project combined to create a financial crisis for the Association. An effort to obtain additional funds from the City was unsuccessful, and the Association was compelled to plan for a reduction of services. Contemporaneously, in November of 1968, a bill was introduced in City Council proposing the creation of a wholly new public defender program unrelated to that of the Association, the chief administrative officer of which would be appointed by the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia. The bill met immediate opposition from the Association and from many other groups in the community who were satisfied that throughout its existence the Association had provided indigent citizens <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>with, independent legal defense services of the highest quality. There followed meetings between representatives of the Association and the City to search for a compromise approach which would enable the Association to continue to provide all of the constitutionally required legal defense services in Philadelphia. These negotiations resulted in a contract between the Association and the City, entered into on January 28, 1969.</p>

This in turn, it is said, will adversely affect the independence of Association attorneys and thus create an unconstitutional conflict of interest. It therefore follows, so appellants argue, that the amendments are neither “lawful, beneficial or non-injurious to the community” as required by statute. The conflict of interest is found in the fact that the Mayor appoints both the Commissioner of Police and the City Solicitor, <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>a prosecuting official,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> whose interests as law enforcement officers are presumed to be antithetical to those of criminal defendants.

This argument assumes, of course, that the City group and the Association group each will select one-half of the community directors and that each group will automatically accept the nominations of the other. It also assumes that those community directors will themselves be the creatures of the group which nominated them. All this is sheer speculation. We have no reason to believe that the Association directors, at least one of whose votes is necessary for majority action, would be unaware of the obvious harm that would result from the injection of improper influence into the operation of the Association and would accept nominees for community director seats on the Board if there were any indication that such nominee would act merely as a rubber stamp for the Mayor. We think it much more likely that both the Association directors and the City directors would make and approve nominations of persons whose character, background and experience suggest qualification for the task of board membership independent of any political predilections.</p>
