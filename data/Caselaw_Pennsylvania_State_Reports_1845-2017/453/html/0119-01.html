On February 26th, the trial court withdrew a juror and ordered a mistrial. The retrial was listed on numerous subsequent dates, but continued. It eventually commenced on November <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>29, 1966, and concluded on December 9th. The jury found Wideman guilty of conspiracy and one of the armed robbery charges. He was found not guilty on the other charges. A motion for a new trial was denied and a prison sentence of two and one-half to five years was imposed on the robbery conviction, to begin upon the completion of a prior sentence Wideman was then serving. Sentence was suspended on the conspiracy conviction. On appeal the Superior Court unanimously affirmed without opinion. <a href="/pa-super/212/0733-03" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="212 Pa.

On the third day of trial, it became apparent the trial would require many additional days to complete and would extend beyond the last day the <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>visiting judge had been assigned to preside in Philadelphia. The judge called a conference of all counsel in chambers, informed them of this difficulty and also said he had previous personal commitments which would interfere with his continuing to preside for the period the trial would require. Counsel for one of Wideman’s co-defendants then made a motion for a continuance, asserting he had court commitments in another judicial district which required his presence and would interfere with his continuing as counsel in the trial then under way. -Counsel for all of the defendants, including Wideman, apparently agreed to the continuance, although the record fails to show any affirmative consent on the part of Wideman’s counsel. A mistrial was then declared without anyone voicing an objection.</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[193,1202,1156,919]]]'>Double jeopardy attaches if a mistrial is declared without “manifest necessity” or without the defendant’s request or consent. <em>United States v.

It goes without saying that a trial judge’s convenience does not constitute “manifest necessity” in the constitutional sense. The instant record leaves no other conclusion but that the initial trial was aborted for this reason. Accepting that Wideman’s counsel consented to the mistrial, under the circumstances, this was not a true consent or the type of consent the law contemplates to prevent double jeopardy from attaching. What could Wideman’s counsel do but agree to a mistrial in view of the trial judge’s dilemma? The claim of double jeopardy is, therefore, sustained.</p>

An issue is waived if “tbe petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raise it . . .” and “tbe petitioner is unable to prove tbe existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify Ms failure to raise the issue.” Section 4 of tbe Act of 1966, supra, 19 P.S. §1180-4(b) (1) &amp; (2).
