Stewart are special counsel conducting a special judicial investigation by order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Franck and Stewart are responsible for the formulation of charges of unethical conduct where the investigation reveals the need therefor, and for the prosecution of the formal charges.

Pursuant to that investigation, Eugene Frohlich, a client of X-l, was subpoenaed to appear before the court. X-l advised Frohlich that he, Frohlich, should be represented by an attorney at this court appearance and X-l offered to pay an attorney to provide Frohlich with such representation. Accordingly, Frohlich appeared represented by attorney I. Raymond Kremer, who admits he is being paid by X-l. Judge Shoyer, on motion of special counsel Stewart, disqualified Kremer as attorney for Frohlich because of the conflict of interest arising from the fact that Kremer was being paid by X-l and not Frohlich. Kremer and Frohlich petitioned us for a writ of mandamus and/or a writ of prohibition, to compel the court to permit Kremer to represent Frohlich and petitioned for a stay of all proceedings until we reached a decision.</p>

Stewart and Franck contend that since Frohlich’s interests are not affected by the investigation, if X-l, the attorney under investigation, can pay Kremer to advise Frohlich, he might be able to silence the only source of information to which the investigation can turn. Consequently, they argue, citing <em>Jedwabny v. Phila. Tr.

Two attorneys, respondents Michael Franck, Esquire, and William P. Stewart, Esquire, have been appointed special counsel to aid in the conduct of that investigation. Witnesses to be examined in that proceeding are brought by subpoena before a judge of the court and are questioned in an <em>ex parte </em>manner by the special counsel. These witnesses, some of whom are former clients of the attorneys under investigation, often bring with them counsel to render advice during the examination. In the matter now before us, attorney X-l is under investigation. Petitioner Frohlich had been represented by X-l when Frohlich was plaintiff in an automobile accident case, and was contacted by the special counsel. Immediately after an interview with an investigator, Frohlich telephoned his former attorney X-l and informed him of the interview and of the fact that he, Frohlich, had been subpoenaed and was to appear before Judge Shoyer on November 3, 1972. Attorney X-l advised Frohlich that he should have a lawyer when he appeared before the judge and that to that end should telephone I. Raymond Kremer, Esquire, at such-and-such a number the next morning. Frohlich did so, and was told by Mr. Kremer’s secretary that Mr. Kremer had been expecting his call and that she would call back and give him an appointment. <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>Frohlich later that day again called attorney X-l and asked him why the services of a lawyer were necessary. X-l assured him that counsel would be advantageous, and that he, X-l, would pay the fee of Mr. Kremer. Kremer’s secretary called Frohlich back and requested him to be in the attorney’s office at 9:30 a.m., November 3rd, the day of the hearing. The two met in Mr. Kremer’s office and later proceeded to the examination before Judge Shoyer, at which time Kremer was disqualified by order of the court from further representation of Frohlich in the investigatory proceeding. Mr. Kremer told the court at the hearing that he had prior to that day been paid $350 by attorney X-l as a fee for his representation of Frohlich.</p>

The canon with which we are today concerned is Canon 5: “A lawyer should exercise independent professional judgment on behalf of a client.” The Canons, as the American Bar Association states, are statements of “axiomatic norms”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> The <em>ethical considerations, </em>on the other hand, are said to be “aspirational in character and represent the objectives toward which every member of the profession should strive.” There are two ethical considerations which are relevant here and which serve to interpret Canon 5. Ethical Consideration 5-22 reads in part that “if a lawyer is compensated from a source other than his client, he <em>may </em>feel a sense of responsibility to someone other than his client.” (My <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>emphasis.) Ethical Consideration 5-23 cautions that “[a] person . . . that pays or furnishes lawyers to represent others possesses a potential power to exert strong pressures against the independent judgment of those lawyers.” Lastly, the <em>disciplinary rules </em>are said by the A.B.A. to be “mandatory in character. The Disciplinary Rules state <em>the minimum level of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to disciplinary action” </em>(My emphasis.)</p>

The initial choice of Kremer as the laAvyer for Frohlich was not Frohlich’s, but that of X-l, and X-l’s undertaking to pay for the services was coupled with the engagement of Kremer as the lawyer. It should be noted that DR 5-107(a), supra, does not deal with the question of <em>selection </em>of <em>counsel; </em>it deals only Avith pay<a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>ment. The fact that Frohlich went along with this selection surely does not prevent a court from questioning its propriety and rule against it under all the circumstances. I know of no constitutional right of a lawyer under investigation for possible misconduct to invest his client, a witness in the investigation, with another lawyer of his own choosing and whom he pays. In short, while the conduct here is not a ground for disbarment under the precise language of DR 5-107 (A), I must say that it does not strike me as conforming to “the highest ethical standards of our bar”, as Mr. Justice Nix describes it.

    <p id="b95-10" data-blocks='[["BL_95.11",95,[161,1496,1150,644]]]'>At issue in this proceeding is whether petitioner Krerner, a member of the bar of this Court, should be allowed to represent petitioner Frohlich, a client of attorney X-l. This question arose during the course of a special judicial investigation when Mr. Frohlich was subpoenaed to testify with respect to a certain personal injury case in which X-l had served as his counsel. When Mr. Frohlich appeared before the court with Mr. Krerner as his attorney, Mr. Krerner was disqualified by order of the Court on the ground that there was a conflict of interest due to the fact that Mr. Krerner was being paid by X-l and not Mr. Frohlich.</p>

In their answer to the petition the respondents specifically admit: “No one has suggested that Petitioner Frohlich may not be <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>represented by counsel of <em>Ms </em>choice. The Order below seeks to prohibit Petitioner Frohlich from being represented by counsel of X[-l]’s choice.” (Emphasis in original.)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> Indeed, any attack on petitioner Frohlich’s right to retain counsel would be ineffectual. The sanctity of the right to retain counsel in both civil and criminal cases was recognized in <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/287/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="287 U.S. 45" data-case-ids="369864" data-case-paths="/us/287/0045-01">287 U.S. 45</a> (1932),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> where the Supreme Court explicitly stated that: “If in any case, civil or criminal, a state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” <a href="/us/287/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="287 U.S. 45" data-case-ids="369864" data-case-paths="/us/287/0045-01">287 U.S. at 69</a>. Similarly, this Court has recently observed in an analogous situation that “[t]he right to counsel of one’s own choosing is particularly significant because an individual facing criminal sanctions should have great confidence in his attorney.” <em>Moore v.

    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[163,448,1150,755]]]'>I recognize that an individual’s right to counsel of his choice is not absolute, particularly in light of the state’s interest in establishing standards to control the practice of law in its courts. In the instant case, we have as conflicting interests the right of Mr. Frohlich to retain Mr. Kremer as his attorney and the right of the state to discipline lawyers to prevent unethical and unprofessional conduct. In balancing these conflicting interests, I must conclude that the state’s interest in assuring that the administration of its legal system is properly controlled is not a sufficiently compelling interest to justify the degree of infringement (i.e., disqualification of his attorney) imposed upon Mr. Frohlich’s right to counsel.</p>
    <p id="b97-6" data-blocks='[["BL_97.6",97,[163,1216,1150,427]]]'>Here, it is alleged that petitioner Kremer should be disqualified because of the arrangement whereby X-l referred Mr. Frohlich to Mr. Kremer and undertook to pay Mr. Kremer’s fee. It is averred that this situation necessarily gives rise to a conflict of interest in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility. However, it is my belief that petitioner Kremer has adhered to the highest ethical standards of our bar.</p>
    <p id="b97-7" data-blocks='[["BL_97.7",97,[164,1656,1148,153]]]'>Disciplinary Rule 5-107 of the American Bar Association’s Code of Professional Responsibility, the standard applicable to the instant case, provides as follows:</p>

It is not disputed that Mr. Kremer made a full and voluntary disclosure to Mr. Frohlich of the method of referral and of the payment arrangement. Moreover, Mr. Frohlich was also fully cognizant of the possible conflicts that could arise between he and N-l when he chose Mr. Kremer to represent him. Subsequent to his retaining Mr. Kremer, Mr. Frohlich has stated that he has complete faith in the ability and ethics of Mr. Kremer and that he is fully satisfied with the legal services rendered and the advice offered by his present attorney.</p>
    <p id="b98-5" data-blocks='[["BL_98.5",98,[177,1151,1159,1028]],["BL_99.1",99,[167,324,1150,485]]]'>The record before us fails to sustain any suggestion that Mr. Frohlich received inadequate or inefficient representation from Mr. Kremer or that the method by which he was retained has in any way influenced his handling of this case. Notwithstanding the absence of actual misconduct and Mi*. Kremer’s complete and voluntary explanation of the entire arrangement to Mr. Frohlich, the respondents maintain that the court below was acting within its discretion in disqualifying Mr. Kremer because “even the appearance of impropriety” cannot be tolerated. However, in my view, a subtle appearance of impropriety is not a sufficiently compelling reason to disqualify an attorney from representing a client who is fully aware of all possible conflicts of interest. As pertinently stated in the Ethical Considerations applicable to Canon 9:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a> “In order to avoid misunderstandings and hence to maintain confidence, a lawyer should fully and promptly inform his client of material developments in the matters being handled <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>for the client. While a lawyer should guard against otherwise proper conduct that has a tendency to diminish public confidence in the legal system or in the legal profession, <em>Ms duty to clients or to the public should never be subordinate merely because the full discharge of his obligation may be misunderstood or may tend to subject him or the legal profession to criticism </em>(Emphasis added.)

    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[161,819,1154,756]]]'>In my estimation, public confidence in our legal system will only be eroded where there is no attempt to disclose potentially conflicting interests. Here, Mr. Kremer by virtue of his voluntary disclosures has upheld the integrity of his profession and, in fact, has exercised proper judgment in competently safeguarding the interests of his client, Mr. Frohlich, to whom he owes a solemn duty. Having found no conduct that would warrant a conclusion that the arrangements between counsel and client in fact have improperly influenced counsel’s handling of the case, I believe the disqualification of counsel was completely arbitrary and constitutes an unreasonable and intolerable burden on the constitutional right to counsel of one’s choice.</p>
