    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.10",347,[170,699,1148,1109]]]'>Gerasimos and Mary Lykiardopoulos were married on June 15, 1950. While they were married they purchased two parcels of x-eal estate in the City of Pittsburgh, wMch they held as tenants by the entireties. The parties separated in January of 1967. It appears from the pleadings that Mary (hereafter referred to as the appellant) retained beneficial enjoyment of both properties from the date of the separation until the present. The appellant used one parcel as a combination dwelling and coffee shop, and the other as a rental property from which she received all the income. It also appears that the appellant has been responsible for all the expenses necessary to preserve the properties since 1967. On July 1, 1969, the parties were divorced and on December 7,1970, Gerasimos (hereafter referred to as the appellee) filed a complaint in equity seeMng an accounting for the profits derived from the use of the properties by the appellant and the partition and sale of the properties, in accord with the provisions of the Act of May 10, 1927, as amended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>The appellant filed an answer to the complaint and a counterclaim in which she sought to have the following items credited to her and set off against any interest of the appellee in the properties: (1) child support payments from the date the appellee deserted the appellant and two minor children until February, 1971, when the appellee began paying child support under a court order; (2) support for herself from the date of the separation until the date of the divorce; (3) all money she had invested in the properties as part of the initial purchase price; (4) all money spent to preserve the properties including mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities and upkeep. According to the appellant, the value of the combined items claimed in the counterclaim exceeds the value of appellee’s one-half interest in the properties. Therefore, the appellant requested the court to order the appellee to convey his record interest in the properties to the appellant, in lieu of paying her the money she claimed was owed to her. The counterclaim was not endorsed with a notice to plead and no answer was filed thereto.</p>

In disposing of the appellant’s counterclaim, the court held that the claims for support were personal obligations of the appellee not connected with the real estate and therefore not proper matters for consideration in the partition proceedings. The court appointed a trustee to sell the properties and account for the proceeds and denied without prejudice the appellant’s counterclaim for support. The appellant filed exceptions to the decree, which were argued <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>before tbe court below and denied. This appeal is from the denial of the exceptions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[187,439,1149,1164]]]'>The appellant’s first contention is that the appellee has no standing to seek partition of this property because it was his desertion of the appellant that led to the divorce. The appellant argues that the doctrine of clean hands should prevent the appellee from prevailing in a court of equity. There is no merit in the appellant’s argument. The action in partition following divorce is specifically authorized by statute. The Act of May 10, 1927, as amended, 68 P.S. 501 <em>et seq. </em>provides a complete procedure to be followed when parties who have been divorced partition property formerly held as tenants by the entireties. There is nothing in the statute to indicate that recourse to the provisions of the statute is limited to the non-eulpable party to the divorce proceedings. Indeed, the language of the statute is to the contrary: “Whenever any husband and wife . . . shall be divorced . . . either of them may bring suit. . . against the other to have the property sold and the proceeds divided between them.” Act of May 10, 1927, P. L. 884, as amended, 68 P.S. 501.

Section 3 of the Act of May 10, 1927, as amended, provides: “The proceeds of any sale had under the provisions of this act. . . <em>shall be </em>

(emphasis added)</p>
    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[180,702,1157,1163]]]'>Tbe statutory language is clear—only liens of record may be deducted from tbe proceeds of tbe partition sale. At common law, property which was held in tenancy by tbe entireties during marriage remained entire-ties property even after a divorce. <em>O’Malley v. O’Malley, </em><a href="/pa/272/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="272 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1068408" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0528-01">272 Pa. 528</a>, 532, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20A.%20500" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="116 A. 500">116 A. 500</a> (1922). Tbe Act of May 10, 1927, as amended, which converts a tenancy by tbe entireties into a tenancy in common after a divorce and permits either party to partition tbe property, is in derogation of tbe common law and must be strictly construed. <em>Lazare v. Lazare, </em><a href="/pa/365/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="365 Pa. 591" data-case-ids="1225598" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0591-01">365 Pa. 591</a>, 594, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20190" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="76 A.2d 190">76 A. 2d 190</a> (1950). While tbe Act provides for tbe satisfaction of all recorded liens, there is no provision in tbe Act which will permit tbe appellant to charge her unliquidated and unrecorded support claims against tbe appellee’s share of tbe proceeds. The statute provides for tbe payment of recorded liens out of tbe proceeds of the partition sale and they are tbe only charges permissible. <em>See, e.g., Leavy v. Leavy, </em>16 D. &amp; C. 2d 698 (Lycoming C. P. Ct. 1958); <em>Wilson v. Wilson, </em>4 D. &amp; C. 2d 152,153 (Pbila. C. P. Ct. 1955).</p>

Tbe appellant seeks a credit for one-half of all money spent in preservation of tbe property since tbe separation. This claim must also be denied. In <em>Hunsberger v.
