We have reconsidered the question, and now rule it was improper for the district attorney and the trial judge to advise the jury it could draw an adverse inference from the defendant’s failure to call his wife as a witness, thus, we overrule <em>Weber. </em>In so doing, we recognize there is a split of authority on this <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>question,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> and a body of law which reaches a contrary conclusion to that reached herein; however, we view the rationale adopted today as the approach most consistent with the statutory law.</p>
    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[191,560,1149,940]]]'>Our reason for so holding finds its genesis in the aforementioned statute.

The statute by its very terms stops either spouse from adversely affecting a criminal case against the other; although it does allow a spouse to testify on behalf of the other. If the inference is allowed to operate, the very fact the spouse is not called adversely affects the other spouse. Thus, the protection which the legislature vested in the defendant-spouse would be completely eroded by the evidentiary inference. To hold otherwise, would be to give the spouse protection with one hand, and, at the same time take that protection away with the other.</p>

The homicide occurred in the living room of the home of the defendant-appellant, J. B. Moore. There were two Commonwealth witnesses. The first, a Robert Pritchett, testified that he accompanied his girl friend, Ernestine Hitt, to the Moore home where Miss Kitt had a hairdressing appointment with Mrs. J. B. Moore. He said that upon their arrival, Mrs. Moore began to arrange Miss Kitt’s hair, working next to the stove in the kitchen, and that he, Pritchett, seated himself at the kitchen table just inside the doorway leading from the living room. A short time thereafter, Pritchett continued, a Benjamin Jones, the deceased, knocked at the front door, was admitted by Mrs. Moore, followed her back to the kitchen, greeted those present (“how is everyone doing?”), returned to the living room and took a seat. Pritchett then related that J. B. Moore, the defendant, apparently intoxicated, then entered the front door of his house, advanced towards Jones, raised a pistol, and shot Jones in the chest from a distance of one to two feet. Moore then walked toward Pritchett and mumbled, “What are you doing here?” As Moore walked on past Pritchett, Pritchett noticed that Moore’s left hand was bleeding. <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>Pritchett, seizing the opportunity, grabbed the pistol and disarmed him.</p>
    <p id="b365-3" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[183,433,1149,657]]]'>Miss Kitt’s testimony corroborated Pritchett’s in all respects through the arrival of Jones. Not having had a view of the living room, she testified that she heard someone enter at the front, then heard a shot, ran into the living room with Mrs. Moore, passing Moore in the process, and discovered Jones, lying on the floor fatally wounded. She further related that Mrs. Moore asked her husband, “Why did you shoot Ben?”, and he replied, “Because he shot me.” Both Pritchett and Miss Kitt, however, heard only one shot. Defense counsel did not succeed on cross-examination in developing any line of impeachment of these two witnesses.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[181,1105,1150,425]]]'>The defendant then testified. He said that he had taken the pistol from his car outside and intended to place it in the pocket of a coat hanging in the kitchen. While in the act of so doing, he related, Pritchett grabbed at the pistol, frightening Moore and causing him to jerk. The gun discharged, wounding Moore in the left hand. The defendant further testified that he was unaware at the time that Jones had been shot.</p>

That account placed the defendant’s wife in the kitchen at the time of the shooting and made her a witness to the same extent as was Miss Kitt. Prom the record it is manifest beyond doubt that it was the testimony of Pritchett and Ms girl friend that persuaded the jury that Moore <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>was a murderer; that being the case, then the jury had <em>direct </em>evidence of exactly what Mrs. Moore saw and did, and thus that she could <em>not </em>substantiate Moore’s account of an accidental killing. I can only conclude, accordingly, that the instruction on a permissible adverse inference to be drawn from the failure of Moore to call his wife, when measured against the testimony of Pritchett and Miss Kitt, had nothing to do with this conviction.

While the origin of this rule is clouded in “tantalizing obscurity”, 8 Wigmore §2227, at 211 (M’Naghten rev. 1961), it is clear that the reason for it could have had nothing to do with the <em>credibility </em>of the wife when called to testify <em>against </em>her husband. To the contrary, the fear was that she would be <em>all too truthful </em>and, in exposing her spouse’s faults, would disrupt the tranquility and sanctity of the marriage. It is thus <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>beyond doubt that this rule was not one of witness competency or disqualification, i.e., did not reflect a judicial belief that the testimony lacked <em>probative </em>value,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> but was based on considerations of public policy.

It is obviously illogical to suggest that an adverse inference can be taken from failure to call an incompetent (i.e., a legally incredible or irrelevant) witness. Certain lunatics are incompetent, as are convicted perjurers, and yet no one would seriously suggest that an adverse inference be permitted because the defendant failed to call a gibbering madman or a convicted perjurer. Since the reason that such testimony is not allowed is because it would not be probative if given, how can it be said to be inferentially probative when not given?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> The majority, apparently realizing intuitively <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>that the <em>probative value </em>of an inference taken from the failure to call the wife as a witness makes it impossible to approach the problem of her not testifying from the standpoint of <em>competency </em>(i.e., lack of probative value), instead addresses the matter in terms appropriate only to a question of evidentiary <em>privilege.</em>
