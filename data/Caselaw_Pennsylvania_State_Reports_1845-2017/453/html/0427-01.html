During the Commonwealth’s case in chief the testimony had established that the murder weapon was a .32 caliber automatic pistol, but had failed to link any sucli weapon to the appellant. The appellant later took the stand on his own behalf and was asked on cross-examination if he had ever owned a .32 caliber Beretta pistol, if he had ever been to the Hughes Gunsmith Shop, and in particular whether <em>lie </em>had taken a .32 caliber Beretta automatic to that gun shop for repairs on January 2, 1970. To all these inquiries appellant responded in the negative.</p>

Hughes testified that on January 2,1970, the appellant had brought a Beretta pistol to him for repair, and that he, Hughes, had fired several bullets into a bullet trap. Hughes testified that he later recovered approximately eighty .32 caliber bullets which had been accumulating in the trap for ten years. These bullets later came info the possession of William Valenta, the Commonwealth’s ballistic expert, who testified that two of the bullets had been fired from the murder weapon. Appellant objected to this testimony as improper rebuttal evidence.</p>

      <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>We have repeatedly held that the order of presentation of evidence is a matter which is largely within the discretion of the trial judge. The introduction of evidence by the Commonwealth, after the defense rests its case, which could have been offered by the Commonwealth during its case in chief is not necessarily grounds for reversal. <em>Commonwealth v.

Evidence is admissible in rebuttal to contradict that offered by defendant or his -witnesses, even though by doing so the Commonwealth corrects fatal defects in its case in chief. 2 Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence, §730 (4th ed. 1953). In addition, a party may produce evidence to rebut testimony which he himself elicited from Ms opponent’s witness on cross-examination. <em>Blauvelt v. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Co., </em><a href="/pa/206/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="206 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="931858" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0141-01">206 Pa. 141</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.%20857" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="55 A. 857">55 A. 857</a> (1903). Clearly, the testimony of Mr. Hughes which contradicted the appellant’s testimony on cross-examination was properly admitted as rebuttal. The further testimony by Mr. Hughes describing shooting the pistol into the bullet trap, retrieving the bullets and handing them over to the police would be admissible, as held by the lower court, as an elaboration of the previous rebuttal testimony.</p>

This was error. It is not proper to submit on rebuttal, evidence wMch does not in fact rebut the opponent’s evidence. <em>Myers v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/152/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="152 Pa.

The admission of testimony which is not strictly rebuttal, however, is witMn the discretion of the trial court and, if relevant, the fact that it was offered in rebuttal when it should have been offered in chief is not alone grounds for reversal. <em>Commonwealth v. Hradesky, </em><a href="/pa-super/170/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="170 Pa. Super. 24" data-case-ids="474701" data-case-paths="/pa-super/170/0024-01">170 Pa.

Linking tlie murder weapon to the appellant was important evidence for the Commonwealth and should have been offered, if possible, in its case in chief. Even if the only bullets which had ever been fired into the bullet trap had been from the pistol brought in by the appellant, the fact that those bullets matched the fatal bullets can in no way be said to <em>rebut </em>appellant’s statements that he had never owned a .32 caliber pistol nor visited the Hughes Gun Shop.</p>
    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[174,881,1147,858]]]'>More importantly, the testimony of Lieutenant Valenta was not relevant. Therefore, it was not admissible even if presented in the Commonwealth’s case in chief. Thus, the rule of <em>Hradeshy, supra, </em>is inapposite. Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish some fact material to the case or tends to make facts at issue more or less probable. <em>Commonwealth v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/439/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="439 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1931004" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0381-01">439 Pa. 381</a>, 384, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20756" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="266 A.2d 756">266 A. 2d 756</a>, 758 (1970). The evidence that two unidentified bullets taken from the bullet trap matched the fatal bullets tended only to show that at one time in a ten year period the murder weapon was fired into Hughes’ bullet trap. Although this evidence may he logically relevant as enhancing the <em>possibility </em>that the gun brought in by appellant was the murder weapon, it does not enhance the <em>probability </em>that such was the case.</p>
    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.6",489,[174,1761,1146,538]],["BL_490.1",490,[182,316,1156,988]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that the question of relevancy is controlled by this Court’s recent opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Hoss, </em><a href="/pa/445/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="445 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1940012" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0098-01">445 Pa. 98</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=283%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="283 A.2d 58">283 A. 2d 58</a> (1971). In <em>Hoss, </em>the same Lieutenant Yalenta testified to a number of “matching similarities” between the fatal bullet and the bullets from the revolver found in the possession of the defendant, but admitted that he could not conclusively state that the fatal bullet was fired from the defendant’s gun. Speaking to the issue of relevancy, the Court in <em>Boss </em>held that this <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>testimony established that the fatal bullet could have been fired from the same caliber and malm of gun found in the possession of the defendant, and was relevant since it “significantly advanced the inquiry.” <a href="/pa/445/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="445 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1940012" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0098-01">445 Pa. at 115-16</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=283%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="283 A.2d 58">283 A. 2d at 68</a>. In the instant case, Lieutenant Yalenta has conclusively matched the bullets, but has connected neither to the appellant. Thus, in contrast to <em>Boss, </em>the inquiry regarding appellant’s possession of the murder weapon was not significantly advanced. Nor can the admission of Yalenta’s testimony be sustained on the theory that such evidence made the testimony of the chief rebuttal witness, Edward Hughes, more credible. Even assuming the propriety of allowing evidence in support of Hughes’ credibility,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Yalenta’s testimony was not relevant to that issue;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> it did not corroborate Hughes’ statement that the appellant had brought a .32 caliber pistol to his shop, nor tend to show the validity of that statement.</p>

Although there would have been sufficient evidence to support a conviction without Valenta’s testimony, we are not convinced that the error of law in its admission did not control the outcome of this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
