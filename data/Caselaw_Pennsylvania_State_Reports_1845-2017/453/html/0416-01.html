The notation was unsigned so that it did not qualify as a revocation by another writing; and since the provisions of the will remained untouched by the added words they did not constitute a cancellation, obliteration or destruction.” Bregy, Pennsylvania Intestate, Wills and Estate Act of 1947, Wills Act §5, ¶3 (1949) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>

The attorney who drafted the 1947 will gave Mr. McCaffrey (decedent) the original will and kept a copy in his files. In December of 1953, decedent’s home was burglarized and his safe, containing the will, was taken by a person or persons unknown and never recovered. Upon hearing of the burglary, the attorney visited and later wrote to decedent on January 5, 1954, enclosing a copy of the 1947 will. The attorney emphasized, in his letter, that this was only a copy and not a duplicate original of the 1947 will and he suggested that decedent make a new will immediately if he intended to dispose of all or any part of his estate by will. Since decedent’s 1947 will contained charitable bequests, he further advised decedent that a new will containing charitable bequests would be invalid if executed sooner than thirty days before the death of the testator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Thereafter, decedent consulted with the secretary to the Director of Catholic Charities some time before July 4, 1955, and spoke of the “robbery” and the loss of his important papers, and inquired as to the proper form of charitable bequests. The secretary later telephoned decedent to pursue the matter, and on July 6, 1955, sent him further advice and instructions as to how he might make his will should he decide to leave something to the Catholic Charities. Decedent, however, never made another will.</p>

The attorney, however, further testified that he had a “vague” recollection of a chance meeting with the decedent, at which time the 1947 will was discussed, some time after the execution of the 1947 will but prior to its theft. The attorney “vaguely” recalled that decedent had said something to the effect that he was dissatisfied with certain provisions in the will.

At different times between when he discovered his will was lost and his death, he told other persons that he had lost his will and would have to make another one. Mr. Chief Justice Paxson, speaking for this Court, stated: “The weak spot in the appellant’s case is that there was no proof that the testator left behind him an unrevoked will, or any will whatever. On the contrary, it is an admitted fact that the will, which it was alleged the testator had executed, was lost or destroyed in his lifetime, and that its loss was known to him months before his death.

    <p id="b481-4" data-blocks='[["BL_481.5",481,[158,532,1150,1516]]]'>The same presumption arises in the present case. Decedent’s will was stolen in December of 1953 and he died in March of 1961. A short time after the theft decedent was advised by his attorney to make a new will promptly, to preserve any charitable bequests. Decedent then sought advice on the proper form of charitable bequests. He failed, however, to make a new will in the more than seven years between the theft and his death. A careful review of the record indicates, in support of this presumption, that decedent understood what had happened and the advice which he had received, and, accordingly, believed that he had no will. Moreover, there was no positive, clear and satisfactory evidence to rebut the presumption that the 1947 will was revoked by decedent. That the decedent kept the copy in his possession from shortly after the theft until his death does not, without more, rebut the presumption. The record discloses that the 1939 will and the copy of the 1947 will were found together among decedent’s papers. These papers, some of which dated back to the turn of the century, included his ledger records, correspondence, cancelled bank books, tax returns and mortgage notices. Since he also saved his 1939 will which was specifically revoked in his 1947 will, we cannot conclude that by saving the copy of the 1947 will he intended it to be his will. The decedent obviously saved all his business papers and may have saved the copy of the 1947 will for future reference.</p>

The “destruction” of the original 1947 will admittedly was not done at decedent’s “express direction” or “in his presence.” Section 5, however, is inapplicable. The purpose of the section is to prevent oral revocation of an existing, otherwise valid will. Here there is no such problem. Although the execution and existence of the original 1947 will have been proven, so has the fact that it has been physically destroyed.</p>
    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[189,906,1158,800]]]'>We do not hold, and neither did this Court in <em>Dernes’s Estate </em>hold, that actual revocation is effected by the destruction of the original will. Rather, from the overall circumstances in the case a presumption is created that the intent existed to ratify the loss which has already occurred. A presumption of revocation raised from the inability to find a will at a decedent’s death is not based on objective proof that revocation occurred as required by the Wills Act—in such a case the presumption would not be needed. If, however, the presumption is not overcome, a revocation is effected without proof of compliance with the requirements of the Wills Act. Similarly, decedent’s 1947 will is revoked without proof of compliance with the requirements of the Wills Act.</p>

For purposes of revocation the 1947 will, which contained a revocatory clause, took effect upon execution although its dispositive provisions necessarily remained ambulatory. <em>Ford’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/301/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="301 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1126447" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0183-01">301 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.%20789" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="151 A. 789">151 A. 789</a> (1930). The clause of revocation is effective even though the 1947 will cannot be given dispositive effect. Section 5 of the Wills Act does not require a revoking document to be effective as a will at the time of decedent’s death. Section 5(2) provides that a will can be revoked “by some other writing declaring the same, exe<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>euted. and proved in the manner required of wills.” The requirement “executed and proved in the manner required of wills” refers back to Section 2—by “two or more competent witnesses.” <em>Cf. Harrison’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/316/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="316 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1158982" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0015-01">316 Pa. 15</a>, 19, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20407" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="173 A. 407">173 A. 407</a>, 409 (1934).

The testimony of decedent’s attorney and the attorney’s secretary was sufficient to establish proof of execution and contents of the original 1947 will. The 1939 will was effectively revoked even though the original 1947 will is unavailable. This is not a case where we would refuse to recognize an existing will because proof of revocation is limited to oral testimony of an unproduced written revocation. <em>E.g., Koehler’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/316/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="316 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1158995" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0321-01">316 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.%20424" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="175 A. 424">175 A. 424</a> (1934); <em>see, e.g., Harrison’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/316/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="316 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1158982" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0015-01">316 Pa. 15</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20407" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="173 A. 407">173 A. 407</a> (1934).

These writings, together with the oral testimony, were held sufficient to show a revocation of the existing 1924 will. Under the instant circumstances, therefore, neither the carbon copy of the 1947 nor the existing 1939 will should be admitted to probate.</p>
