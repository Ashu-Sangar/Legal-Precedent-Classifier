Discrimination, by its very nature, is directed against an entire class in the particular circumstances and wrongful conduct against a complaining individual is indicative of such a state of mind in the wrongdoer against the class. Common knowledge and experience dictate the conclusion, for example, that an apartment owner found to have discriminated because of race in one instance may well have discriminated, and proposes to discriminate, against all others of the class seeking to rent his accommodations. ...

    <p id="b196-4" data-blocks='[["BL_196.6",196,[196,390,1157,938]]]'>While I join in the opinion of the Court, I wish to express at the same time my complete agreement with the sentiments expressed by Mr. Justice Eagen in his dissenting opinion. As I have had occasion to observe before, the ability to place reliance on the word of a fellow lawyer is a highly prized and important aspect of the administration of justice in this country. See <em>Fox v. </em>Mellon, <a href="/pa/438/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="438 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="1929292" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0364-01">438 Pa. 364</a>, 367, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20623" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="264 A.2d 623">264 A. 2d 623</a> (1970) (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Pomeroy). This is particularly true when the fellow lawyer is representing the government. The problem here, however, is that the appellee cemetery, satisfied to live with the decision of the Commonwealth Court, took no cross-appeal from that court’s adverse holding as to the alleged breach of the settlement agreement. Not having done so, it is not entitled now, as appellee, to a reversal on that ground.</p>
    <p id="b196-5" data-blocks='[["BL_196.7",196,[197,1339,1159,994]],["BL_197.1",197,[162,324,1147,100]]]'>As to the remedy ordered by the Commission, I add my thought that the Commission, an agency of democratic government, is without power to order the giving of a public apology. An apology is a communication of the emotion of remorse for one’s past acts. To order up that particular emotion, or any other emotion, is beyond the reach of any <em>government; to </em>assert the contrary is to advocate tyranny. If, perchance, the Commission, in ordering a public manifestation of remorse, should be indifferent as to whether remorse in fact exists but instead should desire only the outward act, then it would be either extracting a lie from those willing to lie (“I’m sorry”, but I’m really not) or asking the courts of this State to hold in contempt those who will not lie (“I’m not sorry and I will not say that I am”). Given the choice, I would rather hold in contempt the former, not the latter. But in my view the Commission should eschew purporting to order the expression of an <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>emotion, whether or not the emotion is in fact entertained by the one so ordered.</p>

    <p id="b197-5" data-blocks='[["BL_197.7",197,[163,551,1148,152]]]'>I would agree with the opinion and order of the majority, if the following undisputed facts did not appeal* in the record.</p>
    <p id="b197-6" data-blocks='[["BL_197.8",197,[160,717,1151,883]]]'>After the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission entered its first “final order” in the case on April 27, 1970, the Association entered an appeal therefrom in the Commonwealth Court. Negotiations followed between counsel for the Commission and counsel for the Association resulting in an agreement that the Commission’s order would be modified in certain respects. Relying on this agreement, the Association discontinued its appeal. On <em>July 28, 1970, </em>counsel for the Commission confirmed the settlement agreement by writing counsel for the Association wherein he stated, “The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission hereby agrees to the entry of the stipulation” [which included the order of the Commission with the agreed to modifications] and suggesting that the “stipulation” be entered as part of the record in the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b197-7" data-blocks='[["BL_197.9",197,[155,1615,1153,546]]]'>Following the above, the personnel of the Commission changed substantially. Counsel was also replaced. On <em>March 21,1972, </em>the new counsel for the Commission wrote counsel for the Association informing him that on May 20th, the Commission entered an “amended final order” which was “substantially identical” with its “final order” of April 27, 1970. The latter also stated former counsel for the Commission was not authorized to agree to any modifications of the Commission’s order of April 27, 1970.</p>

    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[195,604,1157,659]]]'>It should be noted the Commission waited many, many months before attempting to counteract its counsel’s action in settling the dispute. Moreover, counsel for the Commission is an assistant attorney general of the Commonwealth and the attorney general is vested with broad power in compromising litigation on the part of the Commonwealth. Finally, and probably most important, when a citizen is dealing with government through one of its representatives, particularly the attorney general or one of his assistants, he should be entitled to rely on that individual’s word. Simple honesty and fairness permit no less.</p>
