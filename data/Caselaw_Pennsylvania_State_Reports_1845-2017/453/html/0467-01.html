He continued walking north on Point Breeze Avenue where I apprehended him at Point Breeze and Latona. It’s approximately five stores away from 1253 Point Breeze Avenue. I apprehended him and patted him down. I brought him back to the scene, where I observed in the doorway the screen, protecting the window, pried away from the window. He was placed in the wagon.</p>

All of the evidence offered tends to establish nothing more than the fact that the arresting officer, who was <em>“12, </em>13 stores away”, observed the appellant walk out of a doorway<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and then proceed to a pile of sand at a nearby construction site where he bent over as though to place some object. The officer stated that at this point he apprehended the appellant and walked him back to 1258 Point Breeze Avenue where he noticed that a protective screen over a window in the doorway had been pried away. From this testimony, the Commonwealth would have us conclude that the appellant used a screwdriver, which was found by the police officer in the vicinity of the sandpile, to pry back the screen, a screen which had been intact four hours previously. A finding of guilt based upon such tenuous evidence would be purely conjectural.</p>
    <p id="b527-3" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[159,1261,1144,591]]]'>Appellant’s mere presence at the scene where screening over a window had been bent is insufficient to prove him guilty of attempted burglary.

The record is devoid of any evidence connecting appellant with the screen. There was no showing that anyone saw appellant tampering with the window. Furthermore, the arresting officer gave no indication of hearing any suspicious noises as he approached the store.</p>

There are many tools and implements which are suitable for bending back a screen and the Commonwealth did not attempt to show that in this instance it was a screwdriver Avhich had been employed. We therefore conclude that the finding of attempted burglary was based solely on suspicion or speculation, which is impermissible. <em>See Commonwealth v.

As summarized by this Court, the evidence in <em>Cimaszewski </em>was that at approximately 11:00 p.m. two police officers, responding to a “burglary in progress” report, heard noises coming from Avithin the building, the front door of which had been loosened and a window jimmied. Two men were seen fleeing from the rear of the building one of whom was immediately apprehended and identified as appellant Cimaszewski’s brother. At the same time, the second officer proceeded to the rear of the property and while so doing heard noises coming from that area. Investigating the noises, the officer found the appellant standing on top of a nearby shed roof. Under these circumstances, we were satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to find Cimaszewski guilty of attempted burglary.</p>

The crime of attempted burglary requires that the attempted entry be accompanied with an intent to commit a felony within. Act of June 24, 1989, P. L. 872, §§901, 1107, 18 P.S. §§4901, 5107. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Here it was apparent prior to the dislodging of the screen that entry could not be gained without removing the boarding from the window. The evidence is uncontradicted that the boarding had not been tampered with and there was a complete absence of any evidence of interruption by any outside circumstances. These facts strongly suggest that there may not have been an intention to enter and commit a felony therein but rather that the intent may have been just the malicious destruction of the screen.</p>
