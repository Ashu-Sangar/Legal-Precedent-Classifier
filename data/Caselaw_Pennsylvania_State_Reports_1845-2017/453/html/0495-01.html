While the record is imprecise, it does appear that there was fighting in the area of the stadium parking lot and that at least three persons were injured: one young woman suffered a cut head, a male student sustained a fractured jaw and another unidentified male was beaten with a lead pipe. The initial outbreaks prompted a stadium announcement intended to restore order. The announcement had the opposite effect and fighting became more widespread.</p>

Edwards, principal of Cedar Cliff, E. Jerry Brooks, chairman of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (“PIAA”) District III and Theodore R.

      <em>The </em>court below attributed critical importance to the Harrisburg principal’s admissions of responsibility with respect to the appellant high school’s culpability in the September 17, 1971, incident.

The principal of each school, in all matters pertaining to the interscholastic athletic relations of his school, is responsible to this Association. He may delegate some of these powers but such delegation shall not relieve him of responsibility for any infraction, by his school, of the Constitution and By-Laws of this Association.”</p>

I don’t think we can go back. I am here to plead for Harrisburg High School athletics. What you have reported at this table today, I do not deny one bit of it.” During the same meeting, District III committee questioning elicited the following: “Mb. Palmer (District III committee member) : The things that we were concerned about were the razor blades, the ice picks, the broken bottles, the chains, the deadly weapons that can kill.

      <p id="b558-7" data-blocks='[["BL_558.8",558,[187,1821,1155,491]]]'>Appellee cites the ease of <em>Sanders v. Louisiana High School Athletic Ass’n, </em>La. App., <a href="/so2d/242/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="242 So. 2d 19" data-case-ids="9710498" data-case-paths="/so2d/242/0019-01">242 So. 2d 19</a> (1970), for the proposition that the state-wide athletic association's affairs do not constitute state action. The Louisiana court distinguished <em>Sanders </em>from <em>St. Augustine </em>on the theory that <em>St. Augustine </em>involved the association’s racial discrimination, while <em>Sanders </em>involved the eligibility of the appellant to participate in his high school’s athletic program. This factual distinction could not materially affect the outcome of the question of whether the association’s activities constitute state action, though it does affect the resolution of the question of whether judicial interference is warranted.</p>
