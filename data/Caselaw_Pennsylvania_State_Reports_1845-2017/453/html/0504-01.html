    <p id="b561-8" data-blocks='[["BL_561.15",561,[177,1414,1150,307]]]'>Appellant, Grover Sanger, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally on January 13, 1969. Pursuant to a degree of guilt hearing on February 20, 1969, appellant was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This direct appeal followed. We now affirm.</p>
    <p id="b561-9" data-blocks='[["BL_561.16",561,[177,1741,1149,314]]]'>Appellant argues that: he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, Ms guilty plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily, he was deprived of due process of law at the degree of guilt hearing, and he was not “properly and fairly” advised of Ms right to appeal.</p>

The <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>record also conclusively establishes that appellant’s guilty plea was entered both knowingly and voluntarily, <em>Commonwealth v.
