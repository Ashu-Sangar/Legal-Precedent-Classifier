Approximately seven hours earlier, a night watchman had been killed at a laundry company. Appellant was taken to police headquarters and a first round of interrogation began at 10:32 a.m. He was given advice concerning his constitutional rights and denied any involvement in the crime. The questioning of the appellant continued throughout the day and did not end until approximately 10:18 pan., at which time the appellant refused to sign a formal statement. Appellant was not taken before a magistrate until the following day.

The shortest period was approximately a half-hour and the longest period was approximately two hours. After the first three interrogation periods, a new officer began his participation in the interrogation process. After the first five interrogation sessions, another officer, who had not participated in the first five interrogation sessions, began his participation in the interrogation process. At one point, the appellant was given a polygraph test. During the first five interrogation sessions, appellant continually denied any involvement in the crime. After the sixth interrogation session, involving three officers, had been in progress continually for approximately an hour and a half, appellant, for the first time, made oral statements admitting involvement in the crime. This was approximately eight hours after his arrest and following six separate interrogation sessions throughout the day during which confrontation took place between the appellant and at least six differ<a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>ent police officers. A seventh interrogation session then followed for approximately three hours. At about 10:18 p.m., the appellant was asked to sign a formal statement and refused. He did write thereon the words <em>refused to sign </em>and his initials.</p>

In this case the delay which occurred between arrest and arraignment was clearly related to the statements obtained. The appellant for approximately eight hours denied any involvement. It was only after six interrogation sessions involving various officers that the appellant made any inculpatory statement. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v.

Where on balance these considerations do not <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>favor retroactivity, the current federal practice is to apply the new standard only where prohibited conduct takes place after the announcement of the rule. <em>Desist v.

One may hope that the threat of exclusion will help to deter dilatory or illegal police conduct, but it can hardly be supposed that application of the exclusionary rule to events long past will add anything to the rule’s deterrent force for the future. On the other hand, the Court’s opinion may have grave repercussions on the administration of justice. No one knows how many prosecutions have been instituted since January 1, 1965 in reliance on our <em>pre-Futch </em>rules of admissibility, but there must have been a great many. Now, it appears, any defendant convicted on the basis of evidence which under <em>Futch </em>should be excluded is entitled to a new trial, regardless of the fairness of his original trial.
