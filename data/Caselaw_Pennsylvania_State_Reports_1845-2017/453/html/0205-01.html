This direct appeal comes to us under the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, §57, 19 P.S. §1182.</p>

One of the five—that the Commonwealth erred in not including a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the bill of indictment presented to the grand jury—was not presented to the court below by post-trial motion and under settled principles will not now be decided by this Court. Of the remaining four reasons, one will in fact require that appellant’s conviction be reversed. We will additionally reach and decide two of the remaining three contentions because they are almost certain to recur should the Commonwealth elect to retry appellant.</p>

Springbett, Jr., was shot while visiting at the Levittown, Pennsylvania home of George DuVal, the defendant-appellant, and his mistress, Marilyn D’Ulisse. It was the Commonwealth’s theory that Springbett had traveled to Levittown to effect a reconciliation with his mistress, Joan McCabe, with whom he had recently had a falling out and who had temporarily taken up residence with the defendant DuVal and Miss D’Ulisse. According to the Commonwealth, relations between Springbett and Miss McCabe deteriorated still further during Springbett’s visit and while all four persons were together in the kitchen in the late afternoon, Springbett struck Joan McCabe in anger. This action so infuriated DuVal that he fetched a .45 calibre service revolver from the bedroom, returned to the kitchen and shot Springbett in the chest.</p>

Later, before the Grand Jury, both of them changed their stories to that detailed above. Between the time of the Grand Jury testimony <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>and the start of DuVal’s trial, however, both women became concerned that perjury charges might be in the offing and they consulted a lawyer. That attorney contacted the assistant district attorney of Bucks County “three or four days before the beginning of the voir dire.” In a hearing held after the trial on defendant’s motion to supplement the record, the assistant district attorney recounted the conversation as follows:</p>

When called to the stand, Miss McCabe would state nothing but her name and address, and to all else claimed her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Out of the hearing of the jury, the trial judge decided that the witness had waived her privilege by testifying on prior occasions. The jury was returned and the witness was directed to testify. She refused, was declared in contempt of court, and was led off in the custody of the sheriff. Defense counsel made objection throughout.</p>

The prejudice to the defendant of statements placed before the jury which by their terms directly connect him with the crime (as in <em>Pointer, Douglas </em>and <em>Bruton, </em><a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">supra)</a> is of a different order from the prejudice present in the case at bar. Here the risk is not that the jury will misuse evidence which directly states that the defendant is the criminal, but rather that the jury will make improper inference from the mere refusal of the witness called to testify at all. Here, unlike <em>Pointer, Douglas </em>and <em>Bruton, </em>supra, the witnesses McCabe and D’Ulisse have made no statement, written or oral, before the jury that directly implicates DuVal; they have said nothing at all. Whether or not the error which we find to have occurred in this case is error under the federal constitution as well is a question which it is not necessary for us to reach on this appeal.</p>

Although it could be argued that under certain circumstances a refusal to testify on grounds of scJf-inerimination might have probative value in establishing an issue in a matter to which the witness was not a party, we have recently held that it is not permissible for either defense or prosecution to attempt to capitalize on such refusal. <em>Commonwealth v.

Where it is the prosecutor who attempts to use such a device, there is a special vice: the inference to be drawn from the refusal to testify <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>of the defendant’s co-defendant, accomplice or associate has <em>no probative value whatsoever </em>in establishing the guilt of the defendant.

      <em>Second'. </em>We disagree with those jurisdictions in which it is held that the prosecution may with impunity call before the jury a witness likely to be associated with the defendant in the minds of the jurors, knowing that a privilege against self-incrimination will be claimed and yet believing that the claim of privilege will be legally invalid. It is a simple matter for the prosecuting attorney to inform the court that a witness he intends to call will, to his knowledge, attempt to invoke a privilege against testifying, and obtain a ruling thereon. We note that such a procedure is proposed by the American Bar Association’s Project on Standards for Criminal Justice: “A prosecutor should not call a witness who* he knows will claim a privilege not to testify, for the purpose of impressing upon the jury the fact of the claim of privilege. In some instances, as defined in the Code of Professional Responsibility, doing so will constitute unprofessional conduct.” ABA, Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function §5.7(c), at 122-23.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> In a comment to this section, the Project pointed out that “if the prosecutor is informed in advance that the witness will claim a privilege and he wishes to contest the claim, the matter should be treated without the presence of the jury and a ruling obtained.” Id. at <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>125. The witness’ known intent to invoke the privilege coupled with the prosecutor’s opinion that the testimony sought can be nevertheless compelled presents the risk that, as actually occurred twice in the case at bar, the witness might prove not only reluctant to testify but contumacious as well. If the fact of invocation of the privilege is, as we believe, irrelevant to the issues and prejudicial to the defendant, it is that much more prejudicial to permit the jury to observe that the recalcitrant witness (a person likely to be associated in the jurors’ minds with the defendant) elects to remain silent notwithstanding the order of the court that he testify.</p>
    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[175,1069,1148,491]]]'>In the case at bar it would have been a simple matter indeed, with the jury already removed from the courtroom, to determine whether the witnesses D’Ulisse and McCabe would continue to assert a privilege despite the contrary ruling by the court. Permitting the jury to return to the courtroom and then to observe first McCabe and then D’Ulisse being cited for contempt and marched out in the custody of the sheriff was prejudicial to the defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Whether or not the prosecution has a good faith belief that the assertion <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>of privilege is legally invalid is irrelevant; that matter can be settled outside the hearing of the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The Commonwealth argues that the failure to make such a request precludes appellant from asserting the error we have previously held to have occurred. The <em>Terenda </em>opinion, supra, called ineffective the trial court’s attempt to cure error of this sort by instructing the jury to disregard the fact that co-defendants had been called to the stand and had invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Whether or not prejudicial error can be cured by appropriate instructions can be answered only through an objective evaluation of the capability of the average juror to follow the instruction and thus refrain from misuse or use of evidence improperly admitted. See generally, Note, The Limiting Instruction—Its Effectiveness and Effect, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20Minn.%20L.%20Rev.%20264" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="51 Minn. L. Rev. 264">51 Minn. L. Rev. 264</a> (1956). Where an element of prosecutorial misconduct is present, as it is here and as it was in <em>Terenda, </em>we prefer to give the defendant the benefit of the doubt as to whether or not the error could have been cured by an instruction. We thus hold that the prejudicial error here involved was not waived by failure of defense counsel to request an instruction. It follows that appellant’s conviction cannot stand, and that a new trial must be ordered.</p>

DuVal surrendered to police authorities in the office of his lawyer on the late afternoon of December 14th. Testimony of the arresting officer establishes that DuVal was read the arrest warrant, was read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings from a card which he subsequently signed, and was then removed from the attorney’s office. It was made clear to the arresting officer by appellant’s lawyer, however, that no interrogation of Du-Val was to take place at all. Consequently, the defendant was taken to the Bristol Township Building, was there fingerprinted and arraigned before a Bucks County magistrate, and was then delivered into the custody of the officials of the Bucks County Prison.</p>

This latter form had already been completed by the magistrate before whom PuYal had been arraigned, and it indicated that the arrested man was held for homicide. Although the arrest report, which was blank, contained a space for “charge” to be indicated, Sergeant Poorly testified that he did not ask PuYal the nature of the charges against him, but rather set about transferring the data on the commitment form to the arrest report.

In none of the first nine is there any evidence of blood or viscera; instead it is obvious that care was used to clean the corpse prior to photographing it so that the resulting pictures would show only the external indications of the bullet wound, a wound which appears at both entry and exit points as a small circular puncture. The Commonwealth offered all fifteen slides into evidence, but, after timely objection by defense counsel, the trial judge examined the series and ruled that most were inadmissible. Of those ruled admissible, the Commonwealth actually introduced only three: one of the nude upper torso of the deceased, including the head; one of the upper back of the deceased, and one of the upper torso from the side with metal rods projecting from the two wounds, indi<a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>eating the path of the bullet from front to back.
