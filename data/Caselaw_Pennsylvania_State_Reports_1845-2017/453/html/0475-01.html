The Superior Court reasoned in <em>Trapp </em>that the trial court “might well have prejudiced [appellant] by predisposing the jurors to believe the accused guilty, thus effectively stripping him of the presumption of innocence.” 217 Pa.

As the Superior Court pertinently observed: “The prejudice to the defendant was further aggravated by the fact that the booklets listed other burglaries charged against co-defendant. Jurors are very likely influenced by the maxims of guilt by association and 'birds of a feather flock together’. Almost inevitably, appellant would be tarred with the same brush as the codefendant. The intrusion into tlie trial of other alleged crimes raised issues to which appellant could not realistically present a defense. Clearly, appellant’s association with the other charges and with codefendant tended to show that he was guilty of other crimes and effectively stripped him of the presumption of innocence.” 217 Pa.

Trapp, supra, </em>but felt that it could be distinguished from the instant case. In <em>Trapp, </em>the defendant, upon learning that the jury had the trial booklet, moved for a mistrial. Here, the appellant made a pretrial motion to challenge the jury panel. The trial judge, in his opinion, pointed out that appellant’s challenge to the array did not conform to the provisions of Rule 1104(b) and (c) of the Pennsylvania Rules of <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>Criminal Procedure. Pa. R. Grim. P. 1104 provides in pertinent part:</p>
    <p id="b535-3" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[154,423,1149,373]]]'>“(b) Unless opportunity did not exist prior thereto, a challenge to the array shall be made not later than five days before the first day of the week the ease is listed for trial of criminal cases for which the jurors have been summoned and not thereafter, and shall be in writing, specifying the acts constituting the ground for the challenge.</p>
    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[155,808,1142,154]]]'>“(c) A challenge to the array may be made only on the ground that the jurors were not selected, drawn or summoned substantially in accordance with law.”</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[152,976,1147,1143]]]'>Even though appellant moved for a challenge to the array rather than for a mistrial, we are not persuaded that this is a distinction with any legal significance. In our view, the nature and purpose of ajjpellant’s motion was clear and, therefore, the trial court should have addressed itself to the merits of the objection. As the dissenters in the Superior Court ably point out: “[T]he fact that appellant sought relief by bringing a motion to challenge the jury panel instead of a motion for mistrial is not material. First, insofar as a motion for mistrial would have been timely, if made at the time that the challenge to the jury panel was made, there is no reason for the trial court to deny relief to the appellant on the basis that the challenge to the jury panel was not timely. Second, even if the motion to challenge the jury panel was improperly framed, the trial court still recognized the true thrust of appellant’s pretrial objection and should have passed on the merits of such objection.” <em>Commonwealth v.

However, this suggested use of voir dire to determine whether the jury-had been prejudiced against the appellant does not take into account the fact that the jury had already been sworn when the appellant discovered that the booklets had been distributed and thus the opportunity for voir dire had passed. See Pa. E. Crim. P. 1106, 1107 and 1100.</p>
