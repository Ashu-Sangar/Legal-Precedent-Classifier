When questioned as to the plausibility of the injury of the liver resulting from a fall on or down the stairs the doctor testified as follows: “Q. Doctor, based on your autopsy and findings with regard to the liver, are you able to give a reasonable medical opinion, with reasonable medical certainty, as to whether or not that injury to the liver could have resulted from the child falling down those stairs? A. Yes, I am. Q. What is your opinion? A. I find it difficult to believe that an injury to the liver such as this, which was very localized and which actually resulted in the liver being torn off, could result from falling down a flight of stairs.” At a later point in <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>his testimony under questioning by the court the doctor conceded: “The Court: Doctor, I have a question.

Could that injury to the kidney have been caused by— The Witness: Injury to the kidneys? The Court: I mean, not the kidneys, to the liver. Suppose he was tumbling down the steps and just got into a certain position and would have struck the treads, the sharp treads here, could that have caused the tear to the liver?

The jury was also allowed to view photographs of the scene where the alleged accident supposedly occurred. There was valid and sufficient evidence for the jury to reject the occurence of an accident as described by the appellee to the police and conclude, as they apparently did, that this young life was intentionally and brutally extinguished.</p>

The case is sufficient for a jury to find guilt “unless the proof relied npon for a conviction is so weak and inconclusive that as a matter of law 150 probability of fact can be drawn from the combined circumstances”, <em>Commonwealth v.

Restated, the test requires, before the granting of a motion in arrest of judgment based on insufficiency of the evidence, that the court make a finding that the evidence supporting the verdict of guilt is so weak and inconclusive that a jury of reasonable men and women could not be satisfied as to the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not believe that to be the case under <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>the facts before us. Here a jury could conclude guilt, as it did, based upon the medical testimony and the view (photographs) of the scene of the alleged accident. We reverse the lower court’s order granting the motion in arrest of judgment and discharging the appellee.</p>
