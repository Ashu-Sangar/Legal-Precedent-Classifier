Prior to acceptance of the plea by the lower court, defense counsel and the Assistant District Attorney conducted an extensive on-the-record colloquy with appellant. The court, in the presence of the appellant, was advised that the plea was negotiated. In return for the plea, the Commonwealth certified that the charge of murder rose no higher than murder in the second degree and recommended a prison term of seven and one-half to fifteen years for the murder charge and a concurrent sentence on the aggravated assault and battery charge. On October 10, 1972, appellant appeared before the lower court for sentencing. The terms of the plea bargain were again stated. The court then imposed a sentence of six and a half to fifteen years on the murder charge and one to three years on the assault and battery charge to run concurrently. This appeal followed.</p>

According to Mrs. Dew, appellant was a former boyfriend who kept coming to her home. On this particular evening she was in. the second floor front bedroom with decedent when appellant entered the house on the first <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>floor. Hearing someone coming in, she went to her son’s room. Appellant walked by this x’oom heading for the front bedroom. Mrs. Dew then heard appellant say to the decedent, “Who are you, who are you?” Decedent replied by asking the same question. Mrs. Dew heard shots and ran into the front bedroom screaming, where she was shot in the arm by appellant. She then ran out of the house and last saw appellant walking down the street.</p>

His illiteracy was brought to the court’s attention during the extensive colloquy. The court, mindful of appellant’s lack of a formal education, directed specific questions to appellant to ascertain his awareness and comprehension. In addition, both defense counsel and the Assistant District Attorney repeatedly asked appellant if he understood various specific aspects of the colloquy and he at all times indicated that he understood these matters. In determining the constitutional validity of appellant’s plea, we are not merely concerned with whether he was able to read or write but whether, at the time of his plea, he was able to comprehend his position and understand what Avas happening. <em>See Commonwealth v.

It is abundantly clear from the record that appellant’s plea was entered in complete awareness of the terms of the agreement and the sentence recommendation. Appellant was also aware that the court was not obligated to accept the Commonwealth’s recommendation. Had the court not accepted the recommendation appellant would have been given an opportunity to withdraw his plea pursuant to Eule 319(b) (3). Therefore, considering the existence of the on-the-record plea agreement, together with appellant’s right to withdraw the plea if the court decided <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>not to concur in tlie plea agreement, we conclude that appellant was more than adequately protected from unknowingly pleading guilty.
