If compliance with legislative <em>policy </em>were all that were required, appellees’ efforts to carry the burden of making inquiry should clearly suffice.

It is obvious that if the inquiring party suggests a name, and receives an affirmative response, he has ascertained the <em>identity </em>of a recipient.</p>

      <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[166,1288,1148,259]]]'> To lighten this chore when, as here, an inquiry is directed towards all persons within a large geographic area, the board might well permit the inquiring party to inspect lists of names, addresses and amounts of assistance received by persons in that area; such, indeed, is the normal procedure under the Right-To-Know Act, 65 P.S. §66.2.</p>
      <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.7",231,[164,1563,1150,709]]]'>As explained in the text, ante, the present versions of sections 404 and 425 of the Public Welfare Code of 1967 stem directly from the unsound attempt of the Social Security Administration, following enactment of the Jenner Amendment, to make an interpretation of that statute turn on Congressional use of the passive voice, “access may be had.” The amendment in 1953 to the Pennsylvania Welfare Code reflected nothing more than an attempt to gear the statutory provision permitting access to welfare records from the active voice (the Board of Assistance “shall . . . make available for inspection and examination . . . .”) into the passive voice (“upon request of any adult resident . . . .”). The difference between the active and passive voices is stylistic only, and it is not such as to change the result. There is thus nothing startling in the conclusion that the changed mode of procedure, while it places the initiative upon the person who inquires, does not in fact change the net product of ascertainable information.</p>
