[Pincus] is a Pennsylvania Corporation engaged in the manufacturing and sale of tailored men’s suits. Its manufacturing plant and principal office are in Philadelphia. In its Corporate Net Income Tax Report for the year 1967, Pincus computed the tax due the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as $12,-804.00. Subsequently, the Commonwealth’s Board of Finance and Revenue [Board] determined sur a petition for review, that Pincus owed a total tax of $19,-<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>644.11. Pincus filed an appeal in the Commonwealth Court which ruled the Board correctly determined the tax due and entered judgment for the amount of tax [$19,644.11], plus interest and costs.

However, he resides in Philadelphia and also has an office there.</p>
    <p id="b583-6" data-blocks='[["BL_583.7",583,[141,1036,1153,858]]]'>Eight full-time employees work in the New York City showroom-office. The wages paid these employees are reported to the State of New York for unemployment compensation. Pincus also employs fifteen individual salesmen who are assigned territories in Illinois, California, Rhode Island, North Carolina and Texas. These salesmen work under the supervision of David Pincus and contact him about selling problems. Sales meetings are held both in Philadelphia and New York City. The commissions due the salesmen plus their expense vouchers are paid from the Philadelphia office. Their earnings are reported to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for unemployment compensation purposes. All of the expenses incident to the maintenance of the New York City showroom-office are paid from the Philadelphia office.</p>

At all other times, these salesmen work in their assigned territories.</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[202,598,1155,536]]]'>The orders obtained in New York City are reported to David Pincus for preliminary approval and he then forwards them to the office in Philadelphia. All of the orders obtained by the salesmen in their respective territories are forwarded directly to the Philadelphia office. All orders are processed in the Philadelphia office for approval of credit and “as to manufacturing” (i.e., the availability of the goods). No deliveries are made until the Philadelphia office gives final approval. All billings are from the Philadelphia office.</p>

    <p id="b584-6" data-blocks='[["BL_584.7",584,[205,1361,1155,425]]]'>The three fractions by which such allocation is made are the so-called: (1) “tangible property fraction”; (2) “wages and salaries fraction”; and (3) “gross receipts fraction”. The tangible property fraction is not in dispute. Nor are the denominators of the wages and salaries fraction and gross receipts fraction. In contention are the numerators of the wages and salaries fraction and the gross receipts fraction.</p>

The Commonwealth Court concluded that these individuals were chiefly situated at the Philadelphia office, but, in our view, this conclusion is not supported either by the record or previous decisions of this Court.</p>

L. 420, §21, as amended, 72 P.S. §1871, imposing a franchise tax on foreign corporations doing business in Pennsylvania. For example, see <em>Commonwealth v.
