On September 1, 1967, appellant and his wife became involved in a marital dispute. When appellant physically abused Ms wife, she left their apartment and went to stay with her parents, Edna and Ezra Bray. Appellant went to the Bray home to see his wife the day she left and three times the following day. On Ms first three visits he was not permitted to see her. On the last visit, when he was again denied permission to see her, appellant pulled a <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>gun from under Ms sweater and mortally wounded Ms mother-in-law, Mrs. Edna Bray. He then turned the gun on Ezra Bray, his father-in-law, but the gun misfired. The appellant’s wife heard the shots and ran to her mother’s bedroom to telephone the police. Appellant pursued and twice wounded her. When she fled to the basement, appellant gave chase and inflicted several more wounds. He then left the Bray residence and was apprehended three blocks away.</p>

In this connection the appellant introduced the psychiatric reports of several qualified medical experts. This evidence indicates that appellant is a chronic schizophrenic with paranoid tendencies, but that his condition, pre-trial, was in “fairly good remission”. There was also evidence that appellant was “oriented in all spheres”, and there was no indication that appellant was not able to understand the warnings, consonant with <em>Miranda v.

In this instance, while the appellant exhibits chronic paranoid schizophrenia, there is no evidence that his condition prevented him from understanding the significance of the inculpating statement he made to Ms interrogators. In addition, there is no evidence that police took unfair advantage of the appellant’s condition. <em>(See: Commonwealth v.

The appellant’s stay at Glen Mills was first disclosed <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>by him during cross-examination by the Commonwealth: “Q. By the way, I think you did refer to the Testament at one time in your testimony here this afternoon. Who gave you that Testament? A. Who gave it to me? Q. Yes. A. I brought it home from Glen Mills School. Q. Did Mrs. Bray give you a Testament as a wedding gift? A. No.” The fact of appellant’s stay at Glen Mills was raised a second time during questioning of the appellant by the court: “How long had you lived on Archer Street? A. I think it was the summertime of ’66. Q. That was when you first moved there? A. Yes. Q. From Leithgow Street. A. No. Q. From where? A. Orianna Street. Q. That is the same neighborhood? A. Three blocks down, two blocks over. Q. How long did you live on North Orianna Street? A. I don’t know, my mother moved there when I was up at Glen Mills School. Q. When were you at Glen Mills School? A. 1964 to 1965.”</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[185,1298,1155,741]]]'>We do not believe the lower court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial under the instant circumstances. The allusions to Glen Mills were not elicited by the Commonwealth or the court but were offered spontaneously by the appellant during questioning which probed matters unrelated to his stay at Glen Mills. Additionally, even if we assume that it was error to refuse to grant a mistrial on the basis of these disclosures, it was harmless error beyond reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a> (1967).

    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[182,616,1144,1071]]]'>“Now, if you have that kind of a doubt after you have argued the facts that have been presented before yon, both pro and con, applied the law as I give it to you, <em>if you find that you cannot reach a decision, </em>then you must have some type of reasonable doubt and that doubt is to be resolved in favor of the defendant and that is so because the Commonwealth therefore has not convinced yon, according to the law as described by the Court, convinced you beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Emphasis added.) The appellant argues that the court’s instruction was erroneous because reasonable doubt has never required the quantum of doubt which would prompt a juror to <em>refuse </em>to act if he found he could not reach a decision. In reading the court’s instruction <em>in its entirety, </em>we find no reason to distinguish the court’s definition of reasonable doubt from the Instruction expressly approved by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

Therefore, that is a vital part of the body and the infliction of a wound there by a gun are facts from which you may infer the intention to kill, even though the defendant or person accused of the crime says ‘I didn’t intend to kill’, but that is for you to determine and not anyone else.”</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[212,723,1150,972]]]'>We agree preliminarily with the appellant’s position that, although the use of a gun on a vital part of the deceased’s body raises the presumption of an intent to kill, the inference is merely a factual presumption which may be overcome by a rebuttal evidence to the contrary. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant also contends, however, that the court’s instruction was erroneous because it established an <em>irrebuttable </em>presumption that the firing of a pistol at the chest of the decedent was evidence, as a matter of law, that appellant acted with the intent to kill. We disagree. The court in fact charged the jury that they could infer the intention to kill even though the appellant gave contrary testimony, but that only the jury could finally decide. Because the court’s instruction accurately described a rebuttable or factual presumption, we find no error in this charge.</p>

Since the testimony of the interrogating officer was that the appellant’s statement was freely given, and because his testimony was uncontradicted, the jury had no facts before it to justify a conclusion that the appellant’s statement was involuntary. Viewed in this context, the court properly removed the issue of voluntariness from the consideration of the jury without doing violence to Rule 323(j) or the holdings of <em>Heckaihorn </em>and <em>McLean.</em>
