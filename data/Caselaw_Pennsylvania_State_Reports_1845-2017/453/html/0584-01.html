As to the adoption of this doctrine, it has been observed: “. . . the only similarity between the situation in New England and the Russell case lay in the fact that the defendants were counties. The New England county was incorporated, had a corporate fund and the means of enlarging it by taxation and was charged by statute with the duty of keeping highways in repair. Under the authority of Russell v. Devon, therefore, practically no reason for immunity can be found in these circumstances to exist, yet the Massachusetts court passed judgment for the defendant on the unconvincing ground that the county was a <em>quasi</em>eorporation created by the legislature for purposes of public policy and not voluntarily, like a city, and that as a State agency it was therefore immune. This poor<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>ly reasoned decision, based upon a case which contradicts rather than sustains it, has been followed very generally in New England and has become the ‘common law’ of the states of the United States, with few exceptions.” Borchard, supra at 42 (footnote omitted). “On such slender grounds have rested thousands of decisions requiring the assumption by the injured parties of damages inflicted by public corporations.” Stason, supra at 1321.</p>

Empirically, there is little support for the concern that the courts will be flooded with litigation if the doctrine is abandoned.

Rev. 1 (1959); Fuller and Casner, Municipal Tort Liability in Operation, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20437" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="54 Harv. L.

Brodsky, </em>supra at 412, 261 A. 2d at 89, is applicable here: “. . . more compelling than an academic debate over the apparent or real increases in the amount of litigation, is the fundamental concept of our judicial system that any such increase should not be determinative or relevant to the availability of a judicial forum for the adjudication of impartial individual rights. ‘It is the business of the law to remedy wrongs that deserve it, even at the expense of a “flood of litigation”; and it is a pitiful confession of incompetence on the part of any court of justice to deny relief upon the ground that it will give the courts too much work to do.’ Prosser, Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering: A New Tort, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20874" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="37 Mich. L. Rev. 874">37 Mich. L. Rev. 874</a> (1939). We obviously do not accept the ‘too much work to do’ rationale. We place the responsibility exactly where it should be: not in denying relief to those who have been injured, <em>but on </em>the judicial machinery of the Commonwealth to fulfill its obligation to malee itself available to litigants. Who is to say which class of aggrieved plaintiffs should be denied access to our courts because of speculation that the workload will be a burden? Certainly this Court is unwill<a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>ing to allow such considerations to influence a determination whether a class of litigants will be denied or permitted to seek adjudication of its claims.” (Emphasis in original.)</p>

      <p id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[185,1154,1148,353]]]'> The notion that the immunity of the school district is linked to the sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth and that, therefore, only the Legislature may act, is a notion without present vitality. Underlying this assumption is the theory that there is a distinction between municipal corporations and quasi-corporations, the latter being agents of the Commonwealth and, thus, entitled to the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the Commonwealth. See <em>Ford v. School District, </em>supra note 3.</p>
      <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.6",657,[183,1521,1149,446]]]'>We expressly rejected this theory in <em>Morris v.

      <p id="b657-6" data-blocks='[["BL_657.7",657,[185,1980,1148,303]]]'>Thus, municipal corporations and quasi-corporations are on an equal level with regard to immunity. The immunity of both these types of governmental units was judicially created and may be judicially abolished. Whatever may be the need for legislative action in the area of sovereign immunity, it is clear that there is no requirement for legislative action to abolish—as we do here—the immunity of municipal corporations and quasi-corporations.</p>
