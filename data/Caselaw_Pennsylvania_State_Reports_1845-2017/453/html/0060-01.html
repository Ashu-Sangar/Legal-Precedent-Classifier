Its corporate purpose, as expressed in the articles of incorporation, is the “conducting and operating [of] a hospital and dispensary; and in connection therewith carrying on such educational, philanthropic and scientific activities as are incidental to hospital work. . . Pursuant to these goals, the Hospital since 1957 has sought increasingly to integrate its operations into the activities of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, of which it became an affiliate in 1969. The Hospital is also a formal corporate member of the University Health Center.</p>

During this same period, he was also on the Active Staff of the Department of Medicine, possessing the same rights and privileges as all other staff physicians, specifically all other staff cardiologists. As director of the Laboratory, appellant was the only cardiologist on the Hospital staff authorized to perform cardiac catheterizations and related procedures, except cardioversions and the installation <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>of pacemakers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Although four other qualified cardiologists were on the staff, all their patients who required catheterizations were referred to appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The establishment of the Laboratory in 1963, its subsequent expansion, and finally its restructuring on a full-time basis in 1969 were part of the evolution of Montefiore from a community hospital to a major teaching institution responsible for the training of medical students, interns and residents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Contemporaneously with these changes, many of the physicians employed on a part-time basis to direct the specialty units and laboratories were replaced with full-time physicians.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> After the part-time employees were replaced, they were <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>no longer permitted to perform the specialized procedures pertaining to their units, even though they continued to be fully qualified to do so. This was true also with respect to the Laboratory, with the result that appellant was not allowed access to it to perform procedures therein even though such procedures were with respect to his own patients. The prior policy and practice established under Dr. Adler’s regime as director was thus continued under Dr. Curtiss’ directorship. It is this policy of exclusivity, not his discharge as an employee of the Hospital, which appellant challenges as unlawful.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[193,979,1157,865]]]'>At the same time that appellant’s employment with the Laboratory was terminated, he was hired as the salaried, part-time chief of Montefiore’s Coronary Care Unit. On March 1, 1970, he was relieved of these duties for alleged failure to follow hospital rules, attempts to subvert the system, failure to fulfill teaching commitments, and removal of expensive equipment from the premises without authorization. Again, this discharge is not here challenged. Eight months after his replacement as Director of the Laboratory, and during a period when his position with the Coronary Care Unit was in jeopardy, appellant requested a hearing before the Joint Conference Committee of the Hospital, as permitted by the Hospital by-laws, on the ground that his exclusion from the Laboratory amounted to a reduction of privileges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The request was denied.</p>

Potential complications include, among others, death, serious infections, cardiac complications, and serious bleeding.

Based upon voluminous expert testimony, he concluded that this practice improves patient care, the teaching program and efficient administration in the following ways: (1) as the procedures are essentially team functions, the members are able to develop a routine as well as a familiarity with the equipment and its utilization by a particular physician; (2) full-time presence at the Hospital by the operator permits optimal patient care because complications can be treated by the physician who performed the procedure; (3) physician competence can be maintained only by the performance of at least three cardiac catheterizations per week, and in a low volume laboratory such as Montefiore’s this can be assured only by restricting performance to the full-time director; (4) a full-time physician-director has the extra time necessary to teach effectively the many medical students, interns and residents who utilize the Laboratory as a basic learning tool; (5) scheduling problems are reduced when it is not necessary to attempt to accommodate practitioners on the staff who have outside commit<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>ments; (6) procedures should be scheduled when possible in the morning so that the performing physician can be available in the afternoon should complications arise; (7) a full-time director insures that the nonprofessional but essential administrative details of operating a laboratory will be performed by a physician; were the director’s volume of procedures reduced by allowing others to perform them, it would be extremely difficult to obtain a qualified cardiologist willing to assume the administrative functions; (8) equipment breakdowns and lack of reliability are minimized by limiting equipment utilization to a single physician; and (9) appellee has a substantial and legitimate interest in insuring the optimal performance of its employees and use of equipment because it is liable for negligently caused injuries.</p>

The amount of involvement must be measured by the facts of each particular case. The parties in the case at bar stipulated, and the chancellor accepted without question, that “[b]y reason of the affiliation with a state-related university [the University of Pittsburgh] and the financial support from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Federal Government, Montefiore Hospital is a public institution and the conduct and actions of Montefiore Hospital are ‘state actions’ within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.” Although we do not consider that this legal conclusion to which the parties agreed is necessarily binding on the courts having responsibility to render a decision in this action, we do not consider it necessary to question it in this case. For assuming, without deciding, that the Hospital’s policy complained of does constitute state action, we conclude that it does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> We deem it appropriate, nevertheless, to mention briefly what appear to us to be the relevant aspects <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>of the question of when a hospital can be considered to be “public” for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

No representation has been made to us of any dissatisfaction of Dr. Adler’s patients with the challenged restriction at the cardiac Laboratory, nor has there been any argument that this appellant has standing to represent his patients as a class in this litigation. Putting those important points aside, however, the record fails to show any impairment of the physician-patient relationship. The task facing a hospital which attempts to provide comprehensive medical services is complex. Under the regulations in force at Montefiore, similar to those of other like hospitals, one’s personal physician is not the operator in various areas of diagnosis and care, including radiology, pathology, anesthesiology, the coronary care unit, and the nuclear medicine unit, as well as the Laboratory here in question. To require that the procedures administered in these departments shall be performed by hospi<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>tal-designated operators is not to deny the appellant or any other qualified staff physician the right to treat his patient in the hospital, or the corresponding right of a patient to the choice and general services of his own physician, See, <em>Benell v.

The Minnesota Supreme Court upheld such a practice on grounds that it (1) was advocated by the American College of Radiologists as being in the best interests of hospitals, patients, and physicians generally; (2) did not interfere with the right of the qualified physician to treat his patient in the hospital; and (3) was part of the general advancement in medical specialization designed to protect patient safety and the hospital from negligence liability. <em>Benell v.

We are not certain of the equivalence of the two organizations in regard to the two branches of medicine involved, but in any event do not consider the non-advocacy of the Heart Association in any way determinative. Expert testimony adduced at trial in favor of the full-time director concept, although possibly not as authoritative as the formal recommendation of a professional board, at least shows that a large proportion of cardiologists do favor the practice challenged here. In addition, as with radiology, the performance of procedures within a cardiology laboratory is essentially diagnostic in nature and does not interfere with the right of the physician to prescribe for and treat his patient. Although the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>Laboratory procedures are performed only by the Director, a specialist, the physician-staff member in the final analysis controls what is to be done, the interpretation of the tests, and the treatment. Finally, the Hospital’s expert evidence underscored the essential differences between x-ray or cardiovascular laboratory procedures, where full-time team functioning is favored, and surgical operations, where they are not. According to Dr. Richard Gorlin, Chief of the Cardiovascular Division and Associate Professor of Medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston: “An analogy is often erroneously made with a surgical operating team: during general surgery, however, the number of maneuvers are stylized and set for each team member such as Operating Nurse, and apply to all participating doctors. In a catheterization laboratory the number of technicians, nurses, etc., is multiple and varying in applications—doctor idiosyncrasy is greater including type of equipment and its operation, modes of physiological measurement or of angiographic data retrieval. Furthermore, patient crises are manifold running the gamut from pain and discomfort to cardiac arrest and death.” A second expert, Dr. James Leonard, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of the Cardiology Division of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, testifed that whereas general surgery depends primarily upon, the surgeon himself, procedures in a cardiac laboratory, like a “moon shot”, are highly dependent upon sophisticated equipment requiring a large team and full-time people to assure quality control for the entire operation. Even in surgical procedures, however, according to Dr. Leonard, the trend is toward full-time teams, due to the increasing use of complicated equipment such as the heart-lung machine.</p>

To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it ... . Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law—rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to their benefits. . . .” <a href="/us/408/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="408 U.S. 564" data-case-ids="1782964" data-case-paths="/us/408/0564-01">408 U.S. at 576-77</a>, <a href="/us/408/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="408 U.S. 564" data-case-ids="1782964" data-case-paths="/us/408/0564-01">33 L.

As in <em>Board of </em>Regents, where the teacher’s contract supported no possible claim of entitlement to reemployment, so here, appellant’s position on the medical staff provides no basis for his claim to Laboratory privileges. His rights to admit pat'cuts and to prescribe treatment, and the remainder of the cluster of privileges accorded to all staff members, have in no way been diminished, but remain in all respects equal to those of other staff members.

Board of Governors, </em><a href="/ad/286/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="286 A.D. 542" data-case-ids="2893619" data-case-paths="/ad/286/0542-01">286 App. Div. 542</a>, 547, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20N.Y.S.2d%20534" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="145 N.Y.S.2d 534">145 N.Y.S. 2d 534</a>, 538 (1955). “Hospital officials are properly vested with large measures of managing discretion and to the extent that they exert their efforts toward the elevation of hospital standards and higher medical cax*e, they will receive broad judicial support. <em>But they must never lose sight of the fact that the hospitals are operated not for private ends but for the benefit of the public, mid that their existence is for the purpose of faithfully furnishing facilities to the members of the medical profession in aid of their service to the public. </em>They must recognize that their powers, . . . are powers in trust which are always to be dealt with as such. While rea<a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>sonable and constructive exercises of judgment should be honored, courts would indeed be remiss if they declined to intervene where, as here, the powers were invoked ... to preclude ...

    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[151,775,1149,692]]]'>It must be emphasized again that: “[t]he question before the court in the instant case is an important one from the standpoint of the public. In many communities in this state there is only one hospital serving public and private patients alike. It, therefore, does not appear to me that a hospital commission, or hospital board, operating such a public hospital should be able by resolution to deprive the patient of the right to be attended by a doctor of medicine of his own choice, when such doctor is duly licensed and is admittedly a competent and qualified member of the medical staff of such a hospital.” <em>Benell, </em>supra at 570-71, <a href="/minn/258/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="258 Minn. 559" data-case-ids="341239" data-case-paths="/minn/258/0559-01">104 N.W. 2d at 640</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>
