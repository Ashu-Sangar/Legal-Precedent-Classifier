Const, art. I, §11. I am obliged to agree with the Chief Justice that because of this provision “no other conclusion is possible than that it falls to the Legislature to determine the circumstances under which immunity must be waived.” Opinion of the Court, ante at 571. I also agree with the statement in the opinion of Mr. Justice O’Bkien in <em>Biello, </em>supra, that “this [constitutional] language has <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>consistently been interpreted to mean tbat no suit may be maintained against tbe state in tort until the legislature specifically has provided for such an action”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> By the same token, I cannot agree with my brother Nix, dissenting in <em>Biello </em>and repeating that dissent here, that the constitutional provision above quoted does not place a limitation on the power of the judiciary to act in the premises. When by their Constitution the people of Pennsylvania have expressly delegated to the legislative branch of government the task of determining in what manner and in what court and in what cases the Commonwealth may be subjected to suit (and, implioity, to the liability that may result therefrom), I fail to see how this Court can properly hold that it has a right to preempt this legislative function. A proposition that had its ancient origin in the common law of England and colonial America was elevated to constitutional status in Pennsylvania as long ago as 1790. To ignore this development would be to warp <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>the plain meaning of the Constitution to suit societal ends which now, one hundred and eighty-three years later, the entire membership of this Court thinks are much to be desired. We may lament the legislative failure to correct before the present date an inequitable situation, but impatience should not cause us to upset the balance of power in our tripartite system of government by making the correction ourselves. To do so would be judicial action of a quite different order from that which I thought proper in Laughner, supra, and which the Court is today taking in <em>Ayala.</em>

It must be emphasized, however, that of the twenty states taking this action, twelve have done so either by constitutional provision or by statute.

Each of the past decisions of this Court have <em>pronounced </em>the existence of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and then cited a previous case in support of the <em>pronouncement. </em>One would expect that a search through the precedents, containing the <em>pronouncement </em>followed by a prior citation, would eventually lead to the origin of the judicial chain and a discovery that the chain is solidly anchored in principles worthy of government established by a <em>written constitution. </em>Such a discovery cannot be found in the past decisions of this Court. Those decisions have assumed that the <em>sovereign is the state </em>and that the state possesses inherent and inalienable rights—the exact principles of government guillotined and buried in the human revolutions that gave birth to <em>written constitutions.</em>

      <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>Article 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is titled the <em>Declaration of Bights. </em>The entire Article is concerned with establishing the principle that the people are the sovereign—not the state. There are twenty-six sections in Article 1 and every single section is concerned with the rights of the people—not the state. To isolate one sentence out of the twenty-six sections in the <em>Declaration of Bights </em>and say that it should be interpreted to protect the rights of the state—not the people—is ludicrous and violates all reasonable principles of construing written language in proper context. Article 1, the <em>Declaration of Bights, </em>opens by stating that the purpose of the <em>Declaration </em>is “that the general, great and essential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and unalterably established.” Nothing is said about protecting the state. The complete Declaration—its language, tone and thrust—concerns the protection of the people— not the state.</p>

It states that all power <em>is inherent in the people, </em>and all free governments are founded <em>on their </em>authority—not that power is inherent in the state or that government is founded on the authority of a divinity or an unwritten floating concept in a judge’s mind. The <em>Declaration </em>states that no one <em>can be deprived of his life, liberty, or property, unless by the judgment of Ms peers or the law of the </em>land—not that the state’s life, liberty or property is protected. It also says that <em>private property </em>shall not be taken <em>without just compensation being first made or </em>secured—and there is no exception for any kind of property. The people are protected from <em>any grant of special privileges or immunities </em>by the state. The people are given the right to the <em>redress of </em>grievances— no exception for tort claims or any other claim.

It protects everyone—without exception—for all injuries —without exception. It specifically speaks of injuries to <em>lands, goods, person or reputation. </em>The first sentence says that everyone <em>shall have remedy </em>by due course of law—it does not say that sometimes there is a remedy and sometimes not. The sentence states that right and justice shall be administered <em>without . . . </em>denial—it does not say justice can be denied sometimes and sometimes not. The first sentence of Section 11 must be read before proceeding to sentence two, and that <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>first sentence could not have been written in more absolute terms even by one possessing divine rights. Can we possibly destroy the absolutely plain meaning of sentence one by an interpretation of sentence two, which requires a reach outside the people’s <em>written constitution. </em>The <em>written constitution </em>contains no mention of immunity for the state—or inherent rights of the state—or inalienable rights of the state—or indefeasible rights of the state. It is thus necessary for the majority to begin its interpretation of sentence two by reaching <em>outside the icritten constitution. </em>Just where that reach extends, we are not told.</p>

The full phrase is “in such manner, in such courts and in such cases. . . .” If the focus is on the complete phrase, or the complete sentence, or the complete Section, or the complete Article, the majority’s interpretation cannot stand. The majority’s interpretation depends upon a focus centered on three words—ignoring the phrase in which they appear— ignoring the sentence in which they appear—ignoring the Section in which they appear—and ignoring the Article in which they appear, all of which is called the <em>Declaration of Rights </em>for the protection of the people— who are the sovereign.</p>
