Pierce was convicted by a jury in Delaware County of the crimes of murder in the second degree and conspiracy.

Anticipating trouble, he picked up two rifles at the home of his sister; one a single shot which he gave to a companion, James L. Doehery, and the other a repeating rifle which he kept himself. About 9:30 p.m., Pierce and Doehery saw five boys walking across a field and approaching the Euth Bennett Project. Pierce first fired three shots from his rifle at some street lights and when the “five boys” turned and started to run away from the project, Pierce aimed the gun in their direction and fired “wildly” into the group. One of the group, Emanuel Hughes, age fifteen years, was hit in the abdomen by a bullet and fatally wounded.</p>

The record shows the following occurred during the questioning of a witness: “Defense Counsel: Do you know if Tony also called the hospital? District Attorney: I object. That is not relevant. The Court: What difference does that malee whether he did or did not? District Attorney: He should have thought of that before he shot him. Defense Counsel: I ask for a Mistrial, Tour Honor. The Court: Overruled. I will grant you an exception.” Although we do not condone such a statement by the prosecuting attorney, we do not deem the incident sufficient to warrant a new trial. The remark was consistent with the evidence which had already been presented and did not add any new evidence to the trial, and was not of the nature to truly inflame or prejudice the jury or to have the unavoidable effect of prejudicing the jury to the extent that they would have a fixed bias in their minds, so they could not objectively weigh the evidence and render a true verdict.

A ballistics expert stated testing disclosed one of these rifles, a single shot .22 caliber rifle, had six lands and six grooves, and that the other, a “Mossburg” automatic .22 caliber rifle had eight lands and eight grooves. [It was undisputed at trial that the rifle in the possession of Pierce at the time involved was the “Mossburg.”] The witness testified, while the bullet recovered from the body of the victim during the autopsy, was a .22 caliber rifle bullet with eight lands and eight grooves, he was not able to testify conclusively that this bullet was fired from the “Mossburg”, because the striae on the bullet had been obliterated. However, he said the bullet was fired from a rifle with eight lands and eight grooves and he was, therefore, certain it was not shot from the single shot rifle with six lands and six grooves. Over objection, the witness was then permitted to say that in his opinion the bullet was fired from the “Mossburg.” The ruling permitting this expression of opinion is urged as error. We are not so persuaded.</p>

The expert witness testified he was “certain” the bullet which killed the victim was not fired from the single shot rifle, and Pierce’s brief states this testimony presents “no problem.” In view of this, the court certainly did not err in permitting the witness to express the challenged opinion. Moreover, the opinion expressed by the witness involved ivas not inadmissible merely because he was unable to state “conclusively” the bullet was fired by the “Mossburg.” Cf. <em>Bialek v.
