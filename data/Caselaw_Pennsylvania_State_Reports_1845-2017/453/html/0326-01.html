Smith and his companion were placed in a police vehicle and directed to empty their pockets. This disclosed Smith was in possession of two bags of heroin. The sole legal issue is whether or not the evidence of possession of the heroin should have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>To sustain its burden of establishing probable cause for the arrest here, the Commonwealth at the suppression hearing relied completely on the testimony of one of the arresting officers. He stated a reliable informant telephoned and informed him that while he was drinking in a bar with two Negro males he “found out” they had narcotics in their possession. The informant did not tell the officer how he “found out.” The officer then proceeded to the bar with another officer and when the informant pointed to Smith and his companion as they left the bar, the arrest ensued.</p>
    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[206,926,1156,318]]]'>Probable cause may be based on hearsay information, but this information must include sufficient underlying circumstances to permit an objective determination that the information is credible. Conclusory statements on the part of the informant are not enough. See <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em><a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">378 U.S. 108</a>, <a href="/us/378/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="378 U.S. 108" data-case-ids="6165107" data-case-paths="/us/378/0108-01">84 S.

The Commonwealth argues that “there are only two ways this could have happened: either he saw the narcotics, or one of the two defendants told him he had narcotics.” This ignores that it is just as possible the informant gained the information from a third <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>party or from overhearing conversations among patrons in the bar. Contingencies such as those last mentioned would not provide a valid basis for prohable cause. A police officer may not delegate the determination of the reliability of a potential secondary informant to tbe primary informant. <em>Commonwealth v.

United States, </em><a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">supra,</a> at 417 n. 5, <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">89 S. Ct. at </a>590 n. 5. Specifically, the Supreme Court has held that “less stringent standards for reviewing the officer’s discretion in effecting a warrantless arrest and search would discourage resort to the procedures for obtaining a warrant. Thus, the standards applicable to the factual basis supporting the officer’s probable-cause assessment at the time of the challenged arrest and search are at least as stringent as the standards applied with respect to the magistrate’s assessment.” <em>Whiteley v.
