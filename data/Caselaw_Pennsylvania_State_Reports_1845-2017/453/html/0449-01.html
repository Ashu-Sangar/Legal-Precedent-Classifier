In discussing an alleged meeting with appellant, Detective McGreevey stated: “After I parked the car Mr. Clark handed me a pack of bills stating, ‘There is four there.’ I placed the bills in my pocket. He said he was sorry he couldn’t meet <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>me on Friday, but that he was busy and had to go out of town. We talked over the situation on the street, he stated that everything was all right and the same two men were dealing for him. I asked him if he knew a Clarence Rose; <em>he stated that he was in prison with him and knew him well. </em>When I told him that Clarence told me that he wanted to work for Alvin, he stated that it was not true.’ ” (Emphasis added.) A prompt request for a mistrial was denied, no cautionary instructions were given. It is argued that this testimony allowed the jury to infer that the appellant had a prior criminal record. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[206,975,1157,1124]]]'>As this Court has recently stated: “It is a fundamental precept of the common law that the prosecution may not introduce evidence of the defendant’s prior criminal conduct as substantive evidence of his guilt of the present charge. It has been succinctly stated that ‘[t]he purpose of this rule is to prevent the conviction of an accused for one crime by the use of evidence that he has committed other unrelated crimes, and to preclude the inference that because he has committed other crimes he was more likely to commit that crime for which he is being tried. The presumed effect of such evidence is to predispose the minds of the jurors to believe the accused guilty, and thus effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.’ ” <em>Commonwealth v.

Other than these limited exceptions, the admission of evidence indicating defendant’s prior criminal record has been firmly resisted in Pennsylvania. Therefore, if the testimony can be fairly characterized as conveying to the jury, either expressly or by reasonable implication, the fact of prior criminal offenses, a reversal of a verdict of guilt must result in the event that the Commonwealth is unable to establish that the evidence was within one of the recognized exceptions.</p>

Unlike a mere passing reference to an arrest or a lineup, the fact that appellant had been placed “in prison” strongly infers that there has beeji a conviction. Moreover, we cannot find, nor has <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>the Commonwealth suggested, any legitimate evidentiary purpose which would justify the introduction of this highly prejudicial remark.
