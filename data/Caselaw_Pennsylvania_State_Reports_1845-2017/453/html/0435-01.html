    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[174,701,1150,362]]]'>On December 18, 1959, two police officers, acting pursuant to an anonymous phone call, went to the residence of a Mr. and Mrs. Donald Newman in Philadelphia and discovered the dead body of Mr. Newman buried under earth in the basement. A medical examination disclosed death was caused by a gunshot wound of the thorax.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.6",493,[171,1083,1151,533]]]'>Later the same day, Homer and Mrs. Newman were taken into police custody in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and following questioning Homer made a statement, which was recorded, wherein he admitted shooting Newman, but stated he acted in self-defense. Homer completely absolved Mrs. Newman of any complicity. Prior to making the above statement, Horner was advised that anything he said could be used against him in court, but he was not advised he could have the assistance of counsel during the questioning.</p>
    <p id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.7",493,[165,1625,1152,536]],["BL_494.1",494,[185,331,1155,696]]]'>On December 19, 1959, Homer was given a preliminary hearing before a committing magistrate. He was not represented by counsel, nor was he advised he could have such assistance. At this hearing the district attorney called Horner as a Commonwealth witness and, after warning him that he did not have to testify and anything he said could be used against him in the event he was held for trial, asked Horner to “tell us what happened.” “Do you understand the warning?” After Homer indicated he understood the warning, the dis<a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>trict attorney again asked, “Do you want to tell us what happened? Tell us what happened?” Homer’s testimony was consistent with his statement given to the police the day before. During his testimony, Horner was asked specific questions by the district attorney about his relationship and conduct with Mrs. Newman and the events leading up to the killing. He was also asked about the truthfulness and voluntariness of the statement he made to the police. Homer admitted the voluntariness of the statement and affirmed its truthfulness. At the conclusion of the hearing, Homer was committed to jail to await action by the grand jury.</p>
    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[183,1039,1158,533]]]'>In the days that immediately followed, the police continued to question Horner and told him Mrs. Newman had changed her story. On December <em>23, </em>1959, Homer was again questioned by a police detective and confronted with a written statement given the police by Mrs. Newman. In this statement Mrs. Newman said she and Horner plotted her husband’s death for a month, and Homer shot her husband as he lay asleep in bed. Homer then admitted Mrs. Newman’s statement was true and he signed it.</p>

However, he stated he gave the gun to Mrs. Newman and she did the shooting in a second floor bedroom while he was in the living room on the first floor.

Accepting that the use of the entry of a guilty plea at a preliminary hearing is not the same as utilizing the testimony of the accused that he shot and killed a person in self-defense, nonetheless, prejudice did result to Horner by the trial use of his testimony at the preliminary hearing, and this prejudice renders the preliminary hearing a “critical stage.” Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

New York, </em><a href="/us/401/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="401 U.S. 222" data-case-ids="11712077" data-case-paths="/us/401/0222-01">401 U.S. 222</a>, <a href="/us/401/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="401 U.S. 222" data-case-ids="11712077" data-case-paths="/us/401/0222-01">91 S.

Here, we are faced with the use of pretrial testimony given under oath. We agree with the court en banc below that the two situations are vitally different. In this connection, the court said: “The adverse use of testimony given by defendant at a preliminary hearing without advice of counsel is far more prejudicial to him than the use of a statement given to the police without the required Miranda warnings because that testimony is given under oath in open court before an impartial magistrate rather than at a police station to a policeman interested in gathering evidence and without an oath. A statement given to the police is more vulnerable to attack as made under duress or from fear and without full knowledge and understanding of an individual’s constitutional rights than testimony given at a public preliminary hearing. A jury is more likely to believe that the individual’s will was overborne by the interrogation of police officers than by questioning of a district attorney governed by the rules of evidence. Consequently, the use of such testimony on cross-examination has a significantly greater impact than a similar use of an incriminating statement. The impact distinguishes the use, on cross-examination, of testimony given at an uncounseled preliminary hearing from the similar use permitted by Harris, of an incriminating statement taken without the required Miranda warnings.”</p>

      <em>White </em>arose under a Maryland procedure which permitted (but did not require) the defendant at a preliminary hearing to enter a plea to the charges against him. In that case the defendant, uncounseled, entered a plea of guilty and later, counseled, withdrew the plea, entered a plea of not guilty, and proceeded to trial, only to he impeached by his uncounseled guilty plea at the preliminary hearing.

Here, however, Horner recognized that his version of the facts did constitute a defense. He was not precluded <em>hy Pennsylvania procedure </em>from iater asserting a different defense at trial. The only penalty would be that which always arises when one decides to change one’s story.</p>

Horner had already given a signed statement to Philadelphia police in which he asserted self-defense. Mrs. Newman’s story was consistent with that claim. It having been thus asserted in a signed statement, a competent attorney might well have advised Horner to continue his self-defense claim at the preliminary hearing.</p>
      <p id="b503-7" data-blocks='[["BL_503.8",503,[165,1609,1149,402]]]'>The reason Horner was obliged to abandon self-defense at trial was that after the preliminary hearing, the wife (Mrs. Newman) changed her story to one of conspiracy to murder with Horner as the killer, and then pleaded guilty to murder. No jury would believe self-defense when the paramour had acknowledged guilt. The prejudice arises logically not from the absence of counsel, but rather from the refusal of the wife to remain constant in her earlier account of the killing. For the inconstancy of accomplices the law provides no remedy.</p>

Guerin, Esquire, testified that he and Judge Meade [who together were defense counsel at Horner’s trial] did not object to the admission of the statements because they concluded that defendant gave the statements voluntarily.” If that is so, I would be doubly certain that the voluntariness issue does not warrant a new trial.</p>
