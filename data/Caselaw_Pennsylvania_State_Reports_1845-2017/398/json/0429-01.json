By stipulation of counsel, the matter was heard by the court below on the record made before the board of adjustment upon the applicant\u2019s appeal thereto from the zoning officer\u2019s revocation of the permit which he had originally issued. Additional testimony was not taken by the court. No beneficial purpose can be served by reciting the facts adduced before the board of adjustment. We fully agree with the court below that the board of adjustment was not guilty of either a manifest abuse of discretion or of an error of law.\nOrder affirmed.",
