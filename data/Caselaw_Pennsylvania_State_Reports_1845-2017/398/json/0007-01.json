There, we affirmed the order of the court below dismissing the relator\u2019s petition, on the opinion of President Judge Sheely, of the 51st Judicial District, specially presiding, reported in 13 Pa. D. & C. 2d 57 et seq.\nThe relator is confined in the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, where he is serving a life sentence for a felonious homicide for which he was convicted of murder in the first degree. The facts attending the killing are fully reported in the above-mentioned opinion of Judge Sheely in 13 Pa. D. & C. 2d 57.\nThe petition of the relator, which initiated the instant proceeding in the court below, advanced several additional reasons for the granting of the writ sought. These contentions are satisfactorily and adequately disposed of in a further opinion of Judge Sheely, whereon we affirm.\nOrder affirmed.",
