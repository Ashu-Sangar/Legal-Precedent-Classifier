Justice Bok,\nThe decree, as modified below, is affirmed on the opinion of President Judge Campbell, of the court below.\nThe decedent\u2019s widow, who is the administratrix c.t.a., is surcharged with one-half of the profits from the business from the death of the decedent to the liquidation of the business. The court below properly found that the widow and William C. Ginter, exceptant, should share the said profits, but overlooked ordering the surcharge. The figure of $6501.74 for the profits was agreed upon at argument, the items comprising it having been thrown into the general account.\nThe amount surcharged, $3250.87, shall be paid to the said William C. Ginter, exceptant.\nCosts shall be paid by the estate.",
