At that time he was going to high school, and after school, with the permission of the then owner of 46 South 52nd Street (which is on the Northwest corner of 52nd and Chestnut Streets), he would sell his newspapers from a small wagon located on the sidewalk. After he had been working there for three months, he asked the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin for a newsstand which was set up on the corner. Originally, it was about four feet long, five and a half feet high and about twenty-four inches wide. Since then he has gradually added various racks, additional stands and benches so that at the time of the commencement of the present action in equity in November, 1956, the newsstand was comprised of two newspaper stands, several benches and racks and a magazine stand, all of which were approximately 9 feet <em>4% </em>inches long and 6 feet 3 inches high. There are sold on defendant’s newsstand six or seven newspapers, approximately 300 different magazines and many kinds of comic books and pocket books and several racing forms. Approximately 40% of the physical space of the newsstand is devoted to the sale of newspapers and 60% to magazines, comic books and pocket books. A little more than 50% of the gross in<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>come of the newsstand is derived from the sale of newspapers, the balance from the sale of the other printed matter.</p>

In that year defendant Manlin requested and received permission from the <em>then </em>owner of 46 South 52nd Street to operate a small newsstand about 4 feet long, 24 inches wide and 5% feet high. Since then Manlin has gradually added various racks, additional stands and benches to his original newsstand, so that at the time of the com<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>mencement of the present action in November 1956, Manlin’s original newsstand was extended to include two newspaper stands, several benches and racks, and a magazine stand, which measured 9 feet 4% inches in length, 4 feet 1 inch in width, and 6 feet 3 inches in height. Manlin sells from this newsstand six or seven different newspapers, approximately 300 different magazines, various comic books, many pocket books, and several racing forms. Approximately 40% of the physical space of the newsstand is devoted to the sale of newspapers, and 60% to magazines, comic books and pocket books. The newsstand is located on the northwest corner of 52nd and Chestnut Streets which has a sidewalk 14 feet 8 inches in width. The present newsstand occupies approximately 40% of the width of the sidewalk which is owned by plaintiffs, and over which the public has an easement of travel.</p>

Manlin’s newsstand was directly in front of plaintiffs’ show or display window. Plaintiffs spend $5,000 annually for decorating and arranging displays in this window. Shortly after the window was built, plaintiffs demanded that defendant Manlin remove his newsstand. Manlin does not pay and never has paid any rent to anyone for the privilege of erecting or maintaining his newsstand which he expects to sell for several thousand dollars. This is a heavily traveled corner — in addition to the traveling and buying pedestrian traffic, there is a bus stop in front of plaintiffs’ property and 145 buses, as well as very many automobiles, pass by plaintiffs’ property during each day.</p>

Public convenience creates no legal right. Public convenience and public necessity, which are used interchangeably by defendant and the amici curiae, are neither actually nor legally synonymous. This is one of their many misconceptions. The majority does not fall into the same error. The City in a justifiable exer<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>cise of the <em>police power, </em>erects or permits for the benefit of the general public, fire hydrants, fire and police boxes, mail boxes, utility poles, parking meters, wastepaper receptacles and traffic signals. These are obviously public necessities; they are for the benefit of the general public; they exist for the safety or health and benefit of the public; they are not monopolistic and exclusionary; and property owners do not and cannot object or complain. They are clearly distinguishable from a monopolistic and exclusionary newsstand which serves primarily the private interest of the owner of the newsstand and only incidentally the convenience of the public (at a few locations at rush hours), and as the majority admits, is certainly not a public necessity. Manlin and others overlook the crucial fact that when a news vendor asserts a right to maintain a permanent newsstand upon the sidewalk, he is not claiming or making <em>public </em>use of the sidewalk <em>in common with all other members of the public, </em>but he is claiming an absolute and exclusionary right to appropriate a particular segment of the sidewalk for his own private and exclusive use and profit. The newspaper public can be adequately served by buying at nearby stores, hotels, stations, etc., and by several newsboys selling on or near any busy street corner (or any other location), instead of by an exclusionary monopolistic “grab” of one or more busy corners by one owner of one or a number of newsstands, or by a municipal grant to one or a few newsboys to erect and maintain a newsstand on the property of a private citizen in violation (1) of the Constitutional rights of the property owner, and (2) of the rights of every other Philadelphia newsboy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_13" id="ref_footnote_2_13">*</a>

Since when has competition become anathema in America? Haven’t any other newsboys except the owner of a trespassing newsstand any right to sell newspapers upon the public sidewalks, or is that corner <em>and all the neighboring public sidewalk </em>reserved solely for the owner (or in this case the absentee owner) of a newsstand?

The Code prohibits from the sidewalks all goods, wares and merchandise in certain designated areas of Philadelphia, but (in §9-205) exempts from its application “the display, offering for sale and sale of books, magazines and newspapers, and the placing and maintenance of stands for such articles”. Plaintiffs contend on the other hand, inter alia, (a) that the City must not only grant permission for but must specifically regulate newsstands in order to validate this newsstand; and (b) that the exemption of newsstands from the City’s ordinance is not such an affirmative grant and regulation as to legally authorize the erection of this large permanent newsstand on plaintiffs’ sidewalk. However, I am convinced that the majority has overlooked the two most important rights which are here in issue — (1) the Constitutionally guaranteed right of the owner of the property (the sidewalk) ; and (2) the easement of public passage over City sidewalks, which can be <em>reasonably </em>regulated by City Council only for the public and not for a private interest.</p>

Each in its own sphere or interest is supreme, and neither has a legal right to encroach upon or destroy the other’s interest. For example, a property owner cannot permit or lease a newsstand on his own sidewalk if a newsstand is prohibited by the City in the interest of the traveling public.

If Manlin can sell a so-called privilege or right in a business on a public sidewalk, what is to prevent him from asserting a privilege to cut flowers in a municipal conservatory to vend at a profit?

It goes on to assert that <em>no one </em>has the right to maintain a newsstand at 46 South 52nd Street, and then, like the North Wind, which does not heed its strength, it proceeds to blow all the newsstands in Philadelphia off the streets and sidewalks. The Majority’s ruling in this respect is <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>alarming and shocking. It will invite chaos and turbulence into the orderly business of newspaper vending in Philadelphia; it will encourage a multitude of lawsuits because every property owner whose sidewalk is shadowed by a newsstand, large or small, will now be authorized to oust the newsvendor; it will set off fights between rival newsvendors for the more lucrative street corners; it will raise legal clouds of ambiguity and fogs of uncertainty over all the sidewalks in the cities of Pennsylvania.

That question, incidentally, the Majority has utterly failed to answer. It has not even discussed it. Instead of addressing itself to that issue, it proceeds to enunciate a decision which is wholly extraneous to the proceedings, and, worse yet, decides that extraneous question in a wholly illogical and unconstitutional fashion. The Majority Opinion says: “The decision in <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>this case, thus, boils down to a very narrow issue.

That case decided in 1941 in favor of the defendant newsstand operator rested on the fundamental ground that a newsstand of reasonable size, properly maintained and not located so as to impede traffic, is neither a nuisance nor an unlawful trespass. In the light of this decision it is clear that at least for the past eighteen years the city has taken the position that newsstands are not in need of specific regulation or prohibition. It is not for this Court to inject itself into a matter which is essentially <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>legislative by a holding which would require the city to regulate where it finds that regulation is unnecessary. The Act of April 16, 1838, P. L. 626, §3, 53 P.S. §16436, left it to the City Council to regulate “as to them may seem expedient.” The discretionary power to license or regulate necessarily implies the discretionary power not to license or regulate unless such failure unreasonably interferes with the public interest, thus justifying judicial interference. The fact that Chicago, because of conditions peculiar to it, has seen fit to regulate newsstands does not mean that Philadelphia, where such conditions do not exist, must do likewise unless City Council so decides.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[151,1075,1153,1138]]]'>It is obvious that the long continued custom of maintaining newsstands on the public sidewalks of Philadelphia, <em>fortressed </em>by the ordinances of the city, demonstrates that the legislative arm of city government has considered such newsstands to be appropriate to the implementation of the right of the public voluntarily to conveniently purchase each of the many editions of newspapers. The case in support of magazines, which are not as ephemeral, is not as easy but does not present such difference as would require this Court to hold that the maintenance of a newsstand for the selling of magazines together with newspapers is a nuisance or trespass but that the sale of the latter alone is not. The legislative arm of city government made no such distinction, nor should we. The public should be permitted to enjoy the public easement in a manner that will facilitate distribution of the product of the printing press, not hinder it. The judicial function is ended when it is determined that the maintenance of the newsstand is neither a trespass nor a nuisance as pleaded in the complaint.</p>
