    <p id="b407-8" data-blocks='[["BL_407.11",407,[168,1401,1148,864]]]'>On December 8, 1954, appellant was summoned to appear before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the United States Senate. At this hearing one Thomas, a member of the Communist Party reporting to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, identified appellant as an active Communist Party member and organizer between 1946 and 1952. Both men worked for Bethlehem Steel Company, appellant as a wire driller. When called upon to testify, he took the protection of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and refused to say whether he was or had ever been a Communist or whether he had ever given to the Party information about the internal conditions at Bethlehem Steel. At one point in the hearing he jumped up and shouted that Thomas was a “lying stoolpigeon”.</p>

The Acting Director also sent to Bethlehem Steel a copy of the testimony and a copy of his letter to the Secretary of Defense.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[251,872,1147,363]]]'>On December 14, 1954, the Company sent to appellant a notice reading: “You are hereby suspended and it is the intention of the Company to discharge you five days from the date of this notice.” This was in accordance with the Company’s labor contract.

    <p id="b408-7" data-blocks='[["BL_408.8",408,[250,1693,1146,591]]]'>On December 28, 1954, the hearing was held. It consisted largely of the presiding officer’s offering appellant opportunity to show cause why he should not be discharged and of appellant’s refusing to do so until he had been given proof of the charges. The following statement by him is indicative: “He [Young, who signed the Company’s letter stating the reasons for suspension] accuses me of being a security risk. I say I am not a security risk. And he accuses me of conduct detrimental to the business interests of the Company. I say I am not. Let him prove it.”</p>

    <p id="b409-6" data-blocks='[["BL_409.7",409,[168,1132,1148,639]]]'>On August 2, 1955, arbitration was held under the labor contract upon appellant’s grievance. On August 8th the Arbitrator found that the Company had had just cause to discharge him on the single ground of security. He expressly avoided finding whether the witness Thomas had testified truthfully and based his conclusion of just cause on appellant’s refusal to cooperate with the Senate Committee. At this proceeding appellant specifically denied that he was a Communist on December <em>7, </em>1954, or thereafter, but he invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked whether he had ever been one.</p>

Its reasons were two: (1) appellant refused to furnish information to the Compensation authorities bearing upon his right to compensation; (2) he was guilty of wilful misconduct connected with his work when he refused to answer the charges against him when called upon by his employer to do so.</p>
    <p id="b410-3" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[264,364,1146,593]]]'>
      <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>It is obvious at the outset that no one ever made a finding that the witness Thomas, who identified appellant as a Communist before the Senate Committee, was telling the truth or a lie. The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review adopted the view of the Arbitrator, whose opinion was made an exhibit before the Board. In it he said: “It is not for me to make any finding, any more than did the Subcommittee, or the Company itself after the pre-discharge hearing, as to whether or not the witness Herman Thomas testified truthfully.”</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[265,967,1146,647]]]'>It is therefore painfully apparent that appellant has lost his livelihood and his compensation because he failed to affirm or deny material that may have been truthful, untruthful, or mistaken. The given reason for discharging him and his claim is that he failed to deny, refused to co-operate, refused to furnish information, and refused to answer charges, as it was variously expressed, and such clauses are only different forms of saying that he was turned away because he invoked the Fifth Amendment. It was the form he took to protect himself, and, as the Referee said, he had every right to do so but his doing it also hurt his employer.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[264,1625,1144,88]]]'>The basic question is whether this follows, and we think it does not.</p>

We will discuss it briefly because it bears generally on the basic symposium of due process, but we regard it as a much more sensitive question than whether he should have compensation.</p>

The Board of Review, adopting the Arbitrator’s conclusion, bases its decision on his being a security risk only, but with no shred of established evidence to <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>sustain it. The Superior Court took the other view: appellant refused disclosure and hence wilfully misconducted himself, but without reference to being a security risk.</p>
    <p id="b411-3" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[190,582,1146,205]]]'>The nub is missing, and the nub is legally competent proof. The issue of fact between the testimony of Thomas and appellant’s denial, that Thomas was a lying stoolpidgeon, remains unresolved on the record.</p>
    <p id="b411-4" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[189,799,1147,484]]]'>A more pitiless view of the case is that everyone suspects appellant of being or having been a Communist but no one wants to say so, and it remains a fact suspected but unproved. It has been easier to make a fatal error out of lack of frankness, despite the even chance that either guilt or innocence of Communism may have dictated appellant’s decision to invoke the Amendment. Difficulty of proof has never been allowed as an excuse for dispensing with it.</p>
    <p id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.6",411,[185,1295,1152,744]]]'>That one becomes myopic upon the mere mention of Communism is apparent from reading the opinion of <em>Kelleher v.

The Superior Court said: “Here there is no substantial evidence to support the findings of the compensation authorities to the effect that claimant was ‘absent quite frequently without notice’ . . . The burden was upon the employer to show circumstances which would bring claimant under the condemnation of a disqualifying provision of the Act, and on the record before us it is not clear that it met that burden.”</p>

An employer may discharge an employe for any reason or no reason, absent contractual restrictions. But an unemployed person may not be denied benefits for any reason or no reason: the Act allows denial only for wilful misconduct connected with his work. It is here that the appellee’s argument breaks down. Since a man may be discharged for any reason or no reason, his ensuing right to unemployment benefits is dependent on whether the discharge was for wilful misconduct. The Compensation authorities must show that it was. The Compensation Act requires that otherwise he should get the benefits.

The notice it sent him was to suspend him with the intention of discharging him five days later; this was before a hearing had been arranged. When he asked for one it is not a strain on the imagination to believe that the hearing would be somewhat less than impartial. It may also be noted that appellant met with technical accuracy the statement of the charges against him. He was charged with being a security risk, without proof; he said he was not a security risk, also without proof. He was accused of conduct detri<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>mental to the Company’s interests, but without specification; he denied it also, without specification. It is finally to be noted that the Superior Court accepted as fact the testimony of Thomas, although nowhere is there a finding of its truth.</p>

The Court said: “It was not irrelevant for the employer to ask its employees whether they were members of such a party [i.e., one advocating the overthrow of the government by force], regardless of whether doubts as to their trustworthiness and reliability were raised by the Committee hearings, or by rumor and report.”</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[255,1369,1150,910]]]'>The Maryland Court held that refusal to answer the employer’s questions was wilful misconduct connected with the work and denied unemployment benefits. It then said: “Certainly the suspension was based upon their conduct before the Committee. But their discharge was based on their failure to answer at the Company hearing. If the discharge had been based solely on their conduct before the Committee, we would agree that the refusal to answer there, if misconduct at all, was not misconduct connected with their work. We have so held in a similar case, just decided. Fino v. Maryland Employment Security Board, Md., <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20738" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="147 A.2d 738">147 A. 2d 738</a>. But it seems clear on the record that the Board’s action, and the action of the trial court was predicated on their refusal to answer questions at the Company hearings. That poses a different question, not considered in the Fino case.</p>
