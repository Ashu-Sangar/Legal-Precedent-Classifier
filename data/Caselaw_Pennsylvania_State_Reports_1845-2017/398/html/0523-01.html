The Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County dismissed this objection and entered a decree nisi; exceptions filed thereto were dismissed by a final decree entered July 2, 1958.

From 1925 to 1946 inclusive, the Company contemporaneously with the declaration of each stock dividend, transferred on its books from earned surplus to the capital stock account amounts equal to the established “capital value” of $33.33 per share.</p>

Appellant’s attempt at an equation of a “stock split” and a “stock dividend” in that both result in a “proliferation” of book value was well answered by the court below : “It must be conceded that the income beneficiary’s example outlined above does illustrate that the stock split effects, in a sense, a division of earnings from the stockholder’s point of view. However, this result does not appear to be the type of division and distribution of earnings contemplated by the apportionment cases. After the occurrence of the stock split the earnings of a corporation remain intact in an accumulated earnings account, undisturbed, unaltered, and available for future stock dividends or cash dividends. It is true that more shares of stock represent these identical <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>earnings after a stock split has occurred; but it is only the stock certificates representing the earnings that undergo a split or division, and not the earnings themselves.” A substantial and conclusive difference exists between a “stock split” and a “stock dividend”: in the former, a division of the shares of stock, not of the earnings or profits of the corporation, takes place without any change in or impingement upon the then existing status on the corporate books of the earned surplus and capital accounts; in the latter, an addition of shares of stock and a division of, at least, some of the earnings or profits of the corporation take place, such division being reflected on the corporate books by an irreversible allocation of corporate funds from the earned surplus to the capital account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Although this Court has not directly passed (Cf: <em>Jones Estate, </em><a href="/pa/377/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="377 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1249643" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0473-01">377 Pa. 473</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%20353" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="105 A.2d 353">105 A. 2d 353</a>) upon the apportionability of a “stock split”, the rationale which justifies an apportionment between a life tenant and a remainderman is conspicuously absent in a “stock split” situation, i.e., a division of corporate earnings and profits. In <em>Nirdlinger’s </em>Estate, supra, p. 473, we approved the following language in <em>U. S. Trust Co. v.

      <p id="b687-6" data-blocks='[["BL_687.7",687,[189,853,1149,641]]]'> Appellant has urged that the equities favor the life tenant and that the basic aim of the Pennsylvania Bule has been to make available to life tenants — usually the primary objects of the settlor’s bounty — the earnings accumulated on corporate stock held by a trust. Prom 1933 through 1954 the Company’s total earnings with respect to the shares held by this trust were $1,720,326. The cash dividends ($507,049) and the market value of the stock dividends ($2,111,220) received by the appellant totalled $2,618,268 or $897,942 more than the Company earned on the trust shares. If appellant sold the stocks distributed to him immediately he would have realized this amount; if he retained them, including subsequent stock dividends thereon, he has received from this trust 93,156 shares of the Company’s stock which would have been worth as of December 31, 1954, $6,520,920, absolutely tax free.</p>
