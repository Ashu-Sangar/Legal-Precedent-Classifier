His executors, as trustees, were given power to sell real estate, make deeds and full power and authority to lease, sell or develop all mineral lands, including coal, oil and gas. Hence, the executors had the power to terminate the trust any time within the fifty-year period either by selling the assets or distributing any and all of the <em>res </em>as they deemed most beneficial. These executors, as trustees, on July 27, 1936 made a lease to T. W. Phillips Gas &amp; Oil Company for the same 30 acre tract upon the same terms.</p>

Plaintiffs, at the same time however, indicated their willingness to negotiate a neAV lease, at least in relation to the royalty payments. <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>Nevertheless, after having received such notice from the plaintiffs, defendant drilled a well on the 30 acres in the month of March, 1956 to a depth of more than 7.000 feet which produced 1,243,000 cubic feet of gas per day. The hydro-fracture of Oriskany sands increased the gas production to 4,548,000 cubic feet per day; no meter or other device was placed on the well but the gas produced from it went into the distribution lines of the defendant and was sold by defendant at retail. It was stipulated that the gas produced from this well from June 12, 1956 to February 25, 1957, inclusive, was 854,167,529 cubic feet, the value of which at the field price prevailing of 27% cents per thousand cubic feet was $234,896.07. It is conceded that the accepted royalty paid by gas producers to owners of land is %th of production which in this case would be $29,362 for the above stated period.</p>
    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[237,1301,1149,921]]]'>This agreement, under which the defendant claims the right to drill, is an antiquated type of agreement providing generally for so-called shallow well drilling and contemplated the old method of paying for gas sold off the premises by a system of pressure gauging. It is clear from the very facts of this case that such a method of computing royalty payments is totally inadequate and unfair in deep well drilling, especially where the artificial method of hydro-fracture is used. If the minute pressure in the well were to remain constant and the diameter of the shaft is the same, the flow of the gas well is directly dependent upon its depth. In other words, a well 10,000 feet deep, will produce 10 times as much gas in a given time as a well 1.000 feet deep, and therefore a maximum payment provision of $200 per year bears no actual relation to the amount of gas being taken from the land.</p>

It is clear that the doctrine of unjust enrichment does not deal with situations in which the party to be charged has by word or deed legally consented to assume a duty toward the party seeking to charge him. Instead, it applies only to situations where there is no legal contract. <em>Third National Bank and Trust Company of Scranton v.

It is clear that whether we regard this trust as terminable at a fixed time, i.e., 50 years, or at an indeterminate earlier time, its duration offends this rule. Who is to say, or who can determine how long oil or gas will be produced in paying quantities or for how long operations for oil or gas will be conducted thereon? In any event, it may extend for longer than 50 years, which is the maximum length of the trust. The Restatement, however, qualifies this rule by providing that a lease which is improper because of its extended duration is valid for the actual duration of the trust and can be set aside only as to the excess. If, therefore, the executors had no power to terminate the trust either by sale or distribution of the assets, we could not at this time say <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>that the lease extended beyond the duration of the trust and is thus invalid. The trust here in question, as to the property which is the subject matter of this case, was however terminated in 1952 by the deed of conveyance by the executors as trustees of the William Wingert Estate to the plaintiffs herein, O. E. Wingert and Alverta Wingert, his wife. This sale was in complete accord with the Will of William Wingert which provided: “They [the executors] shall have full and complete power to sell and convey any and all real estate, at anytime or times with [in] fifty years from the date of my decease, . . .”</p>

It was no longer under the jurisdiction of the trustees or subject to the terms and conditions of the trust as imposed by the Will. The land and its incidents after conveyance were no longer trust <em>res, </em>instead, the purchase price of the land became part of the corpus and the lease no longer served the trust. It was therefore terminated. The defendant ought not to be heard to complain of this result. At the time the lease was made, it had full knowledge of the authority and capacity of the lessor. If they had wished to protect themselves they could have insisted upon approval of this agreement by the Orphans’ Court in accordance with Section 31 of the Fiduciaries Act, 1917, P.L. 447, 20 P.S. §717.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

This lease, which was a matter of record, had been executed and delivered six years before the plaintiffs purchased the property from the estate of William Wingert, deceased; and the defendant company has at all times made or tendered to the lessors the sums for which it was obligated by the terms of the lease. That the executors of William Wingert had the power to execute the lease in question is not open to reasonable dispute. The testator’s will so empowered his personal representatives. In fact, the current lease which the executors made to the defendant (T. W. Phillips Gas &amp; Oil Company) was, in effect, a renewal of a lease of similar terms which William Wingert, in his lifetime, had given to T. W. Phillips, Jr., for a term of 20 years and as long thereafter as oil and gas was found in paying quantities. No drilling having taken place under that lease within the 20-year term, which was about to expire, and William Wingert having died, the executors <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>gave the defendant the renewal which is still extant and the lease here involved. The plaintiffs were without right to repudiate or abrogate this lease and their attempt so to do was legally futile. The still subsisting lease, therefore, constitutes the contract which renders inapplicable the rule of unjust enrichment.</p>

If there was to be a more equitable sharing of the returns from the gas produced by the defendant on plaintiffs’ property, that was peculiarly a matter for renegotiation between the parties bound by the lease and cannot rightly be accomplished by our disregarding the lease.</p>
