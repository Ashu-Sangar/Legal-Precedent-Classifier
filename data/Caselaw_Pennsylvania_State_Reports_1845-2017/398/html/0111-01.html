The Commission’s entry was made with the plaintiffs’ full knowl<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>edge and without objection or question from them until the filing of their complaint in the instant action in December of 1957. The fact is that the plaintiffs do not want actual possession of the property. What they seek is a determination of the damages due them for the Turnpike Commission’s additional appropriation of some 68 acres of their property in March of 1953 on the basis of present day real estate values. In other words, the issue is not whether the plaintiffs should have actual and immediate possession of the land in question but the date as of which the damages for the Commission’s taking of the property are to be assessed. That is what is, and all there is, at stake in this controversy.</p>

On March 4, 1952, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, acting pursuant to the Act of May 23, 1951, P.L. 335, condemned by formal resolution a portion of the Rosenblatt property. The resolution specified a right of way across the plaintiffs’ land, 100 feet on either side of a center line described by courses and distances, for “a total width of 200 feet, together with such additional lands sufficient to provide for slopes of cuts and embankments . . The drawings attached as exhibits to the resolution showed the taking of a swath 200 feet wide across the Rosenblatt property for an aggregate area of 9.18 acres.

A copy of the engineering report referred to in the resolution is also attached to the stipulated facts as Exhibit “C” (51a et seq.). A drawing, identified as Plate 9 (66%a) and attached to and made part of Exhibit “C”, depicted the location and lay-out of the Port Washington Interchange at the situs of the Rosenblatt property where the turnpike was to make an overhead intersection of transverse Highway Route 731 (future relocated U.S. Route 309). A later plan (Defendant’s Exhibit No. 1) (144a), showing in minute detail the land necessary for the construction of the Port Washington Interchange on the Rosenblatt property was approved by the Turnpike Commission on January 9, 1953, as so attested on the face of the plan by the hand of James P. Torrance, Secretary and Treasurer of the Turnpike Commission. In passing, we note that it has been suggested that the plan (Defendant’s Exhibit No. 1) was never formally adopted by the Commission since its approval thereof was signed <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>only by its Secretary and Treasurer. While it is not of vital importance whether this plan was ever formally adopted by the Commission, as we shall hereinafter see, the suggestion that Torrance’s attestation evidenced only his own approval and not the Commission’s is without merit. “In the absence of proof to the contrary, the law presumes that a public official’s actions were pursuant to proper authority and that the antecedent steps necessary to give validity to his official acts were duly taken:” See <em>McIntosh Road Materials Co. v.

The letter requested Seltzer, as he himself avers (22a, 23a), to insert the new property description in the bond securing land damages, which the Commission had theretofore mailed to him on January 13th preceding, as security for the 9.18 acres taken for the highway. The new description embraced a tract of 76.8 acres, more or less, and included the 9.18 acres for the 200 foot wide right of way specified in the resolution of March 1, 1952. Upon the substitution of the new description in the bond, the Commission therewith became entitled to a right of entry upon the property as then described in the bond: see Section 10 of the Act of 1951, supra. Consequently, from March 13, 1953, onward, Seltzer has had the Commission’s bond to indemnify him for the damages due for the Commission’s appropriation of approximately 76.8 acres, more or less, of his land and, for the same period of time, the Commission has had the exclusive use and possession of the property.</p>

On the same day, however, the Chief Counsel of the Right of Way Division of the Commission advised Seltzer’s office by telephone that he (the Chief Counsel) had received the final plan of the total area to be taken and would mail the new description to Seltzer, which was done, as already related. Prom the time of the substitution of the new description in the bond on March 13, 1953, neither the Turnpike Commission’s representatives, its contractor, nor the contractor’s employees were ever again interfered with or interrupted in their entry upon, use, and complete appropriation of the described 78 acres, more or less, of Seltzer’s land.

It is implicit in our opinion in the <em>G-itlin </em>case that both the taking for the highway, as described in the resolution of March 4, 1952, and the subsequent appropriation of additional land for an interchange, according to the revised plan delivered to the property owner, came equally Avithin the intended scope of the resolution’s condemnation. No further resolution of condemnation was either contemplated or required by the Act of 1951, so that, while the <em>QitUn </em>decision recognized that the resolution of March 4, 1952, appropriated definitively only the 200 foot right of way, Avith slopes for cuts and fills, it did not hold that the land subsequently appropriated by the Commission for necessary appurtenances or facilities according to revised plans did not also come Avithin the purview of the condemning resolution. On the contrary, both appropriations were considered and treated with together as having been condemned by the resolution of March 4, 1952. No one questions that the resolution of March 4, 1952, complied with the statute’s requirement so far as the condemnation of the land for the 200 foot highway from the Valley Forge Interchange eastward to the Delaware River was concerned. Why, then, should not the Commission’s later appropriation of additional property for the construction of necessary approaches and ramps to the highway (i.e., an interchange), as envisioned by the Act of 1951 and contemplated by the resolution of March 4, 1952, come within the effective scope of Uie condemnation?

The date of the condemnation remains constant but the daté for reckoning the damages for subsequent appropriations (not specifically described but within the purview of the resolution) is necessarily the date of the Commonwealth’s right of entry thereupon, if the statutory provision is to be given a reasonable and constitutional interpretation.

From <em>the </em>time the Commission delivered to Seltzer on March 13, 1953, the new description of the property being appropriated for the Fort Washington Interchange and the Commission’s contemporaneous entry thereon, Seltzer stood by without complaint or protest while the Commission made large and expensive permanent improvements on the property with the result that, by the time Seltzer petitioned for the appointment of viewers on November 4, 1955, the construction of the interchange had been entirely completed to Seltzer’s positive knowledge, (see Exhibit “D” at p. 32a) and without complaint or protest from him. His conduct had never indicated other than that he would proceed for the assessment of his damages by a board of view. Indeed, at the time he did so proceed, he was otherwise bound to do so. Just ten days before he petitioned for the appointment of viewers, Seltzer, acting by Rosenblatt, had established a line of credit at the Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank with an assignment to the bank of his prospective damages from the condemnation as security. To permit him to change his position with respect to the condemnation, to the injury of the Turnpike Commission, would be highly inequitable.

There, the defendant turnpike company, which possessed the power of eminent domain, entered upon and took possession of land belonging to the plaintiffs without filing a bond required by the statute as a prerequisite to a valid condemnation. The plaintiffs were minors represented by a guardian. The defendant company petitioned the court for the appointment of viewers, which was done. The viewers made an award of damages in favor of the plaintiffs. The turnpike company appealed the award to the court of common pleas where an issue was framed and a jury trial ordered in accordance with a written stipulation of all parties. That was in 1893. Nothing further was done with the Company’s appeal from the viewers’ award until 1906. In the year preceding (1905) the plaintiffs, who had attained their majority, brought an action of ejectment against the <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>turnpike company to recover possession of the appropriated property on the ground that the statutory procedure prerequisite to a valid taking had not been complied with. The case went to trial and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. However, the trial judge, citing and following <em>Oliver v. Railway Company, </em><a href="/pa/131/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="131 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="810298" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0408-01">131 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.%2047" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="19 A. 47">19 A. 47</a>, conditioned the jury’s verdict by providing in the judgment for plaintiffs that the turnpike company should have four months within Avhich to institute another condemnation of the appropriated land. Instead of instituting such a proceeding, however, the turnpike company revived its appeal of 1893 from the viewers’ award. The plaintiffs thereupon issued a writ of <em>habere facias </em>upon the judgment in ejectment in order to obtain possession of the property in controversy. The trial court granted the turnpike company a stay of execution of the writ of <em>habere facias </em>until a trial of the defendant’s appeal from the viewers’ award could be had. The plaintiffs appealed the stay order to the Superior Court. After noting that the plaintiffs (following attainment of their majority) had never attempted to obtain a trial of the company’s appeal from the viewers’ award or made any timely move to repudiate the proceeding (p. 147), the Superior Court held that the stay was proper and, in concluding, said that if the turnpike company “proceeds in good faith, under order of the court, to have the plaintiffs’ damages secured or paid, then their right of possession will surely have passed . .

Why not? No one had ever questioned otherwise, at least not in this court, until the instant case, which the plaintiffs belatedly instituted in the court below four and a half years after the Commission’s entry upon the land was known to Seltzer, as the letter also confirms. According to the Chief Construction Engineer of the Commission, as reported in the same letter (Plaintiffs’ Exhibit No. 2, supra), K 'Mr. Seltzer [sometime prior to March 25, 1953] was in the Board Room of the Commission at Harrisburg, when all the plans were laid down and a very thorough and complete discussion was carried on, showing him exactly what was being taken and what was being done.’ ” The record before us does not present a case of a <em>vi et armis </em>invasion by the Commission of the private property of an uninformed individual, but, rather a consensual land appropriation by the Commission in an exercise of its power of eminent domain and a voluntary acquiescence therein by a well-informed and competent landowner.

Under the circumstances, here obtaining, it is relatively of no moment whether the 68 acres were ever validly con<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>demned or, indeed, condemned at all. See <em>Philadelphia Parkway, </em>supra. The thing of importance is that the possessor of the right of eminent domain entered upon and appropriated the land to its own use with the owner’s knowledge and without objection from him and that the prospective damages due the owner for the taking were at all times secured to him by adequate bond. That such a situation constitutes, under the law of this State, a binding and unimpeachable exercise of the appropriator’s power of eminent domain, there cannot be the slightest doubt. The plaintiffs were without standing to maintain an action in ejectment and should have been relegated to their viewers’ proceeding in Montgomery County for the assessment of the damages due them. But, even if the plaintiffs were entitled to a conditional ejectment, the damages would still be assessable, upon the ensuing condemnation, as of the date of the Commission’s entry upon the property. <em>Oliver v.

      <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>The majority opinion, however, concludes that the Commission did condemn all of the land in question by resolution on March 4, 1952. On that date the Commission passed a resolution to condemn one hundred feet on each side of a center line with additional lands and slopes of cuts and embankments and such additional lands as would be needed for “ramp approaches, maintenance sheds, gasoline stations, restaurants, power facilities, waste banks, borrow pits and other facilities including tunnels. . . needed for the construction operation and maintenance of the Turnpike. . .” This resolution exactly fixed the center line of the Delaware River Turnpike extension as shown on maps which were made part of the resolution. The maps attached to this resolution cover <em>the entire length of the turnpike </em>and affected property belonging to many owners. The maps included 9.18 acres of plaintiffs’ property. Plaintiffs never have questioned before and do not now question the validity of the condemnation of these 9.18 acres. However, on March 10, 1958 plaintiff was notified that the Commission had condemned approximately 68 acres more of his land for an interchange “strictly in accordance with the provisions of our Act and with the ruling laid down by the Supreme Court.” The Commission then took possession of the 68 acres. A year later the Commission notified plaintiffs that they needed an additional 1.555 acres of their property. There was no formal resolution adopted by the Commission condemning these 68 acres or the 1.555 acres. The majority opinion says that March 4, 1952 is the effective date of the condemnation of this additional land even though on that date the plans attached to the resolution indicated the land condemned was only 9.18 acres. Even the Commission has not contended that this date is the effective date of condemnation of the 68 acres or the 1.555 acres. The Commission’s requested findings of fact and conclu<a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>sions of law state, “3. The effective date of the taking of the 9.18 acres is March 4, 1952. 4. The effective date of the taking of the approximately 68 acres is January 9, 1953. 5. The effective date of the taking of the utility easement of 1.555 acres is March 10, 1954.” The reason that learned counsel for the Commission did not contend that the effective date of the condemnation of the 68 acres and the 1.555 acres is March 4, 1952 is understandable. That identical contention had been made by the Commission and rejected by this Court in the case of <em>Gitlin v.

The Act authorized and empowered the officers, directors and engineers of the railroad to ‘fix, mark and determine such route for a railroad as they may deem expedient . . . and not, except in the neighborhood of deep cuttings or high embankments . . ., to exceed sixty feet in width. . .’ The plaintiffs, who were objecting property owners, conceded the company’s right to take their land to the extent of sixty feet in width but urged that the condemnation proceedings <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>were ineffective as to any land in excess of sixty feet. The court below permitted the railroad to take additional land to the extent needed for the slopes of the cuts and fills. That is all that was involved in that case. And, while there is a statement in the opinion implying that the resolution condemning the sixty foot strip also permitted the railroad to take such land as was necessary for ‘stations, sidings and turnouts’ not noted on the plan, the statement was a patent dictum for the court immediately went on to say that ‘When the petition for approval of the bond is filed, <em>accompanied by a map designating the extent of the land to be taken, </em>the owner knows precisely the quantity of land the company proposes to take’ (Emphasis supplied).

However, as stated therein, this presumption is effective only in the absence of proof to the contrary. Here, of course, there is such proof to the contrary. The Commission’s Senior Plans Engineer testified that he carried the revised plans into the offices of the Chief Engineer and the Secretary where they were signed. There was never any action taken as to the signing of these plans by the Commission as a whole. The record is clear that the action of these individuals was not a resolution of the Commission. The Act of 1951, supra, does not say that the Commission may condemn property by having the engineer and the secretary of the Commission sign some plans. The Commission is a body of five members of whom three constitute a quorum. (36 P.S. §652(d)). We have defined a resolution as “a formal expression of the opinion or will of an official body or public assembly, adopted by vote.” <em>Wiley v.

Certainly here there was no formal expression of the opinion or will of the Turnpike Commission.</p>
