On or about March 8, 1957, one of plaintiffs’ cars was placed in defendant’s garage and locked as usual. The complaint goes on to aver that this car contained approximately $8,000 worth of samples of various types of jewelry; that on or about March 19, 1957 the car was missing from the garage and was reported to the police as stolen. On March 23, 1957 the car was found but the jewelry was missing. It is plaintiffs’ contention that the defendant violated a bailment contract in failing to return the automobile and its contents and sought judgment. Defendant’s answer denied the material averments of plaintiffs’ complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The first is where an owner rents space in a parking lot, drives his automobile therein, locks it or not as he chooses, and for all practical purposes retains control thereof. The second is where the garage attendants collect fees, assume control of cars, park them and move them about within the garage as they find convenient, the keys are left in the cars and tickets are issued as means of identifying cars upon redelivery. The first class of cases has almost universally been held to be that of a mere lease of parking privileges because the owner has paid a fee only for the privilege of parking his automobile without any actual delivery to the parking lot operator and with no corresponding right to redelivery.

See 24 Am. Jur. 493. Since here plaintiffs reserved possession of the car at all times by retaining the keys thereto, defendant acquired no dominion over the vehicle nor any right to control removal of it; hence there was no bailment.

This agreement is at least clear evidence of the intention of the parties. It originally provided: “The Authority shall have the right to move the applicant’s automobile to such location as it may deem necessary in order to facilitate the most effective use of the parking space on the roof. <em>Ignition kegs must be left in the automobile at all times.” </em>However, it is conceded that it was orally amended to permit plaintiffs to retain their ignition keys at all times and thus retain absolute control over the vehicle. This indicated that plaintiffs themselves considered their arrangement in the nature of a lease of parking privileges where no control of their automobile was turned over to defendant rather than a bailment in which control is surrendered. This being so, it follows that under the circumstances of this case the court below correctly held that the defendant was not liable.</p>
