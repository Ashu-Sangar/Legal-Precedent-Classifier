This fund was created in the following manner: the decedent, Boyd, and one William B. Albright entered into a written contract on December 10, 1947, supplemented by another written contract on January 9, 1948, under which Albright, as general contractor, was to perform certain construction work on property owned by Boyd; Albright was adjudged a bankrupt on November 27, 1951 and Boyd died March 29, 1954; subcontractors and furnishers of supplies in connection with the construction work presented claims against the Boyd Estate, said claims being based on either attachment proceedings or assignments from Albright; Boyd’s executor and the trustee in bankruptcy in Al-bright’s bankruptcy proceedings entered an agreement <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>as to the balance due and owing under the Boyd-Al-bright contract, to wit, $25,000, and this amount was set aside in the Orphans’ Court of Delaware County for the payment of valid claims. After our remand the Orphans’ Court allocated an additional sum of $1,000 to the fund as interest from the date of that court’s supplemental adjudication so that the present fund amounts to $26,000.</p>
