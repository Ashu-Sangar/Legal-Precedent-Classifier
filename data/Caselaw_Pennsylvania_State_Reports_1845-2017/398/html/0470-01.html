Franklin’s executor is not entitled to a <em>y^tk </em>interest or to any interest in the principal of Lillian Walls’ trust, for three reasons: (1) The Pay and Divide Rule shows that the gifts to the grandchildren were contingent; (2) Mrs. Hope desired and intended the trusts which she created to be paid only to her nieces and their children and issue, since she expressly “Provided, however that in no event shall any husband of my said niece receive any portion of my estate”; and (3) That it would be anomalous, if not absurd, to hold that Mrs. Hope intended the estate of a grandnephew to share in her niece Lillian’s trust principal, when the grandnephew died before Lillian. <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>The answer to appellants’ first point is two-fold: First, this Court abolished the Pay and Divide Rule in <em>Dickson Estate, </em><a href="/pa/396/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="396 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="1284906" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0371-01">396 Pa. 371</a>, 374, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20680" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="152 A.2d 680">152 A. 2d </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20680" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="152 A.2d 680">680</a>; </em>secondly, the Pay and Divide Rule, even if it were still in existence, would be inapplicable to the language of Mrs. Hope’s will. Appellants’ second and third points raise close questions of interpretation which can only be resolved by our construction of the meaning and intent of Mrs. Hope as expressed in the language of her entire will.</p>
