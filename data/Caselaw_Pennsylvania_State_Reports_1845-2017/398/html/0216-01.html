Sylvesters— then owners and operators of an art school — planned to remodel this building; to convert the first floor into two apartments<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and the second floor either for use by the art school or into several apartments. When it became impracticable to locate the art school in the building Sylvesters applied for a building permit to convert the second floor into several apartments; such permit was refused because of the two-family zoning regulation. Sylvesters then applied for a zone change but City Council did not grant their request. The result is that Sylvesters and their son each have an apartment on the first floor but the second floor of the building remains unused and unoccupied. One variance now requested is to use the second floor of this building as the office of a coin-vending machine corporation in which Sylvesters and their son own the majority stock.</p>

The “innocence” of Sylvesters in the premises and alleged misleading representations made by certain members of the School Board, in connection with the sale and purchase of the school property, do not vary <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>the rule that Sylvesters should have been cognizant of the zoning requirements when they purchased this land.</p>

The “hardship” which Sylvesters urge is an economic hardship; in the case of the school building, the second floor remains unoccupied and thus non-income producing and, in the case of the garage building, its availability for use only for the storage of the trucks and supplies attendant to the storage and repair of such trucks will result in a far less profitable and economical operation of the coin machine business. Such “hardship” is not recognized as a basis for a variance nor does it render the application of the zoning ordinance invalid: <em>Upper St. Clair Twp. Grange Zoning Case, </em>supra; <em>Richman v.

Sylvesters argue that the “uniqueness” of the hardship to their property is: “There is no other such abandoned school house in the area; no other building of comparable large size in the area; and no other building such as the major garage in the area. . . . More particularly, there is accordingly no other tract of three to four acres; similarly created with cliff, hill and knoll; somewhat isolated; and having on it two such unique buildings. Neither is there any such property with such a history as this one has for redemption from place of blight, danger and eye sore, to place of beauty, orderliness and good example”. In effect, the properties, they urge, cannot be used for any other purpose if the variances be not granted; the second floor of the school will remain unoccupied and the garage will remain a garage. However, the court below found that the properties could be utilized for other purposes, such as a subdivision for house developments; our review of the testimony in that respect indicates that such <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>finding is supported by sufficient evidence and cannot be disturbed upon appeal. Sylvesters, no doubt, would realize greater profit from the use of both premises as tbe centre of operations for tbeir coin machine business. Nothing of record, however, justifies us in finding that such hardship — loss of financial gain — by reason of the particular character, terrain, etc. of this property requires the grant of the variances. <em>Garbev Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/385/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="385 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="1267105" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0328-01">385 Pa. 328</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%20682" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="122 A.2d 682">122 A. 2d 682</a>; <em>Baronoff v.
