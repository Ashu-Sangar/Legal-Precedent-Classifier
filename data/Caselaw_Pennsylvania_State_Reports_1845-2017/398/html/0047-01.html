Vincent Scatena pleaded not guilty, and Michael Popovich and Frank Zaffina pleaded guilty. Their offense was also fixed at murder in the first degree and their punishment at life imprisonment. Ann Dixon Garrison, <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>defendant’s wife, was indicted as an accessory, was found guilty of murder in the second degree, and was sent to the Industrial Home for Women at Muncy.</p>
    <p id="b205-3" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[146,542,1147,206]]]'>The unusual cause of Mrs. Ensinger’s death was shock and hemorrhage following a comminuted fracture of the jaw that pierced the face and constituted, medically, a “stab” wound.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[143,760,1150,795]]]'>The evidence reveals that Ann Garrison at one time had worked for Scatena as a waitress in his tavern. She had once lived next door to Mrs. Ensinger and had told Scatena that the old lady kept money in her house: she was supposed to be worth between seventy and a hundred thousand dollars. Scatena then sent to Cleveland for two ex-convicts, Popovich and Zaffina, to take care of some illegal business for him. On November 16, 1957, the day before the ultimate episode, Ann Garrison was introduced to Popovich in Scatena’s tavern and told him that she knew he was in business for money and had a prowl job (burglary) for him in a house that was worth plenty. They were interrupted at that point and she told Popovich to talk further to Scatena about the affair.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[138,1577,1151,796]]]'>The next day all but the Garrisons met at the tavern and after making a telephone call, Scatena said that they should go over to “meet them”. ■ They then drove to Garrison’s house and found defendant working on his car. The three men spoke to defendant, who pointed out Mrs. Ensinger’s house, gave them a general description of it, and told them where to find the old lady’s money-box and key. After this they got into Garrison’s car because the car in which they had come bore an Ohio license and they drove twice past Mrs. Ensinger’s house, once in front and once in back. During this drive defendant told the others the best time and place to enter. As he left them he urged them not to hurt Mrs. Ensinger and was told that he would be taken care of.</p>

They pushed her down, but when Popovich put his hand over her mouth she bit him. In exasperation he struck her and broke her jaw, giving her the injuries from which she soon died. They gagged and taped her and ransacked the house, finding no money-box and nothing of value to them save seventeen cents. Concerned over Mrs. Ensinger’s condition, they hastily left the house, put in an anonymous telephone call to the police for an ambulance, and left, via Scatena’s tavern, for Cleveland. When the ambulance arrived Mrs. Ensinger was dead.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[248,1135,1146,371]]]'>During the burglary the Garrisons sat in their car in a vacant lot across the street from the Ensinger house and watched Popovich and Zaffina enter by the front door. They then drove to the rear of the house and saw them leave by the back door, after which they too went to Scatena’s tavern but had no talk with anyone.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.6",206,[242,1516,1149,704]]]'>It was the Commonwealth’s theory that all five persons now tried and convicted had conspired to burglarize and rob Mrs. Ensinger, and that although nothing was taken, a burglary was committed in the commission of which the victim received fatal injuries. This involved Popovich and Zaffina directly, Scatena and Garrison indirectly, under the felony-murder rule <em>(Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.8",211,[142,1246,1150,523]]]'>I agree that the language of Judge Hirt in <em>Kerr v. Clements, </em><a href="/pa-super/148/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="148 Pa. Super. 378" data-case-ids="1040648" data-case-paths="/pa-super/148/0378-01">148 Pa. Superior Ct. 378</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="25 A.2d 737">25 A. 2d 737</a>, in referring to the Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, 19 P.S. §683, as amended, is applicable to this case. Judge Hirt said: “What is prohibited by the act is testimony in any form by the wife or husband <em>against </em>the other. Extra-judicial admissions are a sort of testimony; hence the prohibition of the act applies to them with the same force as though made by a spouse from the stand.”</p>
    <p id="b211-7" data-blocks='[["BL_211.9",211,[137,1791,1151,586]],["BL_212.1",212,[226,358,1145,261]]]'>Thus it is seen that the alternatives are that the declaration of the wife was against her husband or it was not. If it was not, it was not admissible in this case since in that event it would be admissible only against herself and she was not on trial with him. If it was, then it falls within the ban of the rule as stated. Believing it to be error to have admitted it, I cannot escape the conclusion that it harmed the defendant. It is therefore unnecessary to consider, under the circumstances of this case, (a) whether the wife can be and (under the evidence aliunde the decía<a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>ration itself) was a co-conspirator with her husband and (b) whether the declaration was in furtherance of a conspiracy between her and her husband as distinguished from a conspiracy between her and the others. Hence, I dissent.</p>
