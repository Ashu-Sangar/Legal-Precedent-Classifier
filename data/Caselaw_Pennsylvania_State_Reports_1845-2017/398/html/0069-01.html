Thus viewed, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts:</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[225,695,1152,1404]]]'>The defendant, Madeline Schneyer, was operating her automobile northwardly at a speed of 20 or 25 miles an hour on Easton Road, Glenside, at 3:30 p.m. on September 29,1956. Easton Road is 40 feet 9 inches wide and is bisected by a white line. Her husband was a passenger in the car and there was no traffic immediately in front of her nor were there any vehicles parked along the road to obscure her view. There were two lanes on each side of the road and she was driving on the inside lane. As defendant arrived at a point at least two car lengths south of a driveway leading into some houses on her right side of the road, she saw plaintiff run from the driveway into the street. The child reached all the way across the northbound lane and was at least as far as the center line of the road when the defendant (who had turned her car in the same direction he was running) struck him with the left front of her car. When her car came to rest the right front and left rear of her automobile were on the white line which bisects the road and the left front of her car was about 3 feet over the center line. After she stopped the child was to the left and front of her car. It is conceded that the child died as the result of this accident. The whole matter was submitted to the jury in a fair charge to which no exception has been taken in this Court.</p>
    <p id="b228-6" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[223,2120,1146,263]],["BL_229.1",229,[148,371,1147,373]]]'>This is not a case where a person steps off a curb and is immediately struck. The physical facts on this state of the record demonstrated that this six year old child was in the unobscured view of the defendant for a period long enough to permit that child to run at <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>least 20 feet. The jury therefore could have inferred, since there were no skid marks at the scene of the accident, that the defendant’s automobile was travelling only 20 miles an hour; that the defendant did not immediately apply her brakes or they were defective or that in any event there was ample opportunity for her to stop her car in time to avoid striking the child.</p>

Her position was clearly stated by the court to the jury which <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>was not bound to accept the whole of her statement to the police or her evidence at the trial even though she was called as on cross-examination by the plaintiff. It is true, of course, that such evidence as she gave at the trial which was uncontradicted by any other evidence by the plaintiff is binding upon him. And if she were confronted by a sudden emergency not of her own creation because a parked car obscured her vision her position would be well taken. <em>Liuzzo v.

Ryan,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> who was among a group of children who had been playing with the deceased plaintiff, who was in position to see and testified that he did not see any parked cars at all. Besides, the husband who was available was not called. Since no explanation for this failure was given, the jury could infer that had he been called his evidence would not have helped his wife. <em>Haas v.

Therefore, the case under review presents a situation where, although the accident occurred not at a crosswalk but in the middle of the block, children on both sides of Easton Road could have been observed by an attentive driver. Such a situation called upon the driver to exercise a high degree of care to avoid striking any of these children who, as this child did, might dart into the street, in view of the well known proclivity of children to so act.</p>

The very essence of its function is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable. . . . Courts are not free to reweigh the evidence and set aside the jury verdict merely because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions or because judges feel that other results are more reasonable.’ Tennant v.
