Not infrequently, therefore, specific intent to take life is shown by proof of the offender’s use of a deadly weapon, for while an intention to kill may be shown by the defendant’s expressed words or declarations or other conduct, such intent may be just as effectively inferred from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part for a manifest purpose: [citing cases].” See also: <em>Commonwealth v.

Apparently conceding that the knife was a “deadly weapon,” defendant argues that the knife was not used on a “vital part” of deceased’s body and, therefore, the inference of a specific intent to kill did not arise. In this connection it is argued that Dr. Lippard changed his testimony in respect to whether or not the wound was inflicted on a “vital part” of the deceased’s body. On direct examination Dr. Lippard testified: “Q. Now Doctor, there has been some reference in remarks in this case as to vital parts of the body. Would you determine from your experience whether or not you regard the area wounded as a vital part of the body? A. Yes, <em>definitely a most vital part of the body.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). On cross-examination the doctor testified: “Q. Now, do you consider the fleshy part of the arm behind the bone as a vital part <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>of the body? A. No.” It is obvious that the doctor did uot change his testimony and that in his opinion the area wounded was a “vital part” of deceased’s body. The court below in its opinion well covered this situation: “The fact that in reaching this most vital part of the body the knife passed through the flesh of the upper arm is of no moment. A weapon <em>may </em>be used in such a way that death is improbable; however, we must consider not only the nature of the weapon, but also the manner in which it is used and all the attending circumstances: Commonwealth v. Kluska, <a href="/pa/333/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="333 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1187952" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0065-01">333 Pa. 65</a> (1939). In the instant case the weapon is a butcher knife 11 inches long, secured and used by the defendant against her husband who was unarmed and thrust with such force and in such a manner that it caused a stabbing wound longer than its blade in a diagonal path into the heart.” No more vital area exists in the human body than the heart area; it was in this area that defendant wounded her husband and from the use of the knife in the manner in which it was employed, from the wound which it inflicted and under all the circumstances the inference was fully warranted that defendant’s act was done with the specific intent to take life. This contention of the defendant is without merit.</p>

During the trial the jury had had rooms at the Penn-Harris Hotel. On the last day of the trial the jurors checked out of the hotel and brought their luggage with them to the courthouse. The jury retired for deliberation on the verdict at 7:08 p.m. after which time the jurors were fed. At 11:15 p.m. the jury requested and were given additional instructions on the various degrees of homicide and, in the words of the trial judge, at that time “gave no indications of fatigue <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>or illness.” At approximately 3 a.m. counsel for the defendant requested that the jury be given sleeping quarters and that their deliberation be suspended while they rested and slept, but this request was refused. On his own volition the trial judge called the jury into the court room at 5:00 a.m. The following colloquy ‘then took place: “the court: Are there any questions that you think the Court might be able to answer; any additional questions that you might have that would help? This is, of course, an important case, as you well know, and you have deliberated on it very conscientiously. It is an important case to both the Commonwealth and the defense and the verdict, of course, must be unanimous, and we want to give you every opportunity to continue to deliberate, hoping that you can come to a unanimous verdict, the fore-lady : Your Honor, I as Forelady — we have deadlocked as far as I am concerned, the court: And you feel that any longer deliberations would not solve the deadlock, is that what you mean? the forelady: We have been trying, the court : Well, we are going to send you back again for another effort to see if you can’t come to a unanimous verdict, and we urge you to make every effort to do that.” The jury finally reached a verdict at 6:08 a.m.</p>
    <p id="b361-3" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[187,1732,1148,369]]]'>Defendant argues that it was reversible error on the part of the trial court to require such extended deliberation without rest for the jurors of whom ten were women.

Cas. 301" data-case-ids="1890604" data-case-paths="/johns-cas/2/0300-01">2 Johns. Cas. 301</a>, Mr. Justice Kent said: “The doctrine of compelling a jury to unanimity by the pains of hunger and fatigue, so that the verdict in fact be founded not on temperate discussion and clear conviction, but on strength of <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>body, is a monstrous doctrine that does not, as St. Ger-main evidently hints, stand with conscience, but is altogether repugnant to a sense of humanity and justice.” A verdict brought about by judicial coercion is a nullity in the eyes of the law: <em>Miller v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/187/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="187 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="900273" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0572-01">187 Pa. 572</a>. If the instant verdict were brought about by any compulsion or if there was anything of record to indicate that the instant verdict was reached because of the jurors’ desire for rest and sleep or fatigue we would have no hesitancy in setting such verdict aside. However the instant record does not disclose such motivation for this verdict. The extent of time during which a jury is kept together for deliberation is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge; only for an abuse of such discretion should his action be reversed. Defendant argues that the court violated the Act of August 9, 1955, P. L. 323, §2336, 16 PS §2336, which provides that the county commissioners “shall provide and maintain a separate room or rooms, at or adjoining the Court House, upon order of the Court, for the comfort, accommodation and convenience of woman jurors, and such rooms shall be provided with suitable furniture for the use of women jurors who may be serving upon juries unable to bring in verdicts upon the day in which the case was placed in their hands. . . .” We fail to follow the logic of this argument in its applicability to this case. There is no evidence of record that appropriate quarters for the women jurors had not been provided nor that any request was made on the part of any of. the jurors that the jury’s deliberations be suspended and that provision be made for appropriate quarters for rest and sleep during the suspension of such deliberations. In <em>Commonwealth v. Tenbroeck, </em><a href="/pa/265/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="265 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="1051902" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0251-01">265 Pa. 251</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.%20635" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="108 A. 635">108 A. 635</a>, affirming a verdict of second degree murder, this Court said: “The jury, after forty-eight hours’ deliberation, came into court and reported their inability to agree <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>upon a verdict, whereupon the trial judge explained the nature of the case and importance of reaching a verdict and said, ‘You must agree,’ but added, ‘If someone of you should become physically unable to remain, the situation would be different, but as long as you are physically able to remain, it is your duty to undertake to agree.’ He also expressed great sympathy for the jury and enjoined them to continue their deliberations. Considering, as we must, all, that the judge said, it did not constitute such a coercion of the jury as to invalidate the verdict.. . .” We find nothing to substantiate the defendant’s charge that this verdict was arrived at through any judicial coercion or because of fatigue from lack of rest.</p>
    <p id="b363-3" data-blocks='[["BL_363.4",363,[164,1142,1159,1287]]]'>Defendant’s third contention is that the trial court erred in permitting the reception into evidence of the rebuttal testimony of a Commonwealth witness, Constable Grimwood. The defendant had taken the stand and had testified, inter alia, that she loved her husband, had never threatened to kill him and had never told anyone that she would kill him. Grimwood testified that, in March 1958, he was attempting to apprehend the deceased and, while chasing deceased through his home, defendant said “If you don’t soon get him, you will be coming after me, because I am going to kill him.” The court admitted this testimony for two purposes; first, as it might affect the credibility of the defendant and second, to show possible intent. For both purposes this testimony was clearly admissible. In <em>Commonwealth v.

The specific intent that death shall result is not essential to a finding of voluntary manslaughter. While it is true that a specific intent to take life, coupled with adequate provocation and passion, constitutes voluntary manslaughter rather than murder in the first or second degree, it is equally true that an intent to inflict serious bodily injury, which results in death, coupled with adequate provocation and passion, does not constitute murder in the second degree but is voluntary manslaughter, it is seen, therefore, that where there is a non-malicious felonious killing with a specific intent either to kill or to seriously injure, it is voluntary manslaughter.

At 7:08 that evening, after receiving instructions from the Judge on the subjects of murder and manslaughter, the jurors took up the case for deliberation, discussion and verdict. At 11:15 p.m., they requested further instructions which were given to them in the courtroom and they once more retired to the jury room.</p>

This request was refused. At 5 a.m., the Judge called the jury into the courtroom and the following ensued: “tits court : Are there any questions that you think the Court might be able to answer; any additional questions that you might have that would help? This is, of course, an important case, as you well know, and you have deliberated on it very con<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>scientiously.

The Majority Opinion quotes the Trial Judge as saying that when, at 11:15 p.m., he delivered additional instructions, the jury “gave no indications of fatigue or illness.” But this was still at a reasonable hour. There was no reason for the jury to have been helplessly fatigued at 11:15 p.m. However, this was still a long-distance from 5 a.m. In six hours the pendulum of the clock swings thousands of times and, with each stroke, after midnight, the eyelids of the average person become heavier, the muscles tire, the brain loses alertness and, as a consequence, attention flags, concentration weakens, resolution droops, determination falters, and eventually a sleepless juror may well lose <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>the will of resistance and become, like a rudderless ship at sea, the prey of every influence abroad on the waves of pressure and importunity.</p>

Who were the jurors to stand up in the jury box and protest against the omnipotence of the Court? No one informed them that they had the right to ask for a suspension of their deliberations until they had been refreshed with rest and slumber. They had been told that very morning that there would be no sleeping accommodations for them any more; they were given their suitcases. In every way that human intelligence can understand, they could only conclude that they had to reach a verdict before they could get to a bed again, and this time it had to be the bed in their own homes.</p>

The lawyers must limit their arguments, the jury must deliberate quickly, the verdict must be reached speedily, and justice must be satisfied on the run. Just as the ship of justice is <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>about to be launched, when the slightest miscalculation and carelessness will capsize it, everyone seems to feel that the important thing is to get home.

The Majority Opinion says, as already stated, that the jury should have complained. But to say that jurors may complain is like saying that a recruit in the army or navy may complain when his superior officer orders him on a detail of duty. Appellate courts often overlook that jurors are novices in the ways of the law, that they are strangers in an unexplored land, that they are children in the presence of awesome authority. Their every physical movement is guided and controlled by the Judge and the Court attaches. When the Judge said to the jurors that: “We are going to send you back again for another effort to see if you can’t come to a unanimous verdict, and we urge you to make every effort to do that”, his words were like a royal invitation, they constituted a command.</p>
    <p id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[181,1631,1148,482]]]'>During his entire speech to the jury at 5 a.m., the Judge made not the slightest suggestion that if they desired rest and needed sleep, he would see that they got it. What the Judge said was that he wanted a verdict, a unanimous verdict. He said this in courteous language, of course, but in words which could have left no doubt in the minds of the jury that he regarded it as their duty to return a verdict, and return it quickly.</p>

It is obvious what happened. Flesh overcame will, exhaustion broke down resolution, the <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>legions of sleep conquered the forces of vigilance. The verdict finally rendered may have been a correct one, but it also may have been an irresponsible one.</p>
    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[257,543,1153,811]]]'>There was a time when I wondered why it was that, even with so-called third degree methods, prisoners would confess to deeds which they could not possibly have committed. In many cases it developed that they signed confessions because they were not allowed to sleep. They were not subjected to physical violence, but by various devices and means they were denied sleep. The agony of the denial of sleep is a torture which surpasses almost any type of physical manhandling. It has been proved scientifically that the time comes when the victim who is denied sleep will sign any paper, confess to any murder or a hundred of them, if only he may close his eyes in dead relief so that the thousands of battering rams at every pore of consciousness may cease their maddening blows.</p>

Olcott, <a href="/johns-cas/2/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="2 Johns.

The Majority only says that there is no proof in this case that any juror was coerced into the verdict because of lack of repose. But the facts of Nature are as much a part of a Court record as the stenographic transcript. Nature writes with an accuracy and an inerasability that would shame the most faithful stylograph or stenotype. And when it is known that a jury is deadlocked at 5 a.m., after deliberating all night, and have not only had no sleep but no accommodations in which to rest comfortably, <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>and a Judge tells them they had better come to a unanimous conclusion pretty soon, the verdict becomes suspect when that verdict does come in pretty soon.</p>

In that case the Judge said to the Jury: “ ‘If some one of you should become physically unable to remain, the situation would be different, but as long as you are physically able to remain, it is your duty to undertake to agree.’ ” If, indeed, in the case at bar, the Judge had intimated to the jury in any way that he would allow them to sleep if they needed sleep, and he would see that they got the accommodations to sleep, the situation would have been considerably different. But the Judge failed to tell the jury that he would give them the opportunity to sleep, if they wanted to sleep, and, failing to do this, he ignored Justice who, herself, lay down on the couch of weariness and drifted off into the land of Nod where thought is a vagrant zephyr, deliberation a floating vapor, and decision uncontrolled, irresponsible, and often bizarre.</p>

Indeed, the coercion there was infinitely worse than the coercion here. It must be pointed out, however, that (1) this Court was con<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>vinced that the verdict should have been murder of the first degree rather than second degree, which the jury found; (2) the case was decided 41 years ago when accommodations for jurors (particularly for females) were far less civilized than they are now; and (3) during the trial the jurors had been permitted to separate, no hotel accommodations having been provided for them. It seems to me that the legislature has, in effect, invalidated the <em>Tenbroeclc </em>decision.</p>

Conceding that the jurors did not specifically ask for what the legislature required to be available for them “upon order of the court”, it is, in any event, clear that counsel for defendant, at 3 a.m., specifically requested that the jury’s deliberations be interrupted to give them rest. The question therefore is whether it was an abuse of discretion for the court, in the present case, to fail or refuse to do what it had power to do. And it is not without significance that this happened in the Capitol of the Commonwealth, not in some obscure place where criminal trials are rare.</p>

But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected. The inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence.

The real issue was not between murder and manslaughter but between manslaughter and Not Guilty. The situation is much different than in Tenbroeck, supra. In this case, after a review of the record, I am left with the unrelievable impression that the jury was coerced by fatigue and that this coercion did prejudice defendant.</p>
