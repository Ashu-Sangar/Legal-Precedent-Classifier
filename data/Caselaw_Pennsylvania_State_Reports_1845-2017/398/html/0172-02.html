Upon the prothonotary’s refusal to accept the transcript, Booz, without having sought leave of court to appeal, filed his complaint in the instant action of mandamus in the court of common pleas against the prothonotary for the purpose of compelling him to accept the appeal without leave of court. The prothonotary filed preliminary objections to the complaint <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>in mandamus setting forth that Booz had not complied with the terms of the Act of 1956 in attempting to appeal the judgment entered against him by the justice of the peace for a sum less than $100. The court dismissed the prothonotary’s preliminary objections in an opinion which held that the Act of 1956 is unconstitutional. See <em>Booz v.

The prothonotary then filed his answer to the complaint in which he admitted his refusal to accept the transcript and averred, as justification for his action, Booz’ failure to comply with the requirements of the Act of 1956. Booz moved for judgment on the pleadings. The court entered judgment on the pleadings for the defendant prothonotary in an opinion holding that the Act of 1956 is constitutional.

Obviously, he can neither aver nor prove that denial of leave so to appeal will be the result of a petition to the court therefor.

L. 2751, 21 PS §821a et seq. In that case, the plaintiff petitioned the court of common pleas for a writ of mandamus to compel the prothonotary to issue a writ of levari facias directed to the sheriff to proceed with execution on a judgment in favor of the plaintiff upon a debt secured by a mortgage. The prothonotary defended his refusal so to act on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to file a statement with the court releasing the obligors from personal liability for the secured debt or to have the fair market value of the mortgaged property fixed by the court upon petition by the judgment creditor as required by the Act of 1937, supra. The court refused a mandamus and on appeal, this court held the Act of 1937, supra, to be unconstitutional. Plainly enough, mandamus was there recognized as the appropriate form of action for testing the statute’s constitutionality and, very properly so, in the circumstances. If compliance with the procedure prescribed by the challenged statute were required before its validity was established, the plaintiff would thereby be forced to sacrifice in advance the very rights of property of which, as he timely com<a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>plained, it was unconstitutional for the Act to deprive him.</p>

L. 400, Section 6, 12 PS §2621.6, the same procedure, as in the first <em>Scott </em>case, was followed in order to test in limine the validity of the Act of 1941, supra. On this occasion, however, the Act of 1941 (which had obviated the defects in the Act of 1937) was held to be constitutional. But, here again, mandamus was the appropriate form of action for questioning the validity of the Act of 1941 since compliance with the challenged statute, before its validity had been judicially determined, would have required the plaintiff to surrender the rights which, he alleged, could not constitutionally be taken from him by the legislative enactment.</p>
