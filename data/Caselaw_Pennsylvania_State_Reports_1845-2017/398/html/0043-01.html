In 1945 he was paroled <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>from, that state to supervision in Pennsylvania. Less than five years after his parole, on June 20, 1949, after pleading guilty to murder generally, he was adjudged guilty of murder in the second degree in Wayne County, Pennsylvania.</p>

Hence, convictions without the Commonwealth should not be included in the computation of crimes’ committed, and the imposition of a life sentence as provided for under that act was illegal.</p>
