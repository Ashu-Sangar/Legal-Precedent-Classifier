After Lockman’s death, his administratrix, alleging that Harvey Loekman had secured the transfer and assignment of the bonds through fraud and undue influence, brought a bill in equity seeking the transfer and delivery of the bonds to decedent’s estate.

The Commonwealth assessed a transfer inheritance tax upon the full value of these bonds and this assessment was upheld by the court below. Mrs. Wallick appealed to this Court on the ground, inter alia, that, under the federal regulations, a joint tenancy with right of survivorship was created and that the tax should have been assessed on only one-half of the value of the bonds. Without mentioning the federal regulations, this Court held that, since the decedent retained complete custody and exercised exclusive dominion over the bonds, Mrs. Wallick’s possession and enjoyment of the bonds were <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>postponed until decedent’s death.; therefore, the Commonwealth could tax the entire value of the bonds since their transfer was not intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment until at or after death. <em>Estate of Diskin, </em><a href="/pa-super/105/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="105 Pa.
