The result was a conviction of murder in the second degree, which, with a recommendation of mercy, led Chief Justice Maxey to remark at the end of his opinion of affirmance, at <a href="/pa/360/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="360 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="475033" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0441-01">360 Pa. 441</a> (1948), that Peyton’s escape from a worse fate “cannot be attributed to any weakness in the Commonwealth’s case.” The ensuing sentence was from ten to twenty years in the penitentiary.</p>

On September 27th he met his nephew, the plaintiff, who had a certified check from his savings and loan association for $5000, and together they went to Margiotti’s office. Edward Peyton’s name is on the back of the check, together with that of plaintiff’s counsel, because Margiotti refused to take the check, even in escrow, and plaintiff had to go out and, with proper identification, have it cashed. The money was then given to Margiotti, who agreed that Peyton would get it back if his brother was not released from prison by <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>Christmas. Margiotti took the money, left his office, and shortly after his return a girl came in with a receipt reading: “Received of Thomas Peyton $5000., acct. services trial and Pardon Board Com. v. Peyton.” It was signed with Margiotti’s firm name, by Florinda R. Sirianni, bookkeeper, and handed to Thomas Peyton.</p>
    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[148,757,1151,753]]]'>Margiotti had successfully argued the case before the Pardon Board, and all that stood between Charles Peyton and freedom was the Governor’s signature. The Governor, however, withheld it and Peyton remained in prison not only over Christmas but for some time thereafter. In 1955 the family both wrote and visited Margiotti and demanded return of the money according to the oral contract, since their father had not been released by Christmas, but were refused. Margiotti died in 1956 and plaintiffs brought suit against his Estate. The jury found in their favor for the full amount and interest. The defense was that Margiotti had been underpaid and that the $5000 was an unequivocal fee.</p>

Justice Huston said, in the good language of the day, that “the proof in the cause was various, and not a little of it,” and it involved a contract to procure signatures to a petition to the governor for a pardon. He said: “The power to pardon may be considered as a part of the penal code for the state; it operates after trial to be sure, generally; but may be exercised before. It is as important that it should be free from bias, or prejudice, or crime, as that the trial should be so. No man would say, that if it were possible to procure a pardon by direct payment to a governor, it would be lawful to give one. To bribe others to deceive and impose on him, only differs in degree. ... all contracts to change the course of trials, or the effects of trials, whether to <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>obtain a liberation of a prisoner by money to the jailer, or to obtain a pardon by the use of money, directly or indirectly, must be void.”</p>

The defendant is an attorney-at-law, and, in dealing in this manner with one whom he makes his client, the parties are not regarded as in pari delicto . . . An attorney-at-law has been said to be a public officer. He is an officer of the court sworn to aid in the administration of justice and to act with all good fidelity both to his clients and to the court.

Contingent fees in both civil and criminal cases have, in my judgment, been greatly abused, with resulting grave injustice to clients who are poor, needy and/or injured. Especially is this so where an attorney charges a contingent fee of 30% to 50% in negligence cases in which the risk of loss, experience shows, is negligible. However, I regard the contingent fee as a necessity for a poor man. A poor man is entitled to representation by a lawyer of his choice, whom he considers able or very able. In many civil and criminal cases a poor person is unable to engage such a lawyer except on the basis of a contingent fee. Provided <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>such a fee is fair and reasonable,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> I believe that realistically it is both proper and necessary.</p>
    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[241,482,1153,700]]]'>With respect to the Board of Pardons, the Board requires, and for many years has required, the petitioner to state the fee which he has paid or has agreed to pay his attorney, and this would include a contingent fee or a fee partly paid and partly contingent. If the Board of Pardons considers the fee to be unfair to the client, or to indicate that it is being charged because of the attorney’s <em>supposed </em>influence with the Board of Pardons, the Board has the power to remedy the situation by refusing to hear the petition, or by refusing to permit that particular attorney to argue the case; and it probably has other disciplinary powers with respect to any improper or inordinate fee.</p>

Peyton” — was for services solely for obtaining a pardon by Christmas, it was obviously unreasonable. However, we all know that Margiotti’s death prevented his presenting his version of the agreement. Nevertheless, the jury believed plaintiffs’ witnesses; the lower Court approved the jury’s verdict; and since I find neither palpable abuse of discretion nor error of law, I would affirm the judgment.</p>
