The court also found that during this ten years they were known as Mr. and Mrs. Wagner by their friends.</p>

Five witnesses testified that the general reputation of the parties thereafter was that of man and wife. Examples: witness Helen Angstadt — “Q. Would you state what their general reputation was? A. Man and wife.” Witness Shrank — “Q. And what was that reputation? A. . . . man and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner, the same as the rest of the neighborhood. Everybody referred to them as Mr. and Mrs. Wagner. Q. And the general reputation was husband and wife? A. That’s right.” The court below did not reject this testimony but seems to have overlooked it when it said: “. . . Was it a consensus of opinion in the community?
