Myhalyk’s complaint averred, inter alia: (1) his place of residence and his membership in the United Mine Workers of America; (2) that the garnishee coal company had moneys in its possession due and owing to the Fund and to that extent the Fund had property whose situs was in Pennsylvania; (3) a <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>statement of the requirements set up by the Fund’s trustees which must be met by applicants for pension benefits together with an averment that Myhalyk met such requirements; (4) that, on July 20, 1952, Myhalyk applied for pension benefits and that the Fund has not only refused to pay such pension benefits but has even refused to accept his application for such benefits. Myhalyk’s complaint sought a judgment against the Fund and the issuance of a direction to the Fund that he, Myhalyk, be paid a monthly pension of $100 beginning July 20, 1952. Myhalyk and the garnishee entered into a stipulation wherein the garnishee agreed that it had in its possession $15,000 due the Fund and Myhalyk agreed that the garnishee pay all amounts in excess of $15,000 to the Fund. On January 21, 1959, counsel for the Fund and its trustees entered an appearance <em>de bene esse </em>and filed preliminary objections raising the question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.

The thrust of this argument is that the royalties in the hands of the garnishee coal company are not earmarked for the payment of pension benefits because such royalty payments under the terms of the Fund are made to the General Account of the Fund and do not reach the Pension Account until the Fund’s trustees, in the exercise of their discretion, so determine. Such a contention is without merit. The sole source from which any pension benefits are paid by the Fund is the royalty payments made by the coal operators to the Fund: absent such payments there would be no moneys available to pay the pension benefits, payment of which is one of the stated objectives of the Fund. Whatever may be the bookkeeping methods of the Fund and the method of allocation on the Fund’s books of the royalty payments when received, the fact remains that part of the royalty payments when received from the coal operators is eventually utilized for the payment of pensions. To hold otherwise would ignore the objectives of the Fund and attribute to the trustees an arbitrary attitude unjustified and unwarranted by the actual experience of the <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>operation of the Fund.

If, as the appellant argues, the Fund is amenable only to the courts of the District of Columbia, then those for whom the Fund was created would have to process and litigate their claims in a forum far distant from their places of residence; the obvious consequence would be to impose upon them a harsh and unnecessary burden and necessitate the expenditure of considerable time and money on their part. Time and again when this same Fund seeks, through the federal courts, to make the coal operators pay their obligations into the Fund it comes into Pennsylvania. Now when those who are entitled to payment of welfare benefits from the Fund seek to enforce its obligations to pay such benefits the Fund objects to coming into Pennsylvania.
