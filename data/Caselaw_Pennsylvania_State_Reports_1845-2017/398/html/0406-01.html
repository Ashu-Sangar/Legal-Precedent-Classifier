The explanation lies in appellant’s theory of the case, which was that the property had no market value but was intrinsically worth $382,000 before the taking and $90,-000 after. This brace of figures stems from considering the sand and gravel apart from the land, considering the West Wyoming and Forty Fort lands as an inseparable business unit, considering future profits or royalty values, considering the value of the sand and gravel needed to be left in place in order to support the levees, and considering the lack of comparable sales and the uniqueness of the situation. Both counsel stated that they had no testimony of fair market value to submit to the jury. The Court’s measure of damage was, according to its considered expression after argument en banc: “The market value of the entire tract before and after the taking, giving effect to the taking <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>and also taking into consideration in fixing the value that there is a deposit of sand and gravel on the land . . . the price which a purchaser willing but not obliged to buy would pay an owner willing but not obliged to sell, taking into consideration all uses to which the property is adapted and might in reason be applied (Vollmer v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/350/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="350 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="461149" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0223-01">350 Pa. 223</a>, 228).” See <em>Ward v.

    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[167,1200,1149,1136]]]'>The court below was right. Commonwealth does not condemn an owner’s business acumen or its results expressed in value. It condemns his property, which one man may use exceeding well, another ill, and a third not at all. The use of one’s talents is a private, not a public matter. If we own part of the common earth, we risk having to return it to the common use, and what we may expect to get for it in compensation is the common value. We so admire industry and ingenuity that the obverse of the appellant’s picture is easier to see fairly. If his fields contained diamonds and he never raised his hand to take them, he could not expect to be compensated after condemnation for all of his estimated diamonds at Tiffany prices. No more should the owner expect it who does make ado to realize them and sell them: he has done so while he owned them, but when the public needs his land for the general good, he may not hope to be paid thereafter for what he may no longer realize. All he can get is the value of his land as affected by an idea that may appeal to the general or average buyer.</p>

It has been suggested that the royalty value of the ascertained amount of sand and gravel in the ground would provide a ready measure of damage. We disagree, because royalty value is another facet of profits and business accounting.</p>

In general he is competent, since he has at least a general knowledge of what he owns: <em>Hencken v. Bethlehem Water Authority, <a href="/pa/364/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="364 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1223484" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0408-01">3</a></em><a href="/pa/364/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="364 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1223484" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0408-01">64 Pa. 408</a> (1950), <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20264" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="72 A.2d 264">72 A. 2d 264</a>. But he is subject to the current rules and occupies no special position as a witness. Appellant is in the position of the witness whose testimony was held incompetent in <em>White v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em><a href="/pa/229/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="229 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="971835" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0480-01">229 Pa. 480</a> (1911) <a href="/citations/?q=78%20A.%201035" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="78 A. 1035">78 A. 1035</a>, where we said: “. . . Not only did he repeatedly admit in his preliminary examination that he had no familiarity with the market value of the land in the neighborhood, but when testifying in chief he as repeatedly said that the estimate he gave was not a market value, but a value based on what he thought the farm would produce. When asked how he arrived at the market value, his reply was that he did not believe it right to consider market value; that he had his own notion as to what this land was worth, and was not governed by outside sales; that he estimated it from its earnings capacity, and that he could not confine himself in his estimate to market value. Thus the one standard by which the law measures damages in cases of this kind was distinctly repudiated by the witness. . .</p>

Certainly there is no clear evidence that the property has no market value. There is a thick and continuous blanket of sand and gravel under the Wyo* <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>ming Valley. The witness Banks spoke of a sale of sand and gravel land in the Valley: his company bought its tract of “stone” property. In thirty years this witness operated three sand and gravel enterprises in Luzerne County, and he mentioned one other concern in the business in 1955 besides himself and appellant. Even appellant named two outside the Valley but within a radius of ten miles, and two others in the Valley. He also said that his company has bought another piece of land two miles from the property in suit. There is evidence of some eighty holes bored on the acreage to determine the extent of pay-dirt. Altogether there seems to us ample evidence, even if there is little by way of comparable sales, from which a fact-finder advised by the “custom or common dealing of the country” could establish what value such land has among its neighbors and according to the rules. The figure of the Board of View, $6500, should be adopted as the value, in accordance with the agreement of the parties.</p>
