To achieve it, appellees offer very meager fare from the precedents. In the <em>First Baptist Church </em>case we spoke of “necessary” as being reasonable and not absolute, but at once excluded from it what is merely desirable. We also limited necessity to entrance, exit, light, and air, and denied exemption. In <em>Pittsburgh v. Third Presbyterian Church, </em><a href="/pa-super/10/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Pa. Super. 302" data-case-ids="819477" data-case-paths="/pa-super/10/0302-01">10 Pa. Superior Ct. 302</a> (1899), the Superior Court denied exemption for a janitor’s house and then indulged in variegated dictum <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>approving horse-sheds, shade, places for refreshment, and springs as things of religious necessity. Such dictum does not move us. There is nothing else helpful to the appellees in the precedents, unless it be the argument that in <em>Chevra v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa-super/116/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="116 Pa. Super. 101" data-case-ids="979726" data-case-paths="/pa-super/116/0101-01">116 Pa.

Judge Keller added that a church building would not lose its exemption because of heating space, robing rooms, and spaces for the storage of music, hymnals, Bibles, chairs, and the like. To shred the idea finer would reduce the situation to the absurdity of taxing the space in church between the bodies of the congregation or between their heads and the ceiling. Exempting an entire building when it is all put to religious use and not to purposes of gain has a reasonable and necessary basis. See also <em>Wynnefield United Presbyterian Church v.
