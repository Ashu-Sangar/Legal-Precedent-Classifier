There is no appellate Pennsylvania authority on this point. Criminal conversation, at early common law, was an action brought by <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>the husband against the other man with whom his wife committed adultery. The action was one of trespass vi et armis, <em>Antonelli v. Xenakis, </em><a href="/pa/363/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="363 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="1221658" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0375-01">363 Pa. 375</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="69 A.2d 102">69 A. 2d 102</a>, and in many states of America was the civil counterpart of the criminal charge of adultery, the only difference being that in the former the private right was vindicated and in the latter the public proscription. Although in other states adultery is no longer a criminal offense it is still so in Pennsylvania and may be punished by fine or imprisonment, or both. Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, §505, 18 P.S. §4505.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[154,977,1150,754]]]'>In this case the defendant, not being married, would not be guilty of adultery. This factor, however, is not decisive of the present case. It is conceded by both sides that under the common law the parties to a marriage became in legal contemplation one person and that person was the husband and hence a married woman was under a complete disability to institute legal action in her own name. 26 Am. Jur. §19, page 645; 42 C.J.S. 352, §697. Hence, a husband at common law had both a procedural and substantive right of action for criminal conversation against any man who made an adulteress out of his wife, but the wife, on the other hand, not only was under a procedural disability but also had no such substantive right of action.</p>

Ill, a married woman, among other things, was given the same right as <em>an unmarried person </em>to sue and be sued civilly, with certain exceptions not pertinent hereto. Thus the <em>procedural </em>disability to bring suit in her own name was removed and she could thereafter pursue the <em>substantive </em>rights of an unmarried person. Hence, appellant argues that since the Act of 1893 was in derogation of common law and having been passed prior to 1937, it must still be strictly construed under the Statu<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>tory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, art. IV, §58, subsection 8, 46 P.S. §558. This is correct and we would therefore be unable to hold that the Act of 1893 had conferred any substantive right of action for criminal conversation upon a married woman for, as pointed out by appellant, “it will be noticed that the act does not give a married woman the same right to sue or be sued as a husband has.” But the general emancipation of women in America did not begin or end with the Act of 1893. Under the earlier common law a married woman had no right whatever to pursue any action against a third person for conduct which caused her the loss of the consortium of her husband. But, nevertheless, we have held that she could pursue an action for personal injury in her own name or even an action for alienation of affections. See <em>Gernerd v. Gernerd, </em><a href="/pa/185/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="185 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="897977" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0233-01">185 Pa. 233</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%20884" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="39 A. 884">39 Atl. 884</a> (1898).
