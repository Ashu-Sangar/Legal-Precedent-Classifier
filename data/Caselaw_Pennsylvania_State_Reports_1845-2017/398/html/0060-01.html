In the closely related field of fair sales, the Act of July 1, 1937, P.L. 2672, 73 P.S. §§201-207 was held unconstitutional in <em>Commonwealth v. Zasloff, </em><a href="/pa/338/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="338 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1199887" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0457-01">338 Pa. 457</a> (1940), <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%2067" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="13 A.2d 67">13 A. 2d 67</a>, Mr. Justice Stern saying: <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>“If the Act confined itself to prohibiting sales below cost when intended to destroy competition, it would undoubtedly be valid . . .”. The instant Fair Trade Act of 1935 refers to products which are “in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others.” Plaintiff’s complaint avers that its gasoline is thus competitive in Pennsylvania, but the only evidence adduced in support is the bare statement by plaintiff’s single witness: “We are in competition with the major companies in this market ... [in Philadelphia].” Defendant’s answer expressly denies this averment.</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[221,1037,1154,854]]]'>We incline to the view that competition may be a self-serving and conclusionary word and that it may not necessarily exist merely because one says it does. Defendant sought to offer evidence to show that it did not exist in fact, but was foreclosed. He also offered unsuccessfully to prove a modification of the price arrangement in plaintiff’s telling him that he could sell at any price he wanted. Plaintiff suggests that from observation we could take judicial notice of competition, but it occurs to us that one company’s gasoline may not differ in content or quality from that of another merely because they differ in color or advertising slogans, at least in the regular gasolines, which seem to be uniform in price. And observation might reveal only that one man keeps his station neater than the next.</p>
    <p id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[220,1911,1144,98]]]'>Since competition is the nexus of the Act and has been asserted and denied, the need of proof is obvious.</p>
