        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nOn July 1,1957, Frank McCoy and James Allen entered the grocery store owned by Gaetano Sabelli, a former employer of McCoy, and perpetrated an armed robbery, during which McCoy shot and killed Sabelli while Allen acted as \u201clookout.\u201d McCoy was tried by a jury and convicted of murder in the first degree, sentenced to death and subsequently executed. Allen pleaded guilty to a charge of murder generally, was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Commonwealth then tried appellant Coleman, charging that he was a participant, driving the \u201cget-away\u201d car and therefore an accessory before and after the fact. Appellant was brought to trial before the Honorable Bernard J. Kelley and a jury on June 22, 1959, on Indictment No. 993, April Sessions, 1958, charging murder.\nAt the trial, both McCoy and Allen testified for the Commonwealth. Their testimony established that when appellant drove McCoy and Allen to the neighborhood of the crime, he had full knowledge that McCoy had a gun which he intended to use in committing a robbery of Sabelli\u2019s store.\nAppellant\u2019s defense was that he knew nothing about the plans of McCoy and Allen for the robbery, or McCoy\u2019s possession of a gun. He only knew what Allen told him, which was that Allen and McCoy were to borrow money from a numbers writer. He had never met McCoy before McCoy got into his car the morning of the robbery.\nThe jury must have believed Allen and McCoy, not Coleman, because on June 25, 1959, appellant was found guilty of murder in the first degree and the jury fixed the penalty at life imprisonment. On January 4, 1961, we affirmed the judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Coleman, 402 Pa. 238, 166 A. 2d 525 (1961).\nAppellant filed a petition for a new trial one year later on the grounds of after-discovered evidence. Judge Kelley heard testimony by Frank McCoy on January 25, 1962, shortly before he was executed. At that hearing McCoy\u2019s testimony did not contradict the testimony he had given at Coleman\u2019s trial, where he testified that he never knew Coleman before, that he heard Allen tell Coleman that they were going to see a numbers writer, but that he and Allen discussed the robbery in Coleman\u2019s presence. However, he did state for the first time that Coleman knew nothing about the robbery or the plans for the robbery and he refuted the testimony which Allen had given at Coleman\u2019s trial, namely that the robbery had been discussed by the three men at breakfast that morning.\nOn January 9, 1963, at a hearing before Judge Kelley, Allen recanted the testimony he had given at Coleman\u2019s trial. Allen stated that Ms original statement to the police, which did not implicate Coleman, was true and that Ms testimony at Coleman\u2019s trial, which contradicted his previous statement, was perjury. He again testified that appellant knew nothing about the robbery and that he (Allen) had lied at appellant\u2019s trial because he was angry at appellant for refusing to help him obtain a lawyer and for going out with his girl while he (Allen) was in jail. In addition, Allen testified that his decision to implicate Coleman was strengthened by favors he received from the District Attorney\u2019s office, and promises made by men at that office not to oppose him in having his sentence commuted and to help him to receive a better job while in prison.\nAfter \u201cdue and careful consideration,\u201d Judge Kelley denied appellant\u2019s petition for a new trial, nunc pro tunc, October 23, 1964.\nOn August 20, 1968, the appellant filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition, alleging, inter alia, that he was entitled to a new trial because of the exculpatory evidence shown in the post-trial testimony of Frank McCoy and James Allen.\nIf the lower court had believed the recanting testimony, a new trial would have been required.\nThe tests for granting a new trial in a criminal case on the ground of after-discovered evidence were set forth succinctly by the Superior Court in the case of Commonwealth v. Hanes, 162 Pa. Superior Ct. 206, 57 A. 2d 165 (1948). At page 209 the court stated: \u201cA new trial in a criminal case will be awarded on the ground of after-discovered evidence where the evidence in question (1) has been discovered after the trial and could not have been obtained at or prior to the conclusion of the trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence; (2) is not merely corroborative or cumulative; (3) will not be used solely for impeaching credibility of a witness; and (4) is of such nature and character that a different verdict will likely result if a new trial is granted.\u201d\nIf believed, the sworn testimony of Frank McCoy and James Allen, contradicting their previous testimony, would clearly require a different verdict because appellant\u2019s original conviction depended on the testimony given by McCoy and Allen at trial.\nAfter a hearing before Judge Kelley on November 28, 1968, appellant\u2019s petition was denied in an opinion filed February 26, 1969. From this order he prosecuted this appeal.\nThe well-established rule is that an appellate court may not interfere with the denial or granting of a new trial where the sole ground is the alleged recantation of state witnesses unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Green, 387 Pa. 515, 128 A. 2d 577 (1957), Commonwealth v. Sholder, 201 Pa. Superior Ct. 642, 644-645, 193 A. 2d 632 (1963).\nRecanting testimony is exceedingly unreliable, and it is the duty of the court to deny a new trial where it is not satisfied that such testimony is true. Commonwealth v. Scull, 200 Pa. Superior Ct. 122, 130, 186 A. 2d 854 (1962). There is no less reliable form of proof, especially when it involves an admission of perjury. Commonwealth eso rel. Leeper v. Russell, 199 Pa. Superior Ct. 93, 96, 184 A. 2d 149 (1962), Commonwealth v. Sholder, supra.\nThe only evidence which would corroborate the new testimony Allen offers in addition to Coleman\u2019s consistently stated explanation is Allen\u2019s first statement to the police and the testimony of McCoy. We cannot say that Judge Kelley\u2019s decision to refuse to believe Allen and McCoy now, after a full hearing on which he was able to evaluate the demeanor of the witnesses and the reasons for their inconsistent statements was an abuse of discretion.\nOrder affirmed.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMb. Justice Robbbts:\nSolely on the basis of testimony given by two alleged co-felons, appellant stands convicted of first degree murder. Both co-felons have now recanted their testimony. The majority holds that appellant\u2019s right to a new trial depends on whether the hearing court believed the recanting testimony, and that since it did not, its decision to deny a new trial must be affirmed. I believe, however, that we must examine this case somewhat more closely and that, given the nature of the original testimony and the facts surrounding the recanting testimony, the hearing court erred when it denied appellant a new trial. Hence, I must dissent.\nAppellant was tried as a participant in the robbery-murder of a grocery store owner. The issue in dispute at appellant\u2019s trial was whether, when he drove his co-felons to the grocery store, he knew that they were going there to commit a robbery. Both Frank McCoy, the murderer, and James Allen, the other robber, testified that appellant was informed of the robbery beforehand; appellant testified that he thought he was driving McCoy and Allen to a numbers writer to borrow money. McCoy testified that appellant knew McCoy had a gun; appellant denied this. The jury evidently believed the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and convicted appellant.\nPrior to appellant\u2019s trial, McCoy had been found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to death. We granted him a new trial, see 401 Pa. 100, 162 A. 2d 636 (1960); but he was again found guilty and sentenced to death. On July 18, 1961, this Court affirmed the judgment, see 405 Pa. 23, 172 A. 2d 795 (1961). On January 25, 1962, shortly before he was to be executed, McCoy recanted the testimony he had given at appellant\u2019s trial. He testified under oath that appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t know about this crime\u201d and that appellant had not seen the gun.\nIt was not until nearly one year later that the Commonwealth\u2019s second witness, Allen, likewise recanted his testimony. On January 9, 1963, Allen, admitting under oath that he had committed perjury at appellant\u2019s trial, testified that appellant was completely innocent. This was now in conformity with the testimony Allen gave at his own trial, where he stated that appellant was unaware that a crime was to be committed. Further, Allen indicated why he had lied at appellant\u2019s trial. While Allen was in jail and appellant out on bail, appellant had refused Allen\u2019s request for money to hire a lawyer, and had attempted to date Allen\u2019s girl friend. Allen is presently in jail serving a life sentence for his participation in the murder.\nThus appellant stands convicted solely on testimony which originally emanated from a corrupt source, alleged co-felons, and has now been fully and explicitly recanted. One witness, Allen, has returned to his former story exculpating appellant, giving a highly credible reason for his deceitful deviation. The other, McCoy, had changed his testimony only after all avenues of appeal had been exhausted and he was about to die. Both men are now admitted perjurers. Appellant, on the other hand, has consistently told the same account, and his actions on the day of the crime were perfectly consistent with his testimony.\nI think that under these circumstances it is how for a jury to determine where lies the truth. It is not now a question of whether the hearing court believed or disbelieved the recanting testimony. For the recantation by both Commonwealth witnesses, in the circumstances of the instant case, places the Commonwealth\u2019s trial evidence too much in doubt. We should not forget our \u201creluctance to entrust plenary powers over tlie life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges.\u201d Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 156, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 1451 (1968). Appellant deserves the right to have a jury pass on the credibility of the recanting testimony.\nAccordingly, I dissent and would grant appellant a new trial.",
