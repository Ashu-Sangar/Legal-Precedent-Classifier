Defendant has thereby been effectively precluded from determining his rights vis-a-vis the additional defendant in this suit. Similarly, since the result is the same, a denial of a defendant’s petition to join an additional defendant nunc pro tunc under Rule 2253 after the expiration of the specified 60 days from service of plaintiffs’ complaint on the original defendant is final. Therefore, the Act of 1925, supra, is inapplicable. The Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, §1, 17 P.S. §41, provides a right of appeal, and such an appeal may be prosecuted in accordance with the Act of May 19, 1897, supra, which permits an appeal to be taken “from an order, judgment, or decree of any court of common pleas . . . within three calendar months from <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>the entry of the order, judgment, or decree appealed from, . . . .” The appeal in this case having been filed 42 days after entry of the order of the lower court, it was clearly timely filed.</p>

It was <em>not </em>intended by this act to impose a uniform appeal period and procedure for all matters which are appeal-able. Section 2 thereof specifically states: “The provisions of this act shall not apply to any order, decision, judgment or sentence of a court of record which under any act of assembly heretofore enacted may be appealed to an appellate court.” We have already determined that the order here appealed from was appealable under the Act of June 16, 1836, supra, in accordance with the time limitations specified in the Act of May 19, 1897, supra.

Accordingly he claims he did not have an opportunity to learn of the basis for considering the joinder until some time after June of 1968, when Alan Liljestrand was discharged from the service. The critical information was allegedly obtained from the testimony elicited during the deposition of one Charles Duncan on August 22, 1968. This testimony was subsequently corroborated by Alan Liljestrand on October 8, 1968.

The court found, and defendant’s counsel admitted, that the presence of Ralph Spieglemann near the accident scene had been long known, because his name appeared on the police report. In addition, no deposition had been taken of Charles Duncan, who ultimately revealed the allegedly critical information, until almost three years after the accident and more than one year after counsel had entered his appearance for Alan Liljestrand. Duncan had been a passenger in the Liljestrand car, and, therefore, would have presumably been a readily accessible source of information. No consultation occurred with Alan Liljestrand himself until some four months after his discharge from the service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> These circumstances do indicate that counsel for Liljestrand was not diligent in his preparation of this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Yet, such joinder may also result in a delay in the trial, because the proposed additional defendant has not participated in discovery proceedings. The plaintiffs’ litigation against original defendants has already been substantially delayed by Alan Liljestrand’s induction into the armed services, and at least one pre-trial conference has already been postponed. We therefore hold that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to have .concluded that the trial of plaintiffs’ cause may be delayed by permission of late joinder and such a delay was not justified ón the basis of the “cause” alleged by defendant Alan.
