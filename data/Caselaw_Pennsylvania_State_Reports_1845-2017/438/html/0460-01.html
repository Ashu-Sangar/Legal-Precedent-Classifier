    <p id="b577-8" data-blocks='[["BL_577.14",577,[138,1199,1156,530]]]'>Pursuant to The Local Tax Enabling Act, Act of December 31, 1965, P. L. 1257, §1, 53 P.S. §6901 <em>et seq. </em>{Supp. 1970) (Act 511), the School District of Upper Merion, Montgomery County, passed a tax resolution which imposed a $10.00 “occupational privilege” tax on individuals employed within the district, whose annual income exceeds $1,000.00. The resolution provides that the employers within the School District are to collect the tax from their employees, retaining a 2% collection commission.</p>
    <p id="b577-9" data-blocks='[["BL_577.15",577,[131,1751,1155,537]]]'>On October 24, 1967, several employees within the School District, appellants herein, instituted an action in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, whereby they sought: (1) a declaration that the method of collection was unconstitutional, and (2) appropriate injunctive relief. There being no controversy as to the pertinent facts, the issue was presented to the court below on the briefs, and a final decree was entered on June 9, 1969, rendering judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>

Therefore, it is claimed that the local ordinance is unconstitutional insofar as it provides that the tax: is to be collected by employers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In support of their argument, the appellants point out that Act 511 does specifically provide for an earned income tax to be collected by employers (Act of December 31, 1965, P. L. 1257, §9, as amended, August 11, 1967, P. L. 228, §1) , although no similar provision was made for the collection: of an occupational privilege tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

L. 1257, §2, 53 P.S. §6902 (Supp. 1970) (Emphasis added). This language is sufficiently broad to permit the tax to be collected directly by the taxpayer’s employer, who would forward the taxes to the taxing authority. <em>Wilkinsburg Borough v.

The general provision for the collection of taxes under Act 511 is also broad enough to permit employers’ collection of the tax: “Any such political subdivision is hereby authorized to provide by ordinance or resolution for the <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>creation of such bureaus or the appointment and compensation for such officers, clerks, collectors, and other assistants and employes, either under existing departments, <em>or otherwise as may be deemed necessary, </em>for the assessment and collection of taxes imposed under authority of this act.” Act of December 31, 1965, P.

Collection of the occupational privilege tax by the taxpayers’ employers is an efficient and quite reasonable means of collection, and does not prejudice the employees to any extent. <em>See Swatara Twp. v.
