He filed post-trial motions which were overruled and was sentenced to a term of from four to ten years. No direct appeal was taken. In 1968 he filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition alleging he had been denied his right to appeal. Following appointment of counsel and a hearing, Diaz was granted the right to file an appeal nunc pro tunc.</p>

Further, although the record does not disclose that Diaz was informed of his lawyer’s action, he has filed a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief which raises several issues.

This is what appellant raised in his <em>pro se </em>brief, and as to that claim the facts are as follows. What is involved is not one confession but three. The first was uttered just prior to appellant’s arrest. The police suspected Diaz of having committed the stabbing and went to his home. After they had gotten out of their car and as they were walking across the sidewalk, Diaz came out of the house with his hands up and said “[s] omething to the effect—it was broken English— that I give up, I did it. . . .” The second was uttered after Diaz was under arrest while the two officers were taking him to the police station. The third was given to two different police officers while appellant was at the police station.</p>

After a hearing the court suppressed 2 but refused to suppress 3. At that hearing there was no mention at all of the first confession, and even though the suppression order states that statements made to Patrolmen Bell and Shank shall be suppressed (it was Bell who testified at the trial as to the first confession), it can therefore have no effect on the admissibility of that con<a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>fession. At trial, Bell’s testimony as to the first confession was admitted. Appellant originally objected but after a side-bar conference withdrew the motion to strike. No evidence as to the second confession was introduced during the trial. After Sergeant Henley and County Detective Durnell testified as to the third confession, appellant (after expressly conceding the voluntariness of that confession and waiving a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing) moved to strike the testimony of both men on the theory that he had not been adequately apprised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>and that there had been no intelligent waiver of those rights. The court granted the motion to strike that part of Durnell’s testimony which quoted Diaz’s oral statement and denied the motion to strike Henley’s testimony as to the same oral statement. Therefore, what was before the jury was Bell’s testimony as to the first confession and Henley’s as to the third.</p>

There is nothing in the record to indicate that this statement was anything other than completely voluntary, and it was uttered prior to the time appellant was under arrest and before the officers could possibly have given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He also argues that Henley’s testimony as to the third confession should be stricken because it was involuntary. It is also possible that the third confession was obtained through the “exploitation of the original illegality,” (The second confession), <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Banks, <a href="/pa/429/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="429 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1913544" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0053-01">429 Pa. 53</a>, 59, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20416" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="239 A.2d 416">239 A. 2d 416</a> (1968), although it would be almost impossible to know whether the third confession resulted from an exploitation of the illegal second confession or was the fruit of the valid first confession.</p>

      <em>Anders </em>was designed to ensure that the holding in <em>Douglas </em>would not be undercut by the simple expedient of having a lawyer, rather than a judge, state that counsel could do “no good.” It mandated that appointed counsel was to act as an advocate, arguing any nonfrivolous claim. Further, <em>Anders </em>required the appellate court to watch over appointed counsel, to make certain that all nonfrivolous claims were properly raised and argued. Thus when, pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>an appellate court scrutizines the record for any non-frivolous claim, it does not act as advocate for the defense. It acts merely to be sure that the state has properly afforded the indigent his day in court. Its task is to see that the poor man has received what the rich man can buy—“counsel’s examination into the record, research of the law, and marshalling of arguments on his behalf.” <em>Douglas v.

If there is an arguable issue, we do not advance or suggest the Commonwealth’s response. That is the district attorney’s function. In the instant case, the confessions might have been improperly admitted. Whether this alleged error was harmless is an issue to be argued by <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>the beneficiary of the error, the prosecution, and it is a proposition that the prosecution must establish beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a>, 24, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">87 S. Ct. 824</a>, 828 (1967). Since it is at least arguable that an improperly admitted confession would do some harm to a defendant’s case, <em>Anders </em>certainly requires us to appoint counsel to make this non-frivolous argument <em>before </em>we decide it on the merits.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[166,831,1160,869]]]'>It is my view that appellant has not been accorded his day in court. <em>Anders </em>mandates that an indigent be given an effective advocate where there is <em>any </em>arguable issue. The majority admits there is one here, but refuses appellant effective counsel to argue it, deciding instead that the claim would not win relief on its merits. The majority, by thus shifting its role from watchdog to advocate, has in effect returned to the very standard of review condemned in Douglas—it has gone through the record and decided that counsel would do “no good.” I think it ironic that this .appellant is new before our Court only because he was found to have been denied his right to appeal under <em>Douglas. </em>We have now given him a chance to assert his right to appeal, but we have refused to provide him with an active advocate to argue his case. I must dissent.</p>
