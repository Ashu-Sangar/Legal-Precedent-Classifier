Appellant argues that the presence of an allegation of unconstitutionality in its complaint cures the defect this Court emphasized in <em>Y.M.C.A. </em>That decision, however, does not state that a mere allegation of unconstitutionality is sufficient to confer jurisdiction on a court of equity. It only states in a negative way one set of circumstances in which equity does not have jurisdiction. In a positive sense, what is required to confer jurisdiction on an equity court is the existence of a substantial question of constitutionality (and not a mere allegation) and the absence of an adequate statutory remedy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Neither of those cases, however, involved a real estate tax as this one does. In the real estate tax area most of the grave constitutional questions have already been decided, and most of the actions, including this one, question not the underlying statute but rather its application. In such a situation, the administrative body which has responsibility for applying the statute on a day-by-day basis should have the first opportunity of studying and ruling on any new application. It may well be that all problems will be worked out at that stage, and neither party will be required to resort to the judicial system.</p>

VII, §704, 72 P.S. §5453.704, makes no explicit provision for the payment of interest on the amount due it as a refund. The fact that the statute does not specifically provide for interest does not mean that interest can not be part of any award. The Act of April 6, 1859, P. L. 381, §1, 12 P.S. §781, provides for the collection of interest or any verdict and the entry of every general judgment. Our case law stands for the same proposition. “The weight of authority appears to be that where the taxpayer is entitled to a refund on an excess payment of taxes, whether such right accrues by virtue of statute or not, the taxpayer is entitled to interest on the refund if no statute or public policy militates against it.” <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co. v.

Since no statute or public policy of this Commonwealth militates against the payment of interest, Rochester will be able to recover if it is determined that it is entitled to a refund. It is not necessary to determine at this time as to what period interest may be collected. See <em>Jefferson Memorial Park v. West Jefferson Hills School District, </em><a href="/pa/397/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="397 Pa. 629" data-case-ids="1286256" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0629-01">397 Pa. 629</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20861" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="156 A.2d 861">156 A. 2d 861</a> (1959).

In both those cases equity, while acting with haste, did not give the eases the thorough analysis to which they would have been subjected if the administrative process had been used. As a result, the decrees were overbroad, and this Court was required to decide whether taxes could be assessed retroactively after the mistakes came to light. Expertise in this field lies in the administrative bodies, and we should be slow, as far as jurisdiction is concerned, to favor equity courts over them.</p>

Since the revaluation substantially increased the tax valuations of the properties located in these nine subdivisions, the practical result was that the affected property owners paid a higher tax on their property than did similarly situated property owners in the other twenty-nine subdivisions. Appellant, the largest landholder in Indiana County, believing that the levying of taxes on the basis of this partial revaluation violated the uniformity provision of Article VIII, §1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, brought this suit in equity. The trial court sustained the County’s preliminary objections and a majority of this Court today sustains that ruling on the theory that equity has jurisdiction over cases challenging the imposition of a tax only where there is “a substantial question of constitutionality . . . and the absence of an adequate statutory remedy.” Because I believe that this result is contrary to our prior case law and unnecessarily restricts equity’s proper function, I must dissent.</p>

Reading, </em><a href="/pa/402/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="402 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1296717" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0592-01">402 Pa. 592</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="167 A.2d 469">167 A. 2d 469</a> (1961). There this Court examined the historical basis of equitable jurisdiction in tax cases and concluded that equity had no jurisdiction where the challenge was not of constitutional dimension, saying: “We conclude, therefore, that, absent a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute or of official action thereunder, equity has no jurisdiction to restrain the collection of taxes. . . .” 402 Pa. at 598, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="167 A.2d 469">167 A. 2d at 472</a>. It is my view that the rationale of this case unstintingly supports the presence of equity jurisdiction in a case such as the one before us today.</p>

If uniformity means anything it means that similarly situated taxpayers must be treated equally. Whether the inequality arises from a variance in the rate used or from varying standards of assessment makes no difference—any inequality is unconstitu<a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>tional. To levy taxes against property owners in one locality on the basis of recent valuations while utilizing older, lower valuations for calculating the taxes due from taxpayers owning property in other portions of the county is a seemingly patent violation of uniformity. This is not a case involving the revaluation of a single property based on improvements or other specific changes in circumstances, but a general revaluation of large areas of property based only on general changes in the economy. Such partial revaluation obviously creates the probability that two standards of valuation will be used and that there will be an uneven allocation of the tax burden. <em>Banger’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/109/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="109 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="542246" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0079-01">109 Pa. 79</a> (1885).</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[175,1104,1158,812]]]'>I can see no reason to reverse our long held position that equity has jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to tax extractions. If a tax is inherently constitutionally defective, there is no reason to confine those affected to narrow statutory remedies. Why should every property owner in Indiana County have to assume the burden of appealing the propriety of his payment when the large questions could expeditiously and efficiently be resolved in a single suit? Further, a court of equity is certainly as competent as a tax review board in deciding constitutional questions. It is my conclusion that where the intrinsic constitutionality of a taxing scheme is challenged there is no reason to force that litigation into an administrative forum, and that equity ought to have jurisdiction over such cases.</p>
