The aggregate limit of coverage for fire loss under these policies was $50,000.</p>
    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[153,900,1153,1475]]]'>In April, 1968, appellants filed a sworn statement in proof of loss with appellee insurance companies stating a total loss of $62,000 and claiming to be entitled to a recovery of $50,000 under the policies. The Donegal Mutual Insurance Company retained appellee Claude R. Martin Company, an insurance adjustment company, to handle appellants’ claim; the Martin Company in turn referred the claim to its Hazelton resident agent, appellee Carl A. Pécora. The other three insurance companies retained appellee General Adjustment Bureau, Inc. to adjust the claims for them, and that company referred them to appellee Edmund M. Gromelski, its Hazelton branch manager. Thereafter, in June, 1968, appellee insurance companies, through their adjusters, offered to settle the claim for $32,623.56. Dissatisfied with this offer and unable to secure a better one, appellants commenced suit by filing a complaint which does not appear in the record before us. Subsequently, they filed an amended complaint, setting forth the facts above and praying for (a) compensation for their fire loss under the insurance policies, (b) damages in excess of the policy limits, plus expenses, interest and punitive damages for breach of contract by appellee insurance companies, and (c) similar damages for breach of contract by appellee insurance adjustment companies and their two respective local agents.</p>

The court below sustained the demurrers of both appellee adjustment companies and their agents to those counts of the complaint alleging breach of contract by them. The court also sustained the demurrers of the four appellee insurance companies with regard to the claims of punitive damages and damages in excess of policy limits. In that part of the order sustaining these demurrers, the court did not grant appellants leave to amend their complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellants thereupon brought this appeal.</p>

As a general rule, an order which sustains preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer without dismissing the complaint or éntering judgment or otherwise terminating the action between the parties is interlocutory and, therefore, lacks the requisite finality to be an appealable order. Where, however, the order does, in effect, terminate the action between the parties, or so restricts the pleader with respect to further amendment of his complaint as virtually to put him out of court on the cause of action he seeks to litigate, it is a definitive and final order and, thus, appealable. <em>Sullivan v.

The second part of the order sustained the demurrers of the two appellee insurance adjustment companies and their respective agents to the entire breach of contract claim against them.

    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.7",394,[185,953,1161,867]]]'>It is appellants’ position that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the insurance adjusters (including their two local agents) to this claim because the complaint contained allegations sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract against them. Appellants contend that the following allegations establish that cause of action: (1) the existence of insurance contracts between the appellants and the insurance companies, (2) an agency relationship between the insurance companies and the adjusters, (3) action by the adjusters outside the scope of their authority— essentially the failure, by means of unreasonable or fraudulent acts and delays, to negotiate in good faith an adjustment of the claim—which constituted a breach of the insurance contracts and rendered them personally liable for the breach.</p>

Without such a relationship, it is impossible for the adjusters to be liable for breach of contract to the insureds. If the adjusters had been acting within the scope of their authority, their alleged failure to per<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>form their principals’ contractual duties which had been delegated to them could be attributed to the principals, thereby rendering the insurance companies liable for breach of contract. But actions by the adjusters beyond the scope of their authority could not result in the imposition upon them of contractual duties to the appellants which they had never assumed. The adjusters had a duty to their principals, the insurance companies, to perform whatever tasks were assigned to them, but this duty did not serve to create a contractual obligation between the adjusters and appellants.</p>

Jackson, </em><a href="/pa/387/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="387 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="1271014" data-case-paths="/pa/387/0611-01">387 Pa. 611</a>, 623, <a href="/citations/?q=129%20A.2d%20490" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="129 A.2d 490">129 A. 2d 490</a> (1957) is misplaced. There the Court acknowledged the well-settled proposition “. . . that a person who purports to make a contract on behalf of a principal whom he has no power to bind thereby becomes subject to liability to the other party thereto, upon an implied warranty of authority.” See, also, <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency, </em>§329 (1958). That rule is not the equivalent of the proposition which appellants seek to support by it, viz., that an agent becomes liable in assumpsit on his principal’s contract when he prevents the performance of that contract by actions which exceed the scope of his authority. Under the <em>Kribbs </em>rule, the agent (not the principal) is held liable on a contract which the agent himself made, although purporting to act for the principal. Under appellant’s theory an agent to whom some duties under an existing contract between the principal and a third party are delegated would become personally liable for performance of all the duties under that contract simply because he exceeded the authority delegated to him by his principal—a separate contractual arrangement to which the third person was in no way privy. Appellants’ theory simply does not <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>follow from the cited rule, nor do we believe it is supported by any other rule of contract law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

This rule is a sound one because a plaintiff should not be put out of court completely merely because he alleges the wrong measure of damages. We have not had occasion to speak on the question of which, if any, preliminary objection is the appropriate one by which to raise this objection. The lower courts of the Commonwealth have reached inconsistent answers to the problem. Compare, e.g., <em>Lippincott v. Houseberg, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/19/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="19 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 558" data-case-ids="1643175" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/19/0558-01">19 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 558</a>, 559 (C. P. Northampton Co. 1959) holding that, “[w]here a defendant wishes to raise the question of the wrongful measure of damages pleaded, he should do so by a preliminary objection in the nature of a motion to strike off the complaint because of lack of conformity to law” with <em>Spadel v. Zarlinski, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/39/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="39 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 452" data-case-ids="1693792" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/39/0452-01">39 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 452</a>, 457 (C. P. Northumberland Co. 1966): “It is the position of defendant that the pleading must be stricken because damages are claimed [which are not recoverable] . . . The fact that the relief requested is not justified is not a ground for attacking the complaint, as at the pleading stage plaintiff is merely required to aver the relief he seeks . . . and defendant is not required to plead to plaintiff’s demand for relief.” In our opinion an allegation of damages or a prayer for damages which are not legally recoverable in the cause of action pleaded is impertinent matter in the sense that it is irrelevant to that cause of action. Thus, a preliminary objection in the nature of a motion to strike off impertinent matter would appear to be the appropriate means through which to chal<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>Ienge an erroneous prayer for damages. In the case at bar, appellees did in fact attack the impertinent matter by way of a motion to strike as well as a demurrer.</p>
