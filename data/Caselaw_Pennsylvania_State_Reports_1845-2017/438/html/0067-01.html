On May 27, 1969, representatives of the <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>Philadelphia police and of the Office of the District Attorney of Philadelphia County visited Polak’s establishments. After viewing portions of the allegedly obscene motion pictures they served Polak with a witness subpoena ordering him to appear at a hearing to be held on June <em>2, </em>1969, and with what purported to be a subpoena duces tecum ordering him to bring to the hearing copies of some eight motion pictures which were in his possession.</p>
    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[175,877,1157,1072]]]'>At the June 2, 1969, hearing, Polak appeared without the films and further refused to produce them. He was then held in contempt of court by Judge Barbieri. Polak claims that his contempt conviction is defective for three reasons. He argues that the trial court had no authority to issue the subpoena duces tecum because there was at the time of issuance no “cause or matter” pending before the court as required by the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, 17 P.S. §251; that the subpoena duces tecum was invalid on its face in that there is no indication on the face of the document that it was issued under court authority as required by the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, §22, 17 P.S. §2079; and that enforcement of the subpoena duces tecum would violate his rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We feel that Polak is correct in. his first contention, and therefore do not reach the other issues.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[174,1969,1153,425]]]'>The Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, 17 P.S. §2079, provides that: “Each of the said courts is empowered to issue writs of subpoena, under their official seal, into any county of this commonwealth, to summon and bring before the respective court any person to give testimony in any cause or matter depending before them, under the penalties hitherto appointed and allowed in any such case by the laws of this commonwealth.”</p>

      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>We believe this statute to require, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a subpoena, that there be some preexisting matter or cause pending before the court. The essence of a subpoena’s function is to aid the court in the resolution of litigation, so if there is no formal proceeding pending before the court there can be no legitimate reason to issue a subpoena. Our courts of common pleas, broad though their jurisdiction may be, are not possessed of the power to originate the kind of judicial or investigatory proceedings which were instituted in this case. They are not arms of either the prosecution or the defense, and their neutrality must be jealously protected.</p>

    <p id="b185-7" data-blocks='[["BL_185.9",185,[154,1535,1149,751]]]'>Much of the difficulty involved in this case stems from the fact that the films, as communicatory embodiments, enjoy the protection of the first amendment. Because of the first amendment problems involved in the seizure of allegedly obscene communicatory embodiments, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that such materials cannot be seized without a prior adversary hearing being held on the issue of their obscenity. <em>A Quantity of Copies of Books v.

However, the first amendment is not the sole restraint on the Commonwealth’s behavior in this case, and I believe that the fourth and fifth amendments forbid the procedure attempted here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Ct. 430</a> (1950). The subpoena procedure attempted in this case works a patent violation of this restriction. No probable cause was established or even alleged, yet Polak was ordered to produce, for court scrutiny, films in his possession. If this procedure is legitimate then, by analogy, a court could order an individual to produce for court and prosecution inspection, without probable cause, a weapon which was suspected of having been used in the commission of a crime. This is simply constitutionally impermissible.</p>
