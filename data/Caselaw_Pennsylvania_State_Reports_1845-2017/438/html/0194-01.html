The first seeks recovery of $16,661,489, plus interest, for financial advice allegedly given to South Penn Oil Company (appellee’s prior name) by appellant under an agreement to pay him at the prevailing rate in the custom of the trade if the recommendations were accepted and used in whole or part. The second seeks recovery of $1,000,000, plus interest, under an oral agreement to pay appellant at the prevailing rate in the custom of the trade if he would discreetly negotiate with Tidewater Oil Company, <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>if lie were successful in learning that Tidewater’s holdings in South Penn could be purchased at a given price and if South Penn were able to purchase those holdings.

James Breene, whose family had long been connected with the corporate affairs of appellee, and who was about to inherit stock in South Penn, met with appellant in Arizona in March, 1962. He explained to appellant that in his opinion South Penn “wasn’t going any place” and that appellant with his extensive experience in corporate matters could be of great use to the company. He stated that John Selden, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of appellee, should want to know about any recommendations appellant might have. Over the next few months appellant studied South Penn’s situation and formulated recommendations. He spoke with Breene several times about his ideas during this period. Towards the end of May, 1962 Breene contacted Selden and told him that Walter Davis would like to discuss with him some matters concerning South Penn. Breene told appellant that Selden had agreed to meet with him and had suggested that he have ready an outline of the plan. After an abortive attempt on June 11 in Pittsburgh, they met on June 24 in Toronto.</p>

South Penn should advance continually the market price of its shares by purchase of its own shares on the open market on the American Stock Exchange. 2. South Penn should acquire Tidewater’s holdings of its shares (amounting to 9-11% of outstanding shares) and thus eliminate a large bloc overhanging the market and eliminate a source of opposition to an expansion program. 3. South Penn should negotiate property-reserve acquisitions through shares of its stock which with South Penn leading the way will be increasing in value. 4. In addition South Penn should—a. increase the number of authorized shares from 1,715,000 to 10,000,000. b. change its listing from the American to the New York Exchange, c. change its name to Pennzoil Company, d. strengthen the board of directors by replacing those who retire by experienced corporate executives of national prestige. 5. South Penn should expand earnings through acquisition of additional oil and gas production and reserves through merger and/or purchase with shares at advanced prices. Also, there should be substantial extension of product-distributorships, plants and marketing facilities under experienced personnel. 6. South Penn should—a. issue quarterly reports to shareholders, b. split the shares as the market price advances, c. increase dividends, d. not make any purchases involving the issuance of any substantial amount of stock-conversion rights.</p>

On May 6, 1968, appellee served on appellant, under Pa. R.C.P. 4014, a request for admission of 544 writings. Appellant filed an answer on May 16 stating that he had not been able to read and comprehend the documents because of their volume and that the documents covered so many peo<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>pie and locations that it was impossible for him to ascertain their accuracy. On June 5,1968, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, and on September 12, 1968, it filed preliminary objections to appellant’s answer to the requests for admissions. This motion and these objections were argued before the court below on September 27, 1968, and on December 16 the court directed the entry of summary judgment in favor of appellee and declared that the requests for admissions were deemed to be admitted because appellant’s answer was insufficient. Appellant then moved for reconsideration of the order relating to the requests for admissions and at the same time filed exceptions to the order for summary judgment and a motion to strike it off. Appellant next moved to have his motion for reconsideration listed for argument before the court (Judge Oleum ) and his exceptions and motions to strike listed for argument before a court en banc. On December 26 the court below denied both motions. At No. 145 March Term, 1969, appellant is appealing the entry of summary judgment; at No. 169 March Term, 1969, appellant is appealing from the two orders of December 26, 1968, denying argument on the post-judgment exceptions and motions.</p>

It granted summary judgment as to the second cause of action because the contract was made on Sunday, because Selden lacked authority and because appellant did not perform his obligation under the contract. The court granted summary judgment <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>on the alternative causes of action because delivery of the plan occurred on Sunday and because appellee received no benefit from appellant’s plan. The court granted appellee’s preliminary objections to appellant’s answer to its request for admissions because it felt Pa. E.C.P. 4014 set no limits on the number of documents that could be included in such a request and considering the nature of the case the number was not unreasonably large nor beyond appellant’s reasonable anticipation.

Such advance should be implemented by South Penn or one or more of its officials on its behalf, by purchasing shares of South Penn on the open market on the ASE. The relatively small floating supply of shares ... of this long, generous dividend-payer, should make a relatively easy job of continually advancing SP’s market price and such advance will be assisted substantially (if not taken over in a major way from time to time by the investing public and brokerage fraternity) when it becomes apparent through publicity and market action that SP has entered on an accelerated <em>expansion program. </em>At the moment, on the basis of 1961 earnings of $2.40 per share, SP’s shares at around $32.00 are selling at only about 13 times earnings whereas they could and should be selling at least 20 to say 23 times earnings or around $48.00 to $55.00 per share. This 20 times (plus) ratio will materialize without difficulty as soon as the investing public learn that SP has embarked on a constructive aggressive expansion program. . . . The shares purchased in the open market as above mentioned as well as Tidewater’s SP shares, if purchased, can, of course be used in negotiating future property acquisitions . . . then SP share market price could continually make new highs, with occasional market help of SP. South Penn’s leading the way, from time to time, in continually advancing the market price of its shares consistent with the circumstances as mentioned, will be beneficial to the company in many ways, especially in establishing a much higher and more favorable price-structure basis on which to negotiate thru shares, well selected property-reserve <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>acquisitions in its expansion program. . . . <em>Earnings-expansion </em>through acquisition ... (of reserve) . . . thru merger and/or purchase . . . with payment for same being made by the company out of its treasury and increased shares at advanced stock market prices for SP shares as above mentioned; . . .”</p>

What Davis was proposing was that South Penn expand by “purchasing” companies cheaply with stock that was valued at high levels as a result of South Penn’s own market activity and the effect that activity would have on the “investing public and the brokerage community.” “Of course, it is axiomatic that it is the ticker record of a stock that attracts customers, and here, by buying purchasing power and increasing activity, there was attention called to the stock and a marked advance was achieved by it.” <em>SEC v.

In the Genesco, Inc. proceeding, supra, the company admitted that it may have violated 10b and 10b-5 by not disclosing its activity in its stock during periods of negotiation.</p>

Complying with the requirements of 10b and 10b-5 would have rendered the plan valueless, and under those circumstances there is no need for a finder of fact to hear evidence on the question.

Regardless whether the contract is seen as unilateral or bilateral, it is not of the type from which the illegal part can be excised. Restatement, Contracts, §606 states: “Except as this rule is qualified by the rules stated in sections 599-605 (not here relevant), where a single consideration for one or more promises in a unilateral bargain is illegal, the promises are unenforceable. But if legal executed consideration is apportioned to a corresponding promise <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>which is also legal, that promise is enforceable, unless the whole transaction involves serious moral turpitude or is prohibited by statute.” Although the complaint alleged that consideration, was to be paid if the plan were accepted and used in whole or in part, section 29b of the Exchange Act is quite explicit in saying that every contract in violation of that Act or rules promulgated thereunder shall be void. Restatement, Contracts, §607 states: “Except as this rule is qualified by the rules stated in sections 578, 599-605 [not here relevant] where any part of a bilateral bargain is illegal, no promise can be enforced unless not only that promise is legal but a corresponding legal promise is, by the terms of. the bargain, apportioned as consideration therefor, nor even in that case if the illegal portion of the bargain is an essential part of it.” See <em>Deibler v.

There were three things that had to happen before appellant became entitled to compensation— he had to discover if Tidewater were willing to sell, he had to discover at what price Tidewater was willing to <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>sell, and the transaction had to be consummated. An excerpt from appellant’s deposition will indicate how he did not perform his obligation. “Q. How did you get that information [that Tidewater was willing to sell]? A. That information came to me through correspondence with Mr. Patrick [of Baird &amp; Co. whom appellant had used to get information from Tidewater] which he had with the Tidewater people, photostatic copy of which he sent to me, and photostatic copy of which I forward through to Mr. Selden on, I believe, the 17th of August. Q. Will you look at those documents, please, and point out to me where that information is contained in, first, Exhibit No. 7, the letter of August 14 from Mr. Patrick,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and then Exhibit No. 6, the letter of August 15 from Mr. Patrick to you?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Where do you find that Tidewater holdings could be acquired for approximately $55 to $60 per share? A. Referring to that correspondence, and referring to the discussion Mr. Selden and I had about Tidewater at Skyline Hotel (June 24) at which time he told me that he didn’t know it could be purchased, but he also heard the rumor around $56 to $58. We now refer back to Mr. Roth’s letter, Mr. Roth of Tidewater Oil, where he says that ‘while we have little desire to sell assets of this nature, if someone were to make an attractive offer we would certainly give it serious consideration. Such an <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>offer would have to be substantially above present market price.’ Q. Present market price? A. The present market price at that time was approximately $30, $31, $32, in that area, and substantially above it would carry it up to the area of $56 to $58, as I told Mr. Selden in the letter of August 17 where I said to him: ‘and you can deduce from Mr. Roth’s letter that the price would be in the order of $55 to $60 per share as we discussed when we met at the Skyline Hotel last June.’<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Q. In other words, you and Mr. Selden, in June, had talked about the price of $55 to $60 per share, and when Mr. Roth said that the price would have to be substantially about the present market price, from that you concluded that $55 to $60 a share would be sufficient to enable South Penn to get it? A. A logical deduction. Q. That is the only basis you have for the statement in Paragraph 30 that you found that Tidewater’s holdings in South Penn could be acquired for approximately $55 to $60 per share? A. That’s right.”</p>

There is absolutely no basis for saying that $55-$60 is the “substantially above present market price” amount Exhibit 7 refers to. It is impossible to know what figure Roth contemplated, and it is evident that as appellant did not perform his obligations under the contract pleaded in the Second Count, he has no basis for recovery under it.</p>

It would not prejudice the noninquiring party because he could assume the answer was sufficient and, if permitted by the court, could file an amended answer or take other appropriate measures if faced with an adverse determination. The only prejudice would be to the party responsible for the delay, the inquirer. If, faced with an answer of questionable validity, he decides not to object immediately, it is his preparation for trial that is made more difficult. This procedure was designed for his benefit; if he wishes to make his position more difficult, no one should object. Of course, all this presumes he acts so as not to delay the trial itself.
