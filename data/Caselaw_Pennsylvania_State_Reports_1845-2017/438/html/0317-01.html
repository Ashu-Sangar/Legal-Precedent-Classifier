Antoinette Atria resides on the second floor of that building and has done so for many years. Atria, Inc. also owns lot 18 which abuts lot 17 to the west and on which is a building rented to a third party and used as a garage. Nicholas Atria is the owner of a private residence located on lot 22 in the Parker Gardens Plan which fronts on Newburn Drive, a residential street which intersects Beverly Road a short distance to the west of lot 18.

On July 21, 1958, the Mount Lebanon Township Commissioners approved a site plan submitted by Joseph Atria, former president of Atria, Inc., now deceased, for accessory off-street parking in the rear of the building in which the beer parlor is located. Their approval was conditioned on the fact that access to the parking area was to be only by a route which traversed property then owned by Abe Finkelstein (now owned by Rollier Bros., Inc.) which was situate to the east of appellees’ property. The Township Commissioners denied Joseph Atria’s request that access be across the driveway located on lot 22 and required him to build a wall across the driveway <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>thereby ensuring that Newburn Drive and the driveway would not provide access. By an agreement between Atria and Finkelstein access to the parking lot was obtained from the east, and until 1967 traffic entered the lot over the property now owned by Rollier Bros.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[187,664,1157,429]]]'>On May 8, 1967, Rollier Bros, was issued a permit to erect a cyclone fence along the rear portion of their property which abutted the Atria property. When the fence was completed on July 27, 1967, access to the parking lot from the east was effectively cut off. By agreement between Atria and Rollier Bros., the former were permitted access over the latter’s property for a period of five years which would end in May, 1973.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[182,1104,1160,815]]]'>Atria then applied to the Township Building Inspector for a Certificate of Use, Occupancy and Compliance which would have permitted them to remove the concrete block wall in the rear of lot 22 and use the driveAvay as an access route to the parking lot. This request was refused, and Atria appealed to the Township Zoning Board of Adjustment. After a hearing, the Board affirmed the decision of the Building Inspector and concluded (1) that Atria could gain vehicular access from Beverly Road across its own commercially zoned property, (2) that granting the appeal would result in a greatly increased flow of commercial traffic across a residential area, and (3) that such commercial use would affect injuriously the property values of Newburn Drive.</p>

The court took no additional testimony, and after a reading of the record, it concluded that Atria had not waived any rights by failing to appeal the Mount Lebanon Township Commissioners’ decision of July 21, 1958, that there was no substantial relationship between the Board’s denial and the health and safety of the com<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>munity, and that the Township could not deny Atria the fundamental rights of ingress and egress.

The parking lot is located partly in an NS area and partly in a R-4 area; up to now access has only been permitted over commercially zoned (NS) property. Township Ordinance No. 1723, Art. VII, §1 regulates the uses in R-4 residential districts and states: “In this [R-4] District the land, buildings, and structures shall be used, and the buildings and structures erected, altered, enlarged, and maintained for the following uses only: 1. Any use permitted in Rl, R2, and R3 Districts. 2. Multi-family dwelling. 3. Required Off-street Garage, Parking Area, and Loading Space ... 4.

In that case the Borough of Prospect Park filed a bill in equity to restrain the defendants from using its driveway in a commercial zone as a means of ingress to and egress from its brick manufactory which was in an industrial zone. The Borough argued that the use of the driveway to take supplies in and haul bricks out was accessory to the industry of brick making. The <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>Superior Court disagreed saying that the driveway was used for ingress and egress only and that no part of the manufacturing process was carried on there. The crucial element in that case, however, was that “[a] driveway for the purpose of affording means of passage to trucks is equally advantageous and suitable for commercial as for industrial purposes”, <a href="/pa-super/151/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="151 Pa. Super. 467" data-case-ids="1047317" data-case-paths="/pa-super/151/0467-01">151 Pa. Superior Ct. at 471</a>. The court emphasized that such a use did not alter the character of the district in which it was located and would not endanger those interests which the zoning ordinance was intended to protect. In addition, the court stated that it was “conceivable that the public use of a private driveway lying within a <em>residential </em>district in connection with a public garage located in an adjoining commercial district may so change the character of the driveway as to render its public use prohibitive as 'a commercial use’ . . <a href="/pa-super/151/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="151 Pa. Super. 467" data-case-ids="1047317" data-case-paths="/pa-super/151/0467-01">151 Pa. Superior Ct. at 471</a>. The record indicates that between 75 and 100 cars can be expected to use the driveway each day, and certainly that use would not be as advantageous for residential as for commercial purposes. It could also be expected to alter the character of the district. Therefore the Prospect Park case presents a different set of circumstances from those facing us in this action.</p>

Defendant was summarily convicted of violating the zoning ordinance for having used one lot zoned residential as a parking lot for her funeral home located on a contiguous lot which was zoned commercial. By affirming the judgment of sentence the Superior Court necessarily was holding that the commercial aspects of a business carried over to the land used as a parking lot for that business.</p>

Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/414/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="414 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1890370" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0001-01">414 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20863" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="198 A.2d 863">198 A. 2d 863</a> (1964), the burden of proof in an attack on the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance is upon the person so asserting, and that burden is a heavy one.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[136,1990,1149,377]]]'>It is difficult to understand upon what specific grounds appellees attack the constitutionality of the ordinance, but it would appear that they attack the power of the Mount Lebanon Township Commissioners to create a residential area that is to be free of commercial activity. As we stated in <em>Bwade, </em>supra, however, that argument is totally without merit.</p>
    <p id="b442-3" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[195,394,1158,639]]]'>
      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>What we have decided is that appellees do not have the right under Township Ordinance No. 1723, Art. VII, §1 to use a driveway located in a R-4 area as a means of access to a parking lot serving a grocery store, restaurant and beer garden located in a NS area and that that ordinance is constitutional. As the question has not been presented to us (or to the Board or court below), we are not deciding whether on these facts appellees are entitled to a variance. As stated above, their sole claim is that they Avere entitled to a certificate of use, occupancy and compliance under the terms of the ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[193,1052,1153,203]]]'>Since we have determined that the Board of Adjustment neither abused its discretion or committed an error of law, the order of the court below is reversed.</p>
