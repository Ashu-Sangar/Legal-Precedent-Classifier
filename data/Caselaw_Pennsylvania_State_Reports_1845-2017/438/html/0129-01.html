The licensee was arrested. On June 25, 1966 Philadelphia police officers observed patrons being sold drinks after the legal closing time of the bar. The licensee was arrested.</p>

After hearing, the Board imposed fines of $200 and $150 respectively. The licensee appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions, and the court affirmed the decisions of the Board and dismissed the licensee’s appeals.”</p>

L. 90, Art. IV, §471, as amended, the Act of January 13, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1301, §2, 47 P.S. §4-471. In relevant part that section states: “No penalty provided by this section shall be imposed by the board or any court for any violations provided for in this act unless the enforcement officer or the board notifies the licensee of its nature and of the date of the alleged violation within ten days of the completion of the investigation which in no event shall exceed ninety days.” Before us is the question whether notice as specified by the statute must be given when the Board makes: no independent investigation of its own but rather issues citations solely on the basis of information supplied by other agencies such as local police departments. No such notice was given to appellee. The Superior Court held <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>that its decision in <em>Elfman, Point Bar, Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/212/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="212 Pa.

When that factual situation exists, the section specifies what notice must be given and at what time it must be given. The purpose of this provision is to give warning to the licensee that his activities have been under investigation and that his license is about to be endangered. If a licensee or his employee is arrested and charged with activities violative of our criminal laws which are also violative of the Liquor Code, he has received the essence of the notice that the Liquor Code requires. It is necessary to look at the realities of the situation, and when an arrest has been made for conduct that violates both the criminal law and the Liquor Code, the licensee must surely know that the Liquor Control Board may well proceed against him and that he should take corresponding steps to protect his interests.
