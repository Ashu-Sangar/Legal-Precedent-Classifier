    <p id="b519-7" data-blocks='[["BL_519.11",519,[174,826,1151,580]]]'>Larry Arnold was tried before a jury on a general charge of murder, convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced to serve six to twelve years. The only issues raised on this direct appeal concern the propriety of admitting into evidence certain pieces of physical evidence—two .32 caliber revolvers—and the constitutionality of certain incriminating statements. Since I believe that the conviction must be reversed because the two revolvers were unconstitutionally seized I will not deal with the more problematical confession issue.</p>
    <p id="b519-8" data-blocks='[["BL_519.12",519,[171,1427,1151,534]]]'>On May 23, 1966, police officers in Westmoreland County discovered the bullet riddled body of one David Pedder. After a preliminary investigation by the Pennsylvania State Police an order was issued to pick up for questioning the victim’s wife, Violet Pedder, and an unknown male companion. Since Violet Pedder was then known to be living in York County, two State Police officers stationed in that area proceeded to her home. Upon their arrival they found Violet Pedder, her child and her stepfather, Mr. Hutton, at home.</p>
    <p id="b519-9" data-blocks='[["BL_519.13",519,[169,1970,1149,426]],["BL_520.1",520,[178,388,1154,98]]]'>The officers asked Violet Pedder several questions, among them whether anyone was then living with her. She told the officers that Arnold was living with her and gave them a description of him and his car. The description matched the one sent out from Westmoreland County. The troopers also inquired about the guns, but neither Violet nor her stepfather professed any knowledge of the weapons. The officers then took <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>Violet Pedder into custody and departed, leaving the child and the stepfather behind.</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[171,497,1160,1618]]]'>After leaving the house and traveling two or three miles, the officers were passed by Arnold driving in the opposite direction toward the Pedder residence. The officers turned around and gave chase, finally catching Arnold about three-tenths of a mile from the house, on a long private drive that led from the house to the public highway. Arnold was frisked and placed in the police vehicle. At that moment Mr. Hutton approached, driving from the house. He related that shortly after the officers left he noticed two .32 caliber revolvers and a box of ammunition in the bedroom which Arnold and his daughter shared and that he was on his way to notify the officers of his discovery when he happened upon them in the driveway. Mr. Hutton further stated that the guns were his but that he had given them to Arnold several months before with the understanding that Arnold would have them repaired and that each of them would keep one of the repaired weapons. Since the teletype report had mentioned that David Pedder had been killed with a .32 caliber weapon the troopers expressed interest in the discovery. The entire cast of characters then returned to the Pedder residence. While Violet Pedder and Arnold remained in the police car with one of the officers, the other officer and Mr. Hutton went inside the house and retrieved the guns, which were lying inside an army cap on the bed in the Pedder-Arnold bedroom. The officer took the guns and then returned with Violet Pedder and Arnold to the police station. One of the two guns was found to have been the murder weapon.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.6",520,[171,2127,1154,260]]]'>The guns were introduced into evidence at Arnold’s trial over the objection of his counsel. Since I believe that they were seized in violation of Arnold’s Fourth Amendment rights, it is my view that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>

      <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>It is clear beyond doubt that “. . . searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment—subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.” <em>Katz v. United States, </em><a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">389 U.S. 347</a>, 357, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">88 S.

The Commonwealth argues, however, that the search in the instant case fits within the exception which permits an otherwise impermissible search to be made with the consent of the person whose rights are violated, or with the consent of a third person who has either the authority to waive the rights of the person against whom the search is directed, see, <em>e.g., Katz v. United States, </em><a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">389 U.S. 347</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">88 S.
