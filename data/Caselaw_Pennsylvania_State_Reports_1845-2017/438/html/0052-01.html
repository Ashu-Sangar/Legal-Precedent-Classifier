A reading of the instant record clearly indicates that the defendant was not being “interrogated” or “questioned” within the meaning of the <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>rulings and that her statements to the police officer were spontaneous and voluntary. The statements of the police officer to the defendant which brought forth the latter’s statements were in no wise inquisitive but simply observations as to the victim’s condition.</p>

The absence of any objection to the admission of these oral statements constituted a waiver of error, if error existed and, certainly, if error existed, it was not fundamental or basic viewed in the light of this record. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

Moreover, it is noted that no question is now raised as to the admissibility of the statement given by the defendant, after proper and appropriate warnings, to the police lieutenant in the police station, and in such statement the defendant said practically that which she had previously stated orally to the police officer en route to the police station. Under the instant circumstances, we fail to see how the error alleged in the admissibility of the oral statements, <em>if </em>such was error, resulted in any prejudice to the defendant or in an unfair trial and a deprivation of justice.</p>

You interpreted that to mean a confession or something against interest having to do with the commission of the offense? The Witness: Yes. The Court: Not remarks? The Witness: Yes, sir. THE Court: All right.” It is obvious that what the court below was trying to elicit was á <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>clarification of what Officer Lincoln meant by the word “statement.” In <em>Commonwealth v. Watts, </em><a href="/pa/358/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="358 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="8845042,8845060" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0092-01,/pa/358/0092-02">358 Pa. 92</a>, 96, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%2081" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="56 A.2d 81">56 A. 2d 81</a>, 83 (1948), this Court said: “It is always the right and sometimes the duty of a trial judge to interrogate witnesses, although, of course, questioning from the bench should not show bias or feeling nor be unduly protracted.” There is no evidence whatsoever of any bias or feeling or undue protraction of the questioning by the court below. What the court below was simply trying to do was to clarify for the jury just what Officer Lincoln meant by the word “statement.”</p>
