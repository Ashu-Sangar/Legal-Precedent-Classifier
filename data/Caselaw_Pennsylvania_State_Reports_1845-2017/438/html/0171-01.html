He sought an accounting from the defendants and a dissolution of the partnership. The defendants filed an answer to the complaint denying the existence of a partnership, and, as an alternative defense, asserted that if it were determined that the alleged partnership did in fact exist, then they were entitled to recover from the plaintiff a sum in excess of $5000, because of his failure to render any meaningful services to or on behalf of the partnership during its existence. Plaintiff replied that under the partnership agreement he was not required to actively participate in the operation of the business.</p>

However, the chancellor’s inferences and conclusions from the facts as found to exist are always subject to review <em>(Kemp v.

The same standards control in those situations where the <em>court en banc </em>consists only of the chancellor himself [Pursuant to Philadelphia Local Rule C. P. *256(a)].

Our review of the record is persuasive that the evidence justified the chancellor in finding the following facts:</p>
    <p id="b290-4" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[185,574,1157,1028]]]'>Defendant Peter Krasas was an unlettered man of Greek origin who had spent most of his life in the restaurant business. In 1960, Thomas Cowen was a college student engaged to be married to Peter Krasas’ daughter. The relation between Cowen and the Krasas family was warm and friendly. In March 1960, Cowen advanced to Peter Krasas the sum of $5000 to be used to purchase the Gaiety Luncheonette, as well as to assist Krasas with his other financial obligations. The purchase price of the Gaiety was $23,500 and Cowen was given to understand that there would be an initial cash investment by the parties of $15,000. Cowen was to advance the sum of $5000 and Peter Krasas and Peter Krasas, Jr., the remaining $10,000, and each was to enjoy a 1/3 interest in the business. A further sum of $10,000 would be borrowed. However, the Krasases never advanced the $10,000 as <em>per </em>this understanding, but borrowed the sum of $23,500 from a finance company.</p>
    <p id="b290-5" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[185,1614,1155,261]]]'>The purchase of the business was completed in May of 1960. Prom that time until March 1965, Cowen received payments nearly every month from the Krasas family in various sums totalling by Cowen’s own estimation $21,478.28.</p>
    <p id="b290-6" data-blocks='[["BL_290.7",290,[183,1886,1156,252]]]'>During this same period, Cowen and Peter Krasas’ daughter “broke off” their engagement and subsequently both married other persons. Nevertheless, Cowen continued to receive periodic payments from the Krasases.</p>

    <p id="b291-3" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[160,491,1149,587]]]'>As noted before, the lower court concluded that a partnership had been created between the parties in 1860, and Cowen had a 1/3 interest therein. The factual findings of the chancellor which were approved by the <em>court en banc </em>are supported by the record and are sufficient to warrant this conclusion, and we will not disturb it. While there was evidence to the contrary, it is not for us to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Kalyvas v. Kalyvas, </em>supra. The existence or nonexistence of the partnership was primarily a matter of credibility.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[160,1091,1149,206]]]'>The chancellor also determined that Cowen’s letter of May 24, 1965, constituted an “offer” to sell his interest in the business “for whatever reasonable sum Krasas might put on it.”</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.6",291,[159,1309,1150,526]]]'>This conclusion was based solely on a reading of Cowen’s letter. Thus, in interpreting such a writing and determining whether or not that writing constituted an offer, the chancellor was passing on a question of law. <em>Hanover Const. Co. v.

It is true that Cowen’s letter expressed a far greater degree of amenability than he subsequently manifested in his dealings with the Erasases. Yet, it is this very quality—this general interest in selling coupled with an open-mindedness as to price and any other terms— which preclude a determination that the letter constituted an offer. His letter was intended to do no more than to give notice of the fact that he was no longer interested in receiving periodic payments, but would prefer a lump sum final payment to terminate his interest in the partnership. “It is common for one who wishes to make a bargain to try <em>to induce the other party to the intended transaction to make the definite offer, </em>he himself suggesting with more or less definiteness the nature of the contract he is willing to enter into.” Restatement, Contracts, §25, comment a (1932) [Emphasis supplied.]; <em>Upsal St. Realty Co. v.

It was $3000 less than Cowen’s initial investment. Moreover, it was less than 1/2 of the average annual amount Cowen had received from Krasas in the form of periodic payments. Finally, there is an internal inconsistency in the chancellor’s own adjudication: The chancellor initially determined that a partnership was created in which Cowen had a 1/3 interest. He further concluded (and there was ample evidence to support him) that the Gaiety had developed into a “thriving business.” However, the conclusion of the syUogism, namely, that $2000 was a reasonable value for Cowen’s 1/3 interest, is inconsistent with his major and minor premises. There is no doubt from the evidence adduced that the total value of the Gaiety was far in excess of $8000. Certainly, Cowen’s 1/3 interest would exceed $2000.</p>
