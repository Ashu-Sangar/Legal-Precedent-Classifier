    <p id="b217-3" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[159,436,1149,1189]]]'>This is an action instituted by twenty individuals, members of Transport Workers Union, Local 234 (TWU) to require the Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) to recognize and bargain with TWU based on a Memorandum of Agreement dated January 13, 1969. Prior to October, 1968, appellees’ employer was the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) and its predecessor corporations. The appellees and all other PTC employees similarly situated had as their exclusive bargaining representative, TWU. In October, 1968, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) took over the operation and maintenance of the transit facilities owned and/or operated by PTC and assumed the obligations of the TWU collective bargaining agreement then in effect which was to continue until January 14, 1969. Part of the local mass transit facilities taken over by SEPTA from PTC was the high-speed operation from 16th and Locust Streets in Philadelphia to Camden, New Jersey (the Bridge Line). About 42 SEPTA employees covered by the TWU agreement were directly employed in the operation of the Bridge Line.</p>
    <p id="b217-4" data-blocks='[["BL_217.7",217,[159,1637,1149,753]],["BL_218.1",218,[181,386,1155,699]]]'>Appellant PATCO is a subsidiary corporation of the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) which is a bi-state agency formed pursuant to 1951-52 Compact Legislation (including enabling legislation) by and between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey and pursuant to an Act of Congress of the United States. In 1963 the two states entered into a Supplemental Agreement to the Compact Agreement which provided, inter alia, that the Commission of the DRPA could form a wholly owned subsidiary corporation to effectuate any of the authorized purposes of DRPA. Pursuant to this Supplemental Compact, PATCO was formed on September 20, 1967, for the purpose of operating the Bridge Line and a <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>proposed extension to Lindenwold, New Jersey. Prior to the formation of PATCO, TWU informed DRPA of the seniority, pension representation and other rights of the appellee and further notified DRPA that it was obligated to continue to recognize all such rights when and if it took over the operation of the Bridge Line. Similar notification was given to PATCO upon its formation. On December 27, 1968, one day before DRPA terminated its lease to SEPTA to operate the Bridge Line, TWU and DRPA/PATCO orally agreed, among other things, that TWU was to continue as the exclusive bargaining representative for the hourly employees who were to operate the Bridge Line and its extension.</p>
    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[180,1097,1156,1022]]]'>This oral agreement was reduced to writing on January 13, 1969, and that Memorandum of Understanding states that PATCO recognizes TWU as collective bargaining representatives for its hourly employees and that PATCO will give those SEPTA employees whose jobs were eliminated by the take-over (approximately 42) an opportunity to select comparable employment in PATCO. It also states that the parties agree to meet as soon as possible and work out terms of a contract covering wages, hours, pensions, fringe benefits and working conditions. This action has arisen because it is alleged that PATCO has employed only twelve of the forty-two former SEPTA employees, has refused to recognize TWU as bargaining representatives for PATCO employees, and had refused to negotiate a definitive agreement with TWU. The real basis of the controversy is the struggle between TWU and the Teamsters Local Union No. 676 over which will represent employees on the Bridge Line.</p>

Rather than state that we will give recognition to a New Jersey decree, we hold that the lower court should have declined jurisdiction of this matter because New Jersey is the state with the most significant relationship with the parties and events. PATCO’s principal offices are located in Camden; its maintenance center and headquarters are located in Linden-wold; eight of twelve stations are located in New Jersey; all the employees report to work there; 95% of the employees actually work there; it hires in New Jersey; a great majority of its investments are in New Jersey; and the majority of the patrons using the line are residents of the New Jersey area who commute to and from Philadelphia.</p>

This is not an action in which convenience, in the sense of availability of witnesses and evidence, is involved as much as is the concept of appropriateness of exercising jurisdiction. The availability of another forum, however, is an element in determining appropriateness. When presented with cases, courts should be careful to weigh the costs of assuming jurisdiction, and after examining the long and complex history of this action, we feel it important that the controversy be finally settled by the jurisdiction that has the greatest interest in the matter. The conflicting orders of various courts and agencies indicate that the only way in which this result can be assured is for the courts of Pennsylvania to decline jurisdiction.</p>

The contract upon which the appellees base their cause of action was signed in Pennsylvania by an employer created in part by the Commonwealth and by a union representing Pennsylvania-based employees. And although most of the PATCO-operated high-speed line lies in New Jersey, that section of the operation in which the affected employees used to work ran only between Philadelphia <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>and Camden. This is therefore not a case where Pennsylvania’s interest is truly insubstantial.</p>

Pennsylvania need not specifically enforce the TWU-PATCO agreement, but could grant such relief as damages or merely requiring PATOO to hire the affected employees without mandating their union affiliation. In fact, assuming that both states will apply intelligent confliets-of-law rules, the likelihood of consistent and complimentary outcomes in both suits is high.</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[149,1113,1153,643]]]'>Thirdly, I believe that it is improper to dismiss a case on grounds of comity at the preliminary objection stage whenever there is the least doubt as to the propriety of such an action. All of the ends which are served by such a resolution can be equally well reached at a later stage in the litigation. The inconveniences of proceeding further seem slight when compared with the finality of dismissal. At the very least, the trial court could, if appropriate, stay the proceedings but retain jurisdiction pending the outcome of litigation in the other forum before deciding to divest itself of all jurisdiction over the matter.</p>
