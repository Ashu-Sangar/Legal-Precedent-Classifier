Among others, the group included Johnston, Pittman, Mrs. Pittman and Mrs. Wolfe. Strong ill feeling existed between Mrs. Pittman and Mrs. Wolfe, and an argument started between them which culminated in a physical tussle. When the pair were separated, Mrs. Wolfe began to berate Pittman and called him some obscene names. Pittman became angry, drew a knife and threatened to kill her. He chased her from the building and inflicted two knife wounds on her arm as she fled. When he caught up to her, he knocked her to the ground and cut her in the area of the hairline.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.6",603,[135,1536,1151,425]]]'>Johnston separated the two, led Pittman to his automobile and asked him to leave the premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Pittman and his wife got in the car. Mrs. Wolfe then threw a brick through the rear window of the Pittman automobile and directed some additional obscenities toward him. Whereupon Pittman jumped from his automobile and chased Mrs. Wolfe into the building with the knife in his hand, saying, “Pm going to kill you.”</p>

He then followed Pittman in<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>.to the building, grabbed him by the left arm (Pittman had the knife in his right hand) and pulled him back several feet from the area where Mrs. Wolfe was standing. Defendant then said, “Charlie, don’t kill that woman in here because I don’t want no trouble in my place .... Man, you get out of here and leave that woman alone.”</p>
    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[202,772,1156,859]]]'>Pittman broke away and Johnston started to walk sideways. Pittman then approached Johnston with the knife in an upraised hand, saying he was going to kill Mrs. Wolfe and what was that to Johnston. Johnston retreated 10 to 15 feet, then stood his ground and drew his gun, saying to Pittman: “Charles, don’t come any closer—I don’t want to hurt you.” Despite this Pittman kept approaching Johnston with the knife held in a menacing position. When Pittman was about 11 feet distant from him, Johnston fired one shot at his feet. When Pittman was about 6 feet away, Johnston fired two shots into Pittman’s body, one of which entered his heart causing instant death. Before these shots were fired, Johnston was standing only a few feet from an open, unobstructed door, which led to the outside of the building.</p>

It is the duty of one who is assailed to flee, if flight is possible ; and it is only when he is persuaded that he must suffer death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of his assailant, or take the life of his assailant that he may save his own, that he can justify his act as done in self-defence.” <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Breyessee, <a href="/pa/160/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="160 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="852201" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0451-01">160 Pa. 451</a>, 456, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.%20824" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="28 A. 824">28 Atl. 824</a> (1894). The understanding of self-defense articulated in <em>Breyessee </em>has remained the law of the Commonwealth up to the present. <em>Commonwealth v. Lawrence, </em><a href="/pa/428/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="428 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1912392" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0188-01">428 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20768" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="236 A.2d 768">236 A. 2d 768</a> (1968) and <em>Commonwealth v. Collazo, </em><a href="/pa/407/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="407 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="1307380" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0494-01">407 Pa. 494</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20903" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="180 A.2d 903">180 A. 2d 903</a> (1962). It reflects the deeply felt belief that life is sacred and should not be taken, even in self-defense, except as a matter of the last resort when there is no reasonable alternative. As the Court held in <em>Commonwealth v. Vassar, </em><a href="/pa/370/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="370 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1234582" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0551-01">370 Pa. 551</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20725" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="88 A.2d 725">88 A. 2d 725</a> (1952) and <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>reiterated in <em>Commonwealth v. Collazo, supra, </em>where it is a question as to “ ‘whether one man shall flee or another shall live, the law decides that the former shall rather flee than the latter may die.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[133,607,1154,537]]]'>Both in this and in other jurisdictions, however, it has been consistently held that one is under no duty to retreat when feloniously attacked or placed in danger while in one’s own home. <em>Commonwealth v. Wilkes, </em><a href="/pa/414/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="414 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1890422" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0246-01">414 Pa. 246</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20411" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="199 A.2d 411">199 A. 2d 411</a> (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em><a href="/us/379/0939-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="379 U.S. 939" data-case-ids="11786996,11787087,11787189,11787286,11787382,11787477,11787580,11787627" data-case-paths="/us/379/0939-01,/us/379/0939-02,/us/379/0939-03,/us/379/0939-04,/us/379/0939-05,/us/379/0939-06,/us/379/0939-07,/us/379/0939-08">379 U.S. 939</a> (1964); <em>Commonwealth v. Fraser, </em><a href="/pa/369/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="369 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1232328" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0273-01">369 Pa. 273</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20126" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="85 A.2d 126">85 A. 2d 126</a> (1952). That exception is based on our common sense that the home is the last place of safety, that one there assaulted is already “at the wall” and no further retreat is required.</p>
    <p id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.6",609,[123,1156,1158,977]]]'>In the present case, the Court holds that the rule that he who is being assailed is not obliged to retreat if in his own home is applicable also when the threatened party is lawfully in “his office or place of business,” and this notwithstanding that a way of retreat was immediately at hand. I am not persuaded that this extension of the “no retreat rule” is either necessary or wise. No reason of policy or of logic has been advanced in support of this extension, nor is if suggested that the present limitations placed upon the claim of self-defense unduly jeopardize any legitimate public interest. It is true, as the majority notes, that some other jurisdictions have embraced the rule here adopted, but I do not see any indication that this Commonwealth has suffered from the want of such a rule. Absent strong countervailing considerations which are not here present, I would not adopt a rule of law which more easily justifies the taking of human life.</p>
    <p id="b609-6" data-blocks='[["BL_609.7",609,[121,2141,1150,268]],["BL_610.1",610,[198,390,1158,643]]]'>Moreover, I believe that significant definitional problems are inherent in the majority’s rule and indicate the unwisdom of the Court’s present holding. What is one’s home, and where it is, is generally a simple matter of fact, and not a matter of dispute. <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>One’s “office or place of business”, on the other hand, is not so susceptible to easy definition; and the collateral determination of the person, or the class of persons, able to claim the “place of business” exception will prove still more elusive. It is easy to imagine the troublesome problems which may arise when the courts of this Commonwealth attempt to apply this no-retreat rule to a street corner newsstand, a small store or a large one, an office building, a factory, a mine or a farm, to suggest a few examples. Precisely because the present rules relating to self-defense are adequate, these problems are unnecessarily created.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[196,1044,1157,153]]]'>Because I can find no real merit to the present holding and believe the rule will leave considerable problems in its wake, I dissent.</p>
