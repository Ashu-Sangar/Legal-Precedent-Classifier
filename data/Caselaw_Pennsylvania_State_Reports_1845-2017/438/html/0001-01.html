No post-trial motions were filed. On June 7, 1965, he was sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than twenty years. Subsequently, Freeman filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. He alleged that he was denied his right to counsel on appeal, as required by <em>Douglas v. California, </em><a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">372 U.S. 353</a>, and that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive that right. It is by now well established that a person convicted of crime is entitled to appeal and to be represented in his appeal by an attorney, and, if indigent, by a Court-appointed <em>free </em>attorney. These rights can be waived only by a knowledge of and a voluntary waiver of his rights. Defendant also contends that two con<a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>fessions which were used against him at trial were taken from him in violation of his Constitutional rights. From the Order of the lower Court which denied his petition, defendant took this appeal.</p>

With all respect, I believe he misinterprets what has been decided. As I view it, the Court is not at all unmindful of the federal constitutional rights enunciated in <em>Douglas v. </em>California, <a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">372 U.S. 353</a> (1963), nor is it receding from the decision of our Court in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/pa/430/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="430 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1915777" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0001-01">430 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=241%20A.2d%20760" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="241 A.2d 760">241 A. 2d 760</a> (1968) and its “progeny.” No new uncertainties should result from the present deei sion, nor should any new burden be placed on the federal courts; no separate or deviate approach to the guaranteed right of appeal and the elements of waiver of that right is indicated by what has been here decided.</p>
    <p id="b127-8" data-blocks='[["BL_127.10",127,[157,2232,1146,154]],["BL_128.1",128,[172,372,1155,320]]]'>The question before us is a very narrow one, a factual one, of determining whether, on the whole record, the defendant, being indigent, knowingly waived his <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>right to appeal with the assistance of conrt-appointed counsel. More specifically, the question is whether since there was no record made on this subject at the trial court level, the Commonwealth sustained the burden which it had of proving such a waiver by the fair weight of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[170,700,1154,850]]]'>As has been pointed out in the other opinions, two able lawyers were appointed to represent the defendant. This occurred on the very day of his arrest. They gave immediate and continuous attention to the protection of his rights, from a prompt motion to suppress a confession (based on <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. 368</a> (1964)), through the preliminary hearing, the trial and the sentencing. Following the sentencing, they conferred at length with their client and told him of his right to have “his counsel,” i.e., his two court-appointed counsel, move for a neAV trial; he was further told that he had a right to appeal if a new trial was denied and that his court-appointed counsel would prosecute that appeal if he gave the word. The decision as to whether an appeal should be taken was properly left to the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[167,1570,1155,804]],["BL_129.1",129,[170,383,1147,314]]]'>There is no testimony that defendant’s attorneys told him in express terms that their services in prosecuting an appeal would be rendered at no cost to the defendant just as their services prior to the conviction had been rendered free of charge. But, as the other opinions note, the defendant testified that he knew his lawyers’ services were provided “for nothing” and that they were to be paid by the Commonwealth. There is no suggestion in this record that defendant either believed, or had any reason to believe, that his attorneys’ services on appeal would not be free; at the PCHA hearing defendant begged ignorance of his appeal right, but he evaded a direct answer to the question whether he understood that an appeal would be provided at public expense. On this record, there was a clear issue of <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>credibility, and the hearing judge was justified in believing defendant’s attorneys and in finding and concluding that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving that Freeman had been fully advised of all his rights and that his decision not to appeal was knowingly made.</p>
    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[163,711,1154,1560]]]'>It would, of course, have been better had Messrs. Williams and Scanlon, appellant’s lawyers, been categorically asked whether they had advised Freeman that he had the right to free counsel on appeal, and had given a categorical answer. In the context of the whole proceeding, however, this omission is understandable. The decision of this Court in <em>Wilson </em>had not yet come down, and the emphasis the Court has since placed on the right to free or court-appointed counsel as a right separate and distinct from the right of appeal had yet to be articulated. But this is not fatal where, as here, the circumstances disclosed by the record support a finding that the defendant was informed of his right to the assistance of court-appointed counsel on appeal. We have not yet held that circumstances can never spell waiver, or that a precise verbal formulation of waiver is a constitutional mandate. To find on this record a waiver of defendant’s right to the assistance of free counsel on appeal is not, in my view, a substitution of inference for evidence; neither does such a finding establish, as the minority suggests, a presumption that “without any evidence, ... all indigent defendants, represented by free counsel at trial, know that they can have free counsel on appeal.” Unlike <em>Wilson, </em>where the record was “completely silent as to whether appellant was at any point informed or was aware that he was entitled to court appointed counsel”, <em>Wilson, supra, </em>at p. 5, the record here supports the opposite finding.</p>

      <em>Commonwealth v. Wilson, supra, </em>is particularly instructive, for it is clear that <em>Wilson </em>and the instant case are identical in every respect—except for this Court’s disposition. Wilson, like Freeman, was an indigent represented by court-appointed counsel at trial. Wilson, like Freeman, was not told at trial of his right to appeal, or of his right to free counsel to prosecute his appeal. Wilson, like Freeman, filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, alleging a denial of his constitutional right to appeal, as set forth in <em>Douglas v. California, </em><a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">372 U.S. 353</a>, <a href="/us/372/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="372 U.S. 353" data-case-ids="1765282" data-case-paths="/us/372/0353-01">83 S.

This Court held that the right to free appellate counsel is part of an accused’s rights under <em>Douglas. </em>This Court held that “an accused cannot waive his right to . . . assistance of appellate counsel unless he is told of his right to such court appointed counsel.” 430 Pa. at 5, 241 A. 2d at 763.

One could as easily say that once an indigent is informed of his <em>Miranda </em>right to free counsel at interrogation, he is presumed to know that free counsel will follow him through the rest of the trial and appeal. Further, the majority’s decision will undoubtedly create uncertainties in the trial courts of this Commonwealth. Nothing, of course, could be more confusing to our trial courts, and the profession, than to say we are following <em>Wilson </em>while reaching a totally opposite result.</p>

Mr. Scanlon and I went to the Monroe County Jail, and, as I recall it, this conviction, the jury verdict, came in on a Saturday, and we talked to Mr. Freeman in the early part of the week following the day the jury rendered the verdict. At that time, Mr. Scanlon did the explanation. He advised Mr. Freeman concerning his rights, first, to make him have his counsel move for a new trial, and secondly, that if that new trial was denied, that he had a right to appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and have his case reviewed. There was a mention of four days, as I recall it, in which, under our rule of court, this motion would normally be made. It is my recollection that in this particular instance, since the verdict was rendered on the last day the court sat, that under the rule, there was additional time in that a motion could be filed at the next session <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>of the court.

Relator clearly knew of his right to appeal, hut there is nothing on the record to indicate that he knew of his right to counsel on appeal.” The court therefore granted the writ, subject to the Commonwealth giving relator his right to direct appeal with court-appointed counsel. It is also interesting to note that F. R. Crim.
