While he was kicking and punching her (eventually heating her, semi-conscious, to the ground), a crowd of boys formed across the street, yelling for help. As the result of their cries, Junior Jackson came out of his house which was across the street, approached Franklin and told him to stop beating Vanessa. A very brief argument ensued and Jackson inflicted a three and one-half inch knife cut on the back of Franklin’s neck.</p>

The officer testified that he volunteered to take Franklin to the hospital for medical treatment, but Franklin refused and told him, “I will get a gun and take care of the [s.o.b.] myself.” When asked to clarify this statement, Franklin assured the officer that he was speaking in jest, and Culver left.</p>

Birdella Riley, who had been with Jackson when he cut Franklin on the back of the neck, was sitting in a car in front of the bar. Franklin arrived at about 7:20 p.m., put his gun to her head and asked where “the man” had gone. She indicated that Jackson was in the bar. As Franklin walked towards the door of the bar, Jackson came out, saw Franklin, and pulled his knife again. Franklin responded by removing the revolver from his pocket and shooting Jackson once in the left eye, the wound being fatal.</p>

The officer waited while the defendant was given stitches and had his neck wound bandaged, then returned to the station house with his prisoner. No questioning took place at the time of arrest; in fact, Officer Culver testified that when he told Franklin that he was under arrest and need not say anything, -the defendant responded that he was well aware of his rights under the law.</p>

You have a right to remain silent and do not have to say anything at all. B. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. C. You have a right to talk to a lawyer of your own choice before we ask you any questions, and also to have a lawyer here with you while we ask you questions. D.

E. If you are willing to give us a statement, you have a right to stop any time you wish.” Franklin was then questioned as to his understanding of his rights, and he responded affirmatively to the effect that he understood his rights. See <em>Commonwealth v. Medina, </em><a href="/pa/424/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="424 Pa. 632" data-case-ids="1905003" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0632-01">424 Pa. 632</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20842" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="227 A.2d 842">227 A. 2d 842</a> (1967).

At around midnight, the defendant still being unable to locate his own attorney, an assistant public defender was called to consult with him. However, Franklin was apparently not satisfied with this conference, and he declined the services of the public defender. The defendant then spoke privately with his wife, Rosalyn, for half an hour, drank some coffee and rested in an interrogation room.</p>

Detective Thompson, being questioned by the assistant district attorney at the suppression hearing, testified to the circumstances which led to the statement. “Q. Then what occurred? A. Then on our way down in the elevator he told us he would tell us what happened. He returned to Room 104 and we started taking a statement from him. Q. Let’s get into this on the elevator on the way down. Had you asked him anything? What was going on in the elevator that he made this statement that he would tell you what happened? A. We was talking in general and I <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>told Mm we didn’t have to have a statement from Mm because witnesses bad identified Mm but we would like to bear bis side of tbe story. At this time be said, 'Take me back up and I will tell you wbat happened.’ ” There was no subterfuge employed here, since it was perfectly true that tbe police already bad at least three witnesses who knew Franklin and who bad given statements as to wbat had happened. In fact, tbe only use that was made of tbe statement was to impeach Franklin’s credibility, after he testified, by comparing bis trial testimony with two small, nonincriminatory, portions of tbe statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It cannot be said, on the factual posture of this record, that Franklin’s will was overborne when he decided to give bis statement.</p>

First, be was read tbe same statement of bis rights that was used at 9:40 p.m., when be initially decided not to answer any questions. Tbe interrogating officer then asked a series of seven questions, as follows: “1. Do you understand that you have a right <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>to keep quiet and do not have to say anything at all? Answer, ‘Yes, I understand that.’ <em>2. </em>Do you understand that anything you say can and will be used against you in court? Answer, ‘Yes, I understand.’ 3. Do you want to remain silent? Answer, ‘No, I will give a statement.’ 4. Do you understand that you have a right to talk with a lawyer before we ask you any questions? Answer, ‘Yes, I do.’ 5. Do you understand that if you can’t afford to hire a lawyer and you want one, we will not ask you any questions until a lawyer is appointed for you? Answer, ‘Yes, I do.’ 6. Do you want either to talk with a lawyer at this time, or to have a lawyer with you while we ask you questions? Answer, ‘No, I will give a statement.’ 7. Are you willing to answer questions of your own free will, without foree or fear, and without any threats or promises having been made to you? Answer, ‘Yes, I am.’ ” Since Franklin knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights, the questioning which took place at 3:00 a.m. was proper and the statement admissible. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Bordner, </em><a href="/pa/432/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="432 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1919662" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0405-01">432 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20612" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="247 A.2d 612">247 A. 2d 612</a> (1968). The record is perfectly clear that the defendant was very thoroughly informed as to the rights to which he was entitled, and that he understood those rights. “An express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by a statement could constitute a waiver.” <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, 475, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S. Ct. 1602</a> (1966). Moreover, there is utterly no evidence that the defendant was coerced or “worn down” in any way whatsoever.

The defendant now complains about that segment of the charge on self-defense wherein the court explained that Franklin could not now claim to have killed his victim in self-defense, <em>if </em>the jury were to find that Franklin went looking for Jackson with a criminal intent, expecting that such confrontation would necessitate his use of the gun. To explain himself, the court analogized to “a classical case, <em>but not like this one, </em>where a man goes into a marketplace in order to hold up the proprietor. He is committing a felony at that time. He knows that the danger of having to defend himself exists. Under those circumstances, he has no right to claim self-defense because he set the moving factors into being.” (Emphasis added)</p>

In short, one man cannot provoke another man into a fight, knowing that the second man will probably use his knife, and then claim that he shot the second man in self-defense, to ward off the expected knife attack. The evidence in the instant case supports a finding that this is precisely what happened between Franklin and Jackson. Accordingly, we find no error in that portion of the charge complained of.</p>

If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. ... If the individual states that he wants an attorney, <em>the interrogation must cease until an attorney is </em>present. ... If the individual cannot obtain an attorney and he indicates that he wants one before speaking to police, they must respect his decision to remain silent.” (Emphasis added)</p>

      <em> </em>In fact, the type of questioning used here is quite similar to the subtle interrogation which this Court recently held impermissible in <em>Commonwealth v. Simala, </em><a href="/pa/434/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="434 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1922651" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0219-01">434 Pa. 219</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20A.2d%20575" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="252 A.2d 575">252 A. 2d 575</a> (1969). In <em>Símala, </em>the police brought the defendant into the mayor’s office, where he sat for one-half hour. The mayor then said: “ ‘What’s the matter, Mike, you look kind of down in the dumps; do you want to talk? ... if you want to talk, talk.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 222, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20A.2d%20575" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="252 A.2d 575">252 A. 2d at 576</a>. We held that these statements by the mayor constituted interrogation and that the resulting confession was inadmissible: “This certainly was not an innocent attempt on the part of the mayor to strike up a friendly conversation to help appellant pass the time until the police returned from their search. There is no difference for constitutional purposes between questioning an accused outright and more subtly suggesting that he incriminate himself without being asked specific questions. ... In our view, <em>any question likely </em>

Yet the majority holds that appellant’s statement was “volunteered.” I fail to see how the majority can reach this conclusion, for the confession was clearly given in response to police-initiated questioning. This is hardly a case where a confession was given by an accused “without any prompting.” <em>See Simala, </em><a href="/pa/434/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="434 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1922651" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0219-01">434 Pa. at 226</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20A.2d%20575" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="252 A.2d 575">252 A. 2d at 579</a>.</p>

        <em> </em>Just as giving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings only after interrogation has begun cannot cure the original defect, the giving of the warnings before taking his statement, but after the questioning in the elevator—and after appellant had asserted his rights—cannot cure the error.

This raises serious doubts about the voluntariness of the confession, even apart from <em>Miranda. </em>See <em>Culombe v.

However, I find it difficult, on the state of this record, to decide whether appellant’s will had been overborne. There is no indication that an opinion has ever been filed by the suppression court or the trial court, and thus it is extremely difficult to review that court’s decision as to voluntariness. Hence, in any event, the ease should at <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>least be remanded for tbe filing of an opinion, see Pa. S. Ot.
