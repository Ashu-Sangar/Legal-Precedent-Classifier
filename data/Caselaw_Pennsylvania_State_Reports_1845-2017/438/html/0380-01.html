The “liberality” of the several states’ divorce laws varies greatly and no choice of law rules have developed whereby the forum state would take into account the fact that the marriage is “multi-jurisdictional.” Each forum will apply its own divorce laws and so long as one of the parties is a bona fide domiciliary, the final decree of the rendering state will be binding in all other states. See <em>Williams v.

If a litigant decides to risk contempt of court and violate the injunction, it is possible that he will be able to secure a valid, binding decree in the more hospitable state.

In a sense, such injunctions help fill the need for adequate choice of law rules in divorce litigation. For when a court is called upon to issue an anti-suit injunction, it has a chance to weigh the interests of each jurisdiction, issuing the injunction if it feels its interests predominate. For example, if the issuing court’s jurisdiction has been invoked first, the injunction is a way to insure a normal course of adjudication. See <em>Wenz v. Wenz, </em><a href="/pa/400/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="400 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1292498" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0397-01">400 Pa. 397</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20376" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="162 A.2d 376">162 A. 2d 376</a> (1960). While sister states will normally defer to the court which first acquires jurisdiction, the principle of comity does not work very well in the divorce area. Also, anti-suit injunctions can prevent harassment of one of the parties;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> in the divorce area, such harassment may take the form of going to an inconvenient forum to which the other spouse either cannot, or will not, go. Most importantly, an anti-suit injunction helps insure that the issuing court’s law will be applied. In the <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>normal suit where more than one state may constitutionally exercise jurisdiction, courts are prone to weigh the respective interests of all the concerned jurisdictions, and an anti-suit injunction may not be very necessary. In a divorce action, however, each state will apply only its own divorce law; an anti-suit injunction proceeding gives the issuing court an opportunity to examine its contacts with the marriage relationship and to decide whether it is essential that its law apply.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

Such a finding would, obviously, indicate that the other jurisdiction has no contacts with the marriage relationship, and therefore no concern with applying its own law. We have also stated, however, that we will refuse to issue an anti-suit injunction where one spouse is a bona fide domiciliary of another state, apparently basing our refusal on the United States Supreme Court’s holding in <em>Williams v. North Carolina (I), </em>supra. See <em>Smith v.

But this does not mean that we are constitutionally barred from enjoining that spouse from proceeding in the other state. New York, for example, has issued anti-suit injunctions where the enjoined spouse may have had a bona fide <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>domicile in another state.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> In fact anti-snit injunctions have often been employed in cases where some other forum can constitutionally exercise jurisdiction and issue a final decree binding under the full faith and credit clause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> See, e.g., <em>Pope, Miles, Kepner, </em><a href="/us/314/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="314 U.S. 44" data-case-ids="6136873" data-case-paths="/us/314/0044-01">supra.</a></p>

Rather, it should turn on the factors articulated above, the most important being whether Pennsylvania contacts with the marriage relationship so outweigh the other state’s contacts as to make it vital that our divorce law should govern.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[129,828,1161,1189]]]'>Applying these principles to the instant case, it first appears that the divorce action was originally commenced in Pennsylvania, and thus an injunction can help us proceed with our normal course of adjudication. Further, the hearing court found that the Monihans have been married for nine years, have four children ranging in age from three to eight years, and have resided in Philadelphia all their lives, except during the period that Dr. Monihan was in the military service. The contact with Nevada, on the other hand, consists only of a short residence there by Dr. Monihan, such residence commencing <em>after </em>Mrs. Monihan informed her husband that she would contest the divorce he had already begun in Pennsylvania. Thus it is clear that Pennsylvania’s interests in the marriage relationship— the length of residence in Pennsylvania and the domicile of the four young children in Pennsylvania—plus our interest in the orderly adjudication of a divorce action originally begun here, far outweigh Nevada’s very slight interests in the relationship. Hence I agree with the majority that the injunction was properly issued in this case.</p>
