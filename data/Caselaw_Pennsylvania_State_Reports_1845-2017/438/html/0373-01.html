    <p id="b490-10" data-blocks='[["BL_490.17",490,[182,1540,1157,863]]]'>On July 1,1957, Frank McCoy and James Allen entered the grocery store owned by Gaetano Sabelli, a former employer of McCoy, and perpetrated an armed robbery, during which McCoy shot and killed Sabelli while Allen acted as “lookout.” McCoy was tried by a jury and convicted of murder in the first degree, sentenced to death and subsequently executed. Allen pleaded guilty to a charge of murder generally, was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Commonwealth then tried appellant Coleman, charging that he was a participant, driving the “get-away” car and therefore an accessory before and after the fact. Appellant was brought to trial before the Honorable Bernard J. Kelley and a jury on June 22, 1959, on Indictment No. 993, April Sessions, 1958, charging murder.</p>

      <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>At the trial, both McCoy and Allen testified for the Commonwealth. Their testimony established that when appellant drove McCoy and Allen to the neighborhood of the crime, he had full knowledge that McCoy had a gun which he intended to use in committing a robbery of Sabelli’s store.</p>
    <p id="b491-3" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[141,728,1148,373]]]'>Appellant’s defense was that he knew nothing about the plans of McCoy and Allen for the robbery, or McCoy’s possession of a gun. He only knew what Allen told him, which was that Allen and McCoy were to borrow money from a numbers writer. He had never met McCoy before McCoy got into his car the morning of the robbery.</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[141,1113,1149,367]]]'>The jury must have believed Allen and McCoy, not Coleman, because on June 25, 1959, appellant was found guilty of murder in the first degree and the jury fixed the penalty at life imprisonment. On January 4, 1961, we affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

Judge Kelley heard testimony by Frank McCoy on January 25, 1962, shortly before he was executed. At that hearing McCoy’s testimony did not contradict the testimony he had given at Coleman’s trial, where he testified that he never knew Coleman before, that he heard Allen tell Coleman that they were going to see a numbers writer, but that he and Allen discussed the robbery in Coleman’s presence. However, he did state for the first time that Coleman knew nothing about the robbery or the plans for the robbery and he refuted the testimony which Allen had given at Coleman’s trial, namely that the robbery had been discussed by the three men at breakfast that morning.</p>

Allen stated that Ms original statement to the police, which did not implicate Coleman, was true and that Ms testimony at Coleman’s trial, which contradicted his previous statement, was perjury. He again testified that appellant knew nothing about the robbery and that he (Allen) had lied at appellant’s trial because he was angry at appellant for refusing to help him obtain a lawyer and for going out with his girl while he (Allen) was in jail. In addition, Allen testified that his decision to implicate Coleman was strengthened by favors he received from the District Attorney’s office, and promises made by men at that office not to oppose him in having his sentence commuted and to help him to receive a better job while in prison.</p>

Both co-felons have now recanted their testimony. The majority holds that appellant’s right to a new trial depends on whether the hearing court believed the recanting testimony, and that since it did not, its decision to deny a new trial must be affirmed. I believe, however, that we must examine this case somewhat more closely and that, given the nature of the original testimony and the facts surrounding the recanting testimony, the hearing court erred when it denied appellant a new trial. Hence, I must dissent.</p>
    <p id="b494-7" data-blocks='[["BL_494.9",494,[187,1324,1155,695]]]'>Appellant was tried as a participant in the robbery-murder of a grocery store owner. The issue in dispute at appellant’s trial was whether, when he drove his co-felons to the grocery store, he knew that they were going there to commit a robbery. Both Frank McCoy, the murderer, and James Allen, the other robber, testified that appellant was informed of the robbery beforehand; appellant testified that he thought he was driving McCoy and Allen to a numbers writer to borrow money. McCoy testified that appellant knew McCoy had a gun; appellant denied this. The jury evidently believed the Commonwealth’s witnesses and convicted appellant.</p>

    <p id="b495-3" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[129,601,1155,749]]]'>It was not until nearly one year later that the Commonwealth’s second witness, Allen, likewise recanted his testimony. On January 9, 1963, Allen, admitting under oath that he had committed perjury at appellant’s trial, testified that appellant was completely innocent. This was now in conformity with the testimony Allen gave at his own trial, where he stated that appellant was unaware that a crime was to be committed. Further, Allen indicated why he had lied at appellant’s trial. While Allen was in jail and appellant out on bail, appellant had refused Allen’s request for money to hire a lawyer, and had attempted to date Allen’s girl friend. Allen is presently in jail serving a life sentence for his participation in the murder.</p>
    <p id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[124,1362,1154,643]]]'>Thus appellant stands convicted solely on testimony which originally emanated from a corrupt source, alleged co-felons, and has now been fully and explicitly recanted. One witness, Allen, has returned to his former story exculpating appellant, giving a highly credible reason for his deceitful deviation. The other, McCoy, had changed his testimony only after all avenues of appeal had been exhausted and he was about to die. Both men are now admitted perjurers. Appellant, on the other hand, has consistently told the same account, and his actions on the day of the crime were perfectly consistent with his testimony.</p>

It is not now a question of whether the hearing court believed or disbelieved the recanting testimony.
