Unfortunately, the business did not fare well and shortly after the Zeidmans commenced operation they began to negotiate for the sale of the business to one Donnelly. At that time the vice-president of National, Jules Caplen, contacted the Zeidmans’ attorney and asked to be allowed to attempt to find a purchaser other than Donnelly, whom Caplen thought unable to handle the business. Caplen’s interest in the Zeidman venture stemmed from the fact that National stood to <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>take a substantial loss if the Zeidmans or tbeir successors in interest defaulted on the installment sales contract under which the equipment had been purchased.</p>
    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[210,601,1158,715]]]'>Caplen eventually suggested that the business be sold to two individuals, Klein and Jablonski, whom he knew to be capable and responsible restaurant operators. As an inducement Caplen stated that if the Zeidmans accepted his suggested purchasers he would indemnify the Zeidmans against payment of the restaurant’s outstanding debts. The Zeidmans’ attorney then called Caplen and told him the Zeidmans would agree to sell the restaurant to Klein and Jablonski, but only after they received a signed indemnification agreement from Caplen. As a result of these negotiations, Caplen signed and delivered to the Zeidmans the following agreement:</p>

The Zeidmans contend that the award was a compromise and that they are entitled to recover much more.</p>
