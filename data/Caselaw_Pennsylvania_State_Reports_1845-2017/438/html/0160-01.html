First, I believe that Riggins’ preliminary hearing should properly have been heard by a judge of the Family Court Division. In <em>Gaskins Case, </em><a href="/pa/430/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="430 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1915774" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0298-01">430 Pa. 298</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="244 A.2d 662">244 A. 2d 662</a> (1968), this Court said: “We, therefore, hold that when a juvenile has been charged with murder, and a prima facie case has been made out by the Commonwealth in Juvenile Court proceedings, such juvenile must be held for further criminal proceedings.” <a href="/pa/430/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="430 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1915774" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0298-01">430 Pa. at 310</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="244 A.2d 662">244 A. 2d at 669</a>. And earlier in the same opinion we noted with approval the Common<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>wealth’s contention that “. . . the purpose of this procedure is to assure a juvenile that he will enjoy the protection afforded by the Juvenile Court until the Commonwealth has presented a prima facie case of murder.” <a href="/pa/430/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="430 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1915774" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0298-01">430 Pa. at 307</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="244 A.2d 662">244 A. 2d at 667</a>. I feel that it is ill-advised of the majority to abandon an entirely salutory rule which we so recently approved and adopted as our own.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[194,835,1157,1022]]]'>My second disagreement with the majority concerns its interpretation of the new Article V of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The majority apparently believes that Section 16(g) of the schedule to that article justifies the procedure used in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> I cannot agree for two reasons. First, I can find no indication that the trial division jurist assigned to hear this case sat as a member of the Family Court Division and not as a trial division member. At the very least a trial division judge specially assigned to hear a case properly brought in the Family Court Division is required to conduct those proceedings in accordance with the rules of the division to which he has been assigned. Secondly, I do not believe that Section 16(g) authorizes the transíerral of a judge to another division for the sole purpose of holding a single preliminary hearing where there is nothing in the record to indicate that the special assignment was in any way “required to expedite the business of the court.”</p>
