After the testimony was taken the following colloquy occurred: “Me. Hummer [defense counsel]: Your Honor, I would like to say one thing. I think it is obvious from his testimony that this is not one of the leaders in whatever this gang consisted of, or whatever occurred here, and I don’t even believe he was one of the main perpetrators. I think he was perhaps along with them, and as his own testimony was, he admitted that he did participate in the fracas. The Court: Well, of course he has been in trouble before. In 1965 he was charged with burglary and placed on probation. You also have some trouble going to school, don’t you? Dependant: Yes, sir. The Court: Were you suspended from school also? You seem to be in need of some stricter discipline. Isn’t that about right? Dependant: I don’t know. The Court: You don’t know. Well, if you don’t know, the court so finds from the testimony in this case and from your prior conduct. The court adjudges Charles Laverne Wilson a delinquent and commits him to the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. . . ,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

It is quite clear that the hearing judge in this case drew no distinction between those issues which were relevant to the adjudication and those which were important only in determining the length of commitment. Rather, he obviously based the adjudication of delinquency on two previous incidents in which Wilson had been involved, a school suspension and a “burglary,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> as well as on the finding that he had participated in the street fight that led to the initiation of the proceedings. Neither Wilson, nor his parents, nor his counsel were alerted to the fact that these prior occurrences were going to be considered, and were therefore not prepared to either offer testimony or to argue the seriousness or relevance of these past events. In short, Wilson was not really given an opportunity to try several major aspects of Ms case.</p>

The ‘burglary’ mentioned by the lower court refers to an incident which occurred when Wilson was 13 years old. At that time he broke a window in a public school, ran water in the school’s toilet bowls and knocked a soap dispenser from the wall for a total damage of $8. He was placed on 14 months probation, and from the record, his conduct appears to have been satisfactory in that interval.

In that section the majority states: “It is quite clear that the hearing judge in this case drew no distinction between those issues which were relevant to the adjudication and those which were important only in determining the length of commitment. Rather, he obviously based the adjudication of delinquency on two previous incidents in which Wilson had been involved, a school suspension and a ‘burglary/ as well as on the finding that he had participated in the street fight that led to the initiation of the proceedings.”</p>

      <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>The record discloses the following colloquy. The Court: Were you suspended from school also? You seem to be in need of some stricter discipline. Isn’t that about right? Wilson : I don’t know. The Court : You don’t know. Well, if you don’t know, the court so finds <em>from the testimony in this ease and from your prior eonduet. </em>The court adjudges Charles Láveme Wilson a delinquent and commits, him <em>to </em>the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. . . .” (Emphasis added) It is because Wilson was not given notice of the fact that conduct other than that involved in the assault and battery charge would be evaluated in determining whether he were a delinquent that the majority remands for a new trial. I do not understand how it can then say that the conduct which led to his five-year sentence was the same as would lead to a maximum two-year sentence if he had been tried as an adult. The conduct which led to the finding of delinquency and the five-year sentence was not only -that conduct which would support a charge of simple assault and battery.. Additional conduct was involved, and as such, it is incorrect to state that Wilson was denied the equal protection of the laws because the conduct for which he was sentenced was the same as that which would have pi^odueed a two-year sentence if he had been tried as an adult.</p>

The first two factors must be present in every delinquency adjudication regardless of the prospective sentence, and as to them there can be no question. The third factor, however, states “it must be clear that the longer commitment will result in the juvenile’s receiving appropriate rehabilitative care and not just in his being deprived of his liberty for a longer time.” I do not see how the sen-<a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>fencing court at the time of imposing sentence or the Superior Court or this Count on appeal can determine whether a certain period of commitment will result in appropriate rehabilitative care or deprivation of liberty. Use of -this approach will require courts to guess what the defendant will be doing and what will be done for him during the period of commitment, and it is being unrealistic to expect that courts can make such a determination in a meaningful way. Aside from these three factors, I do not believe that a juvenile can ever be incarcerated for a longer period than an adult for the game conduct. However, the record discloses that this is not the factual situation now before us.</p>
