The court below entered judgment nisi in favor of Michael and Rose Marrazzo in the sum of $21,500 (for the loss of their building) and in favor of John Marrazzo for $30,400 (for the loss of machinery and equipment). It then ordered interest to be paid on both amounts from December 22, 1956, the date of the fire. Defendant filed exceptions, and the court en banc modified the award of interest by making it payable from May 18, 1960, the date on which plaintiffs instituted suit. Defendant appeals from the award of any interest at all, and plaintiffs appeal from the action of the court en banc shortening the period for which interest was payable.</p>

The court en banc, while referring to the award as interest, did recognize the distinction this Court has drawn between interest and compensation for delay. It stated: “While the Trial Judge did not indicate his reason for awarding interest from December 22, 1956, it would appear obvious that the said Judge felt he could not properly assign cause for the delay to either party exclusively, and, therefore, properly held that it was correct to add [to] the award, an additional amount in the form of interest so that the said award would bear. some reasonable resemblance to what it would have meant had the Plaintiffs been allowed the use of it commencing with the date of the damage by the fire.</p>

We think a more appropriate date in fairness to all parties concerned and which is more thoroughly justified by the record in this case would be the date on which this action was instituted by the Plaintiffs, May 18, 1960.” The court en banc erred in speculating that the trial judge felt he could not assign cause for the delay to either party exclusively. There is nothing on the record to indicate the trial judge employed the proper legal standard or what circumstances he considered in arriving at his decision. The record does disclose a wide <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>gap between the plaintiffs’ demands and the final award, but this fact alone is not dispositive of the issue.
