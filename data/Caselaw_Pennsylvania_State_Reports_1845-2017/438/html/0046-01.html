The owners were out of town at the time. To minimize possible detection, the felons lit matches to find their way around the house, rather than turn on the lights. As each match burned down, it was dropped or thrown to the floor. A head of one of the matches lodged in between the cushion and overstuffing of a chair. When the felons departed from the premises, there was no sign of fire, but the match head which landed in the chair, as be<a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>fore related, ignited the material, which, after smoldering for hours, finally resulted in a fire which completely destroyed the house and personal property therein.</p>

A jury trial resulted in a verdict against all defendants and in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $70,375.99. Samuel Harrison, one of the defendants, was covered against liability by a homeowner’s policy with a $25,000 policy limit. His insurer settled the claim against him for $24,000 and secured a release.</p>

There was an <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>exclusion in the policy which provided that “Section II of this Policy does not Apply: ... (c) under Coverages E and F, to . . . property damage caused intentionally by or at the direction of the Insured.”</p>
    <p id="b165-3" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[160,623,1150,689]]]'>Royal’s contentions on appeal are two-fold. It first alleges that the acts committed by Hornberger were intentional and therefore excluded from coverage under the policy. However, the question is not whether the dropping of the matches was an “intentional act,” but rather whether the resulting property damage was “intentionally caused” by the insured. The insurance policy does not exclude damage resulting from intentional acts of the insured but only damage intentionally caused by him. There is no basis on which to conclude that the insured in this case intended to cause any property damage in dropping the matches as they burned down to the end of the stem.</p>

    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[172,498,1153,260]]]'>Royal’s second allegation is that it would be against public policy to allow recovery on the insurance contract since the property damage occurred as a result of acts performed by the insured in the course of the commission of a crime. We are not so persuaded.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[172,770,1154,962]]]'>We note initially that the insurance contract itself does not contain a “violation of law” clause. Royal is thus placed in the position of asserting that we should rewrite the policy to provide for a contingency which it could have provided for itself. However, under the facts of this case, we are not confronted with any overriding public policy which would preclude recovery. There is no evidence whatsoever that the policy was procured <em>in contemplation </em>of the crime. Nor can the insurance policy be said to have <em>promoted </em>the unlawful act. Moreover, it seems equally implausible that denying coverage would serve as a crime <em>deterrent. </em>Finally, the insurance policy in no way saves the insured from the consequences of his criminal act. In the contest of this case, the sanctions of the criminal law and the coverage of the insurance policy address themselves to quite separate and distinct actions on the part of the insured.</p>
