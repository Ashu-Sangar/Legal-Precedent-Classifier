      <em> </em>The decision is somewhat of a paradox, being both broad and narrow at the same time. It is broad in that it evidences a fundamental and far-reaching disillusionment with the anticipated benefits of the juvenile court system: “ [T]he highest motives and most enlightened impulses led to a peculiar system for juveniles, unknown to our law in any comparable context. The constitutional and theoretical basis for this peculiar system is—to say the least—debatable. And in practice, as we remarked in the <em>Kent </em>ease, supra, the results have not been entirely satisfactory. Juvenile Court history has again demonstrated that unbridled discretion, however benevolently motivated, is frequently a poor substitute for principle and procedure. . . . The absence of substantive standards has not necessarily meant that children receive careful, compassionate, individualized treatment. The absence of procedural rules based upon constitutional principle has not always produced fair, efficient, and effective procedures.

If we had only ithe broader language it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the Supreme Court had concluded that juvenile courts must comply with <em>all </em>the requirements of due process. The holdings do not, however, seem to contemplate so large a result, and our task is to decide whether the right to a jury trial ought to be operative in the juvenile court under the reasoning of <em>Kent </em>and <em>Gault </em>or under our own reading of the Constitution.</p>

The Supreme Court there held that the “Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which—were they to be tried in a federal court— would come within the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Again, the Court spoke in sweeping language, calling the right to trial by jury fundamental to our system of justice, and installed the right to a jury trial as one of those protections in the Bill of Rights which is fully applicable as a restraint on state conduct.</p>

In a discussion of the proper standards for “incorporation,” the Court indicated that a new standard had been operating in recent cases. No longer was the inquiry to focus on whether <em>some </em>civilized system of justice could be constructed without utilization of a particular safeguard. Realizing that every state in the union <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>operated under highly similar versions of the Anglo-American common law system, the Court declared that incorporation was appropriate whenever a particular procedure was fundamental to this kind of a legal system—“whether, that is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered'Miberty.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The Court then enumerated those protections in the Bill of Rights which had recently been made applicable to the states, and concluded that of each “it might be said that the limitation in question is not necessarily fundamental to fairness in every criminal system that might be imagined but is fundamental in the context of the criminal processes maintained by the American States.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Referring specifically to the right to trial by jury, the Court stated that a “criminal process which was fair and equitable but used no juries is easy to imagine. It would make use of alternative guarantees and protections which would serve the purposes that the jury serves in the English and American system.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Further, we are confident that juveniles also enjoy the right to have a transcript of the hearing, the right of appellate review,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> and the right to be declared delinquent only upon evidence which demonstrates that the facts upon which the declaration is made are true beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Together these rights insure that the juvenile court will operate in an atmosphere which is orderly enough to impress the juvenile with the gravity of the situation and the impartiality of the tribunal<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> and at the same time informal enough to permit the benefits of the juvenile system to operate.</p>

      <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>The proper inquiry, then, is whether the right to a trial by jury is “fundamental” within the meaning of <em>Duncan, </em>in the context of a juvenile court which operates with <em>all </em>of the above constitutional safeguards. Since the Supreme Court felt that the right was “fundamental” in the context of the normal criminal process, which also operates with all of these safeguards, it is our view that the answer to our inquiry turns upon whether there are elements in the juvenile process which render the right to a trial by jury less essential to the protection of an accused’s rights in the juvenile' system than in the normal criminal process, and therefore not so “fundamental” as to be constitutionally required.</p>
    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[163,1103,1160,540]]]'>We believe that such factors do inhere in the juvenile system.

And although the experts are not nearly so numerous as one might hope, they still provide the juvenile courts with services specially designed to aid minors, which are far superior to those available in <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>the regular criminal process. It is the opportunities for progress offered by this area which constitute the single best reason for preserving the juvenile system. Properly operated, the juvenile system is capable of giving understanding and sympathetic treatment for each juvenile by providing the correctional, rehabilitative and instructional attention appropriate to each case. Having recognized the value of this approach, it is indeed regrettable that it is as inadequately utilized as it is. In this area more than in any other, it is the false economies of today which will contribute exponentially to the waste of tomorrow. Yet a little bit of wisdom is better than none, and in the end we see this aspect of the juvenile system, underused though it may be, as constituting one of its very real strengths.</p>
    <p id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[128,1219,1159,762]],["BL_466.1",466,[169,390,1154,98]]]'>Third, we must recognize that the end result of a declaration of delinquency <em>is </em>significantly different from and less onerous than a finding of criminal guilt. There is no public record of the adjudication,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> and its results are not admissible in subsequent legal proceedings. None of the disabilities which follow a criminal conviction attach to an adjudicated delinquent,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> and most importantly, the institutions to which juveniles are committed are something less than jails, for there is a greater emphasis on rehabilitation. We do not mean to say that the post-adjudication process has lived up to expectations. It has in many respects fallen far short of its goals, and its reality is far harsher than its theory. But we are not yet convinced that the cur<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>rent practices do not contain the seeds from which a truly appropriate system can be brought forth.</p>

Utilization of the other due process rights in 'the juvenile courts will not require the judge to abandon traditional practices; the hearing can still be conducted with some flexibility and with patience and understanding. A jury trial, on the other hand, by replacing the judge as the finder of fact, would probably require substantial alteration of the traditional practices. Faced with the necessity of refereeing a contest between the state and one of its juvenile citizens, and deprived of the power of the final arbiter, the juvenile court judge would of necessity have to concern himself much more with the technicalities of proper procedure, and would have a vastly reduced capacity to guide and mold the hearings. It is our view that the procedural rights which we have held applicable in the juvenile process will give the juveniles sufficient protection, and there is no need to add an element, the right to a trial by jury, which might well destroy the traditional character of juvenile proceedings.</p>

In that footnote, 391 IT.®, at 149-50, the Court stated that incorporation was proper whenever “given this kind of system a particular procedure is fundamental—whether, that is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty.” The Court then stated that it could easily imagine a fair and equitable criminal system that used no juries and remarked that such a system “would make use of alternative guarantees and protections which would serve the purposes that the jury serves in the English and American systems.” That statement in no sense narrows the holding in <em>Duncan; </em>if anything, it amplifies it by emphasizing the role the jury plays in the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence. <em>Duncan </em>clearly stands for the proposition that the due process of law requires that the states provide jury trials in all serious criminal cases.</p>

Certainly the process by which one is adjudged a delinquent has little to do with the understanding and sympathetic treatment the juvenile system is capable of giving through correctional, rehabilitative and instructional attention. What is done with an individual after it is determined he is a delinquent is a very different problem from that concerning the process by which it is decided that he is a delinquent.</p>

This includes no public record of the adjudication, the inadmissibility of the results in subsequent legal proceedings, the nonimposition of the disabilities which follow a criminal conviction, and the fact that institutions for juveniles are “something less than jails.” In <em>WinsMp, </em>however, the United States Supreme Court stated, <a href="/us/397/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="397 U.S. 358" data-case-ids="12054393" data-case-paths="/us/397/0358-01">397 U.S. at </a>365: “We do not find convincing the contrary arguments of the New York Court of Appeals, <em>(¡fault </em>rendered untenable much of the reasoning relied upon by that court to sustain the constitutionality of §744(b).

    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[192,569,1166,1416]]]'>The final element is the disruption of the unique nature of the juvenile process which would allegedly occur with the introduction of trial by jury. There seems little doubt that the introduction of jury trials would necessitate the judge’s concerning himself with the technicalities of proper procedure to a greater extent than required now and would reduce somewhat the flexibility and informality of the hearing. It would seem, however, that the beneficial aspects of the juvenile system result not from the adjudicatory stage but rather from the pre- and post-adjudicative stages in. which, hopefully, some rehabilitation can be accomplished. It is difficult to see how the informality or flexibility of the hearing can have much effect on molding the juvenile’s outlook so that his conduct will be in conformity with the rules society has established. Informality and flexibility are not ends in themselves : the purpose of the adjudicatory stage is to determine whether the defendant is a delinquent, and as some loss of informality and flexibility will not have a great effect on whatever rehabilitation the juvenile system can accomplish, I do <em>not </em>see an alteration of the “traditional character of juvenile proceedings” as so weighty a factor as to render the right to a jury trial less fundamental in the juvenile system than in the ordinary criminal process.</p>

Thus, due process and parens patriae have come into direct conflict. Such conflict can be seen in the decisions of this Court. For example, the majority opinion in <em>Wilson Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/438/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="438 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1929230" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0425-01">438 Pa. 425</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20614" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="264 A.2d 614">264 A. 2d 614</a> (1970), emphasizes constitutional requirements while the tone of the majority opinion in this action reflects the feeling that juveniles and tire juvenile court system are somehow different and special and that the beneficial aspects of the juvenile process will be destroyed by the application of too many of the rights given adults. The trend of the United States Supreme Court decisions, however, appears to be away from parens patriae in the adjudicatory stage, and the right to trial by jury is an essential part of the adjudicatory process. I do not see valid reasons why <em>Duncan </em>should not apply to the juvenile court system.</p>

We, of course, will be bound by its decision, and, as we have waited this long for this difficult issue to be resolved, we should wait until the matter is finally settled. Once the <em>Bwrrus </em>opinion is filed, our opinion in this action will be of no consequence, and it is a futile effort for us to deal with this issue at this time.</p>
