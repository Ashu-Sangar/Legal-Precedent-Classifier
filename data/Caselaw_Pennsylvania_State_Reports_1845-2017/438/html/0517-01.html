He was questioned extensively until late in the day, when police officers took him home. This procedure was again repeated on the next day. On January 31 appellee’s sister gave police a statement indicating that appellee had killed a man on the date in question. The next day appellee was again taken to police headquarters. He was questioned from 11:30 A.M. until 5:30 P.M., when he finally made an oral admission. It was at this time that appellee was first warned of his constitutional rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Commonwealth points out, however, that after appellee gave his oral incriminating statement, one and one-half hours elapsed before the written confession was begun, during which time appellee was given the required warnings and was allowed to see his mother. These facts, the Commonwealth urges, show that the written confession was not tainted by the prior illegal questioning and confession, and hence the written confession <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>was properly admitted.

This is unlike the instant case, where the confession was obtained only after a three-day period of questioning. Clearly by the third day there was no doubt that the investigation had focused on the accused, and on that day seven hours of custodial interrogation preceded the required warnings.

Nor can the recital of the required warnings at such a late stage in the interrogation process remove the taint. Custodial interrogation was nearly completed and an oral confession obtained before the giving of the warnings. To hold that giving warnings at this point can purge a written confession of the taint of illegal interrogation would be to completely eviscerate both the clear mandate and the specific holding of Miranda—the warnings must be given before any interrogation begins.</p>
