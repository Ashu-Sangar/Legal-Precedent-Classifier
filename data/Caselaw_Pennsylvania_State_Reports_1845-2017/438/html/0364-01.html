The court below felt appellant had not shown a reasonable explanation or excuse for the delay and thus insufficient equitable considerations were present to justify opening the judgment. The record shows that the complaint was served on appellant’s wife and not on his counsel, that his education ended with the ninth grade, and that the notice to plead was in very small letters. A person untrained in the law would not be looking for any such notice, and when it was in such small lettering it was unlikely to catch his attention. Taking judgment so early on the twenty-first day together with the small notice to plead gives the impression that all this was a studied attempt by appellee to obtain a default judgment. Under all the circumstances, we feel appellant did show a reasonable explanation and excuse for ¡the delay and that the court below abused its discretion in refusing to open the judgment.</p>

They show that upon being served with the writ, “defendant promptly turned [it] over to his insurance agent who, on August 19,1968, forwarded it to the Eegional Claims Office of the defendant’s liability insurance carrier”, Ohio Casualty Insurance Co. (appellant’s brief). The copy of the complaint which was served by registered mail on the following October 4 was accompanied by a letter from plaintiff’s attorney to defendant. It gave the full caption of the case, and said “Enclosed herewith please find a true and correct copy of the original complaint filed by me in this matter with the Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County.” The defendant delayed sending the complaint to his insurance agent because “I thought the case was over and done with. I wanted to talk to somebody about it that <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>could enlighten me, so to speak.” He tried without success to reach an attorney friend of his. He wanted to talk to his insurance agent, Mr. Yoos, to whom he had earlier forwarded the summons, because “I was concerned.” When asked why he didn’t telephone Mr. Yoos, the answer was, “Truthfully can’t say.” Defendant did, however, mail the complaint to Mr. Yoos, who received it on October 14, 1968. On the same day, Mr. Yoos sent it to the Regional Claims Office of the insurance carrier with a covering letter reading (after a subject caption which identified the claimant and the insured) : “On 8-19-68 we sent you Summons in Trespass. Now att. is Complaint rec. by us from insured today. Please handle as necessary.”</p>
    <p id="b485-4" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[140,1175,1156,1253]]]'>The claims manager of the Philadelphia branch office of the insurance company, a Mr. Melson, testified that the complaint was received in his office on October 15 from Mr. Yoos, the agent. Melson made no attempt to find out when the complaint had been served, but assumed this had occurred shortly before October 14, the date of mailing to him. He first spoke to the insurance company attorney (the attorney for appellant here) about the matter on the late afternoon of October 25, 1968. When asked on direct examination why he had not referred the matter to his counsel before October 25, he answered, “Well, it was a matter of business in general. I had been attending a trial, I believe in Delaware County, and had a number of other such matters.” On cross-examination he repeated the substance of this answer, saying “. . . well, there was no reason other than occupation both with the trial and with the other suits and the assumption made that it [the complaint] had been received by the insured on or closely before the fourteenth.” Mr. Melson stated that he had seventeen men working under him. He identified a Donald Chabin as an adjuster in his office who had worked on this case.</p>

      <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>As President Judge Gawthrop in Ms opinion below observed, a period of two months and ten days elapsed between the service of the writ and the taMng of judgment, during which time an appearance could have been entered; after the complaint was received in the Philadelphia claims department of the defendant’s insurance carrier, there were still nine days within which to enter a timely appearance. And as Judge Gawthrop notes, “Mere reference to the date of the affidavit to the complaint, made October 2, 1968, as shown on the copy served would have been cautionary as to the time available to appear and answer.” As for the nine day delay of the defendant himself in forwarding the complaint to Mr. Yoos, the agent, it is noted that the writ, a much less informative document than the complaint, was promptly sent by him to the insurance company when it was served in August.</p>

Thus it states, in the first place, that “the complaint was served on appellant’s wife and not on his counsel.” What the record shows is that the <em>writ of summons, </em>not the complaint, was served on defendant’s wife on August 15. Service on an adult member of the family of a defendant is certainly good service. Pa. K.C.P. 1009. The <em>complaint </em>was sent to his home by registered mail (it does not <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>have to be registered) as permitted by Pa. B.C.P. 1027 (2) and received there October 4. More importantly, no counsel ever appeared for defendant, and so obviously could not be served.</p>
    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[147,616,1156,1466]]]'>In the second place, the majority opinion suggests that the taking of judgment so early on the 21st day (9:08 a.m. on October 25) coupled with a small-type notice to plead on the cover of the complaint “was a studied attempt by appellee to obtain a default judgment.” This seems to cast aspersion on the plaintiff and her counsel which I consider to be wholly unwarranted. Canon 15 of the Canons of Professional Ethics, which in 1968 were in force in this Commonwealth (Pa. B.C.P. 205), provides in part: “The lawyer owes ‘entire devotion to the interest of the client, warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his rights and the exertion of his utmost learning and ability,’ to the end that nothing be taken or be withheld from him, save by the rules of law, legally applied. No fear of judicial disfavor or public unpopularity should restrain him from the full discharge of his duty. In the judicial forum the client is entitled to the benefit of any and every remedy and defense that is authorized by the law of the land, and he may expect Ms lawyer to assert every such remedy or defense. But it is steadfastly to be borne in mind that the great trust of the lawyer is to be performed within and not without the bounds of the law. The office of attorney does not permit, much less does it demand of him for any client, violation of law or any manner of fraud or chicane. He must obey his own conscience and not that of his client.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

      <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>No one is happy with “snap” judgments, probably including the lawyer who takes one. “Lawyers are accused of taking advantage of ‘loopholes’ and ‘technicalities’ to win. Persons who make this charge are unaware, or do not understand, that the lawyer is hired to win, and if he does not exercise every legitimate effort in his client’s behalf, then he is betraying a sacred trust.” Rochelle and Payne, “The Struggle for Public Understanding,” 25 <em>Texas B. J. </em>109, 159 (1962). Had there been counsel for defendant in the picture here, even informally, the case would be entirely different. Canon 25 would—or should—have prevented the action here taken without notice to opposing counsel. Indeed, one of the great satisfactions in the practice of the legal profession is the reciprocal good faith, mutual respect and courtesy that normally exist between and among lawyers in the conduct of litigation, as well as in their other dealings with each other. One of the fruits of this standard of conduct is that the taking of judgment without notice to opposing counsel is, happily, a rarity. The case before us, however, had been pending for over two months, and no attorney for defendant had appeared. The complaint had been duly served a full 20 days, and no attorney for defendant had appeared. How long beyond that time should one be required to wait?</p>

The statute of limitations is, to be sure, a meritorious defense, and the defense that will be pleaded here, but this is not to say that the plaintiff should not have brought a suit to which the statute could be pleaded. The defense of the statute is an affirmative defense and may be waived. Pa. R. C.
