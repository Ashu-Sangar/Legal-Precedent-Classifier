Hazel’s father, James B. Chambers, executed his will on December 12, 1930, including the bequest to Hazel’s “children, if any.” Paul McGill died from an accident in September, 1931, and on May 6, 1933, the testator died.

The presently pertinent portion of the 1917 Act reads as follows: “Whenever in any will a bequest or devise shall be made to the child or children of any person other than the testator, without naming such child or children, such bequest or devise shall be construed to include any adopted child or children of such other person who were adopted before the date of the will, <em>unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will ” </em>Act of June 7, 1917, P.

In the case at bar, unimpeached and uncontradicted evidence was presented at the hearing which indicated: that Hazel McGill could not have children and, therefore, adopted Paul; that this fact was common knowledge in the community of about 1,300 people; that the testator was a leading figure in the area and was well aware of local affairs; that the testator was very close to his daughter, Hazel, and doted upon his adopted grandson, Paul; and that the testator did, in fact, know that Paul had been adopted and that Hazel could bear no children of her own.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In short, the appellant’s evidence clearly established that when James B.

      <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>We return, now, to the will itself wherein a bequest is made to Hazel’s “children.” Because of the factual situation in 1930, when the will was written, the only natural interpretation that could conceivably be given this bequest is that the testator intended to provide for his adopted grandson, Paul McGill, and for any other children adopted by Hazel in the future. Any other explanation would not only be absurd under the facts of this case, but would render the bequest nugatory. A testator is presumed not to have included mere surplusage in his will. <em>Benedum Estate, </em><a href="/pa/427/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="427 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1910356" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0408-01">427 Pa. 408</a>, 415-16, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20129" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="235 A.2d 129">235 A. 2d 129</a>, 133 (1967). By his use of the plural noun, “children,” the testator evidenced an intent to include in his bequest any child or children which Hazel might have in addition to the one child, Paul, who had already been adopted. Since the testator knew that Hazel could <em>only </em>have additional children by adoption, he <em>must </em>have intended to provide for these children. The provision for Hazel’s “children” makes utterly no sense unless it was intended to include after-adopted children.</p>

In <em>Holton Estate, </em>we found <em>no </em>such indication on the following facts: the will provided for the testator’s son, Howard, and for Howard’s children; Howard’s wife, not Howard, was incapable of having children; and, no children were adopted by Howard until almost four years <em>after </em>the testator’s death. On those facts, it would be equally plausible to either find that the testator did or that he did not intend to include adopted children in his will. Accordingly, we were forced to resort to the legislative rule of construction in the Act of 1917.</p>

There are three factors present in the instant case which require us to reach a different result from the <em>Holton </em>case.

Third, Hazel and her father had a very close relationship, and she and her son spent a great deal of time with the testator. All these facts make it clear that the testator in the instant case was a concerned and devoted father and grandfather who wished to provide for Hazel’s children, regardless of any <em>legal </em>distinctions drawn between relationship by adoption and relationship by blood.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> William James McGill is entitled to take under his grandfather’s will as one of Hazel McGill’s “children:”</p>

The daughter had no natural children but adopted a son in 1930, eighteen years after Corr’s death. The daughter’s attempt to exercise her power of appointment in favor of her adopted son was held invalid. This Court stated (p. 340) : ‘Prior to the passage of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P.
