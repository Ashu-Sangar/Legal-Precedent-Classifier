There was no dispute as to the extent of the property taken nor its location, condition, topographical characteristics or the plaintiff’s right to recover its fair worth. In arriving at a just determination of the fair market value, the jury had as criteria the customarily widely disparate opinions of the real estate experts who testified for the respective sides. It was the province of the jury to weigh the credibility of the valuation witnesses’ testimony and to determine what the land taken was fairly <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>worth, at the time of the condemnation. The jurors had a right to, and undoubtedly did, bring to bear, in appraising the expert testimony, what they had perceived with respect to the property at the time they formally viewed it for trial purposes and, further, exercised their own good common sense. To overthrow the verdict on the ground that it was against the weight of the evidence would, in the light of the record, amount to a judicial usurpation of the jury’s province.”</p>
