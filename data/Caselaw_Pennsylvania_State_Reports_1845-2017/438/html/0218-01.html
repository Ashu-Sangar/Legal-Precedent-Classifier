On January 30, 1947, Smith, along with Edward Hough and David Almeida, engaged in an armed robbery of a supermarket in the City of Philadelphia. An off-duty policeman, who happened to be in the area, was shot and killed while attempting to thwart the escape of the felons. Although the evidence as to who fired the fatal shot was conflicting in appellant’s 1948 trial, the court charged the jury that it was irrelevant who fired the fatal bullet: “Even if you should find from the evidence that Ingling was killed by a bullet from the gun of one of the policemen, that policeman having shot at the felons in an attempt to prevent the robbery or the escape of the robbers, or to protect Ingling, the felons would be guilty of murder, or if they did that in returning the fire of the felons that was directed toward them.” To this part of the charge appellant took a specific exception.</p>

The court below held that appellant had knowingly waived his right to appeal, and although the opinion does not discuss the question, the denial of relief necessarily manifested a belief by the court below that appellant was aware of his right to counsel on appeal. The other issues raised by appellant were not mentioned by the court, apparently of the view that they were cognizable only if it appeared that appellant had been denied his right to appeal, and was entitled to an appeal nunc pro tunc.</p>

The Commonwealth contends that appellant was well aware of his right to appeal and his right to appointed counsel on appeal, but deliberately declined to appeal because of his fear of receiving the death penalty upon retrial if he should be successful in gaining a new trial. The Commonwealth argues in its brief: “The major consideration in appellant’s choice was the possibility of a death sentence on retrial.”</p>

In a thorough analysis of the constitutional issues involved, we held that it was violative of a defendant’s constitutional rights to be placed in jeopardy of a death sentence in a second trial, once he has been found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. In <em>Littlejohn </em>both sides agreed that the reason that the post-trial motions were withdrawn was the fear that at a second trial Littlejohn might receive the death penalty. We there stated, <a href="/pa/433/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="433 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1921080" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0336-01">433 Pa. at </a>349: “A decision not to appeal because of such a fear cannot, as a matter of. law, be a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to appeal.” We therefore granted Littlejohn an appeal nunc pro tunc. In <em>Arehambault, </em>it was not clear on the record before us whether Archambault’s failure to prosecute an appeal was the result of his lawyer’s advice that such a procedure would be fruitless or the result of his fear of receiving the death penalty at a second trial. We therefore remanded the case for a hearing on the issue.</p>

In the latter case, by a stretch of the felony-murder rule, we held that Almeida could indeed be found guilty of murder even though the fatal bullet was fired by another officer acting in opposition to the felony. We adopted a proximate cause theory of murder: “[H]e whose felonious act is the <em>proximate </em>cause of another’s death is <em>criminally </em>responsible for that death and must answer to society for it exactly as he who is <em>negligently </em>the <em>proximate cause </em>of another’s death is civilly responsible for that death and must answer in damages for it.” <em>Almeida, </em>362 Pa. at pages 603-04 (emphasis in original). We thus affirmed Almeida’s conviction, stating at page 607: “The felonious acts of the robbers in firing shots at the policemen, well knowing that their fire would be returned, as it should have been, was [sic] the proximate cause of Officer Ingling’s death.”</p>

      <em>Medline </em>began with a rather general review of the entire felony-murder theory. If we may presume to elaborate a bit on that review, we should point out that the felony-murder rule really has two separate branches in Pennsylvania. The first, and the easier concept, is statutory. The Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §701, 18 P.S. §4701, provides, <em>inter alia: </em>“All murder which shall ... be committed in the perpetration of, or attempting to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or kidnapping, shall be murder in the first degree. All other kinds of murder shall be murder in the second degree.” Clearly this statutory felony-murder rule merely serves to raise the degree of certain murders to first degree; it gives no aid to the determination of what constitutes murder in the first place. <em>Medline, </em>pointing out that except for one isolated situation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> there is no statutory crime of murder, directed us to the common law for a determination of what constitutes murder. It is here that the other branch of the felony-murder rule, the common law branch, comes into play. Citing <em>Commonwealth v. Drum, </em><a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a> (1868), the early leading case on murder in the Commonwealth, and IV Blackstone, Commentaries, *198, <em>Medline </em>reaffirmed that the distinguishing criterion of murder is malice. The common law felony-murder rule is a means of imputing malice where it may not exist <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>expressly. Under this rule, the malice necessary to make a killing, even an accidental one, murder, is constructively inferred from the malice incident to the perpetration of the initial felony.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[180,623,1152,1075]]]'>The common law felony-murder rule as thus explicated has been subjected to some harsh criticism, most of it thoroughly warranted. It has been said to be “highly punitive and objectionable as imposing the consequences of murder upon a death wholly unintended.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> “An effect wholly unexpected and unconnected with the intention and act of the party, except by accident . . . [is] made the foundation of criminal responsibility.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
      <em>Bedline </em>at page 494 related that “a widely accepted and quite plausible explanation of the origin of the doctrine is that at early common law many crimes, including practically all, if not all, felonies were punishable by death so that it was of no particular moment whether the condemned was hanged for the initial felony or for the death accidentally resulting from the felony.” With a history like that it is hardly surprising that the rule has evoked bitter comment referring to it as “a holdover from the days of our barbarian Anglo-Saxon ancestors of pre-Norman days, [having] very little right to existence in modern society.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Our neighboring state of Ohio has managed quite well without a felony-murder rule since abolishing it over a century ago. See <em>Robbins v. State, </em><a href="/ohio-st/8/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="8 Ohio St. 131" data-case-ids="37966,513410" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/8/0131-01">8 Ohio St. 131</a> (1857).</p>

The situation was well-analyzed many years ago: “To punish as a murderer, every man who, while committing a heinous offence, causes death by pure mis adventure, is a course which evidently adds nothing to the security of human life. . . . The only good effect which such punishment can produce will be to deter people from committing any of these offences which turn into murders what are in themselves mere accidents. It is in fact an addition made in the very worst way. ... If the punishment for stealing from the <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>person be too light, let it be increased, and let the increase fall alike on all the offenders! Surely the worst mode of increasing the punishment of an offence is to provide that, besides the ordinary punishment, every offender shall run any exceedingly small risk of being hanged.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> To similar effect, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in <em>The Common </em>Law, argued that the wise policy is not to punish the fortuity, but rather to impose severe penalties on those types of criminal activity which experience has demonstrated carry a high degree of risk to human life.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> In this respect, we note the recent amendment to The Penal Code, providing for increased penalties when certain crimes are committed with firearms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

That is hardly necessary in the instant case. But we do want to make clear how shaky are the basic premises on which it rests. With so weak a foundation, it behooves us not to extend it further and indeed, to restrain it within the bounds it has always known. As stated above, <em>Redone, </em>at page 495 et seq., demolished the extension to the felony-murder rule made in <em>Almeida: </em>“In adjudging a felony-murder, it is to be remembered at all times that the thing which is imputed <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>to a felon for a killing incidental to his felony is <em>malice </em>and <em>not the act of killing. . . . </em>‘The malice of the <em>initial </em>offense attaches to whatever else the <em>criminal </em>may do in connection therewith.’ . . . And so, until the decision of this court in Commonwealth v. Almeida, supra, in 1949, the rule which was uniformly followed, whether by express statement or by implication, was that in order to convict for felony-murder, <em>the killing must have been done by the defendant or by an accomplice or confederate or by one acting in furtherance of the felonious undertaking, </em>[citing a long line of cases].</p>

Under the evidence, Flynn was either (1) an accomplice of Bolish who allegedly had planned the arson or (2) he was Bolish’s weak-minded tool who acted under the impulse of Bolish’s influence and domination. Thus, the malice essential to charging Bolish with murder was present either (1) <em>by imputation </em>under the felony-murder theory, if the death was found by the jury to have occurred as a result of confederate Flynn’s act in furtherance of the criminal conspiracy or (2) <em>expressly, </em>if Flynn was found to be merely a pliant dupe who acted on Bolish’s order in performing the criminal act with highly dangerous means which threatened grievous bodily harm to the actor.” (Emphasis in original). The first theory seems to be that taken by the majority in <em>Commonwealth v. Bolish, </em>decided on the same day that <em>Redline </em>was decided, <a href="/pa/391/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="391 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1276899" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0550-01">391 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=138%20A.2d%20447" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="138 A.2d 447">138 A. 2d 447</a> (1958), which affirmed Bolish’s second conviction after the first had been reversed for trial errors. The Court pointed out, at page 553, that Bolish was actively participating in the arson, and therefore his cofelon’s act was imputed to him. “The fact that the victim was an accomplice does not alter the situation, since the act which caused his death was in furtherance of the felony.”</p>

Proximate cause, as an essential element of a tort founded in negligence, has undergone in recent times, and is still undergoing, a marked extension. More specifically, this area of civil law has <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>been progressively liberalized in favor of claims for damages for personal injuries to which careless conduct of others can in some way be associated.

All of those were <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings, in which Smith’s cofelons sought release by virtue of the change in law that had occurred since their convictions had become final, asking us to give retroactive effect to <em>Redline. </em>In <em>Hough </em>(<a href="/pa/402/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="402 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="1296688" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0371-01">402 Pa. at 375-76</a>) we stated: “The basic fallacy of the appellant’s contention lies in the fact that the felony-murder rule laid down in the Eedline case, supra, which is now the law of Pennsylvania, was not enunciated until 1958, more than ten years after the ap<a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>pellant’s conviction and sentence. Under the felony-murder rule as it existed in this State at the time of the appellant’s plea of guilty to a charge of murder generally, his conviction of murder in the first degree and his ensuing sentence to death, who fired the fatal shot was irrelevant to the guilt of the felonious conspirator so long as it was fired in aid of or in resistance to the perpetration of the felony.” Similarly, in <em>Almeida </em>(<a href="/pa/409/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="409 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1883238" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0460-01">409 Pa. at 462</a>) we said: “The legality of the appellant’s conviction is and must be governed by the law of Pennsylvania as it existed at the time of said conviction.” We most recently reaffirmed this view in <em>Hough </em>(425 Pa.).</p>

By contrast, the instant case is now on <em>direct appeal. </em>Although in the three collateral attack cases, we spoke of the law as it existed at the time of the relator’s “conviction”, we were not at that time faced with a situation where the conviction had not yet become final, as here. Hough’s conviction had become final as a result of his appeal, and Almeida’s became final by virtue of his failure to take an appeal. In contrast, here, Smith’s conviction is not final, as he is on direct appeal. No one would suggest that this Court would be violating any settled principles of law by making a change in the law and reversing a conviction, even though the law at the time of conviction supported the conviction. This has occurred innumerable times, in practically every landmark constitutional criminal case. Nor should the result be any different where the appeal is nunc pro tunc rather than immediately after conviction. In <em>Commonwealth v. Little, </em><a href="/pa/432/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="432 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1919678" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0256-01">432 Pa. 256</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%2032" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="248 A.2d 32">248 A. 2d 32</a> (1968), we conclusively rejected the suggestion made in the late Justice Musmanno’s opinion in <em>Commonwealth v.

See, also, <em>Commonwealth v. Gist, </em>supra. We pointed out that such an approach would lead the Court into a dreadful factual morass in attempting to speculate as to the length of time an appeal would have taken if it had been filed and perfected immediately upon conviction. <em>Little </em>involved a right conferred by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the proscription against tacit admissions, deriving from <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

Where the right involved is one conferred by the decisions of this Court, the factual morass would become even worse, as this Court would be forced to speculate what it might have done when it might have come up on appeal. Clearly, we would be approaching Peter Pan’s Never-Never Land. More important even than the factual morass involved, however, is that we would simply not be according an appellant a true right of appeal, for this Court would never have had the actual opportunity of passing on the issues he raised.</p>

Even worse, if possible, is the fact that the highest Federal and State Courts are frequently making <em>retroactive </em>their <em>newly created </em>and <em>expanded </em>rights of guilty criminals, with the result that dangerous criminals who have been in jail for a dozen or a score or more of years are released or granted new trials which, in practical effect (because of the length of time and the inability to find trial witnesses, or their faded recollections), is the equivalent of release.
