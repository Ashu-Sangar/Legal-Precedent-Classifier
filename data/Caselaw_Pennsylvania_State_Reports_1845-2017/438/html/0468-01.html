For some ten to twelve years, on the occasion of every three <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>to four months, appellee had visited each and every store in the 6700 block of Market Street in Upper Darby, Delaware County, a business section of town, including the premises owned by the Good Company, whose president was Sidney Goodstein, the appellant. On July 11, 1960, at approximately 11:30 a.m., appellee approached the door to the premises in question, heavily laden with his wares. Pushing open the unlocked door, he felt with his cane (apparently striking on the foundation wall or threshold area). Then, holding open the door with his right shoulder, he grabbed his brooms and stepped quickly so as not to be hit by the door. The first step he took was within the range of his cane and brought his foot onto a solid surface. Unfortunately, as he entered he stepped into a floorless area and fell 8 feet 8 inches onto the basement floor below, as a result of which he sustained serious personal injuries.</p>
    <p id="b587-4" data-blocks='[["BL_587.5",587,[140,1380,1150,317]]]'>As appellee later discovered, the Good Company was expanding and remodeling.

On the other hand an invitee enters upon an implied representation or assurance that the land has been prepared and made ready and safe for his reception. He is therefore entitled to expect that the possessor Avill exercise reasonable care to make the land safe for his entry, or for his use for the purposes of the invitation. He is entitled to expect such care not only in the original construction of the premises, and any activities of the possessor or his employees Avhich may affect their condition, but also in inspection to discover their actual condition and any latent defects, followed by such repair, safeguards, or <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>warning as may be reasonably necessary for his protection under the circumstances.”</p>

      <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>We do not agree with appellant’s conclusion. In his instructions to the jury, the trial court made the following statements: “What has been said about the general rule of negligence applies to all the parties in this case. All are required to use due care and each owes to the other the duty to use usual and common rules of caution and safety.”</p>

    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.6",596,[176,1048,1160,1254]]]'>Later in its charge, the court specifically outlined the effect on plaintiff’s case of his own failure to use due care. “. . . he is <em>bound to use. due care </em>under the circumstances and due care for a blind man includes a reasonable effort to compensate for his unfortunate affliction by the use of artificial aids for discerning obstacles in his path. It is not negligence per se for a blind person to go unattended on a sidewalk of a city, but he does so at great risk and must always have in mind his own disadvantage and do what a reasonably prudent person in his situation would do to ward off danger and prevent accidents. He is not bound to anticipate an open ditch but should take precautions to discover possible barriers. In the exercise of due care it is his duty to use a common, well-known compensatory device for blind people such as a cane, a seeing eye dog or a companion. <em>The fact that the plaintiff, or a plaintiffs deceased, had impaired vision doés not increase defendant’s duty toward him nor excuse him from his own negligence. </em>If the individual knows .that he is physically inferior in any particular, he is required to use his remaining faculties with greater diligence.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

A search of the record indicates that the only-evidence to which these instructions could apply was that given in appellee’s own testimony because the appellant presented no witnesses on this issue.</p>
