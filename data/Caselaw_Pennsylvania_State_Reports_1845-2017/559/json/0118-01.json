        "text": "OPINION\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThe issue with which we are presented in this matter is whether the Philadelphia County Office of Mental Health/Mental Retardation (\u201cMH/MR\u201d) had standing to contest a mental health hearing officer\u2019s decision to discharge a mental patient from involuntary commitment. We hold that MH/MR does have standing, and therefore reverse the Superi- or Court\u2019s order quashing MH/MR\u2019s appeal.\nSometime in the fall of 1996, T.J. began exhibiting bizarre behavior. T.J. would enter convenience stores and take food out of the stores for which she had not paid, claiming that Christ had told her to feed the people of the world. On other occasions she claimed she was Christ. Her sleep patterns became erratic. Also, she claimed that unknown persons were poisoning her food; her resultant refusal to eat had caused her to lose approximately thirty pounds in a one month period.\nOn October 18, 1996, T.J.\u2019s husband and sister completed an application for \u201cINVOLUNTARY EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT\u201d of T.J. In the application, they expressed concern for T.J.\u2019s well-being as well as for the safety of her three children. On that same day, T.J. was examined by a psychiatrist at Misericordia Hospital (\u201cHospital\u201d) who concluded that T.J. was severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment. She was subsequently involuntarily committed to Misericordia Hospital for a period not to exceed 120 hours, pursuant to 50 P.S. \u00a7 7302.\nOn October 21, 1996, a petition to extend treatment pursuant to 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303 (\u201c303 petition\u201d) was filed, requesting that T.J.\u2019s involuntary commitment be extended for a period not to exceed twenty days. T.J. moved to have the 303 petition discharged, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to prove that in her present condition she posed a clear and present danger to herself and others.\nA hearing was held before a mental health review officer (\u201creview officer\u201d) on October 22, 1996. At that time, the attorney for the MH/MR attempted to introduce additional evidence of T.J.\u2019s mental incapacity. This alleged conduct, however, had not been noted in the original 303 petition. The review officer did not allow this additional information into evidence. The review officer ultimately determined that there was insufficient evidence to establish that T.J. was in need of involuntary treatment and thus ordered her discharged.\nOn November 1, 1996, the MH/MR filed with the trial court a petition to review the determination of the review officer. T.J. moved to quash MH/MR\u2019s petition on the ground that MH/MR had no right to seek review of a discharge determination. The trial court quashed this petition on January 7, 1997. The court later rescinded this order, however, apparently on the basis that T.J.\u2019s motion to quash had not been served on MH/MR. On February 5, 1997, the trial court denied MH/MR\u2019s petition on the merits.\nMH/MR filed an appeal with the Superior Court. T.J. filed a motion to quash alleging, inter alia, that MH/MR had no right of review from a decision by a review officer discharging a patient from involuntary commitment. The Superior Court agreed with T.J. on this point, finding that MH/MR lacked standing. The Superior Court rested its opinion on two bases. First, the Superior Court found that the Mental Health Procedures Act (\u201cMHPA\u201d), 50 P.S. \u00a7 7101 et seq. did not specifically provide that the MH/MR had the right to seek review of a discharge petition with the trial court. Thus, the Superior Court reasoned, the legislature had not granted standing to MH/MR.\nThe Superior Court went on to state that a party may have standing in a dispute not only via a specific legislative grant but also simply by establishing that the party is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the official order or action. The court stated that for a party to be \u201caggrieved,\u201d it must have: \u201c1) a substantial interest in the subject matter of the litigation; 2) the party\u2019s interest must be direct; and, 3) the interest must be immediate and not a remote consequence of the action.\u201d Beers v. Commonwealth, Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 534 Pa. 605, 633 A.2d 1158 (1993). The Superior Court applied this test and determined that MH/MR was not \u201caggrieved\u201d and therefore lacked standing to pursue this matter. In arriving at this conclusion, the Superior Court placed great emphasis on its understanding that MH/MR did not have a \u201cclose and personal connection\u201d to T.J.; that T.J.\u2019s, and not MH/MR\u2019s, liberty interests were involved; and finally, that only T.J. and not MH/MR had any interest in this proceeding. Super.Ct. slip op. at 8-11. Although the Superior Court briefly mentioned at the outset of its opinion that MH/MR had been created by the legislature to treat mental patients and protect the mental patients from harming themselves and others, it did not take the legislatively mandated purpose of MH/MR into account when it conducted its standing analysis.\nMH/MR filed a petition for allowance of appeal from the order of the- Superior Court; we subsequently granted allocatur.\nThe sole issue before this court is whether MH/MR has standing to contest the review officer\u2019s decision refusing to extend treatment of T.J. and discharging her. As this is a question of law, our scope of review is plenary. See Phillips v. A-Best Products Co., 542 Pa. 124, 665 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1995). As to determining the appropriate standard of review over this matter, we have failed to uncover any case law from this court which is on point. We find, however, that the most sensible approach would be to apply the typical appellate standard of review which requires that the reviewing court examine the lower tribunal\u2019s ruling for an abuse of discretion or error of law. See Albright v. Abington Memorial Hospital, 548 Pa. 268, 696 A.2d 1159 (1997); Park Home v. Williamsport, 545 Pa. 94, 680 A.2d 835 (1996).\nStanding is a requirement that parties have sufficient interest in a matter to ensure that there is a legitimate controversy before the court. In determining whether a party has standing, a court is concerned only with the question of who is entitled to make a legal challenge and not the merits of that challenge. See Sprague v. Casey, 520 Pa. 38, 550 A.2d 184 (1988). As a general matter, the core concept of the doctrine of standing is that a person who is not adversely affected in any way by the matter he seeks to challenge is not \u201caggrieved\u201d and has no right to obtain a judicial resolution of his challenge. Independent State Store Union v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, 495 Pa. 145, 432 A.2d 1375 (1981).\nAlthough the Superior Court correctly enunciated the general rule of standing, it failed to recognize that we refined the rule for application to the particular situation where a governmental agency is alleging that it has standing in a matter. Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Game Comm\u2019n v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Environmental Resources, 521 Pa. 121, 555 A.2d 812 (1989). In Pennsylvania Game Commission, we discussed how an administrative agency could be given standing by the legislature other than through an explicit grant. We stated that\n[although our law of standing is generally articulated in terms of whether a would-be litigant has a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in the controverted matter, and whether he has been \u201caggrieved,\u201d ... we must remain mindful that the purpose of the \u201cstanding\u201d requirement is to insure that a legal challenge is by a proper party. The terms \u201csubstantial interest\u201d [and] \u201caggrieved\u201d ... are the general, usual guides in that regard, but they are not the only ones. For example, when the legislature statutorily invests an agency with certain functions, duties and responsibilities, the agency has a legislatively conferred interest in such matters. From this it must follow that, unless the legislature has provided otherwise, such an agency has an implicit power to be a litigant in matters touching upon its concerns. In such circumstances the legislature has implicitly ordained that such an agency is a proper party litigant, i.e. that it has \u201cstanding\u201d.\nId. at 815 (citations omitted; emphasis supplied). See also Franklin Township v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Environmental Resources, 500 Pa. 1, 452 A.2d 718 (1982) (township had standing to contest granting of permit for solid waste disposal as the granting of the permit necessarily implicates the township\u2019s responsibility of protecting the quality of life of its citizens.)\nWe find that the rule enunciated in Pennsylvania Game Commission controls in this matter. Furthermore, application of that rule reveals that the legislature implicitly ordained that MH/MR has standing. The legislature created county mental health and mental retardation programs with the express purpose that they \u201cdiagnosis, care, treat[ ], rehabilitate] and det[ain] the mentally disabled....\u201d 50 P.S. \u00a7 4301(a). A person is mentally disabled \u201cwhen, as a result of mental illness, his capacity to exercise self-control, judgment and discretion in the conduct of his affairs and social relations or to care for his own personal needs is so lessened that he poses a clear and present danger of harm to others or to himself.\u201d 50 P.S. \u00a7 7301.\nClearly, ensuring that a mental patient who has been involuntarily committed is not erroneously discharged is a matter \u201ctouching upon [MH/MR\u2019s] concerns\u201d as the MH/MR\u2019s goals of providing proper medical treatment to the patient as well as preventing that patient from harming others are implicated. Thus, in matters such as the one sub judice, MH/MR would have standing to file a petition for review or an appeal.\nT. J., however, argues that the Superior Court properly quashed the appeal. One of her primary arguments in support of this position is that \u201cgovernment appeals are inherently moot because virtually every involuntary commitment resulting from a successful government appeal would be based upon stale evidence....\u201d Appellee\u2019s brief at 1. T.J.\u2019s argument is alluding to the fact that the legislature has dictated that the evidence used to support the finding that a person\u2019s mental illness has rendered her a \u201cclear and present danger,\u201d and is thus \u201cmentally disabled,\u201d must refer to events that had occurred within the past thirty days. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7301. T.J. asserts that this thirty day requirement was the legislature\u2019s way of \u201cbalancing] a person\u2019s liberty [interest] and society\u2019s right to provide timely involuntary treatment....\u201d Appellee\u2019s brief at 16.\nWe agree with T.J. that where a governmental petition for review or appeal is not determined prior to the lapsing of thirty days from the time of the alleged incidents, then the governmental petition for review or appeal is mooted; the government could not proceed on a petition where the allegations had become stale. Also, it could very well be, as T.J. implies, that in this day of overcrowded court dockets, the usual scenario is that a court cannot act on a governmental petition for review or appeal prior to the running of the thirty days. Yet, the possibility that a governmental petition for review or appeal could be mooted out is simply unrelated to the issue of the government\u2019s standing. These two issues are separate concerns, and the determination of one question in no fashion controls the outcome of the other. To be sure, there may be matters where the government\u2019s application is not timely acted upon, either because the judicial review process is protracted or simply because the information on which the original petition was based becomes stale. And in those matters, the action will be dismissed\u2014but not because the government lacks standing, but rather because the information has become stale and petition for commitment must necessarily fail.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find that the Superior Court erred as a matter of law when it determined that MH/MR lacked standing to contest this matter. Therefore the order of the Superior Court is reversed.\nJustice SAYLOR did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nJustice ZAPPALA files a dissenting opinion joined by Chief Justice FLAHERTY.\n. The Commonwealth Court has stated that review by a trial court of a mental health review officer\u2019s determination is not in the nature of an appeal since a mental health review officer is not capable of entering a final order. See In re: J.S., 142 Pa.Cmwlth. 493, 597 A.2d 750, 752 (1991). While J.S. concerned 50 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7304 and 7305\u2014and the matter sub judice involves \u00a7 7303\u2014we nonetheless find J.S. to be instructive as all three of these statutes are governed by 50 P.S. \u00a7 7109. Section 7109 is the provision which states that hearings conducted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 7303, 7304, and 7305 may be conducted by a judge of the court of common pleas or by a mental health review officer. Where, however, the hearing is conducted by a mental health review officer, \u00a7 7109 instructs that such a decision is review'able by the court of common pleas. The court in J.S. utilized this self-same language from \u00a7 7109\u2014which is applicable to the hearing conducted in J.S. as well as the hearing conducted in the matter sub judice\u2014as the basis for its determination regarding the effect of a mental health review officer\u2019s order. In re: J.S., 597 A.2d at 752. We therefore find that reliance on J.S. to be apt. We further note that since the mental health review officer\u2019s determination is not a final order, then the trial court\u2019s review of it would be in the nature of de novo.\n. As TJ has already been discharged from Misericordia Hospital, this matter is technically moot. It is beyond peradventure that any decision in this case will have no effect on TJ. personally. Yet, we will still review this matter as it raises an issue of important public interest, and is an issue which is capable of repetition and yet apt to evade review. In re: Fiori, 543 Pa. 592, 673 A.2d 905, 909 n. 4 (1996).\n. TJ. also raises other arguments in support of her position that MH/MR should fail. TJ., however, did not cross-petition for allowance of appeal and therefore these issues have been waived.\n. The legislature provided an exception to this thirty day requirement in certain instances where the mental health patient has been charged with a crime. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7301(b). That exception has no application to the matter at hand.\n. For example, the trial court\u2019s order in the instant matter was entered more than three months after T.J. had committed the complained of conduct. Clearly, MH/MR\u2019s petition for review and its subsequent appeal were thus technically mooted.\n. We did not grant review on the issue of whether the MH/MR may, in effect, be granted a supersedeas and detain a patient involuntarily pending appeal of an order discharging that patient. Contrary to the position taken by the dissenting opinion, which posits that we are somehow addressing the issue of whether a patient may be detained pending appeal of an order of discharge, we stress the lower courts and the practicing bar that we express no opinion on this issue as it is not before this court. An attempt to characterize this opinion as addressing such an issue is, in our view, a mischaracterization.\n. As noted in footnote 2, supra, this appeal is technically moot. Thus, although we have reversed the order of the Superior Court in the instant matter, our determination in this case shall not impact on TJ. personally.",

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent. In my view, the General Assembly acted deliberately in explicitly providing the person made subject to treatment with a right to petition for review when a mental health review officer certifies that a further period of commitment is warranted, without providing a similar right to the county agency or anyone else to petition for review of a denial of such certification, which results in the person\u2019s release.\nThe involuntary commitment process of the Mental Health Procedures Act is designed to permit quick decisions about whether individuals pose a danger to themselves or others, while ensuring that they are deprived of their liberty for the shortest period necessary. Allowing court review where the officer\u2019s decision results in a continued deprivation of liberty, and requiring that the review be expeditious, is consistent with these purposes. See 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(g). Allowing the agency to appeal a decision directing that the person be discharged, however, runs directly counter to these purposes.\nI am fully aware that in this case T. J. was in fact discharged in accordance with the review officer\u2019s direction. Moreover, the majority studiously avoids deciding the significant question of whether an agency could continue to detain an individual for involuntary treatment while its appeal of a discharge order was pending. Nevertheless, I believe consideration of the practical consequences of granting agency standing is necessary, and reveals the inadequacy of the majority\u2019s analysis.\nIf the individual is discharged while the agency\u2019s appeal goes forward, the \u201csubstantial interest\u201d the majority attributes to the agency as the predicate for standing, i.e., \u201censuring that a mental health patient who has been involuntarily committed is not erroneously discharged,\u201d opinion at 482, is illusory. It therefore appears implicit in the majority\u2019s rationale that an agency must be able to continue involuntarily detention while the appeal of the discharge order is pending. Since even under the most expeditious of circumstances such an appeal could not be concluded so as to allow for the individual\u2019s timely release in the event the discharge is affirmed, the agency can accomplish its end, continued detention, by indirection, and the individual can win only a hollow victory by prevailing in the appeal. This possibility seems to me to be entirely at odds with the policy that the Act be \u201cinterpreted in conformity with the principles of due process\u201d and that \u201cthe least restrictions consistent with adequate treatment be employed.\u201d 50 P.S. \u00a7 7102.\nEven if standing were based on another \u201csubstantial interest\u201d that is not inconsistent with the individual\u2019s being released while the appeal is pending, this would in effect give the agency a blanket exemption from the mootness doctrine, under the \u201ccapable of repetition yet apt to evade review\u201d rubric. As in this case, by the time a final order was entered it would have no application to the parties before the court. Every decision arising out of an agency appeal of a discharge order would be an advisory opinion. I am not persuaded that such a course is either necessary or advisable.\nIn addition to my dissent from the decision to allow the agency to appeal, I must register my concern with the majority\u2019s discussion of the nature of the review allowed. The majority indicates that \u201csince the mental health review officer\u2019s determination is not a final order, then the trial court\u2019s review of it would be in the nature of de novo.\u201d Opinion at 480 n. 1. Reliance on In re J.S., 142 Pa.Cmwlth. 493, 597 A.2d 750 (1991), is misplaced, however, since that case dealt with proceedings under sections 304 and 305 of the Act, not section 303, which is involved here. Section 304 provides for court ordered involuntary treatment for periods of up to ninety days either as an extension of a commitment, see 50 P.S. \u00a7 7304(b), or as an initial commitment, see 50 P.S. \u00a7 7304(c). Section 7304(e) provides that hearings on such petitions may be conducted by a judge or a mental health review officer, but since the statute speaks of a court order, the review officer\u2019s conclusions in this context can only be advisory to the court, hence interlocutory.\nSection 303, however, speaks not of a court order but of a \u201ccertification\u201d that the individual is in need of continued involuntary treatment that is to be made after an informal hearing or conference. Although the statute provides that such informal hearing or conference may be conducted by either a judge or a mental health review officer, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(b), in this context the review officer acts not as a \u201cmaster\u201d making recommendations to the court but as an official authorized to make the certification, and the decision is \u201cfinal\u201d not interlocutory.\nIn light of all these considerations, I believe the legislature acted purposefully in specifically providing an individual certified as needing continued involuntary treatment with a right to seek review, while not extending a similar to the agency a similar right to seek review of a discharge order. Thus I would affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nChief Justice FLAHERTY joins.\n. See, e.g., In re J.S., 526 Pa. 418, 586 A.2d 909 (1991), wherein this Court addressed the merits of an issue regarding the procedures applicable where a patient\u2019s commitment was changed from voluntary to involuntary. The review officer ordered the patient\u2019s release, which was done, and the agency appealed. The common pleas court accepted the agency\u2019s argument that the review officer had erred, but in its remand order stated, \"It is not the intention of this Court by its order to direct the commitment of J.S. if she is not currently an in hospital [sic] patient and has no need to be committed.\u201d Id. at 912 n. 4. Similarly, our Court, in reversing the Superior Court and agreeing with the common pleas court on the procedural question, stated, \"Given the passage of time since the proceedings reviewed in this decision, we shall not remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.\u201d Id. at 914. Significantly, the agency\u2019s standing to appeal the discharge order in the first instance was not challenged.\n. It is significant that in cases where section 304 proceedings are initiated for someone not already in involuntary treatment, the Act specifies that \"Involuntary treatment shall not be authorized during the pendency of a petition except in accordance with section 302 or section 303.\u201d 50 P.S. \u00a7 7304(c)(6). To my mind this demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent that individuals not be detained while proceedings to place them in involuntary treatment for extended periods are conducted. It would be anomalous if a person subjected to involuntary treatment under section 302 and then section 303 were allowed to be detained while an order discharging him was appealed, and a person who was the subject of a section 304 proceeding could not be detained while that proceeding was conducted.\n. Beyond this problematic reliance on J.S., the majority fails to explain whether the de novo review it accords to agency appeals from discharge orders is the same as or different from the review specified by the Act where a person made subject to treatment petitions for review of a certification. See 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(g).",
