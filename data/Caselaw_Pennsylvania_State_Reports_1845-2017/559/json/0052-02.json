The Cross Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED in part and the order of the Superior Court affirming the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Cross-Petitioner\u2019s claim for battery is reversed. Since the issue of supervision is being remanded and may be dispositive of Cross-Petitioner\u2019s battery claim, it is further ordered that Cross-Petitioner\u2019s claim for battery is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County to be considered during Cross-Petitioner\u2019s new trial as awarded by the Superi- or Court.
