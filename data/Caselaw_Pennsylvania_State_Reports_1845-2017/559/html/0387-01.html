The Commission held a public hearing on the matter on January 18, 1996. At the hearing, the Director testified that Sadowski’s position had been eliminated in response to extensive funding cuts in the Department’s capital budget. Sadowski, on the other hand, testified that the discharge had been based on “political” considerations stemming from a variety of work-related disagreements she had had with the Director. Despite the City’s allegations to the contrary, Sadowski contended that the discharge could not have been for economic reasons since, in the year she was laid off, she would have generated savings to the City far in excess of her $37,000 a year salary. Following the hearing, the Commission denied Sadowski’s appeal, finding that the City had not abused its discretion in discharging Sadowski.</p>

This is consistent with the burden an employer has when such a dismissal matter is first heard by the Commission. <em>See, e.g., City of Pittsburgh Civil Service Commission v. Beaver, </em>12 Pa.Cmwlth. 353, <a href="/citations/?q=315%20A.2d%20672" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="315 A.2d 672">315 A.2d 672</a>, 674 (1974) (City has burden of establishing by substantial evidence that there was just cause for civil service employee’s dismissal); <em>City of Erie v.

However, once the governmental agency presents substantial evidence that the termination was for economic reasons, the burden properly shifts to the employee to show either that the evidence was not substantial or the reasons for the discharge not proper. <em>See Crede v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/355/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="355 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="468952" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0369-01">355 Pa. 369</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20700" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="49 A.2d 700">49 A.2d 700</a>, 703 (1946) (where agency established just cause for termination, burden of proof shifts to employee to prove dismissal was not for lawful reasons). <em>Accord </em>4 Pa.Code § 105.15(e) (under Civil Service Act, 71 P.S. § 741.1 <em>et seq., </em>appointing authority shall go forward to establish charge on which personnel action was based and if the appointing au<a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>thority establishes prima facie case, the employee shall then be afforded opportunity of presenting his case).</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.5",466,[234,464,1160,1005]]]'>Here, the Commonwealth Court did not engage in improper burden-shifting, as Sadowski alleges. Rather, the court found that the common pleas court erred in determining that the record as a whole did not provide substantial evidence that Sadowski had been terminated for reasons of economy. To support its finding, the court cited to portions of the record establishing that the City had presented substantial evidence that Sadowski’s dismissal had been based on economic considerations. The Commonwealth Court then noted that Sadowski, in light of the substantial evidence presented by the City, had failed to show that her termination had been for the political reasons that she alleged. Since the Commonwealth Court first found that the City had carried its burden of proof as it related to presenting substantial evidence, the court, in its review of the record, properly allocated the burden to Sadowski to demonstrate that her termination was not for economic reasons. Thus, Sadowski’s claim that the Commonwealth Court erroneously placed the burden on her is without merit.</p>

To avoid complying with the plain language of the statute, the <em>Fusaro </em>court essentially found that strict compliance and application of section 20.1 would lead to absurd results by forcing the City to retain employees who are no longer needed simply because of seniority. However, the legislature’s clear intention in enacting section 20.1 was to have seniority be the sole consideration when removing employees for reasons of economy. Prior to the enactment of section 20.1, the regulation governing the discharge of civil service employees, Civil Service Rule 10, Section 4, allowed a governmental employer to consider factors in addition to seniority when determining which employees to lay off because of fiscal restructuring. Specifically, Civil Service Rule 10, Section 4 provided that if no employees were eligible for retirement, the heads of departments must consider "the capability, efficiency, and the length and quality of all other employees in the same grade, class and employment, and must discharge, reduce or furlough, in ascending order of merit, those who are least meritorious.” <em>Wagner v.
