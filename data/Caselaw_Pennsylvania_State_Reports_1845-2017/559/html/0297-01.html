For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>

After the lawsuit was filed, Robert Swift, Esquire, Wintoll’s attorney, contacted Charles Seymour, chairman of Jackson-Cross, to engage Seymour’s services as Wintoll’s expert on the issue of the lost profits suffered as a result of the defendants’ breach of their financing commitment for the industrial rehabilitation project. On December 28, 1990, Seymour responded with a proposal outlining the scope of services that he would perform for Wintoll and the fees that would be charged for those services. The proposal contemplated that <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>
      <em>Seymour would </em>quantify the damages sustained because of the lenders’ failure to close under the mortgage commitments; prepare a signed report outlining what was done, stating the conclusions and supporting them; and participate in pre-trial conferences, depositions and trial. By letter dated January 4, 1991, Wintoll’s attorney accepted Seymour’s proposal.</p>
    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[275,676,1151,422]]]'>Wintoll was subsequently provided with a calculation of the lost profits, which Jackson-Cross estimated to be $6 million. The calculation was prepared by David Anderson, an employee of Jackson-Cross, using a computerized accounting spreadsheet program. The federal trial began on November 24, 1992. Seymour was called by Wintoll to testify as an expert witness on the lost profits calculation on December 7,1992 and provided his opinion as to the damages sustained by Wintoll.</p>
    <p id="b373-7" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[274,1129,1155,746]]]'>On cross-examination, defense counsel established that Anderson’s lost profits calculation contained a mathematical error that completely undermined the basis for the Jackson-Cross calculation of Wintoll’s damages. Seymour conceded that the calculation was wrong because of the error that had been made. Because Seymour had not performed the calculations himself, he was unable to explain the mathematical error in the calculations or to recalculate the lost profits by correcting the error while on the stand. Defense counsel requested that Seymour’s opinion be stricken from the record because it was based on inaccurate numbers and on erroneous mathematical calculations. The trial judge granted the motion to strike Seymour’s testimony and instructed the jury to completely disregard the testimony during its deliberations.</p>
    <p id="b373-8" data-blocks='[["BL_373.7",373,[274,1906,1153,474]]]'>Without Seymour’s testimony, Wintoll’s evidence relating to lost profits consisted of the testimony of Leon Winitsky and Michael Winitsky, principals of Wintoll, and a calculation by Wintoll of its estimated profits. The day after Seymour’s testimony was stricken, Wintoll accepted a settlement offer from the federal defendants for approximately $750,000. Jackson-Cross subsequently provided Wintoll with a corrected computation of estimated lost profits, which indicated such damages amounted to $2.7 million.</p>

Wintoll asserted that Jackson-Cross had breached its agreement to furnish expert services in connection with the federal lawsuit by failing to deliver an accurate or workmanlike lost profits computation, and had failed to exercise the degree of care and skill ordinarily exercised by experts in the field of real estate counselling and computation of lost profits in real estate transactions. Wintoll alleged that it would have received a judgment for lost profits in an amount in excess of $2.7 million plus interest but for the conduct of Jackson-Cross. Wintoll sought damages for the estimated lost profits and reimbursement of the fees paid to Jackson-Cross for its services.</p>

Jackson-Cross asserted that (1) Win-toll’s claim was non-justiciable because the federal action had been settled prior to a jury verdict; (2) Wintoll’s settlement of the federal action severed the causal link between the striking of Seymour’s testimony and the alleged damages; (3) the pro tanto release given by Wintoll to the additional defendant applied to Jackson-Cross as an agent; and (4) Wintoll had failed to state a claim for breach of contract. The second <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>summary judgment motion was granted by order dated July 10, 1996.

First, witnesses might be reluctant to come forward to testify. And once a witness is on the stand, his testimony might be distorted by the fear of subsequent liability. Even within the constraints of the witness’ oath there may be various ways to give an account or to state an opinion. These alternatives may be more or less detailed and may differ in emphasis and certainty. A witness who knows that he might be forced to defend a subsequent lawsuit, and perhaps to pay damages, might be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff, to magnify uncertainties, and thus to deprive the finder of fact of candid, objective, and undistorted evidence. But the truth-finding process is better served if the witness’ testimony is submitted to “the crucible of the judicial process so that the factfinder may consider it, after cross-examination, together with the other evidence in the case to determine where the truth lies.”</blockquote>

The goal of ensuring that the path to truth is unobstructed and the judicial process is protected, by fostering an atmosphere where the expert witness will be forthright and candid in stating his or her opinion, is not advanced by immunizing an expert witness from his or her negligence in formulating that opinion. The judicial process will be enhanced only by requiring that an expert witness render services to the degree of care, skill and proficiency <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>commonly exercised by the ordinarily skillful, careful and prudent members of their profession.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[241,448,1155,585]]]'>Therefore, we find that the witness immunity doctrine does not bar WintolTs professional malpractice action against Jackson-Cross. We caution, however, that our holding that the witness immunity doctrine does not preclude claims against an expert witness for professional malpractice has limited application. An expert witness may not be held liable merely because his or her opinion is challenged by another expert or authoritative source. In those circumstances, the judicial process is enhanced by the presentation of different views. Differences of opinion will not suffice to establish liability of an expert witness for professional negligence.</p>

The majority categorizes the suit filed against the expert witness in <em>Panitz </em>as one which attacked the “substance” of the expert’s opinion; in contrast, the majority asserts that the suit in the matter presently before the court is premised on the allegation that the expert was “negligent] in formulating [his] opinion.” Majority op. at 306. The majority finds this distinction to be crucial. It concludes that while a suit may not be filed on the basis that the “substance” of an expert witness’ testimony was unacceptable, an expert witness may be sued on the basis that the expert was negligent in formulating the opinion tendered at trial. In my opinion, the <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>majority’s attempts to distinguish <em>Panitz </em>ring hollow.

On cross-examination, however, Panitz conceded that her opinion was inconsistent with the available scientific data. After trial, Panitz admitted that she had realized prior to trial that her pro-plaintiffs medical opinion was inaccurate; yet Panitz had failed to inform the Behrend firm that she had changed her opinion.</p>
    <p id="AKT" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[234,1191,1161,787]]]'>Contrary to the majority’s characterization of <em>Panitz, </em>I believe that the lawsuit filed against Panitz was premised on the allegation that she had been negligent in formulating her opinion, and was not an attack on the substance of the opinion she offered on cross-examination. In fact, there is a lengthy discussion in the Superior Court opinion concerning the contention by the Behrend firm in its suit against Panitz that “it was not the in-court testimony that caused the loss but the pre-trial representations about what the in-court testimony would be.” <em>Panitz, </em><a href="/pa-super/429/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="429 Pa.

Clearly, the Behrend firm sued Panitz premised upon Panitz’s negligent failure to inform them that she had changed her opinion prior to trial; I see nothing in <em>Panitz </em>which would indicate that the Behrend firm sued Panitz on the basis that they somehow disagreed with the substance of her opinion.</p>

In my opinion, there is no bright line between what constitutes an attack on the “substance” of an expert’s opinion and what constitutes a challenge premised on the expert’s negligence in formulating that opinion.
