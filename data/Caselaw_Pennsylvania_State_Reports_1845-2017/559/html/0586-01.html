The facts of the first matter are not in dispute. On May 19, 1995, Trooper Rodney Smith (“Smith”), while off-duty, spent the afternoon drinking at a bar. Upon driving away from the bar, he happened to see Tammy Mathis (“Mathis”), an ex-girlfriend of his, sitting in her car which was parked on the side of the <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>road. Smith pulled over his car to speak with Mathis. An argument ensued concerning money Smith claimed Mathis owed him. The argument culminated in Smith jamming his loaded, police-issued weapon into Mathis’ mouth and threatening to kill her. At that point, Smith abruptly ceased terrorizing Mathis and drove away to continue drinking. Mathis promptly called the police. Smith later returned to the scene where the police who had been summoned by Mathis arrested him. Smith was charged with three counts of driving under the influence and one count each of simple assault and making terroristic threats; he subsequently pled guilty to all five charges.</p>
    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[250,994,1155,1114]]]'>The Pennsylvania State Police (“State Police”) later notified Smith that because of his actions of May 19, 1995, he was dismissed from the force. Smith filed a grievance arguing that his dismissal was improper. The arbitrator concluded that although Smith had committed the acts in question, the discipline of dismissal was excessive. The arbitrator noted that prior to May 19, 1995, Smith’s thirteen years of service had been exemplary and that Smith had been under a great deal of stress prior to the incident as a result of his working at the crash site of the USAir jet near Pittsburgh in the fall months of 1994. Yet, the arbitrator stated that these mitigating factors had only a “minimal” impact on his decision. Arbitrator’s decision, dated 1/3/97, at 5. Rather, the arbitrator focused on how the discipline the State Police meted out to Smith compared to discipline imposed on other troopers. The arbitrator concluded that since Smith’s actions were less egregious than actions committed by troopers whom the State Police had merely suspended, then dismissal of Smith was inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 6-9. The arbitrator thus sustained the grievance in part and denied it in part, ordering the State Police to reinstate Smith immediately but without back pay.</p>

On December 18, 1995, Johnson attempted to leave a Clover Department Store (“Clover”) with $27.58 worth of merchandise for which he had not paid. He was subsequently arrested <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>by the Cheltenham Township police on a charge of retail theft, a summary offense. An agreement was subsequently reached between Clover and Johnson by which Clover withdrew the charges and Johnson agreed to pay Clover the sum of $177.00 as restitution and a civil recovery penalty.</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[247,625,1157,639]]]'>On June 27, 1996, Johnson was notified that he would be dismissed from his job. Johnson filed a grievance. The arbitrator determined that Johnson had indeed committed the retail theft. Yet, he determined that there was not. just cause to dismiss Johnson. The arbitrator reasoned that dismissal was not warranted since other troopers had committed more serious crimes but had received discipline less severe than dismissal. Arbitrator’s decision, dated 9/21/96, at 22. The arbitrator also found that dismissal was contraindicated since Johnson had given sixteen years of exemplary service to the State Police prior to this incident and that Johnson had expressed great remorse over his actions. <em>Id.</em>

We had the opportunity to consider this self same point four years ago in <em>Betancourt. </em>In that decision, we determined that the narrow certiorari scope of review applied. This scope of review, true to its name, is quite limited. It allows an appellate court to inquire into only four areas: (1) the jurisdiction of the arbitrators; (2) the regularity of the proceedings; (3) an excess of the arbitrator’s powers; or (4) deprivation of constitutional rights. <em>Betancourt, </em><a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="656 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="472165,472201,7864289,7864395" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01,/pa/540/0065-01,/a2d/656/0083-01,/a2d/656/0083-02">656 A.2d at 85</a>.</p>

Rather, they were dictated by the legislature as part of a carefully crafted plan of remediation to correct flaws in the act which was the predecessor to Act 111. That defunct act, which was commonly known as the Act of 1947,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> caused severe and socially destabilizing problems as it prohibited police and fire personnel not only from striking but also from engaging in collective bargaining. This double denial of rights to police and fire personnel fueled the growing tension between labor and management, tension which culminated in “illegal strikes and a general breakdown in communication between public employers and their employees.” <em><a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="656 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="472165,472201,7864289,7864395" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01,/pa/540/0065-01,/a2d/656/0083-01,/a2d/656/0083-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/540/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="656 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="472165,472201,7864289,7864395" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0066-01,/pa/540/0065-01,/a2d/656/0083-01,/a2d/656/0083-02">at 89</a>.</p>

Specifically, police and fire personnel were still denied the right to strike, but this disability was offset by the granting of the right to collectively bargain.

Specifically, the legislature dictated a restraint on judicial activity in this arena, and forbad appeals from an arbitration award. 43 P.S. § 217.7(a).

Although voting to affirm the decisions of the arbitrators, Judge Pellegrini expressed the view (as the author of the majority opinion in <em>Smith </em>and the author of the concurring opinion in Johnson) that adherence to the narrow certiorari scope of review was ill advised when it allowed troopers such as Smith and Johnson to remain on the force. <em>Pennsylvania State Police v.

The position taken by the learned Judge Pellegrini is not surprising since it was he who wrote the majority opinion for the Commonwealth Court in <em>Betancourt </em>advocating a broad scope of review of Act 111 arbitration awards, a position which this court declined to adopt on appeal. As shall be discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>we rejected this position in <em>Betancourt </em>as we found that the legislature had placed severe limits on our ability to act in this <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>arena; thus we are prevented from interfering with an Act 111 arbitration award merely because the arbitrator's determination is unpalatable, or even extremely distasteful, to us.</p>

In support of its argument that an arbitrator exceeds his powers not only when he orders an illegal act but also when his order violates "public policy,” the State Police relies heavily on <em>United Paperworkers International Union v.

We find this reliance to be inapt for a couple of reasons. First, the Court in <em>Misco </em>was not concerned with interpreting an act such as Act 111, where the legislature, in response to shockingly severe labor unrest in two key sectors of public servants, sharply curtailed judicial review of arbitration awards. ' Thus, the appeal of <em>Misco </em>is superficial at best. Second, even if we were to employ <em>Misco </em>for a limited purpose in determining this appeal, it would seem to cut against the State Police’s position as the <em>Misco </em>Court equated a violation of public policy with the ordering an illegal act. The Court stated that in determining whether an arbitrator's award violates public policy, an appellate court is to examine whether the award creates an "explicit conflict with other 'laws and legal precedents’ the Court emphasized that the examination was not to focus on the nebulous " ' general considerations of supposed public interests.’ ” <em><a href="/us/484/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="484 U.S. 29" data-case-ids="600957" data-case-paths="/us/484/0029-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/484/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="484 U.S. 29" data-case-ids="600957" data-case-paths="/us/484/0029-01">at 43</a>, <a href="/us/484/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="484 U.S. 29" data-case-ids="600957" data-case-paths="/us/484/0029-01">108 S.Ct. 364</a>.

Were this not so, virtually any issue could be submitted to the arbitrators under the guise of a labor conflict. <em>Further, we fully realize that there will be issues that would be fully legitimate in the context of a private sector labor dispute which will not be legitimate in the context of a public sector labor dispute. Public employers are in many respects more limited in what they may do vis-a-vis their employees, and those limitations must be maintained. </em>The essence of our decision is that an arbitration award may only require a public employer to do that which it could do voluntarily. We emphasize that this does not mean that a public employer may hide behind self-imposed legal restrictions.

Pursuant to the section of the Administrative Code that governs the qualifications of. its force, the State Police can appoint only those who possess certain physical and mental qualifications, and who are of “good moral character.” 71 P.S. § 1193. The qualifications generally set forth in Section 1193 are to be <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>“based upon the standard provided by the rules and regulations of the police force of the cities of the first class.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20437" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="259 A.2d 437">Id.</a> </em>This provision, in conjunction with the standard set forth in the First Class Township Code and basic mandates of public policy, limits the power of the State Police to appoint virtually anyone to the police force.</p>
    <p id="b675-4" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[252,674,1155,962]]]'>Although the phrase “good moral character” is not defined, the term has widespread use in our jurisprudence and the lack of it has been defined in a court decision as “anything done knowingly contrary to justice, honesty or good morals.” <em>Gombach v.

Also, “good moral character” in the context of determining professional employment must be assessed in connection with the particular occupation at issue. Here, the crime of shoplifting implicates dishonesty and theft, while the crime of terroristic threats has serious overtones of violence. Both of these crimes in my opinion involve moral turpitude and these officers, as criminal offenders to this degree, cannot hold the confidence of the public in the performance of their jobs as police. As such, I do not believe that these officers have “good moral character” because of the way that term is used within the Administrative Code’s articulation of an officer’s qualifications for the job.</p>

While the Administrative Code is unclear about which rules and regulations of the “police force of the cities of the first class” should guide basic qualifications for appointment to the State Police, I find no reason to exempt the State Police from the requirement that its ranks be free of serious criminal offenders. Indeed, it would appear a fundamental requirement of this Commonwealth that we not appoint felons to act <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>as the enforcers of our criminal laws and the protectors of our citizens.</p>
