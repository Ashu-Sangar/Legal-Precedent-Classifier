Her parents, E and A, were school children aged sixteen and eighteen respectively, living with their parents. During the later stages of her pregnancy, E took up residence in Genesis House in Pittsburgh, a facility which is operated by Genesis of Pittsburgh, an adoption agency for women who intend to place their child for adoption. The day after the child was bom, E executed a document granting custody of the child to Genesis and allowed it to seek adoptive parents for the child. Genesis immediately placed the child with D and C, the prospective adoptive parents. The child has remained with these prospective adoptive parents since that time. E executed a consent to the adoption and a similar consent was forwarded to A, who refused to consent.</p>

D and C filed a motion to intervene, and on July 9,1996, the trial court granted their motion on the grounds that they stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to the child. The trial court heard testimony on the issue of custody, and on November 13, 1996 awarded primary physical custody to D and C. A and his mother appealed.</p>

The <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>Juvenile Act, which governs dependency proceedings, defines a dependent child, <em>inter alia, </em>as “A child who is without proper parental care or control, subsistence, education as required by law, or other care or control necessary for his physical, mental or emotional health, or morals.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6302. In other words, in order for a third party to interfere in a natural parent’s custody of his child, the third party would have to show in a dependency proceeding that the child is not properly cared for. If the third party were able to prevail on that issue, then the third party could intervene in a custody proceeding. As Superior Court stated in <em>Cardamone v.

Here, at the relevant time, D and C acted “in loco parentis” and it was not contrary to the wishes of A. At no time during E’s pregnancy did A express a definite intent to assert custody of the child, nor did he provide financial support to E. Instead, he silently stood by and allowed E to take sole responsibility for the financial and emotional burden of pregnancy and he made no objection to E’s stated intention to give the child to D and C for adoption. The record clearly indicates that A was well aware that E meant to place the child for adoption and that she had made plans to give birth in an institution that would facilitate the adoption.

Instead, if prospective adoptive parents have a direct, substantial and legitimate interest in the welfare of a child in their care, they should have standing to intervene in a custody action governing that child. A meaningful custody determination should not be made without the input of all relevant factors, which necessarily includes details of the child’s current custody arrangements. Here, I believe D and C have an unquestionable interest in the welfare of M and thus have standing to intervene into a proceeding that impacts their relationship with her. They became interested parties by virtue of their de facto assumption of parental duties for this child and because the Mother had signed over her parenting responsibilities to them. In essence, D and C stood in the Mother’s shoes and assumed her parenting responsibilities.
