    <p class="author" id="b84-10" data-blocks='[["BL_84.10",84,[298,916,512,40]]]'>FLAHERTY, Chief Justice.</p>
    <p id="b84-11" data-blocks='[["BL_84.11",84,[254,984,1156,313]]]'>Over fourteen years ago, appellant was convicted of three counts of first degree murder. He received three death sentences, and he now appeals the denial of his second petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 et seq. The trial court dismissed the petition because the issues raised were either finally litigated or untimely.</p>
    <p id="b84-12" data-blocks='[["BL_84.12",84,[249,1323,1158,635]]]'>In 1984, a jury convicted appellant of three counts of first degree murder, three counts of robbery, one count of rape, and one count of possessing an instrument of crime. On June 10, 1985 he was sentenced. On May 27, 1987, this court affirmed the judgments of sentence. On October 24, 1990, appellant filed his first PCRA petition, which was amended on January 6, 1992. On August 22, 1995, this court affirmed the dismissal of the first PCRA petition. The second PCRA petition was filed on May 27, 1997. On December 8, 1997 the trial court dismissed the second PCRA petition on the above-stated grounds that the claims asserted therein were either finally litigated or untimely.</p>

In <em>Commonwealth v. Peterkin, </em><a href="/pa/554/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="554 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="765982" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0547-01">554 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d 638</a> (1998), we recently held that where the conviction became final before the effective date of the act, January 16, 1996, a PCRA <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>petition, in order to be timely, must be filed within one year of the effective date of the act, and it must be the first PCRA petition to be eligible for this one year grace period. Thus, the petition at issue in this case is untimely, for it was the second petition, not the first, and there is no provision of a grace period for the filing of a second petition.</p>

    <blockquote id="b85-7" data-blocks='[["BL_85.7",85,[340,1000,1068,252]]]'>(i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States.</blockquote>

That is, he must show that his failure to raise these claims previously was the result of illegal interference by government officials, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i), or that facts upon which his claims rest were unknown and could not have been ascertained with due diligence, or that he is asserting a newly recognized constitutional right, 42 Pa.C.S. <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>§ 9545(b)(1)(ii)(iii) <em>and </em>that the petition raising these claims was filed within 60 days of the date the claim could have been presented, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2). Appellant’s first issue is that the prosecutor suppressed evidence that an eyewitness to the murders was mentally ill, that he had a criminal record, and that he was favorably disposed to the Commonwealth because drug charges were to be dropped against him in Florida if he would testify for the Commonwealth in this case. Appellant argues that this claim qualifies under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i), as illegal interference of a government official which might have caused the late filing. However, as presented, the claim fails, since nowhere does appellant establish that the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1 )(2) have been met, i.e., that his claim asserting unconstitutional or illegal interference by government officials (42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i) was raised within sixty days of the date the claim could have been raised).</p>
