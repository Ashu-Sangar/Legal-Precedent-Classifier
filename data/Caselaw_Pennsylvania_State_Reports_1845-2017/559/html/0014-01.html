Appellants, the City of Philadelphia, the School District of Philadelphia, Aspira, Inc., the Philadelphia branch of the NAACP, and students and parents in the school district, claimed, in substance, that the General Assembly violated the Pennsylvania Constitution by failing to provide adequate funding for the Philadelphia School District in violation of Article III, section 14 of the constitution which obligates the General Assembly to “provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education.”</p>

Appellees filed preliminary objections claiming, inter alia, that appellants’ claims were nonjusticiable under the doctrine of separation of powers and the political question doctrine. The court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed appellants’ petition for review. It held that the claims therein were indeed nonjusticiable and “it would be impossible to resolve the claims without making an initial policy determination of a kind which is clearly of legislative, and not judicial, discretion,” as the resolution of the claims has been committed solely to the discretion of the General Assembly under Article III, section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. We have jurisdiction of this appeal under 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a).</p>

Appellants argue, in essence, that Commonwealth Court erred: (1) in holding that the separation of powers doctrine prohibits the judicial branch from deciding appellants’ claims; (2) in holding that the Pennsylvania Constitution commits determinations regarding a thorough and efficient system of public education exclusively to the General Assembly; (3) in holding that appellants’ claims do not present judicially manageable standards in determining that the action was barred by the political question doctrine; and (4) in interpreting the substance of appellants’ petition for review by mistakenly viewing the petition as one seeking judicial legislation, when, in reality, appellants were merely seeking a judicial declaration of rights. The commonwealth court meticulously analyzed the precedents of this court which justify its decision, and we will therefore affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>
