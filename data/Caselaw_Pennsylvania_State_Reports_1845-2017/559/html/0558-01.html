In 1988, Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death for killing his girlfriend, Linda Rowden, in retaliation for her having given information she provided to police regarding the murder of Nigel Anderson.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant was also convicted in federal court for violating the civil rights of Nigel Anderson, but that conviction was later vacated. <em>United States v.

Following a second penalty hearing in 1997, the jury rendered a sentence of death on June 25, 1997, and the trial court imposed the death sentence on July 23, 1997. Appellant then filed a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 et seq. (“PCRA”), alleging <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court appointed new counsel, who filed a Post-Sentence Motion and an amended PCRA petition. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the post-trial motion and dismissed the PCRA petition. This appeal followed.</p>

This order also directed counsel to “review the trial and conviction of the Defendant which occurred in August 1991 [Fisher <em>II </em>]” and “assert any alleged PCRA claims in this regard in petition form and submit same to the Court.” However, by Order dated August 11, 1997, we permanently suspended the Capital Unitary Review Act.</p>

Despite its July 23, 1997 order directing Appellant to file collateral relief claims pursuant to the now-suspended CURA, the trial court determined that Appellant’s ineffectiveness claims of penalty phase counsel were incorrectly raised in a PCRA petition. Indeed, the trial court did not even mention that it had ordered that a PCRA petition be filed pursuant to CURA. The trial court inexplicably reasoned that pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(h), a petitioner is entitled to post-conviction collateral relief only if the ineffective assistance of counsel undermines the truth-determining process relative to Appellant’s guiltj and here, at the penalty phase, Appellant’s guilt was not at issue. Consequently, the trial court deemed the PCRA petition to be a procedural miscue, and addressed the claims of ineffectiveness against counsel in <em>Fisher III </em>as if they had been raised in the post-sentence motion. The trial court did not address the claims of ineffectiveness of counsel in <em>Fisher II </em>in its March 1998 opinion.

I agree that these aggravators are quite similar. I believe, however, that there is one difference that is material for purposes of this case: Section 9711(d)(5) identifies as an aggravating factor the killing of a prosecution witness for the purpose of <em>preventing </em>
      <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>his or her testimony, whereas Section 9711(d)(15) specifies the killing of an informant <em>in retaliation for </em>the informant’s activities in aid of law enforcement. Under either aggravator, the issue confronting the sentencing jury is what motivated the killing, but the specific factual conclusions which must be reached in order to find the respective aggravators are different. This is unlike the situation in <em>Zook, </em>where the identical, undisputed fact—the defendant’s commission of a prior first-degree murder—could support the legal conclusion called for by either aggravating factor at issue. Here, the Commonwealth apparently believed that the facts which suggested Appellant’s motive for the killing fit more closely the terms of the (d)(15) aggravator, as the district attorney chose to invoke it and not that of Section 9711(d)(5).</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[258,1130,1151,589]]]'>Because Appellant was not called upon to defend the allegation that this killing was committed for the purpose of preventing witness testimony, and the jury was neither asked to make nor made such finding, 1 do not believe that, under Pennsylvania’s capital sentencing scheme, the (d)(5) circumstance should be relied upon, in any manner, to support the determination that Appellant was eligible for capital sentencing. Since the (d)(15) aggravator was not available, and was the only aggravating factor found by the jury, I would vacate the sentence of death and remand for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
