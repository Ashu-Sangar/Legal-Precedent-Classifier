Even though many of the attendees at the party were underage, large quantities of alcohol and marijuana were consumed. At some point during the evening, a fight erupted and the police were called to the scene. Prior to the arrival of the responding <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>police officers, a group of the partygoers left in two separate vehicles and drove to a local tavern. After consuming more alcohol at the tavern, the group drove to a wooded area outside of Hanover, known as “the Pines.” Several members of the group departed. At one point, the victim left the remaining members of the group and went into the woods to relieve herself. She was followed by appellant and co-defendant James Frey. Sometime thereafter, witnesses testified that they heard the victim scream. An eyewitness, Larry Tucker, later testified at trial that he had followed appellant into the woods and then watched appellant and the co-defendant grab the victim, throw her to the ground and say to her “you give it to everybody else”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appellant was seen shortly thereafter coming out of the woods with blood on his hands. Co-defendant Frey followed several minutes later and the remaining members of the group then left the Pines leaving the victim in the woods. The victim was never seen alive again and her body was found seven weeks later, in a spread eagle position, naked from the waist down with her shirt rolled around her neck, exposing her upper torso. Forensic evidence indicated that the cause of death was a head trauma.</p>

Finally, police investigators learned that appellant had been making incriminating statements implicating himself in the murder. Linda Rhinehart testified that she overhead appellant at an arcade in Hanover state to some friends that: “I followed her into the woods’ cause I was going to get some of that ... She won’t be a tease anymore. It’s amazing what a tire iron can do to hush someone making that much noise.” Cerenna Hughes testified that appellant told her that after the night at the Pines, Cheryl “run away” and “she gave in, she gave up.” Harry H. Carper III testified that sometime during 1981, he visited appellant at his home and appellant stated “he might have <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>killed” Cheryl Smith and that “he hit her over the top of her head.” Lastly, Janice Small, appellant’s wife at the time of the murder, testified that one night in 1981 when Carper was visiting at their residence, she overheard appellant say to Carper “I killed a girl____ [We] hit her over the head, dumped her ass in the woods and left her there.” She also testified that on one occasion when she was reading a newspaper article about the murder, appellant walked by and said, “that’s the girl we killed.”</p>

I didn’t mean it—for it to happen to her.” In addition, the victim’s aunt, with whom the victim had been living for ten months preceding the murder, noticed what appellant characterizes as, “drive-by actions.” Specifically, she testified that on several occasions, beginning a week after the victim’s funeral, two or three men drove slowly past her house, shined flashlights into her house and hollered statements. These “drive-bys” occurred for about two weeks.

In order for after-discovered evidence to be exculpatory, it must be material to a determination of guilt or innocence.

The evidence at the suppression hearing demonstrated that approximately seventeen photographs were shown to the various witnesses—eleven were photographs developed from a camera that was retrieved from the victim’s bedroom loaded with film and six photographs were police identification photos of the four individuals originally charged with the murder. Appellant claims that his photograph was suggestive of guilt since it was a “mug shot” photograph taken in 1995, while the other photographs shown to the witnesses were taken in 1981 and depicted outdoor, casual or group scenes. Contrary to appellant’s claims, the record supports the trial court’s finding that the purpose of the photographic display was not to place the defendants at the scene of the homicide, but rather, to determine if the potential witnesses knew the individuals depicted in the various photographs, to identify the individuals depicted in the photographs retrieved from the victim’s camera, and to <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>determine whether persons displayed in the photographs attended the party on the night of the killing or went to the Pines following the party.</p>

The trial court properly prohibited appellant from questioning a police officer about this subject at the suppression hearing by sustaining an objection by the Commonwealth on the basis that this issue would not have a direct relationship to the issue of whether the identification procedure was suggestive and should be suppressed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Finally, appellant alleges the pre-trial identifications should have been suppressed because of the unavailability of numerous photographs shown to witnesses since 1981 and the failure of police to keep records of all photographs shown to witnesses from 1981 to 1995. Although the better practice for police would have been to keep accurate records of any photographs shown to each witness for identification purposes, the photographs in question were shown to ascertain general information about the victim and the night of the murder, rather than to establish the identity of appellant as the perpetrator, hence, we do not find a new trial is warranted for the failure of the police to do so in this matter.</p>

The trial court ruled that Craig’s proposed testimony would not impeach Moore’s testimony because appellant’s counsel acknowledged that Moore was not asked on direct examination “if he was fearful of John Small.” Moreover, Moore testified on direct that he did feel pressure from the police, when they first questioned him since he “didn’t want to get involved.” Therefore, the trial court properly concluded that there was no statement by Moore that Craig’s testimony would impeach.

Before such questioning is permitted, however, the party seeking to challenge a witness on such basis should be required to make an offer of proof that the witness has in fact engaged in chronic substance abuse. As defense counsel made no such offer concerning either of the two witnesses in question, I conclude that this issue does not entitle Appellant to relief.</p>

Neither case, however, addresses the issue presently before this Court, that is, whether a witness may be questioned about his or her continuous chronic alcohol or drug use throughout a prolonged period of time between the event about which he or she testifies and the trial, so as to attack the credibility of the witness by establishing, through expert testimony, that the witness’s memory or ability to recollect past events could be defective because of the alcohol or drug use.</p>

At trial, the defendant testified that her husband had assaulted her and that only seconds had passed from the time of the assault to the time that she killed him. A prosecution witness, however, testified that over twenty minutes had passed between the assault and the killing. In an attempt to discredit the defendant’s testimony, the prosecution questioned the defendant about her intoxication on the night of the crime. On appeal, this Court found that because the prosecution limited its questioning to intoxication on the night of the crime and because “[t]he question of the consumption of alcoholic beverages within this time frame would be relevant to the question of whether Lthe defendant] did in fact have a reasonable belief of an immediate threat to her life,” the trial court did not err in permitting the questioning. 500 Pa. at 592, <a href="/pa/500/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="500 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="1781158" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0585-01">459 A.2d at 321-22</a>.</p>

At trial, a prosecution witness testified that he had heard the defendant admit to having killed the victims. The trial court precluded defense counsel from questioning the witness about general drug use, but allowed questioning about the witness’s drug use at the specific time that he had heard the admission. This Court affirmed. The plurality opinion reasoned that evidence of drug use at the particular time of the admission was relevant to whether the witness’s mental condition at that time had been impaired so as to affect his ability to remember what he saw or heard. <a href="/pa/478/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="478 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1740526" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0327-01">478 Pa. at 336-338</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="478 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1740526" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0327-01">386 A.2d at 961</a>.

Rather, the witnesses in <em>Drew </em>and <em>Yost </em>were questioned about alcohol or drug use on a particular occasion, such as at the time of the crime or the admission about which the witness had testified.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> The distinction between a specific instance of alcohol or drug use and continuous chronic alcohol or drug use is important. Continuous chronic use could have a strong negative effect on a witness’s memory or ability to accurately recall past events, regardless of whether the wit<a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>ness was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the event that he or she is attempting to recall. Conversely, the effect of a single instance of alcohol or drug use is more limited, as it would only affect a witness’s ability to remember what he or she observed while under the influence. This distinction alone nullifies any controlling guidance that <em>Drew </em>or <em>Yost </em>might offer.</p>
    <p id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[270,717,1150,615]]]'>Second, <em>Drew </em>and <em>Yost </em>are distinguishable because they did not involve a prolonged period of time between the event about which the witness testified and the trial. Since <em>Drew </em>and <em>Yost </em>did not involve a prolonged delay, they could only have addressed the witness’s ability to perceive the event about which they testified. Appellant’s case, on the other hand, involved a fifteen-year delay, which would have brought the witnesses’ memories and abilities to accurately recall past events into issue. The effect of continuous chronic alcohol or drug use on a witness’s memory or ability to accurately recall events that occurred fifteen years beforehand was simply not addressed in <em>Drew </em>or <em>Yost.</em>

Here, defense counsel did call an expert, Dr. Passananti, to testify about the effects of alcohol and drugs on a witness’s memory, ability to accurately recall past events and ability to perceive events.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> This proffer is important because the effect of continued chronic alcohol or drug use on a witness’s memory or ability to accurately recall past events is not a matter which a lay juror would normally understand without the assistance of an expert.</p>
