While the Commonwealth in its brief does address the timeliness issue, that brief is of no avail to this court since the same will not be accepted. After being granted an extension of time in which to file its responsive brief, the Commonwealth’s brief was finally due to be filed on or before January 4, 1999. The Commonwealth did not present its brief to the prothonotary of this court until February 18, 1999. Given the untimely filing, the Commonwealth’s brief was not then accepted for filing. On March 18, 1999, the Commonwealth filed a Petition for Permission to File Post-Submission Communication Pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 2501(a) wherein it seeks permission to file its untimely responsive brief. In that petition, the Commonwealth submits that it was unable to comply with the briefing schedule set by this court because of the volume of cases to which the Appeals Unit was then attempting to respond and because of a recent loss of attorneys in that Unit. The clear intent of Pa.R.A.P. 2501 was to permit, in limited instances, submission to the court that is currently deciding a particular case relevant information that was not known or could not have been known to the parties prior to submission of the case to the court. It is not a vehicle for the filing of initial briefs of a party which were not filed in a timely manner.</p>
