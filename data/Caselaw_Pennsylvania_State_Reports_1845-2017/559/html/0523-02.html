At the time of the child’s conception, appellant was involved in an extramarital affair with appellee and had ceased having sexual relations with her husband.

Appellant listed her husband as the father on the child’s birth certificate. Appellant, her husband, the child, and the couple’s two older children continued to live as an intact family for the next three years, during which time the husband treated the child as his son. He supported the child emotionally and financially and claimed the child as a dependent on the couple’s joint income tax returns. At times, he expressed doubt whether he was the child’s father, but appellant assured him that he was the father. In June of 1992, when the boy was three years old, appellant finally revealed to her husband that he had not fathered the child. He requested blood tests which revealed that he was not the child’s biological father. Two months later, in August of 1992, he left the marital residence and filed a divorce action. Appellant and her husband were divorced in December of 1993, at which time they entered into an agreement whereby the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>husband would support the couple’s two older children but not the son.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellee filed preliminary objections, arguing that appellant must overcome the presumption that her husband was the child’s father before blood testing could be ordered and that appellant was estopped from asserting that he was the child’s father because she held her husband out as the father for the first three years of the child’s life. On June 30, 1994, the trial court ordered the matter to a hearing before a hearing officer on the issue of estoppel. On September 7, 1994, the hearing officer found that appellant was not estopped from proceeding with a support action against appellee. On May 9, 1995, the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed and held that appellant was estopped from asserting that appellee was the child’s father.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The child continues to believe that the husband is his father, and the husband, during the child’s first three years of life, formed a father-son relationship with the child. Following appellant’s separation from her husband and continuing at least until the September 1994 hearing on the issue of estoppel (at which time the child was five years old), he continued to treat all three of her children equally, and appellant and her husband continued to hold the child out to the community as the child of their marriage.

The majority concludes that Mother is estopped from challenging her former husband’s paternity and pursuing a paternity and child support action against Mr. Behers essentially because 1) Mother continually assured her former husband, David Fish, that he was Z.F.’s father; 2) Mother named Mr. Fish as the father on Z.F.’s birth certificate; 3) Z.F. bears Mr. Fish’s last name; 4) Z.F. was listed as a dependent on Mother and Mr. Fish’s tax returns; 5) Z.F. was otherwise treated as a child of the marriage between Mother and Mr. Fish while it was intact and 6) Z.F. continues to believe that <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>Mr. Fish is his father. Most of these circumstances occurred, however, during a time in which Mr. Fish was being led to believe, falsely, that he was Z.F.’s father.

At the same time, by applying the estoppel doctrine, the majority effectively prohibits compelling Mr. Behers to submit to blood tests, as the trial court ordered, despite the fact that all indications from the record suggest that Mr. Behers is Z.F.’s father and was aware of Mother’s misrepresentations to Mr. Fish about Z.F.’s paternity. This situation is a perfect example of why I believe that our courts should abandon the strict application of the estoppel doctrine and grant trial courts the discretion to order paternity blood tests and then consider such evidence along with other factors relevant to the best interests of the child involved.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Such an approach would not only prevent biological fathers from using the estoppel doctrine as a vehicle for insulating themselves from parental responsibilities but would also, as I stated in <em>Brinkley:</em>

The majority finds that Mr. Fish continues to treat all three of his children equally (Mother and Mr. Fish had two children together before Z.F. was born) and concludes that forcing Z.F. into a relationship with Mr. Behers, when the only father he has known is Mr. Fish, would not be in Z.F.’s best interests. I note that the trial court explicitly found that Mr. Fish, since learning that Z.F. is not his child and leaving the marriage, has “had little contact with [Z.F.] and does not support him financially or emotionally.” Trial Court Opinion at 3. Moreover, the trial court specifically found that estoppel would not be in Z.F.’s best interests, as Mother testified that she plans to tell Z.F. the truth of his paternity on the advice of a psychologist that it is in the best interests of Z.F. to do so.</p>
