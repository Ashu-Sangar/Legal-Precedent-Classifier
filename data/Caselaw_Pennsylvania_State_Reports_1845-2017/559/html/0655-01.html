Hoffman (“Claimant”), was employed as a unit clerk/unit secretary by Appellee, Westmoreland Health System (“Employer”), and was paid bi-weekly on Fridays. As part of its regular policy, Employer provided three options for obtaining paychecks: direct deposit to a financial institution; delivery by regular mail; or personal retrieval by the employee from her workstation. Employer encouraged the use of direct deposit. On Friday, August 20, 1993, Claimant was not scheduled to work, but visited Employer’s premises for the sole purpose of obtaining her paycheck, as was her long-established practice. While on such premises, Claimant fell and sustained injuries to her knees, left hand and lower back. Claimant filed a petition for workers’ compensation benefits.
