We conclude that it does not, and therefore affirm the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b97-6" data-blocks='[["BL_97.7",97,[245,773,1152,693]]]'>In October of 1995, Appellant Mercy Catholic Medical Center (“the Hospital”) summarily suspended the clinical privileges of Appellee Timothy J. Hayes, M.D. (“Dr. Hayes”), a general surgeon. The apparent basis of the Hospital’s action was, in its words, “a serious issue involving patient care” that resulted in a medical malpractice action. Dr. Hayes requested a hearing before a peer review panel, as was his right under the Hospital’s bylaws. Numerous procedural complications ensued, leading both parties to seek relief from the trial court. In July of 1997, after hearings had been held, the peer review panel unanimously recommended that the suspension be terminated “because the facts [of the underlying case] do not support suspension.”</p>
    <p id="b97-7" data-blocks='[["BL_97.8",97,[245,1491,1152,527]]]'>Pursuant to the bylaws, the panel forwarded its recommendation to the Hospital’s Medical Board. At a meeting that was held in September of 1997, and recorded on audiotape, the Medical Board approved the panel’s recommendation with one change: instead of stating that the facts “do not support suspension,” the Medical Board stated that the facts “[do] not support <em>continued </em>suspension” (emphasis added). The Medical Board sent its recommendation to the Hospital’s Board of Directors for final action at its next meeting, scheduled for September 25,1997.</p>

In addition, a confidential source had allegedly informed him that some members of the Medical Board had acted in bad faith in making such recom<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>mendation. Wishing to learn what had transpired at the Medical Board’s meeting, Dr. Hayes asked the trial court to enjoin the Hospital from destroying the tape recording of the meeting and to order the Hospital to furnish a copy of the tape to him. The Hospital agreed to preserve the tape, but refused to provide a copy to Dr. Hayes. When the trial court ordered it to do so, the Hospital filed a notice of appeal with the Commonwealth Court, along with an emergency application for a stay of the trial court’s order.</p>

That same day, the Hospital’s Board of Directors voted to accept the recommendation of the Medical Board and reinstate Dr. Hayes’ clinical privileges. . In an unreported opinion filed July 14, 1998, the Commonwealth Court quashed the Hospital’s appeal as moot, noting that Dr. Hayes had obtained the reinstatement of his privileges and that the Board of Directors’ decision to that effect was not subject to further hearing or review. The Hospital filed a petition for allowance of appeal, Dr. Hayes joined in that request, and allowance of appeal was granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Although Dr. Hayes’ clinical privileges have been restored, his record continues to reflect a lengthy suspension of those privileges.

Thus, the failure of the Hospital’s Board of Directors to state that Dr. Hayes’ initial suspension, not merely his “continued” suspension, was unwarranted may, if left unchallenged, continue to have a deleterious effect on Dr. Hayes’ medical career. <em>See Cooper v.

In essence, the Hospital argues that even though a complaining physician may be entitled to obtain peer review information in an internal hospital proceeding, nevertheless if the hospital’s obstinate refusal to provide such information forces the physician to seek equitable relief in a court of law, the physician thereby forfeits whatever right he may otherwise have had to obtain the information.

Because the latter discovery request is part of a pre-complaint motion, the exact nature of his action is not yet apparent. However, if Dr. Hayes wishes to obtain the peer review information for a defamation or contract claim, his ability to obtain the material must not be fettered by Section 4 <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>of the Peer Review Act. <em>Cooper v.

    <p id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[270,782,1152,631]]]'>The majority has erred by narrowing the Order of the trial court. If the majority were truly interested in advancing judicial economy, it would not have intimated that Dr Hayes’ discovery of the audiotape is limited solely to his challenge of the Medical Board’s recommendation to the Board of Directors. Such a limitation will certainly encourage additional, unnecessary litigation. Because the restriction suggested by the majority is inconsistent with the Peer Review Act, absent from the Order of the trial court, and pointlessly burdensome to Dr. Hayes, I join the majority in its decision to affirm the Order of the trial court but dissent concerning any restrictions it attaches to the Order.</p>
