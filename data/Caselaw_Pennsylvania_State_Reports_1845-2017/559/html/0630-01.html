Specifically, we shall consider whether a plaintiff seeking monetary damages under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (“PHRA”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> is entitled to a trial by jury. For the reasons stated more fully below, we find that a plaintiff is not entitled to a jury trial for claims arising under the PHRA. Thus, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b706-6" data-blocks='[["BL_706.7",706,[238,881,1158,786]]]'>The facts of this matter are as follows. In December of 1989, Sherry Wertz (Appellant) was hired as a road crew laborer for Chapman Township (together with the Chapman Township Supervisors, Robert Walizer, Dean Scott, and Robert Young, Appellees) to replace her mother, Patricia Stevenson, who was on medical leave. On April 9, 1990, Appellant informed her road crew foreman, Fred Gummo, that she was no longer able to lift objects weighing more than 25 pounds because she was pregnant. According to Appellant, her foreman ignored this request and began to harass her continuously. Specifically, Gummo ordered Appellant to lift heavy items, made sexually degrading remarks to her, threatened to terminate her employment, isolated her from the rest of the work crew, denied her breaks, and made unwarranted complaints about her work.</p>
    <p id="b706-7" data-blocks='[["BL_706.8",706,[236,1698,1157,364]]]'>Appellant complained to the Chapman Township Supervisors about her foreman’s conduct. The Supervisors agreed that Gummo’s conduct was inappropriate and ordered the foreman to correct his behavior. Appellant alleges that subsequent to this admonition, the harassment by her foreman increased. On May 11, 1990, Appellant was terminated from her position.</p>

On June 30, 1994, Appellant’s federal claims were dismissed as time-barred. As a result of the dismissal of her <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>federal claims, Appellant’s state claims were transferred to the Court of Common Pleas of Clinton County. The trial court found that Appellant’s claims under the PHRA were not time-barred due to tolling. Thus, Appellant was able to press forward with her action against Appellees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b707-4" data-blocks='[["BL_707.5",707,[254,624,1152,312]]]'>On March 13, 1995, Appellant filed a motion for trial by jury. The trial court denied the motion on April 12,1995. On September 25,1996, after a one-day trial, the trial judge found in favor of Appellees. On October 29, 1996, the trial court denied Appellant’s post-trial motions and entered a judgment in favor of Appellees.</p>

In a two to one decision, the court also affirmed the trial court’s denial of a jury trial on Appellant’s claims under the PHRA. Appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

    <p id="b707-7" data-blocks='[["BL_707.8",707,[250,1590,1155,475]]]'>Appellant argues that under both the PHRA and the Pennsylvania Constitution, she is entitled to a jury trial. It is axiomatic that if an issue can be resolved on a non-constitutional basis, that is the more jurisprudentially sound path to follow. Thus, we shall first consider whether Appellant is entitled to a jury trial under the PHRA As with all issues of statutory construction, this court’s analysis begins with the words of the statute. <em>Hoy v. Angelone, </em><a href="/pa/554/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="554 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="765959" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0134-01">554 Pa. 134</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="720 A.2d 745" data-case-ids="11806154,765959" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0745-01,/pa/554/0134-01">720 A.2d 745</a>, 748 (1998). The PHRA provides in relevant part, that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b708-4" data-blocks='[["BL_708.4",708,[272,326,1115,368]]]'>

    <p id="b708-6" data-blocks='[["BL_708.5",708,[230,719,344,38]]]'>43 P.S. § 962(c)(3).</p>
    <p id="b708-7" data-blocks='[["BL_708.6",708,[229,783,1159,476]]]'>Recently in <em>Hoy, </em>this court reviewed the same provision of the PHRA in determining whether a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages under the PHRA. In finding that a plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages under the PHRA, our court considered the absence of language expressly providing for the right, the ability of the General Assembly to provide for such a right, other statutory language, as well as other indicia of the legislature’s intent. We shall conduct a similar analysis in this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b708-8" data-blocks='[["BL_708.7",708,[226,1287,1160,574]]]'>First, the statute itself is silent as to the right to trial by jury. As in <em>Hoy, </em>we again note that the legislature is cognizant of its ability to expressly provide for certain legal rights. The General Assembly is well aware of its ability to grant a jury trial in its legislative pronouncements, as it has done so in other contexts. 50 P.S. § 944 (guardianship of weak-minded persons); 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4343 (child paternity dispute). Thus, with this knowledge firmly in hand, we can presume that the General Assembly’s express granting of trial by jury in some enactments means that it did not intend to permit for a jury trial under the PHRA.</p>
    <p id="b708-9" data-blocks='[["BL_708.8",708,[227,1898,1158,475]],["BL_709.1",709,[251,325,1149,306]]]'>Additionally, the General Assembly’s use of the term “court” in the statute is significant. The statute states that “If the <em>court </em>finds that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice charged in the complaint, the <em>court </em>shall enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful discriminatory practice and order affirmative action which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, granting back pay, or any other legal or equitable relief as the <em>court </em>deems appropriate.” 43 <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>P.S. § 962(c)(emphasis supplied). This is strong evidence that under the PHRA, it is a tribunal, rather than a jury, that is to make findings and provide relief. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921 (“When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”).</p>
    <p id="b709-5" data-blocks='[["BL_709.5",709,[246,654,1154,628]]]'>Finally, the legislative history of the PHRA fails to provide the court with any indication that the General Assembly intended for a plaintiff to have a right to trial by jury. <em>Murphy v. Cartex, </em><a href="/pa-super/377/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="377 Pa. Super. 181" data-case-ids="704467" data-case-paths="/pa-super/377/0181-01">377 Pa.Super. 181</a>, <a href="/pa-super/377/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="377 Pa.

The involvement of a jury would constitute a material difference.”). Thus, neither the terms of the statute nor the legislative history supports Appellant’s position that she is entitled to a jury trial.</p>
    <p id="b709-6" data-blocks='[["BL_709.6",709,[244,1306,1155,361]]]'>Appellant argues that because the language of the PHRA provides for “legal” relief, and because such relief rests traditionally in courts of law, as opposed to courts of equity, she is entitled to a jury trial, since plaintiffs in cases involving monetary damages, i.e., legal relief, are entitled to a trial by jury. Thus, according to Appellant, the PHRA implicitly entitles Appellant to a jury trial.</p>

Finally, the court looked to whether the forfeiture action had a common law basis. The court noted that the term “common law basis” did not, in the context of the case, mean that the action originated at common law, for even prior to 1790, forfeiture actions were statutory in nature. Thus, a jury trial was not denied merely because the action was statutory.

The Court reasoned that in cases in which legal relief is available, and legal rights are determined, the Seventh Amendment provides for a right to a trial by jury.

Although worded differently, the federal constitutional amendment is analogous to its Pennsylvania counterpart. Both provisions retain the right to jury trial in civil cases where it existed át common law. Despite the similarities, this court has made clear that in interpreting a provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution, we are not bound by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court which interpret similar federal constitutional provisions. <em>Blum v.

More importantly, as noted above, this court has viewed the proper analysis under the Pennsylvania Constitution to consist of, <em>inter alia, </em>an inquiry into whether the a jury trial existed for the cause of action at common law at the time of the adoption of our Constitution. Conversely, federal case law examines whether the statutory cause of action is analogous to a common law claim for which there was a right to trial by jury, with focus, as demonstrated in <em>Lorillard, </em>on the relief provided. <em>City of Monterey v.

While this may be an outcome of our holding today, we simply note that such is one of the peculiarities of our system of federalism. U.S. Const, amend. X; The Federalist Nos. 45, 46. (James Madison). Again, the General Assembly is free to amend the statute if it shares a similar concern. Additionally, Judge Leadbetter suggests that rural residents will suffer the increased burden of time and expense if they must travel to a federal court for a trial by jury. We do not believe that this is any different than the situation in which a cause of action is recognized only in federal law or is preempted. No suggestion is made that this burden rises to the level of a deprivation of due process, nor can we envision such a claim. Simply stated, while our rural residents may unfortunately have to travel an increased distance if they seek a trial by jury on their discrimination claims, we do not believe that this compels the conclusion that the legislature intended the PHRA to provide for a jury trial. Finally, Judge Leadbetter suggests that by selecting the forum in which to bring their claims, plaintiffs will have the absolute power to determine whether the case will be tried by jury or judge. We do not believe this concern to be well founded as even if a plaintiff was afforded the right to a jury trial under the PHRA, the plaintiff would still seemingly be in control of whether or not to demand a trial by jury. Thus, our holding does not bestow upon a plaintiff any greater power than she exercised before. Simply stated, these concerns, while legitimate, do not mandate a result contrary to the court’s holding today.</p>

The dissent contends that there exists a right to a jury trial under both the PHRA and our Constitution. As to a statutory right to a trial by jury <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>under the PHRA, we merely note that it is not this court’s role to sit as a super legislature. While the members of this court may believe that it would be in the best interest of the peoples of our Commonwealth to permit a trial by jury, the fact of the matter remains that the right to a jury trial was not made a part of the PHRA. As to a Constitutional right to a trial by jury, the dissent asserts, without citation to case law or other authority, that there should be a constitutional right to a trial by jury for charges of discrimination. Quizzically, the dissent equates the right to a jury trial with the rights of women and minorities in general. In this regard, the dissent, in a case of wanton exaggeration, accuses the majority of repressing the rights of women and minorities and attempting to keep those rights as underdeveloped as they were in the 18th century. Unlike the dissent, we reiterate that we have great faith in our trial judges to uphold the rights of women and minorities and to guarantee that their rights are fully developed in accordance with the laws of Pennsylvania. If the citizens of our Commonwealth believe that a jury trial should be available for causes of action other than those recognized in 1790, they need only to amend that great contract between our government and our citizenry, a contract this court is called on to interpret, not to rewrite.</p>

The right to a jury trial is central to our system of justice. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. Art. I, § 6;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> 42 Pa.C.S. § 5104(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> It has never been the law in this Commonwealth that an individual is entitled to a jury trial only where that right is specifically provided in legislation. Nor, in my view, should it be the law that the right to a jury trial is wholly dependent upon affirmative legislative action. The statutory provisions regarding the filing of various actions such as negligence and defamation suits, for example, are silent as to the availability of a jury trial, yet a jury trial is afforded to a plaintiff in such actions. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5523-24. Similarly, a plaintiff in <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>an employment discrimination action under the PHRA should be entitled to a jury trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

Angelone, </em><a href="/pa/554/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="554 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="765959" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0134-01">554 Pa. 134</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0745-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="720 A.2d 745" data-case-ids="11806154,765959" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0745-01,/pa/554/0134-01">720 A.2d 745</a> (1998), in which we found that a plaintiff in an action under the PHRA could not recover punitive damages. As the majority correctly states, that holding was based upon the fact that the PHRA does not specifically provide for punitive damages, nor does the legislative history indicate that the legislature intended that punitive damages be recoverable under the PHRA. The majority, however, overlooks the fact that our decision in <em>Hoy </em>was also grounded upon the underlying purpose of the PHRA, which is remedial rather than punitive in nature. While the availability of punitive damages would not be consistent with the remedial nature of the PHRA, the same is not true of the availability of a jury trial. Thus, this case is as distinguishable from <em>Hoy </em>as the issue of the availability of punitive damages is from the right to a jury trial. There exists no fundamental right to recover punitive damages; therefore, our decision in <em>Hoy </em>does not violate any fundamental rights. To extend the holding in <em>Hoy </em>to the instant case carries this Court’s reasoning in <em>Hoy </em>to an unwarranted extreme where a fundamental constitutional right—the right to a jury trial—is infringed. I believe that such a result is contrary to the letter of the law in Pennsylvania.</p>

In its analysis of this issue, the majority concedes that “the rights of women and minorities at that time in our history were ‘underdeveloped’ to say the least.” Op. at 1277. That being said, the majority then goes on to ensure that those rights will remain quite “underdeveloped” by applying a rule of law that would require that <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>the rights of women and minorities in the 20 th century be congruent with what those rights were in the 18th century in order for a jury trial to be available in this instance. The majority is, in essence, saying that women and minorities are, at least to the extent of their right to a jury trial, stuck with the state of their rights in 1790 unless legislature affirmatively expands those rights. Certainly the framers of our Constitution intended that it be interpreted to meet the needs of society as it grew and changed. An interpretation of the Constitution that is too rigid to encompass societal changes makes a mockery of the spirit of that document and the rights it grants to the citizens of this Commonwealth. Thus, I would hold that the Pennsylvania Constitution guarantees appellant the right to a trial by jury in this employment discrimination action.</p>
