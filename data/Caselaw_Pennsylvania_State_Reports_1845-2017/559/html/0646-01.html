Initially, as argued by the Commonwealth, the court’s reliance on <em>Roose </em>was misplaced. In <em>Roose, </em>the appellant challenged the authority of a deputy constable to effectuate an arrest for Vehicle Code violations. The Superior Court held that constables lacked such authority. In so holding, the court distinguished constables and deputy constables from sheriffs, noting that constables and deputy constables, unlike sheriffs, are not employees of any municipal subdivision, are independent contractors, and are not under the control of the Commonwealth. Additionally, the court noted that no municipality is responsible for the actions of constables the way a city, borough, or township is responsible for its police or a county is responsible for its sheriffs office. <em>Roose, </em><a href="/a2d/690/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="690 A.2d 268" data-case-ids="11923062,11980619" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/0268-01,/pa-super/456/0238-01">690 A.2d at 269</a>. In addition to noting the differences between constables and sheriffs, the court compared the training that municipal police officers receive with that of constables. In conducting this examination, the court noted its view that only certification pursuant to Act 120 would constitute sufficient training for purposes of our holding in <em>Leet. Roose, </em><a href="/a2d/690/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="690 A.2d 268" data-case-ids="11923062,11980619" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/0268-01,/pa-super/456/0238-01">690 A.2d at </a>271 n. 4.

Moreover, on appeal, we limited our analysis to distinguishing deputy constables from sheriffs; we did not adopt the court’s view regarding Act 120 certification. We noted:</p>
    <blockquote id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.5",727,[287,610,1111,613]]]'>Unlike sheriffs, whose powers grew in the common law tradition to include broad law enforcement authority, the powers of constables were not developed as fully in such a strong common law tradition, but were rather set forth in a series of statutes. Thus it is not appropriate to follow the analysis of <em>Leet, </em>supra, wherein we reasoned that sheriffs, due to their common law powers, had the authority to enforce the motor vehicle laws unless contravened by statute; conversely as to constables, it seems proper to conclude that unless a statute empowers them to enforce the vehicle laws, then they do not possess the legal authority to do so.</blockquote>
