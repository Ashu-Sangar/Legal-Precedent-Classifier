These remarks included frequent denigrating references to the Ferrer family’s national origin.

The court found that local commissions, such as the Reading <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>Human Relations Commission, only have the authority to proscribe discriminatory conduct which is also rendered unlawful by the PHRA.

The provision of the PHRA enabling local human relations commissions allows that a local commission may be given powers and duties similar to those exercised by the PHRC. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 962.1. Therefore, pursuant to such statute and by reference to the PHRC’s regulation, the Reading City Council had the ability to create a local human relations commission competent to redress threatening, coercive and intimidating conduct motivated by racial animus.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

The distinction between jurisdiction and authority is often implicated when dealing with tribunals of general jurisdiction, such as courts of common pleas, which derive their broad grant of general subject matter jurisdiction from the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. Art. V, Section 5. The General Assembly, however, has the power to direct the manner in which the common pleas courts’ jurisdiction is exercised, and thus to define its authority. <em><a href="/a2d/712/0741-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="712 A.2d 741" data-case-ids="11818176,507868" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0741-01,/pa/551/0605-01">Id.</a> </em>For example, the General Assembly has provided that the jurisdiction of common pleas courts over certain orphans’ court matters must be exercised through an orphans' court division. <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 711. Thus, while courts of common pleas can be said to possess general subject matter jurisdiction over such matters in the first instance, only the orphans’ court divisions have the authority to administer them.</p>

While local governing bodies may have the ability to limit a commission's authority (thus implicating the jurisdiction versus authority question), the issue presented by the Commonwealth Court’s opinion is whether the Reading City Council has attempted to <em>expand </em>the range of the Commission’s competency beyond <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>the jurisdictional limit established in the enabling provisions of the PHRA.

I note that the availability of civil penalties for unlawful discriminatory acts (such as the $500 fine imposed by the Commission in this case) is expressly restricted to certain acts enumerated by the PHRA. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 959(f)(2). Thus, in my view, there is a substantial legal issue as to the availability of such penalties pursuant to the PHRC’s regulation at 16 Pa.Code § 45.11, and, correspondingly, Section 157(1) of the Ordinance. I would therefore require the Commonwealth Court, on remand, to address this issue to the extent that it has not been waived.</p>
