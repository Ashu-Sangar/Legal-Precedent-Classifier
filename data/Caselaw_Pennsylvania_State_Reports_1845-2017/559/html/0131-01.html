On January 3, 1995, David Bolasky, an architect, went to an Allentown apartment building that he owned to collect rent from his tenants. Shortly after his arrival there, Mr. Bolasky was beaten, robbed, and strangled to death inside the third floor apartment of the building. On January 6, 1995, the police found Mr. Bolasky’s van. The van had been wiped down, inside and out, in an effort to eliminate any latent fingerprints. Later that same day, the police found Mr. Bolasky’s frozen body, wrapped in bed sheets, in the woods along a secluded road in Allentown. Upon unraveling the bed sheets containing Mr. Bolasky’s <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>body, the police discovered that his wrists and ankles had been hog-tied together. In addition, the twisted towel that Mr. Bolasky’s murderers used to strangle him to death was found still wrapped around his neck. An autopsy revealed that Mr. Bolasky had been hit in the head with a blunt instrument prior to being strangled, and defensive wounds found on Mr. Bolasky’s arms indicated that he had struggled to defend himself against the individuals who had attacked and murdered him.</p>

Based largely on Miguel Moreno’s statements, the police obtained a warrant for Appellant’s arrest. On January 21, 1995, the police found Appellant in Orlando, Florida.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> At the time of his arrest, Appellant was discovered hiding in a closet with clothes piled on top of him.

At trial, Miguel Moreno testified that on January 3, 1995, Appellant, Romero and Barbosa planned to rob and murder Moreno’s landlord, Mr. Bolasky, after he collected the rent from his tenants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> According to Moreno’s testimony, the group’s initial plan was to rob Mr. Bolasky, then shoot him in the head in an alleyway adjoining the apartment building. However, when the men went to Moreno’s third-floor apartment to await Mr. Bolasky’s arrival, they abandoned their former plan, and instead instructed Moreno to lure Mr. Bolasky up to his apartment by offering to pay his rent, at which time Appellant, Romero and Barbosa would rob him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

      <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Moreno testified that he did as he was instructed, informing Mr. Bolasky that he had $700 in rent money to pay him. Moreno gave Mr. Bolasky approximately $350 and told him that the rest of the money was up in his apartment. Mr. Bolasky immediately made out a rent receipt for Moreno, and then followed him up to his apartment to collect the balance of the rent money. Unbeknownst to Mr. Bolasky, Romero and Barbosa were lying in wait for him in the bathroom of Moreno’s apartment. Meanwhile, Appellant sat on Moreno’s sofa, feigning indifference to Mr. Bolasky’s arrival and pretending to watch television.</p>
    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.5",216,[225,913,1162,1163]]]'>According to Moreno, he left his apartment as soon as Mr. Bolasky entered it. Moreno testified that he explained his sudden departure to Mr. Bolasky by telling him that he had to get change for a $100 bill. Moreno actually went downstairs to the first floor apartment of Nancy Roman, where he engaged Nancy and Lisette Roman in conversation in order to keep them from going upstairs and inadvertently interrupting the robbery. Approximately twenty minutes later, Moreno went back up to his apartment to see what was happening. When Moreno knocked on the door to his apartment, Appellant would not let him in, and told him that he did not want to see what had happened inside. Moreno testified that he went back downstairs and a few minutes later, saw Romero and Barbosa carrying Mr. Bolasky’s body, tied and wrapped in bed sheets, down the stairs of the apartment building. Moreno also testified that he saw Appellant sitting in the driver’s seat of Mr. Bolasky’s white van out in front of the apartment building, and watched as Romero and Barbosa threw the body into the van. While Appellant, Romero and Barbosa drove off with Mr. Bolasky’s body, Moreno went back up to his apartment and attempted to clean Mr. Bolasky’s blood off of his floor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

      <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>George Barbosa also testified at Appellant’s trial. Prior to the trial, Barbosa gave a tape-recorded confession concerning his role in the murder of Mr. Bolasky to Captain Bucarey of the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office. In his confession, Barbosa also implicated Appellant, Romero and Moreno in the planning and execution of the murder. Barbosa specifically indicated that he and Romero hid inside Moreno’s bathroom until Mr. Bolasky arrived, at which time he, Appellant and Romero robbed and assaulted him. Barbosa also confessed that he attempted to break Mr. Bolasky’s neck with a string, and that when that failed, he wrapped a towel around Mr. Bolasky’s neck and took turns with Appellant and Romero twisting it until Mr. Bolasky was dead. Barbosa stated that they wrapped Mr. Bolasky’s body in bed sheets, carried it down the stairs, and placed it in Mr. Bolasky’s van. Barbosa, Appellant and Romero then drove to a desolate area of Lehigh County, dumped the body, and abandoned the van. Following his confession, Barbosa pled guilty and received a life sentence.</p>

When Mr. Bolasky entered the apartment, Barbosa came out of the bathroom and saw Appellant hit Mr. Bolasky on the head with one of the .38 pistols. Appellant then gave Barbosa some rope and told him that Mr. Bolasky had to be killed, or else Moreno would end up going to jail for the robbery and assault. Appellant told Barbosa to put the rope around Mr. Bolasky’s neck and strangle him. Barbosa complied, but when he tried to stran<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>gle Mr. Bolasky with the rope, it broke. At that point, Barbosa testified that Appellant ordered him to go to the kitchen to get something else with which to strangle Mr. Bolasky, and to get something with which to stab him in the neck in order to stop him from screaming. Barbosa returned with a towel and a small kitchen knife, and unsuccessfully attempted to cut Mr. Bolasky’s throat with the knife. Barbosa then wrapped the towel around Mr. Bolasky’s neck, and Appellant and Barbosa took turns twisting the towel until Mr. Bolasky was dead.</p>
    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[235,875,1160,573]]]'>Barbosa testified that once Mr. Bolasky was dead, Appellant went through Mr. Bolasky’s pockets and took his wallet, his wedding band, his jewelry, and the keys to his van. Appellant and Barbosa proceeded to tie Mr. Bolasky’s body up, and wrapped it in bed sheets. While Barbosa finished wrapping up the body, Appellant went and got Mr. Bolasky’s van. Barbosa testified that he dragged the body down the stairs, put it in the van and drove off with Appellant to dispose of it. After they dumped the body, Appellant parked the van, wiped away any fingerprints that they might have made inside the van and threw away Mr. Bolasky’s briefcase and keys.</p>
    <p id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.6",218,[235,1472,1158,414]]]'>Barbosa further testified that, while he was incarcerated at the Lehigh County Prison, Appellant approached him and got him to agree upon a fictionalized account of their activities on the day that Mr. Bolasky was murdered (i.e., to get their stories straight). According to their agreed-upon story, Appellant and Barbosa were not involved in the actual robbery and murder of Mr. Bolasky, but only became involved after Moreno asked for their help in disposing of the body.</p>

In fact, Barbosa flatly refused to answer any questions concerning Romero’s involvement in the killing, despite the fact that his earlier confession to Captain Bucarey squarely implicated Romero in both the planning and the consummation of the robbery/murder. As a result, the trial judge held Barbosa in contempt of court, and granted the Commonwealth’s request to have Captain Bucarey <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>read into the record those portions of the transcript of Barbosa’s tape-recorded confession that implicated Romero in the commission of the murder of Mr. Bolasky.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Daniel Lopez testified that Appellant had shown him a newspaper .article concerning the Bolasky murder and had told him that he hit that man (Mr. Bolasky) once and knocked him out. According to Daniel Lopez, Appellant also told him that he could get away with the murder because he was very knowledgeable in the law. Finally, Daniel Lopez testified that Appellant wrote out a statement about his activities on the day of the murder and gave it to Romero to give to him with instructions to translate it into Spanish for Romero to read.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Daniel Lopez testified that the letter written by Appellant said that on the day of the murder, Appellant and several “other guys” went to the pizza shop near Moreno’s apartment building.

According to Daniel Lopez’s testimony, the letter said that Moreno then came back to the pizza shop with a set of car keys and asked Appellant to go get a white van and bring it around to the front of the building. One of the “other guys” told Appellant that Moreno had a body in his apartment which he needed help with. Appellant and one of the “other guys” helped Moreno put the body in the van, and they drove off and dumped the body.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Although Appellant does not argue that Lehigh County’s method for selecting its jury pool violates 42 Pa.C.S. § 4521(a), the statutory section governing the selection of jury pools in Pennsylvania state courts, a review of the section nevertheless reveals that Lehigh County's method for selecting its jury pool is statutorily permissible. Section 4521(a) states that, in preparing a master list of prospective voters, "[t]he list shall contain all voter registration lists for the county, which lists may be incorporated by reference, or names from such other lists which in the opinion of the commission will provide a number of prospective jurors which is equal to or greater than the number of names contained in the voter registration lists.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 4521(a). Appellant does not question the fact that, in 1996, Lehigh County’s <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>method for selecting its jury pool provided a greater number of prospective jurors than were contained in the county’s voter registration list. According to the affidavits of the Lehigh County Administrative Court Operations Officer and the Chief Clerk to the Board of the Election and Registration Commission of Lehigh County (which the Commonwealth has appended to their brief to this Court as exhibits A and B), at the time of Appellant's trial in March of 1996 there were somewhere between thirty and forty thousand more individuals on Lehigh County’s jury pool list than there would have been had the jury pool list simply consisted of those individuals registered to vote in the county. Accordingly, Lehigh County’s method for selecting its jury pool was statutorily permissible pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 4521(a).</p>

In addition, Appellant argues that Lehigh County's jury pool selection method violated his right to be tried by a jury representing a fair cross-section of the community because it improperly conditions the right to serve on a jury on the privilege of obtaining a license to drive an automobile.

On appeal to the Superior Court following his conviction, Cameron raised a Sixth Amendment fair cross-section challenge to Lackawanna County’s method for selecting its jury pool. At the time of Cameron’s trial, Lackawanna County’s jury pool consisted of all citizens eighteen years of age and older, who held a valid Pennsylvania Driver’s License. Cameron argued that Lackawanna County’s method for selecting its jury pool unfairly excluded African-Americans, plus large segments of the elderly, the poor, and the handicapped, and improperly conditioned the right to serve on a jury on the privilege of driving a motor vehicle. In dismissing Cameron's constitutional challenge, the Superior Court found that he failed to provide any substantiation for his allegation that Lackawanna County’s jury selection process unfairly excluded African Americans, the elderly, the poor, or the handicapped. <em>Id. </em>at 175-76, <a href="/pa-super/445/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="664 A.2d 1364" data-case-ids="725734,7880935" data-case-paths="/pa-super/445/0165-01,/a2d/664/1364-01">664 A.2d at 1369</a>.

The <em>Lyle </em>court noted that the letters were offered for a purpose similar to that for which the pizza shop story testimony was admitted in this case:</p>

The court then described two lines of analysis concerning the hearsay nature of such statements. The first would simply treat the statement as nonhearsay, as it is offered not for the truth of the matter asserted but for another relevant purpose. The second would find that the chain of inferences that the jury is invited to make from the statement (i.e., the author needs a false alibi, because he has no explanation for his conduct consistent with his innocence, because he is guilty) is an integral part of the statement itself and thus should be included within the set of assertions made by the statement. Under this view, where the statement is proffered for the purpose of establishing consciousness of guilt, it would constitute hearsay. <em>See generally Lyle, </em><a href="/f2d/720/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="720 F.2d 426" data-case-ids="1903916" data-case-paths="/f2d/720/0426-01">720 </a><a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a><a href="/f2d/720/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="720 F.2d 426" data-case-ids="1903916" data-case-paths="/f2d/720/0426-01">F.2d at 432-38</a>. While the <em>Lyle </em>court adopted the view that implied assertions of this sort fall within the definition of hearsay, I believe that the opposite conclusion is consistent with conventional hearsay analysis, the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Street, </em>and the Federal Rules of Evidence, <em>see </em>F.R.E. 801(c) &amp; comment (indicating that, if a statement, although in assertive form, is offered as a basis for inferring something other than the truth of the matter asserted, the statement “is excluded from the definition of hearsay”), as well as our own rules of evidence. <em>See </em>F.R.E. 801(c) &amp; comment. <em>See generally State v.

I must also respectfully disagree with the majority’s alternative conclusion that trial counsel’s failure to object to the testimony concerning the pizza shop story constituted a reasonable trial strategy, in that counsel utilized the story in his closing speech by imploring the jury to accept the version of the facts it contained. In my view, the introduction of the pizza shop story provided highly damaging evidence of Appellant’s consciousness of guilt. The potential value of the story to the defense would seem to be insignificant in light of the highly suspicious context in which the story was related and absent any corroboration in the evidence whatsoever. Under the circumstances, I do not believe that a reasonable jury would ever accept the substance of such a statement, particularly in view of the extensive evidence of Appellant’s guilt. Thus, if the statement had in fact been objectionable, I would find that trial counsel’s failure to lodge an objection would have constituted ineffectiveness.</p>
