Appellant was in charge of obtaining the heroin from Johnson and supplying it to Freeman, Baker, and Caldwell for street sales. In May of 1980, Johnson informed his associates that he wanted Caldwell killed because Caldwell owed him money and owed money to a rival drug dealer with whom Johnson wanted to do business.</p>

Baker later met Johnson, Freeman, and Appellant at her apartment, where Freeman and Appellant asked Johnson if they could use his van. Johnson said that they could, and told them that Caldwell was already in the van and Appellant should “get on his job.” Appellant went to his apartment and got his shotgun, which Freeman placed down his pant leg.</p>
    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[285,710,1154,467]]]'>Appellant and Freeman then entered Johnson’s van and tied up Caldwell. They drove to Third and Sedgley Streets in Philadelphia, where Appellant and Freeman pushed Caldwell from the van. They wrapped a trench coat belt around Caldwell’s neck and each pulled one end of the belt, thereby choking Caldwell. Appellant placed the shotgun to Caldwell’s head and fired one shot, and Freeman did the same. They returned to Baker’s apartment and informed Johnson that “it was done.”</p>
    <p id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[286,1208,1152,530]]]'>Philadelphia Police Detective James Alexander discovered Caldwell’s body at approximately 2:00 a.m. Dr. Halbert Fallinger, the Assistant Medical Examiner for the City of Philadelphia, subsequently determined the cause of death to be homicide by two shotgun wounds to the head and strangulation by ligature. Approximately five years later, on May 30, 1985, the Philadelphia police arrested Appellant. When he was taken into custody, Appellant verbally confessed to murdering Caldwell, but he later refused to sign a written statement and asked to speak to his attorney.</p>

Appellant moved to suppress his statement to the police, which the trial court denied, and the Commonwealth moved to preclude any discussion in front of the jury of Freeman’s acquittal, which the trial court granted. At trial, the prosecution relied primarily on the testimony of Baker, who testified to the events of the evening of May 16, 1980. On May 22, 1986, the jury found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> criminal conspiracy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The defense presented two mitigating circumstances: (1) that Appellant had no history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); and (2) other evidence of good character and record, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). The jury found both the two aggravating circumstances and the two mitigating circumstances, and found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.
