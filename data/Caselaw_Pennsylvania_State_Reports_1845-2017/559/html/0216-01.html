The second, commenced in 1993, was a mandamus action to compel the Liquidator to assert causes of action on behalf of Colonial against the Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company.

Counsel for the parties met on December 9, 1993, and apparently reached an agreement on general conditions of settlement. On December 15, 1993, the day before the scheduled conference, counsel for the Liquidator sent to Mazzella’s counsel a letter memorializing those conditions and noting that on December 10, 1993, “you advised me that Louis Mazzella is comfortable with the proposed conditions.” Those conditions were, <em>inter alia, </em>that Mazzella would withdraw his lawsuits against the Liquidator; that if Mazzella petitioned to intervene in “the Royal Bank objection matter,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the Liquidator would not object; that if the assets of the Colonial estate proved sufficient to satisfy all claims against the estate that were properly filed and were accepted by the Liquidator, any surplus would be distributed to Mazzella; and that, “within a time-certain following resolution of the Royal Bank objection matter,” the Liquidator would file a petition for distribution of Colonial’s assets.</p>

Included among liabilities, however, was a reserve in the amount of $1,940,000 for the Royal Bank claim. If the court ultimately denied the claim, as proved to be the case, Colonial’s assets would exceed its liabilities by approximately $1, 408, 000. The balance sheet noted that “[n]o reserve has been established for claims rejected by the [Liquidator based on receipt subsequent to the January 1, 1991 bar date.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Among its findings of fact, the court noted that Mazzella had admitted at <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>the evidentiary hearing that, prior to the settlement conference, he had received a letter from his counsel outlining the provisions of the proposed settlement; that he had agreed to those provisions; and that, after the settlement conference, his son and his counsel, both of whom had attended the conference, informed him “that they would get a formal settlement agreement and that it was consistent with the letter [that he had] received from his Counsel.” From these and other facts, the court drew the following conclusions: Counsel for Mazzella had actual and express authority to enter into an agreement with the Liquidator on Mazzella’s behalf, and did so at the December 1993 settlement conference. The terms agreed to at that time were formalized in the January 1994 settlement agreement, and any subsequent revisions to such agreement were non-material. Because counsel never negotiated for a dollar amount of surplus in the Colonial estate, Mazzella would not be heard to complain that the February revisions improperly foreclosed any possibility of a surplus. Moreover, “even if Mazzella objected to language inserted in the February 1994 draft, he cannot validly argue that the January 1994 draft is not binding and fully enforceable.”</p>

According to Mazzella, these changes were not “insubstantial,” as the Commonwealth Court found, but material, since they undercut the very basis <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>of his willingness to enter into a settlement: the understanding that, within a time certain after the resolution of one specific claim, the Liquidator would request that the assets remaining in the estate, if any, be distributed to him. Mazzella argues that, given the absence of an agreement, the draft prepared by his counsel in January was simply an offer, and the draft prepared by the Liquidator in February, since it was not identical to the January draft, was not an acceptance, but a counter-offer. <em>See Hedden v.

In 1992, the Liquidator evaluated Royal Bank’s claim at zero. Royal Bank filed objections to the Liquidator's evaluation, and the Liquidator filed a petition for a hearing in the Commonwealth Court. The matter was ultimately submitted to the court upon a stipulation of the issues and facts. By order entered December 20, 1993, the court granted Mazzella’s request to intervene in the litigation. Although the Liquidator did not object to Mazzella’s intervention, Royal Bank did, and the order permitting such intervention was rescinded. In 1995, the Commonwealth Court dismissed Royal Bank’s objections, concluding that Royal Bank was not entitled to recover and, accordingly, that the Liquidator had properly evaluated Royal Bank’s claim at zero. <em>See Foster v.
