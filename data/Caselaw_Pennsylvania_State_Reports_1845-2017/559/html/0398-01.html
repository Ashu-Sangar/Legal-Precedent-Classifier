Appellant also contends that <em>Middletown Township </em>is distinguishable because the court there ruled that "[cjarrying on a construction business, such as that in which [taxpayer] is engaged, involves much more than the construction of a residence. Section 2(11) of the Act therefore does not prohibit the local tax which was enacted pursuant to Ordinance No. 266.” <em>Id. </em>at 1041. Appellant maintains that because its business involves <em>only </em>the construction of residences, its gross receipts are synonymous with the amount reflected on the deeds, which is the figure upon which the realty transfer tax is assessed. Thus, it asserts that unlike the taxpayer in <em>Middletown, </em>the business privilege tax is imposed upon the same tax base as the realty transfer tax. Although the alleged duplicative nature of the tax will be discussed in more detail <em>infra, </em>Appellant’s misplaced reliance on the above-cited language in <em>Middletown </em>requires further comment.</p>
      <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.7",478,[279,1935,1125,430]]]'>Appellant’s argument hinges upon its assertion that it is not a <em>general </em>contractor under section 809 of the taxing ordinance because it only constructs residential dwellings. The lower courts rejected this argument and concluded that "[Appellant’s] business activity within the City of Scranton can be classified as a ‘General Contractor in the business of erecting and constructing new residential'buildings for sale to unrelated third parties’ ” and therefore fell under section 809 of the ordinance. Trial Court Opinion at 2-3. As our limited grant of allocatur did not include review of the issue of whether Appellant was a general contractor, the lower court’s determination in this regard is final. Appellant is therefore in the same posture as the taxpayer in <em>Middletown Township.</em>

We noted, however, that section 2 also expressly permitted school districts that had adopted taxes on residential construction to continue to assess and collect the tax until June 30, 1982. Thus, we concluded that the Commonwealth Court should have declared the tax invalid as of July 1, 1982, rather than invalidate the tax as a whole.</p>

In a similar vein, Appellant asserts that to "reconcile the present matter with <em>Comach, </em>the Commonwealth Court relied upon the erroneous finding that the Developer was a 'general contractor,’ and that the procedure by which the Taxing Authorities calculated the tax at issue was a result of lack of cooperation on the part of the Developer.” Appellant’s Brief at 19. As noted in footnote 2, the determination by the lower courts that Appellant is a general contractor is controlling in this appeal.</p>
