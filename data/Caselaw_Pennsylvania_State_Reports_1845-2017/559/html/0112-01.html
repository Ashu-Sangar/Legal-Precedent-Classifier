The vacancy board shall consist of the board of supervisors and one elector of the township, who shall be appointed by the board of supervisors at the board’s first meeting each calendar year or as soon after that as practical and who shall act as chairman of the vacancy board....</blockquote>

The court pointed out that the legislature added the phrase “at a public meeting” to Section 603 and concluded that it did so in order to clarify that a majority of a quorum is sufficient for the Board to transact business.

    <p id="b189-7" data-blocks='[["BL_189.7",189,[221,1314,1152,751]]]'>Appellant Scheipe argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the foregoing legislative amendment evinces a legislative intent that only a majority of those present at a public meeting are needed in order to transact business. He maintains that the clear language of the provision requires that a majority of the <em>entire </em>board is necessary to transact business, and that if read any other way the legislature’s use of the term “entire board” would become surplusage. He points out that in <em>Stoltz v. SEPTA, </em><a href="/pa/473/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="473 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1730291" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0157-01">473 Pa. 157</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="473 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1730291" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0157-01">373 A.2d 1096</a>, 1099 (1977), this Court held that the legislature may draft legislation in abrogation of the common law rule that a majority of those voting, in the presence of a quorum, can act for a municipal body. We agree with Appellant that Section 603 requires a majority of the entire board to transact business.</p>
    <p id="b189-8" data-blocks='[["BL_189.8",189,[220,2107,1149,255]]]'>In <em>Stoltz, </em>this Court considered a similar question to the one at issue here when we determined what construction should be given to Section 18(a) of the Metropolitan Transportation Authorities Act, 66 P.S. § 2018(a).

Thereafter, several board members filed equity actions asking that SEPTA be enjoined from carrying out the challenged resolutions. SEPTA filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the five affirmative votes out of the nine votes cast were sufficient to carry a resolution.</p>
    <p id="b190-6" data-blocks='[["BL_190.6",190,[239,922,1158,257]]]'>This Court rejected. SEPTA’s claim that the language of Section 18(a) does not manifest an unmistakable legislative intent to abrogate the general common law rule that “a majority of those voting, in the presence of a quorum, can act for a board or other body.” <em>Id. </em>at 1099. We stated:</p>
    <p id="b190-7" data-blocks='[["BL_190.7",190,[278,1195,1120,1011]]]'>In our view, the statutory requirement that “the affirmative vote of a majority of all members shall be necessary for the adoption of any resolution” (emphasis added [in original] ) reflects a clear legislative intent to abrogate the common-law rule with regard to MTAA, so that instantly a minimum of six affirmative votes was necessary to adopt the challenged resolutions. We thus agree with the majority of the Commonwealth Court that <em>Ross v. Miller, </em><a href="/njl/115/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="115 N.J.L. 61" data-case-ids="123577" data-case-paths="/njl/115/0061-01">115 N.J.L. 61</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.%20771" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="178 A. 771">178 A. 771</a>, 772 (1935), in which it was held that a New Jersey statute providing “ ‘[a] majority of all the members of the municipal council shall constitute a quorum, and the affirmative vote of a majority of all the members shall be necessary to take any action or pass any measure ... ’ ” modified the common-law rule is a more pertinent precedent than the Pennsylvania cases cited by appellants in which the common-law rule was held applicable in the absence of legislative language to the contrary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> See and compare <em>Putney v.

To the contrary, the clear, unambiguous language found therein required that “an affirmative vote of a majority of the <em>entire </em>board” was needed for the Board to transact business. Thus, contrary to the trial court’s further conclusion that the addition of the words “at a public meeting” to Section 603 was an attempt to clarify this language, it is clear that the legislature intended to retain the requirement found in the former act that an affirmative vote of a majority of the <em>entire </em>board is needed to transact business. The only further requirement imposed by the legislature in Section 603 is that the board transact business “at a public meeting.”</p>

Here, because former Section 512 and current Section 603 both clearly indicate that in order to transact business an affirmative vote of the <em>entire </em>board is needed, we find that the trial court erred in concluding that only a majority of a quorum is necessary. Thus, it was error for the court to conclude that Appellee Orlando’s appointment to the Board was proper since only two members of the five member Board voted for his appointment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a>
