The Compact is an agreement among several states to promote compliance with each party state’s motor vehicle laws. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1581, Article I(b)(l)~(2). Pennsylvania became a party state to the Compact in 1996 by adopting sections 1581-1585 of the Motor Vehicle Code. In each of these three cases, Pennsylvania’s Department of Transportation (PennDOT) revoked the driver’s license of a Pennsylvania citizen for an out-of-state conviction.

Subsequently, PennDOT treated Appellees’ out-of-state convictions as if they were violations of Pennsylvania’s DUI statute, 75 Pa.C.S. 3731(a), and suspended Appellees’ licenses for one year, pursuant to the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(b)(3), which mandates a one-year suspension of the driving privileges of persons who have been convicted of violating 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731.

Several of the lower courts have framed the issue as whether Pennsylvania’s drunk driving statute and the out-of-state statute are “substantially similar”. This analysis is understandable as some of the language of Pennsylvania’s DUI statute, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(1), is nearly identical to the language of Article IV(a)(2). However, we reiterate that the correct inquiiy involves first, a comparison of Article IV(a)(2) to Pennsylvania's drunk driving statute, and then a comparison of the out-of-state statute to Article IV(a)(2).</p>
