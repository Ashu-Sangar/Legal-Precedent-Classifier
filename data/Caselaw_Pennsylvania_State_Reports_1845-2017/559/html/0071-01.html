At about 10:30 p.m., they were walking down Clearfield Street in North Philadelphia where they encountered appellant and two of his cohorts who were in a Buick parked between Rosewood and Carlisle Streets. As Gambrell and Brown walked past the parked automobile, appellant made “smart” remarks to them; however, they continued on their way. Later that evening, while Gambrell and Brown were drinking a newly purchased bottle of wine, they saw the appellant and his cronies circling the block in the Buick stalking them.</blockquote>

As they walked past the car, appellant said, “There they go.” Appellant then got out of the car from his driver’s seat and confronted Raymond Gambrell by the steps to an apartment building next to a vacant lot. Brown stood by as appellant accused Gambrell of breaking into appellant’s mother’s house. Gambrell told appellant that he did not do it. Appellant then pulled out a gun and told Brown to get into the car. When he hesitated, appellant said to Brown, ‘You think I’m playing, get in the car ... sit between them.”</blockquote>

On February 3, 1981, an arrest warrant for appellant was executed.</blockquote>

A firearms examiner also testified that the .38 caliber bullet obtained from Gambrell’s head was likely fired from a .357 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver. Sergeant Schmid of the Philadelphia Police Department testified that a .357 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver was found in appellant’s possession when he was arrested.</blockquote>

Renee Jones, who lived with appellant from 1979 to 1981, testified that she also saw appellant shoot up onto the porch of Watson’s house. She then observed appellant and Bernie Smith jump into a car and take off down the street. Renee Jones further testified that appellant had told her that he shot Raymond Gambrell because Gambrell had broken into his mother’s house. Moreover, in a statement she had given to police on February 24,1986, Renee Jones stated that appellant shot Steven Brown because he was a witness to the Gambrell killing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">[4]</a>

Specifically, appellant complains that after the trial court informed the jury about the nature of the permissive inference, it stated that: <em>“If you find </em>that there were any qualifying facts indicating a contrary intent, such facts would prevent the application of this principle ... you may infer from such conduct that the act was done with malice, but <em>if you find facts </em>from the circumstances surrounding the defendant’s conduct indicating an inconsistent or contrary intent on his part, you would not draw the inference of malice.” (Appellant’s Brief at 37, quoting from N.T. 7/29/88 at 2652)(emphasis in Appellant’s Brief). Appellant contends that the trial court impermissibly shifted the burden to appellant to demonstrate the absence of malice by proving qualifying facts or circumstances. However, appellant takes the language in question out of context. In the portion of the charge at issue, the trial court simply stated to the jury that although it was permitted to draw an inference of malice based on use of a deadly weapon against a vital part of the victim’s body, it could not draw such an inference if it found qualifying facts evidencing a contrary intent. The trial court did not tell the jury that the absence of such qualifying facts negated the <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>presumption of innocence with respect to malice. Rather, it told them that the presence of such facts negated its ability to draw the common inference that malice may be equated with use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim’s body. This instruction corresponds with the jurisprudence of this Court holding that while the inference of malice may normally be drawn from use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim’s body, this inference will not be permitted to support a finding of malice where the evidence presented proves the contrary. <em>See Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b163-9" data-blocks='[["BL_163.9",163,[254,978,1153,1231]]]'>Although this Court did reverse appellant’s conviction and death sentence for the murder of Steven Brown while appellant’s direct appeal was pending, appellant subsequently pled guilty to the murder of Steven Brown. Thus, even if this Court were to order a new sentencing hearing, appellant’s conviction for the killing of Steven Brown would still be available for the Commonwealth to use against appellant to establish the aggravating circumstance that appellant had a significant history of violent felony convictions, only this time the conviction would be based on a guilty plea instead of a jury’s verdict. Hence, no prejudice can be established. Further, the vacating of appellant’s original death sentence for the Steven Brown murder is irrelevant to the instant claim. The aggravating circumstance at issue is based solely on the convictions for prior violent felonies and is not based upon the types of sentences imposed for those convictions. Since appellant’s <em>conviction </em>in the Steven Brown murder is presently intact, there is no basis on which to conclude that the jury in appellant’s penalty phase improperly balanced his prior convictions when considering the aggravating circumstance of a significant history of violent felony convictions and the weight that should be attached to it. Accordingly, the instant claim fails on its underlying merits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

      <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>Appellant’s final claim is that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court limiting his presentation of mitigating evidence. Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining objections to the following question when it was posed to appellant’s mother and brother:</p>
    <p id="b164-5" data-blocks='[["BL_164.6",164,[209,653,1153,96]]]'>Q. What would be the impact on his getting the death penalty on your family?</p>

Assuming for the sake of argument that this question was relevant insofar as it arguably related indirectly to petitioner’s character, we conclude nonetheless that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining objections to the question. The record is replete, with testimony from the sentencing hearing concerning the impact a death sentence might have on appellant’s family, as well as his character trait for “love.” Sean Jones, appellant’s brother, testified that if appellant was sentenced to death, it would have a “devastating” effect on his family and would be a significant “hardship” for appellant’s mother. N.T. at 2775. Furthermore, Dorothy Murphy, Kenneth Murphy, and Sean Jones all testified to appellant’s close relationships with his family, friends and children, and asserted that they all loved him very much. <em>Id. </em>at 2772-2788. An abundance of evidence was introduced from which the jury could deduce that there existed people in the world who would miss appellant if he were executed. Accordingly, we will not condemn as an abuse of discretion the trial court’s sustaining of the objections to the foregoing question. Furthermore, as this issue arises in the context of an ineffective assistance claim, we conclude also that appellant has failed to meet his burden of establishing by <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>a preponderance of the evidence that a different outcome would have been likely had he been permitted to introduce this strictly cumulative testimony. Accordingly, appellant’s final claim of ineffective assistance fails.</p>

As noted by the majority, the trial court informed the jury that all they could do was determine what “probably happened”. Like the majority, I appreciate the fact that the trial court was attempting to explain to the jury that because they were not actually present during the commission of the crime, they could not know with absolute certainty exactly what happened. However, I cannot condone any language in a jury charge that suggests to the jury that they need not find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict him of the crimes charged. By injecting language such as “probably happened” into a jury charge on the meaning of “reasonable doubt”, a trial court necessarily risks diluting the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard. Nevertheless, because I agree with the majority that the trial court’s charge in the instant case, as a whole, adequately instructed the jury on the meaning of “reasonable doubt”, I agree that the Appellant’s ineffectiveness claim does not entitle him to relief.</p>
