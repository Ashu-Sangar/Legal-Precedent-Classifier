Whether the trial court erred in its application of 15 Pa.C.S. §§ 1791-1793 by faffing to set aside the corporate action taken on June 25, 1997 as procedurally improper because it was taken with no notice and no quorum and in apparent violation of a ruling the trial court had issued the day before.</p>
