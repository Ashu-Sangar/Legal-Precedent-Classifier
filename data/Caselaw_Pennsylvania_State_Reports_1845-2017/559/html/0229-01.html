Forbes performed several services for the victim, including helping to collect revenues from the victim’s marijuana business. Upon Forbes exiting his car, appellant approached Forbes and asked for a cigarette. After indicating that he did not smoke, Forbes proceeded to cross the street and enter the victim’s apartment building. Approximately fifteen minutes later, Forbes, the victim and the victim’s girlfriend exited the apartment building. As Forbes began crossing the street towards his car, he observed appellant pull out a handgun and begin firing. Forbes initially feared he had been shot but, after realizing he was mistaken, ducked and ran toward the apartment building hoping to escape. The victim was unable to escape and fell to the ground after being shot. Forbes then watched as appellant approached the victim and shot him several more times while on the ground. Forensic evidence established that the gunshot wounds caused the victim’s death.</p>

At first, he refused to sign a written confession acknowledging his statement but, after speaking with his mother, appellant agreed to sign the statement admitting that he shot the victim three to four times in exchange for marijuana from Martin, which appellant subsequently sold for $1,100. The next day, while awaiting preliminary arraignment in a holding cell with other prisoners, appellant did not respond when his name was called. A police officer then checked the armbands of all the prisoners awaiting arraignment and discovered that one prisoner, later identified as Ty Fuller, did not have an armband. The police officer then discovered that appellant, who was still in the cell, had taken Fuller’s armband and replaced his own with it. Fuller was facing only theft charges and was due to be released from jail following his arraignment.

The evidence here demonstrated that appellant shot in the direction of Forbes even though he may have only intended to shoot Aitken.

Hence, this claim warrants no relief.</p>
