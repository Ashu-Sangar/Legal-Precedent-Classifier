The first conversation, which occurred sometime in February of 1991, established that there was a dispute between appellant and Thomas Puksar involving the purchase of model trains. Hartman testified that appellant had stopped at Thomas Puksar’s residence on that particular day to get some money from Thomas Puksar for the train set. N.T., 11/1/93, 705. But, Hartman further stated that “[Tom] wasn’t going to give him any money. He wanted to go sell the trains and get them appraised.” <em>Id. </em>at 708. Further into Hartman’s testimony, the Commonwealth provided him with a police report to refresh his recollection as to what he told the police following the murder. After he reviewed the report, Hartman testified that “[Tom] didn’t trust [appellant]” and that “Tom thought that some of [the trains] were replicas ... that’s why no money ever changed hands, because Tom didn’t know the price of the train collections, what it was valued as.” <em>Id. </em>at 711-12.</p>

We merely note that <em>Bybel </em>involved a seven-month interval between the proffered evidence and the murder, whereas the case herein involves only two weeks to one month between the conversations and the murders. Thus, the conversations were not too remote in time to be reliable evidence.</p>

However, in the instant case appellant is not arguing that "blood splatter interpretation” is not "generally accepted” in the scientific community; rather, appellant's argument is directed specifically at the expertise of Dr. Mihalakis in this area, and as such, reliance on <em>Frye </em>is misplaced.</p>

Although the court determined that the circumstances surrounding the motion to strike in <em>McDuffie </em>warranted an exception to this general rule, since a review of the record indicated that the witness was not being responsive to defense counsel’s questions, and thus, the statements made by the defendant could not be construed as being elicited by defense counsel. <em>McDuffie, </em><a href="/pa/476/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="476 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1736885" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0321-01">382 A.2d at 1192</a>.

Appellant also posits that the trial judge had a duty to recuse himself, rather than deny appellant’s request for a bench trial. However, the mere fact that the judge has participated in pretrial stages of the proceedings does not establish sufficient grounds for recusal; instead, appellant must demonstrate that the trial judge could not rule impartially. <em>Miller, </em>664 A.2d at 1321. Appellant makes no such claim of impartiality to this court, and thus, this argument does not warrant any further comment.</p>
