According to Appellant, this information would have allowed him to present expert testimony to make obvious that he was unable, due to his mental illness, to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Appellant also asserts that trial counsel was ineffective, therefore, for: (1) failing to present a diminished capacity defense that would have been available had this information been provided to his mental health experts at the time of his trial; (2) failing to present expert testimony that <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>would have established a “diminished mental capacity”, which would demonstrate a mitigating circumstance pursuant to Section 9711(e)(8);<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and (3) failing to present expert testimony that would have established mitigating circumstances pursuant to the “catch-all” mitigating factor found at Section 9711(e)(8).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant also maintains that, to the extent that trial counsel pursued mental-illness mitigation evidence, he did so ineffectively by failing to develop more detailed expert testimony concerning the nature and extent of Appellant’s mental illness.

First, Appellant points to twenty-two pages of handwritten notes taken from his residence during the execution of a search warrant at the time of his arrest. They can be loosely described as a journal, and were probably written during a period of time before the murders. In his testimony at the PCRA hearing, Dr. Rodney Steven Altman, a board-certified psychiatrist who assisted in the presentation of Appellant’s mitigation case, described these notes as “fragmented,” “scattered,” “disorganized,” “rambling,” “confused,” and “psychotic.” Dr. Altman testified that the notes contained symbolism that was indicative of schizophrenic illness, and that the sequence of words and phrases was “perseverative,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which Dr. Altman explained as “where the speech or thought process is stuck in a certain topic or certain word or certain phrase or certain rhyming quality.” As an example of the perseverative quality of Appellant’s journal, Dr. Altman noted the unrelated grouping of the words “Bill Cosby, Bill Cousins, Bob Babich, Conrail, Bert,” in this repetitive, rhyme-type of cadence.

She testified that their father was an alcoholic, and that their mother was a “dramatic” person who, in the children’s presence, would threaten to kill herself or to leave the family. Ms. Postich stated that although Appellant’s counsel interviewed her for approximately half an hour and she testified at Appellant’s trial, counsel never questioned her about Appellant’s childhood. Also at the PCRA hearing, Appellant presented the testimony from another older sister, Constance Corbitt, who corroborated much of Ms. Postich’s testimony about their childhood family situation, and who also described the changes in Appellant’s behavior that occurred during the periods of Appellant’s separation from Brenda Jo Stevens, including his heavy drinking, substantial weight loss, and overall depression. Ms. Corbitt further testified that she was never contacted by Appellant’s counsel and was not called to testify during the trial, although she was present for some of it. Appellant also presented testimony from his daughter, Karen Mangieri (formerly Karen Stevens), who had testified at the sentencing phase of Appellant’s trial.

To support this claim, Appellant presented Dr. Christine Martone, a board-certified psychiatrist who had testified at the penalty phase of Appellant’s trial. Dr. Martone had initially examined Appellant in August of 1992 pursuant to the Commonwealth’s request to decide whether Appellant would qualify for an insanity defense. Based on that initial interview, Dr. Martone prepared a report in which she diagnosed Appellant as suffering from an adjustment disorder and a personality disorder but concluded that Appellant did not qualify for an insanity defense and did not suffer from a psychotic disorder. After the guilt phase of Appellant’s trial was concluded, Appellant’s counsel retained Dr. Martone to assist in Appellant’s mitigation case. Accordingly, Dr. Martone again examined Appellant in April of 1993, while the penalty phase was ongoing, and subsequently testified to the nature of Appellant’s mental illness. During the PCRA hearings, however, Dr. Martone testified that she was not, at the time of her second evaluation of Appellant, provided with Appellant’s journal or the other information concerning Appellant’s social history. Had those materials been available to Dr. Martone, they would have <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>affected her earlier diagnoses.

We have noted that two sections of the capital sentencing statute allow the jury specifically to consider the defendant’s mental health in deciding whether to impose the death penalty: Section 9711(e)(2) (that the defendant was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance), and Section 9711(e)(3) (that the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired). <em>See Faulkner, </em><a href="/pa/528/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="528 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1829843" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0057-01">528 Pa. at </a>73 n. 7, <a href="/pa/528/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="528 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1829843" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0057-01">595 A.2d at </a>37 n. 7.

Here, the trial court, as the factfinder in Appellant’s nonjury trial, concluded that, notwithstanding Dr. Martone’s change of diagnosis, it would still have concluded that Appellant had the capacity to form the specific intent to kill at the time of the murders. At Appellant’s trial, there was testimony that, on the evening of the murders, Appellant became very angry when he saw Brenda Jo dancing with Love. Appellant slammed his forearms on the bar and stood and stared at Love and Brenda Jo and then left the bar. He retrieved his gun from beneath the seat of his vehicle and returned to the bar. Appellant walked toward the table area, pulled the gun from underneath his jacket, raised it, but then <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>lowered it to his side and waited until Love and Brenda Jo were finished dancing. When they left the dance floor, Appellant cocked the gun and without hesitation walked up behind Brenda Jo and shot her in the back of the head at close range. He then turned to Love and shot him twice rapidly in succession, and fired at Love several times while he lay on the floor, including an intentional shot through the scrotum area. Appellant fired a last shot at Brenda Jo, hitting her again in the head. Appellant had fired a total of ten shots. Based on this evidence of Appellant’s deliberate actions in leaving the bar and returning to shoot his wife and Love multiple times, the trial court concluded that Appellant had formed the specific intent to kill. Notwithstanding Dr. Martone’s revised diagnosis of Appellant’s psychosis from the trial to the PCRA hearings, the trial court found through circumstantial proof that the Commonwealth had established beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant had the specific intent to kill, and therefore determined that Appellant suffered no prejudice by pursuit of a defense that would have been unsuccessful had Appellant’s counsel presented it. We agree with the finding of the trial court that Appellant has not proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was a reasonable probability that presentation of expert testimony concerning Appellant’s psychosis would have successfully prevented the Commonwealth from proving Appellant’s premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

Dr. Landefeld explained that these tests were given as part of a neuropsychological screening inventory to see whether there could be some neurological component to Appellant’s mental illness. Appellant’s counsel did not question Dr. Landefeld extensively about the results of those tests, and limited his questioning to establishing that Dr. Landefeld reported the results of those tests to Dr. Altman.

This implies that anytime the Commonwealth has established the elements of a crime then the defendant’s criminal liability is unassailable. The majority’s sweeping conclusion calls into question the existence of affirmative defenses and diminishes the role of defense counsel.</p>

Furthermore, counsel may also be ineffective where pursuit of a possible defense was curtailed by the lack of reasonable investigation. See <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b288-6" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[228,1229,1161,469]]]'>Appellant’s contention is that his counsel failed to provide relevant materials to Dr. Martone and that the absence of these materials, especially the writings that comprised Appellant’s journal, led to Dr. Martone’s initial misdiagnosis of Appellant. It was this misdiagnosis which Appellant’s counsel relied upon in not pursuing a diminished capacity defense. This meant that no further psychiatric examinations were made, no witnesses were interviewed, and no trial strategy was devised regarding the diminished capacity defense.</p>
    <p id="b288-7" data-blocks='[["BL_288.7",288,[229,1721,1157,626]],["BL_289.1",289,[270,309,1151,652]]]'>The PCRA court determined that Appellant suffered no prejudice by his counsel’s failure to pursue this defense. It held that it would have found that Appellant had, and exhibited, the specific intent to kill despite Dr. Martone’s revised diagnosis as presented at the PCRA hearing. I believe that the PCRA court as well as the majority fails to consider the full effect of counsel’s error in failing to provide the documents needed to correctly diagnose Appellant. Rather, their consideration^ limited to whether Dr. Martone’s testimony during the PCRA hearing would have been sufficient to establish reasonable doubt when set against the evidence offered by the Commonwealth at trial. This may have indeed been the <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>proper analysis had Appellant presented Dr. Martone’s revised diagnosis as after-discovered evidence. However, Dr. Martone’s revised diagnosis, set against her testimony at trial, is offered to show counsel’s ineffectiveness in failing to pursue a vigorous and viable defense. Counsel’s failures precluded not only Dr. Martone’s correct testimony at trial, but also any other evidence, which was not discovered due to counsel’s failure. Since it is impossible for the trier of fact to fully anticipate and properly weigh a defense that was never prepared and never presented, it is impossible for the PCRA court to state that Appellant was not prejudiced by such failure.</p>
