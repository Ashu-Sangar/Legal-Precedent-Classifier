Appellant, Samuel Carson, was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree, robbery, two counts of aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and possession of an instrument of crime. At the conclusion of the penalty phase of Appellant’s trial, the jury found the existence of four aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances, and returned a sentence of death.</p>

Appellant was a drug dealer, conducting on-going crack cocaine sales in the area of 21st and Clymer Streets in South Philadelphia. On the evening of November 21, 1993, Appellant and two accomplices, Lawrence Eddins and Anthony Johnson, met at a bar where they agreed to rob the residence of Penny Hairston, who they believed was selling drugs in direct competition with Appellant. The men went to Hairston’s residence at 2117 Clymer Street and gained entry by claiming that they wished to discuss the establishment of a drug selling operation at the residence. While Appellant was in the kitchen discussing this arrangement with Hairston, Eddins and Johnson threatened another drug dealer who was present, Edgar Clarke. Appellant, Eddins and Johnson then left the residence.</p>

Immediately thereafter, Appellant, Eddins and Johnson re-entered Hairston’s residence and robbed Clarke of drugs and money. When the men exited the residence, they <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>encountered Burton, who had since proceeded to 2117 Clymer Street in a gray Honda, and a gun battle ensued. Remarkably, the only injury was to Eddins, who suffered several nonfatal gunshot wounds.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[232,542,1159,312]]]'>Immediately following the gun battle, Appellant fled towards 21st and St. Albans Streets. Once on St. Albans Street, Appellant fired several shots at William Lloyd, an innocent bystander who was standing on the southwest corner of 21st and Clymer Streets. Lloyd died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds to the head.</p>

The police also recovered the 9 millimeter handgun fired by Burton. On January 8, 1994, while executing an arrest warrant for Appellant at his residence at 2009 Catherine Street, the police recovered a .38 caliber handgun from Appellant when he attempted to covertly discard the weapon from his second story bedroom window as the police were attempting to execute the arrest warrant.</p>

The Commonwealth also presented the eyewitness testimony of Ruth Beverly. Beverly had been walking north on 21st Street and crossing at St. Albans Street when she heard the gun battle erupt on Clymer Street. Beverly was <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>startled by the gunfire and stumbled to the ground while attempting to take cover.

Appellant attempted to discredit the testimony of Commonwealth eyewitness Beverly by claiming that she was motivated to testify falsely against Appellant as retribution for Appellant having broken off a prior long-standing relationship between the two, in which Beverly had been providing Appellant with sexual favors in exchange for crack cocaine. Appellant attempted to bolster his alibi defense by presenting the testimony of his father and girlfriend, both of whom testified that Appellant was at home when the gunfire erupted on nearby Clymer Street.</p>

On July 18, 1995, Appellant was sentenced to death for the murder conviction. The jury found the existence of four aggravating circumstances: the defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); in the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7); the defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9); and the defendant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a drug felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(13). No mitigating circumstances were found.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On March 28, 1996, Appellant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment on each of the remaining charges, to run concurrent with his sentence for first degree murder.</p>

On April 25, 1996, additional post-sentence motions were filed on Appellant’s behalf by Jack McMahon, Esquire, whom Appellant had since retained to represent him on appeal. By order dated August 6, 1996, the trial court denied the post-sentence motions filed by Greene, which had not been pursued by McMahon, but which had not previously been formally denied.

In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine whether the evidence admitted at trial and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to support all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

The victim in this case was black, as is Appellant. During jury selection, two jurors, both black, had been seated when Appellant used his first peremptory challenge against a white male. When Appellant attempted to use his second peremptory challenge against a white female the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>asked counsel for Appellant to place on the record his race-neutral reason for the challenge. Counsel explained that after consulting with Appellant and explaining to him the law with respect to race and gender vis a vis peremptory challenges, Appellant indicated that there was something about the juror’s face that made him feel that she was not trustworthy. The trial court rejected this proffered reason as pretextual and ordered the juror seated.</p>

A critical rationale for forbidding parties to exclude jurors based on their race is the right of all individual citizens not to be deprived of their right to sit on a jury because of racial concerns or prejudices. It follows that a trial court has a duty not to sit by and watch the constitution being violated. Any other rule would require the court, and by extension the state, to become complicit in racial discrimination. This is forbidden. By not acting when it perceived racial discrimination, the court would condone a violation of the equal protection clause.</blockquote>

The trial court sustained the Commonwealth’s objection and ordered counsel to curtail his opening statement accordingly. Notwithstanding the court’s ruling, counsel continued his opening statement in the same vein and complained to the jury that the trial court was improperly restricting the scope of his statement. The trial court was forced to admonish counsel three separate times for failing to adhere to and disparaging the court’s prior rulings, ultimately ordering that the defense call its first witness. At that point, counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis that the trial court was not permitting him to try his case. The trial court denied the motion for mistrial, but again gave counsel the option of continuing, conditioned on counsel’s compliance with the court’s previous instructions. Counsel accepted the trial court’s offer to continue, but again ran afoul of the court’s instructions:</p>

We find this assertion disingenuous. The criminal episode which resulted in the murder of the victim was one continuous event beginning when Appellant and his co-conspirators threatened and robbed Edgar Clarke and engaged in a gun battle with Ramon Burton. The robbery and assault culminated in Appellant <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>fleeing the scene and shooting the victim, an innocent bystander.

If <em>Batson </em>and its progeny have indeed created an affirmative duty on the part of the trial court to <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges when the trial court observes a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination, we can only speculate as to the untoward effect such a duty would have on the entire <em>voir dire </em>process. For if the trial court is duty bound to <em>sua sponte </em>raise <em>Batson </em>type objections on behalf of jurors, the failure of the trial court to do so when confronted with a prima facie case would constitute an abuse of discretion. One shudders to think of the all encompassing record that would have to be developed at <em>voir dire </em>in order to facilitate appellate review, given the variety of circumstances which the rationale of <em>Batson </em>has been applied to.</p>
