If a valid contract was formed, then we must address the secondary issue of whether conditions existed which excused the PLCB’s performance under the contract. For the reasons stated herein, we hold that a valid contract was formed which was breached by the PLCB. However, the existence of unfulfilled conditions excused the PLCB’s duty to perform the contract. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the tribunals below and remand to the Board of Claims for a determination of damages due to Shovel consistent with the opinion below.</p>

At the time the instant matter began, Shovel operated a distribution facility in Youngwood, Pennsylvania, and had an existing contract with the PLCB to warehouse and distribute alcoholic beverages from its Youngwood facility until June 30, 1988. In .1985-86, following various economic feasibility and logistical studies, the PLCB informed Shovel of its intent to transfer its southwestern distribution district to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, since the studies showed that it would be less <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>expensive to operate from Pittsburgh. The PLCB’s contract administrator provided Shovel with a zone map so that Shovel could evaluate whether relocation to Pittsburgh would be economically feasible. Upon review of the information, Shovel concluded that relocation would be feasible.</p>
    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[221,603,1161,851]]]'>In the spring of 1986, Shovel began a search for a facility to support the warehousing requirements of the PLCB within Pittsburgh. Shovel located a facility in Lawrenceville, City of Pittsburgh, at 55 th Street and Allegheny Valley Railroad (AVRR). The facility was owned by the Giant Eagle food store chain, but was no longer in use. Shovel signed an agreement to purchase the facility on May 20,1986. The sales agreement contained a contingency clause, which allowed Shovel to withdraw from its commitment to purchase the warehouse in the event that a contract with the PLCB was not negotiated. On June 30, 1986, representatives of the PLCB toured and inspected the Lawrenceville facility. All the members in attendance agreed that the facility would meet the PLCB’s requirements to warehouse and store liquor. In July 1986, the PLCB’s contract administrator toured the facility, and also found the facility suitable for the PLCB.</p>

On September 3,1986 the PLCB formally approved of negotiating the storage and distribution contract with Shovel for the Lawrenceville site. On September 12,1986, Shovel executed a second extension to the sales agreement with Giant Eagle. On October 1, 1986, the PLCB sent a “Rough Draft” of the proposed contract. Signature lines for the Budget Secretary and the Comptroller’s signatures appeared on the rough draft. On October 21, 1986, Shovel returned the draft to the PLCB without any changes. On October 30, 1986, Shovel signed a third extension to the sales agreement with Giant Eagle. On October 31, 1986, the PLCB sent Shovel an unsigned copy of the storage and distribution contract, which Mr. Shovel was to sign and return to the PLCB. On November 10, 1986, Shovel <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>returned the executed contract to the PLCB.

In addition, the code states that “the Secretary of Budget and Administration shall develop and publish directives to implement ... such approval.” 4 Pa.Code § 1.332(b).

The Contracting for Services Manual (“Manual”), which was written in compliance with 4 Pa.Code § 1.332, also provides for sole source procurement (I.e. obtaining services from only one contractor without going through the bidding process). In the instant case, the head of the PLCB was confident that the contract should not be let out for bidding because logistical feasibility studies performed by the Department of General Services concluded that the location was not ripe for bidding. R.R. at 448a, 450a, 452a-454a. The Manual provides that where “the selected contractor is the only one capable of providing the services....

In the instant case, following the execution of the original sales agreement with Giant Eagle for the warehouse, Shovel executed three separate amendments to the original agreement to ensure that closing on the property would occur only after it had secured the contract. In a letter dated November 17, 1986 from the PLCB to Shovel, seven days after Shovel’s return of the executed agreement, the PLCB made clear that the storage facility was to be “ready for receipt of PLCB merchandise on Wednesday, February 4, 1987.” It was only following this letter, on November 20, 1986, that Shovel consummated the purchase of the Giant Eagle building. Thus, at the very least, as of November 17, 1986, the parties intended to be bound by the terms of the contract.</p>

The lower tribunals found this letter to be evidence of Shovel’s intent not to be bound until all the signatures were affixed. However, contrary to that finding, it is clear from the letter that Shovel believed an enforceable contract existed, intended to perform thereon, and was merely making it clear that it was having difficulty obtaining financing for the facility in the absence of a fully signed document.
