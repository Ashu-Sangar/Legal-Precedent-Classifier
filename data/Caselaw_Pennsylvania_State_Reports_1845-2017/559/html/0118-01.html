T.J. would enter convenience stores and take food out of the stores for which she had not paid, claiming that Christ had told her to feed the people of the world. On other occasions she claimed she was Christ. Her sleep patterns became erratic. Also, she claimed that unknown persons were poisoning her food; her resultant refusal to eat had caused her to lose approximately thirty pounds in a one month period.</p>

In the application, they expressed concern for T.J.’s well-being as well as for the safety of her three children. On that same day, T.J. was examined by a psychiatrist at Misericordia Hospital (“Hospital”) who conclud<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>ed that T.J. was severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment.

At that time, the attorney for the MH/MR attempted to introduce additional evidence of T.J.’s mental incapacity. This alleged conduct, however, had not been noted in the original 303 petition. The review officer did not allow this additional information into evidence. The review officer ultimately determined that there was insufficient evidence to establish that T.J. was in need of involuntary treatment and thus ordered her discharged.</p>

The trial court quashed this petition on January 7, 1997. The court later rescinded this order, however, apparently on the basis that T.J.’s motion to quash had not been served on MH/MR. On February 5, 1997, the trial court denied MH/MR’s petition on the merits.</p>
    <p id="b197-4" data-blocks='[["BL_197.6",197,[255,650,1153,623]]]'>MH/MR filed an appeal with the Superior Court. T.J. filed a motion to quash alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that MH/MR had no right of review from a decision by a review officer discharging a patient from involuntary commitment. The Superior Court agreed with T.J. on this point, finding that MH/MR lacked standing. The Superior Court rested its opinion on two bases. First, the Superior Court found that the Mental Health Procedures Act (“MHPA”), 50 P.S. § 7101 <em>et seq. </em>did not specifically provide that the MH/MR had the right to seek review of a discharge petition with the trial court. Thus, the Superior Court reasoned, the legislature had not granted standing to MH/MR.</p>

The court stated that for a party to be “aggrieved,” it must have: “1) a substantial interest in the subject matter of the litigation; 2) the party’s interest must be direct; and, 3) the interest must be immediate and not a remote consequence of the action.” <em>Beers v. Commonwealth, Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa/534/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="534 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="1839638" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0605-01">534 Pa. 605</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="534 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="1839638" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0605-01">633 A.2d 1158</a> (1993). The Superior Court applied this test and determined that MH/MR was not “aggrieved” and therefore lacked standing to pursue this matter. In arriving at this conclusion, the Superior Court placed great emphasis on its understanding that MH/MR did not have a “close and personal connection” to T.J.; that T.J.’s, and not MH/MR’s, liberty interests were involved; and finally, that only T.J. and not MH/MR had any interest in this proceeding.

Although the Superior Court <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>briefly mentioned at the outset of its opinion that MH/MR had been created by the legislature to treat mental patients and protect the mental patients from harming themselves and others, it did not take the legislatively mandated purpose of MH/MR into account when it conducted its standing analysis.</p>

One of her primary arguments in support of this position is that “government appeals are inherently moot because virtually every involuntary commitment resulting from a successful government appeal would be based upon stale evidence....” Appellee’s brief at 1. T.J.’s argument is alluding to the fact that the legislature has dictated that the evidence used to support the finding that a person’s mental illness has rendered her a “clear and present danger,” and is thus “mentally disabled,” must refer to events that had occurred within the past thirty days. 50 P.S. § 7301.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> T.J. asserts that this thirty day requirement was the legislature’s <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>way of “balancing] a person’s liberty [interest] and society’s right to provide timely involuntary treatment....” Appellee’s brief at 16.</p>

Yet, the possibility that a governmental petition for review or appeal could be mooted out is simply unrelated to the issue of the government’s standing. These two issues are separate concerns, and the determination of one question in no fashion controls the outcome of the other. To be sure, there may be matters where the government’s application is not timely acted upon, either because the judicial review process is protracted<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> or simply because the information on which the original petition was based becomes stale.

The court in <em>J.S. </em>utilized this self-same language from § 7109—which is applicable to the hearing conducted in <em>J.S. </em>as well as the hearing conducted in the matter <em>sub </em>judice—as the basis for its determination regarding the effect of a mental health review officer’s order. <em>In re: J.S., </em><a href="/pa-commw/142/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="597 A.2d 750" data-case-ids="1421185" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/142/0493-01">597 A.2d at 752</a>. We therefore find that reliance on <em>J.S. </em>to be apt. We further note that since the mental health review <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>officer’s determination is not a final order, then the trial court’s review of it would be in the nature of <em>de novo.</em>

In my view, the General Assembly acted deliberately in explicitly providing the person made subject to treatment with a right to petition for review when a mental health review officer certifies that a further period of commitment is warranted, without providing a similar right to the county agency or anyone else to petition for review of a denial of such certification, which results in the person’s release.</p>
    <p id="b202-9" data-blocks='[["BL_202.10",202,[202,1240,1160,531]]]'>The involuntary commitment process of the Mental Health Procedures Act is designed to permit quick decisions about whether individuals pose a danger to themselves or others, while ensuring that they are deprived of their liberty for the shortest period necessary. Allowing court review where the officer’s decision results in a continued deprivation of liberty, and requiring that the review be expeditious, is consistent with these purposes. See 50 P.S. § 7303(g). Allowing the agency to appeal a decision directing that the person be discharged, however, runs directly counter to these purposes.</p>

J. was in fact discharged in accordance with the review officer’s direction. Moreover, the majority studiously avoids deciding the significant question of whether an agency could continue to detain an individual for involuntary treatment while its appeal of a discharge order was pending. Nevertheless, I believe consideration of the practical consequences of granting agency standing is <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>necessary, and reveals the inadequacy of the majority’s analysis.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[263,435,1151,949]]]'>If the individual is discharged while the agency’s appeal goes forward, the “substantial interest” the majority attributes to the agency as the predicate for standing, i.e., “ensuring that a mental health patient who has been involuntarily committed is not erroneously discharged,” opinion at 482, is illusory. It therefore appears implicit in the majority’s rationale that an agency <em>must </em>be able to continue involuntarily detention while the appeal of the discharge order is pending. Since even under the most expeditious of circumstances such an appeal could not be concluded so as to allow for the individual’s timely release in the event the discharge is affirmed, the agency can accomplish its end, continued detention, by indirection, and the individual can win only a hollow victory by prevailing in the appeal. This possibility seems to me to be entirely at odds with the policy that the Act be “interpreted in conformity with the principles of due process” and that “the least restrictions consistent with adequate treatment be employed.” <em>50 </em>P.S. § 7102.</p>
    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[265,1412,1151,522]]]'>Even if standing were based on another “substantial interest” that is not inconsistent with the individual’s being released while the appeal is pending, this would in effect give the agency a blanket exemption from the mootness doctrine, under the “capable of repetition yet apt to evade review” rubric. As in this case, by the time a final order was entered it would have no application to the parties before the court. Every decision arising out of an agency appeal of a discharge order would be an advisory opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> I am not persuaded that such a course is either necessary or advisable.</p>

The majority indicates that “since the mental health review officer’s determination is not a final order, then the trial court’s review of it would be in the nature of de novo.” Opinion at 480 n. 1. Reliance on <em>In re J.S., </em>142 Pa.Cmwlth. 493, <a href="/pa-commw/142/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="597 A.2d 750" data-case-ids="1421185" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/142/0493-01">597 A.2d 750</a> (1991), is misplaced, however, since that case dealt with proceedings under sections 304 and 305 of the Act, not section 303, which is involved here. Section 304 provides for <em>court ordered </em>involuntary treatment for periods of up to ninety days either as an extension of a commitment, see 50 P.S. § 7304(b), or as an initial commitment, see 50 P.S. § 7304(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Section 7304(e) provides that hearings on such petitions may be conducted by a judge or a mental health review officer, but since the statute speaks of a court order, the review officer’s conclusions in this context can only be advisory to the court, hence interlocutory.</p>

Although the statute provides that such informal hearing or conference may be conducted by either a judge or a mental health review officer, 50 P.S. § 7303(b), in this context the review officer acts not as a <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>“master” making recommendations to the court but as an official authorized to make the certification, and the decision is “final” not interlocutory.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

The common pleas court accepted the agency’s argument that the review officer had erred, but in its remand order stated, "It is not the intention of this Court by its order to direct the commitment of J.S. if she is not currently an in hospital [sic] patient and has no need to be committed.” <em><a href="/pa/526/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="526 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1825967" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0418-01">Id.</a> </em>at 912 n. 4.

It is significant that in cases where section 304 proceedings are initiated for someone not already in involuntary treatment, the Act specifies that "Involuntary treatment shall not be authorized during the pendency of a petition except in accordance with section 302 or section 303.” 50 P.S. § 7304(c)(6). To my mind this demonstrates the legislature’s intent that individuals not be detained while proceedings to place them in involuntary treatment for extended periods are conducted. It would be anomalous if a person subjected to involuntary treatment under section 302 and then section 303 were allowed to be detained while an order discharging him was appealed, and a person who was the subject of a section 304 proceeding could not be detained while that proceeding was conducted.</p>
