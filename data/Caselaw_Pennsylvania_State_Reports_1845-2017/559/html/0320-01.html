The apartment belonged to Agnes McClinchey, Gribble’s mother, who had <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>given Appellant and Gribble permission to stay there while she went to visit a Mr. Ed Paduski.

An employee of the pizza shop observed Mr. Eleftheriou remove a large roll of money from his pocket and give Appellant some money. Appellant and Mr. Eleftheriou then made arrangements to meet later that evening. After closing the pizza shop at approximately 1:00 a.m. on November 12,1992, Mr. Eleftheriou left in his car to meet Appellant.</p>

When Mr. Eleftheriou was looking out a window, Appellant admitted that she struck him in the head with a hammer. After Mr. Eleftheriou fell to the floor, Appellant stated that she continued to beat him with the hammer. Appellant claimed that she was motivated to kill Mr. Eleftheriou because he was a “pervert” and had previously sexually assaulted her. Shortly after beating him, Appellant stated that she took Mr. Eleftheriou’s body to the basement, dismembered the body with a hacksaw, and put the body parts in trash bags. She also admitted that she cut off Mr. Eleftheriou’s penis and placed it in a pencil case with the intention of sending it to her father. In her statement, Appellant alleged that she beat and dismembered Mr. Eleftheriou without Gribble’s help or knowledge. However, Appellant maintained that Gribble did help her with disposing the trash bags containing the body parts and stated that she and Gribble dumped the trash bags along Delaware Avenue at some point on November 12, 1992. Later that same evening, Appellant admitted that she and Gribble used Mr. Eleftheriou’s car and credit card to go shopping.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The responding officers found the severed arms of a white male, a human torso with its head missing and a head with the left eye removed. These body parts were later identified as belonging to Mr. Eleftheriou. Among papers strewn around the site, police found a letter addressed to Agnes McClinchey, 3123 Richmond Street.</p>

Appellant told Ms. McClinchey that she and Gribble had “been involved in a murder” and that she had heard a report that the victim’s head had been found on Delaware Avenue. Ms. McClinchey also overheard Appellant tell Gribble to bum Mr. Eleftheriou’s car. When Gribble returned from doing so, Appellant said to him “thank God you didn’t get caught.” At approximately 7:30 p.m. on November 13, 1992, police responded to a report of a car on fire on D Street. After the fire was extinguished, police found body parts in the inside of the car, later identified as belonging to Mr. Eleftheriou.</p>

After interviewing Ms. McClinchey at a near-by gas station, police went to her apartment and arrested Appellant and Gribble at approximately 1:30 a.m. on the morning of November 14,1992. A search of the basement revealed a kitchen knife, a chisel, and a claw hammer, each containing traces of human tissue and blood. Stuffed inside a pipe, police also found a pencil case containing a human eyeball and penis. During questioning at the police station, Appellant and Gribble each gave their <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>separate statements accepting personal responsibility for the murder while attempting to exculpate the other. Appellant and Gribble were each charged with murder, robbery, arson, and a variety of related offenses in connection with the killing of Mr. Eleftheriou.</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[230,603,1162,1060]]]'>Appellant and Gribble were tried jointly. Both waived their right to a jury trial and agreed to be tried before the trial judge. At the bench trial, an assistant medical examiner testified that there were numerous abrasions on Mr. Eleftheriou’s head that were consistent with blows from a hammer. He further testified that one person could not have killed and dismembered the victim in a manner consistent with the physical evidence. According to the medical examiner, red abrasions in the areas where the victim’s head and right arm had been severed indicated that his heart was still beating when these body parts were removed.. In contrast, yellow abrasions in the areas where the remaining body parts had been severed indicated that the victim’s heart had stopped beating by the time those parts were severed. The medical examiner testified that one person working alone would not have been able to remove both the head and the right arm in the estimated fifteen minutes it took before the victim bled to death. After hearing the evidence presented at trial, the trial judge convicted Appellant on all counts, including murder in the first degree, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

New appellate counsel was retained, who represented Appellant on post-verdict motions, which were denied by the trial court on August 11, 1994. Appellate counsel then filed a brief and conducted oral argument on Appellant’s direct appeal to this Court.

However, both case law and Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1101 (“Rule 1101”) have established the general principles underlying the waiver of a jury trial. <em>See also </em>Comment to Pa. R.Crim. P. 354 (waiver of jury trial in a capital prosecution shall be conducted pursuant to Rule 1101). It is well established that a defendant’s waiver of a trial by jury must be knowing, voluntary and intelligent. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

In this vein, Rule 1101 requires a trial judge, through a colloquy on the record, to ascertain whether a defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial before approving such waiver. Before a voluntary waiver may be accepted as knowing and intelligent, the on-record colloquy must show that the defendant fully comprehended the significance of the right being waived and must indicate that, at a minimum, the defendant knew the essential protections inherent in a jury trial as well as the consequences attendant upon a relinquishment of those safeguards. <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court found that it had been presented with sufficient evidence of a premeditated plan to lure Mr. Eleftheriou to the apartment, to rob him and to murder him by smashing his skull with a hammer. First, Appellant noticed that Mr. Eleftheriou was carrying a large roll of cash while at Mr. Eleftheriou's store on the evening of the murder. Testimony from Ms. McClinchey revealed that the tools, determined to be the murder weapons, were normally kept in the basement. Since the hammer was already in the living room when Mr. Eleftheriou was first attacked with it, the trial court concluded that this fact supported the Commonwealth’s theory that the tools had been placed in the living room in anticipation of the attack upon Mr. Eleftheriou. Moreover, the medical examiner testified that, given the physical evidence, the dismemberment of Mr. Eleftheriou's body would have required more than one person.

The Commonwealth asserts that, although Appellant does not allege that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this colloquy at trial, the claim of trial court error has been waived and must, therefore, be reviewed under an ineffectiveness standard. Given our disposition of the issue, it is clear that we agree with the Commonwealth that this claim also fails when reviewed under an ineffectiveness standard. Since trial counsel had no basis for demanding that Appellant’s jury trial waiver colloquy contain information about life-qualification, Appellant’s claim is without arguable merit.

However, we feel compelled to note that the record raises serious doubts regarding counsel’s effectiveness during the penalty phase of Appellant’s trial. Counsel's entire defense presentation during the penalty phase took only four pages to transcribe. He presented virtually no evidence of Appellant's upbringing or background; he did not present any independent mental health evaluations or institutional or other records; he did not call a single witness on Appellant's behalf. Instead, as evidence of mitigation, counsel merely relied on stipulations that Appellant had no history of prior criminal convictions, was the mother of six children, and was a drug user. He failed to present or argue any further evidence of mitigation even though the record itself indicates that other evidence of mitigation was available and known to counsel. Without dissecting all of the arguments presented by both parties, it is difficult to disagree with Appellant that a defense which amasses only four pages of transcript simply does not reflect adequate preparation or development of mitigating evidence by counsel representing a capital defendant in a penally phase hearing. <em>See Commonwealth v.

I believe sufficient evidence exists of record to demonstrate that the waiver was valid; however, I would remand the case to the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether trial counsel’s assertions about informing appellant of her rights were sufficiently credible to support the conclusion that appellant made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver.

In <em>Ingram, </em>this Court adopted a per se approach, similar to the rule advocated by the majority here, and held that a defendant's knowledge and understanding prior to entering a guilty plea was tested solely by the adequacy of the on-the-record guihy plea colloquy. If the colloquy failed to demonstrate that the defendant understood the charge, the guilty plea was deemed invalid. The decision in <em>Ingram </em>was overruled by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Schultz, </em><a href="/pa/505/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="200" data-cite="505 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1788857" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0188-01">505 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="201" data-cite="505 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1788857" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0188-01">477 A.2d 1328</a> (1984).</p>
