    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.6",78,[277,1236,1149,88]]]'>Immediately after giving that instruction, the court continued:</p>

    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[158,618,1150,586]]]'>The court also instructed the jury on the taxicab company’s duty. The instruction provided that the cab company was a common carrier which “owe [d] to its passengers the highest degree of care which is reasonably possible in the circumstances.” The seatbelt instruction, however, did not ask the jury to determine whether the cab company’s failure to install seatbelts breached that duty. Instead, according to the court’s instruction on primary and secondary liability, the jury could have held the cab company liable merely because it concluded that the railroad was negligent.</p>

Obviously, the risk — the probability and the extent of the potential harm — resulting from both the cab company and the railroad’s conduct was identical. Whether the risk created by each was unreasonable depends, therefore, upon the utility of their conduct. A jury could conclude that the risk created by the railroad in failing to utilize a carrier whose vehicles where equipped with seatbelts was unreasonable in light of the expense to the railroad and the accompanying social costs of seeking out such a carrier. On the other hand, the jury could also conclude that the reduction of risk accomplished by the use of seatbelts did not merit the social cost of higher fares or reduced service that may accompany requiring the cab company to install seatbelts in all its cabs.</p>

This opportunity to correct alleged errors at trial advances the orderly and efficient use of our judicial resources. First, appellate courts will not be required to expend time and energy reviewing points on which no trial ruling has been made. Second, the trial court may promptly correct the asserted error. With the issue properly presented, the trial court is more likely to reach a satisfactory result, thus obviating thé need for appellate review on this issue. Or if a new trial is necessary, it may be granted by the trial court without subjecting both the litigants and the courts to the expense and delay inherent in appellate review. Third, appellate courts will be free to more expeditiously dispose of the issues properly preserved for appeal. Finally, the exception requirement will remove the advantage formerly enjoyed by the unprepared trial lawyer who looked to the appellate court to compensate for his trial omissions.”</blockquote>
