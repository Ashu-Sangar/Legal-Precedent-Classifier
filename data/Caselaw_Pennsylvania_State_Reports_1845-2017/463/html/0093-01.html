He left a will dated May 21, 1889, by which he put his residuary estate in trust for the benefit of his family. The trust is to run for a period of twenty-one years beyond the death of the survivor of a group comprising testator’s five children and five grandchildren who were living at his death.</p>

Geoffrey died in 1957 and was survived by a widow and four children — two natural children and two adopted children. The widow’s name was Annette Tripp Tower; the natural children are Charlemagne Tower, IV, and Helen Tripp Tower Brunet; the adopted children are Annette Tower Ragsdale and Tripp Tower, the appellants. The adopted children were Annette’s (Geoffrey’s wife’s) children by a prior marriage. In 1941, Geoffrey legally adopted them as his own.</p>

One-fourth of this became payable to his widow for the period from his death in 1957 to her death in 1959, because under his grandfather’s will he had a power to so appoint and he exercised it. The other three-fourths of Geoffrey’s %sths share, and all of it since his widow’s death in 1959, is payable to his children. The sole issue is whether this income is payable to all four of Geoffrey’s children or only to his two natural children.</p>

      <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>After Geoffrey’s death the trustees filed an account, which was audited in 1960. At that time, the trustees were unaware of the existence of the two adopted children and therefore did not raise the question whether those children were entitled to participate in Geoffrey’s share of income. The Orphans’ Court thus awarded the whole share — less only the part payable to the widow — to the two natural children. Thereafter, the adopted children, being advised of the problem, asked the Orphans’ Court to open the adjudication, and in January 1962 the court entered a decree granting a review for the limited purpose of determining what rights, if any, the adopted children may have in the trust income. Thereafter, Judge Lefever filed a supplemental adjudication in which he ruled that the adopted children were not entitled to take. <em>Tower Estate, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/27/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="27 Pa.

But in <em>Tafel Estate, supra, </em>we eliminated the judicial doctrine that, absent a clear intent to provide for adopted children of beneficiaries other than the testator, the testator is presumed to have excluded such adopted children.

      <em>Reamer’s Estate, supra, </em>is the case which most strongly supports the appellants’ position.

Appellant contended in <em>Reamer's II </em>that there was error manifest upon the face of the record and that she was a party in interest capable of acting as administratrix because she had a statutory right as an adopted child to share in the intestate estate of her aunt. But the rule of law in <em>Reamer’s I </em>which had precluded the niece from relief was characterized in <em>Reamer’s II </em>as “so gross a mistake as to amount to a legal fraud,” and as “but an inconsistent interlude in the law of the subject with which it dealt.” <em>Reamer’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/331/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="331 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1184310" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0113-01">331 Pa. at 123-124</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%2035" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="200 A. 35">200 A. at 38</a>.

We are not convinced that <em>Tower I </em>contains any error of law in light of <em>Tafel. Tower I </em>was based upon a finding of clear intent by the testator to exclude adopted children. <em>Tafel </em>announced a new rule that this Court would no longer rely solely on the use of words like “child” and “children” to find an intent to exclude adopted children. But Tower’s Will contains more than just passing references to “children” or “grandchildren,” and testator’s intent is clear beyond question. It is replete with the words “children,” “grandchildren,” “issue” and “lineal descendants” used in a methodical, precisely-drawn instrument which clearly illustrates that the bounty of the trust was to be confined to bloodlines only. We there concluded from a reading of the instrument as a whole that Charlemagne Tower displayed the requisite intent to exclude adopted children. <em>Tafel </em>held that, unless a contrary intention is expressed, the presumption arises that the testator intended to include adopted children. Nowhere is it stated that such a contrary intention must be <em>explicit. </em>The intent of the testator, explicit or naturally inferable from his language, is still the polestar of every will. Although words like “issue” and “children” will ordinarily trigger the <em>Tafel </em>presumption, in some instances, as in Tower’s Will, these words may be used in such a context as to negate the necessity of relying upon the presumption.</p>
