The pertinent sections of the will provided for identical trusts for each of his six children except that the three sons were to receive distribution of principal at age thirty-five while the daughters were to receive no distribution of principal. On the death of the life tenant daughters the principal was to be distributed to the “children of her” living at the death of the life tenant or, if none, to the <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>“issue” then living of any deceased child of the life tenant. Emma Bell Baxter, one of the daughters of the testator, died on June 16, 1965. Mrs. Baxter had no natural children and was survived only by her legally adopted son, Edward A. Baxter, the present appellant. Edward was adopted before the death of the testator.</p>

In that appeal, the question of the intent of Samuel R. Bell was before this Court. Our per curiam affirmance in <em>Bell I </em>must be interpreted by implication to hold either (1) the intent of Samuel Bell was clear to the effect that adopted children were to be excluded from the distributive scheme of the testamentary trust, or (2) that the testator expressed no intent in regard to adopted children and that, therefore, the now defunct presumption arose that testator intended to exclude adopted children from the distributive scheme.</p>

Baxter again petitioned the Orphans’ Court for a review of its earlier decision in the same matter, alleging errors of law which would permit review pursuant to Section 3521 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.S. § 3521, since his petition was filed within five years of the decision of this Court. None of the principal, which would be payable to Edward A. Baxter if he succeeded here, has yet been distributed.</p>

Although this Court and others are often compelled to overrule prior decisions, such action cannot become a signal for the re-agitation of the overruled cause of action. Litigation must come to a conclusive end and accounts must at some point be at rest. The state’s interest in the finality of litigation is more than merely an attempt to clear the dockets.
