He also told the police the gun used was hidden in some bushes. These admissions were then reduced to a written statement, which Palmer signed. The interview session ended at 10:30 a.m. and Palmer was then left alone to rest. About 11:30 a.m., Palmer agreed to a polygraph examination. Upon its completion, Palmer spoke to his father and then told the police that the gun was really hidden in his home. The meeting ended at 2:10 p.m. For the next hour and a half Palmer ate and rested. This respite was interrupted with a second reading of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the taking of another written statement. It was identical to the first statement except for averments concerning the gun’s disposal. This statement was completed and signed at 5:52 p.m., when Palmer was permitted to rest for another hour. He then accompanied the police to his home where the gun was secured. Upon returning and resting another hour, the police repeated the <em>Miranda </em>warnings once again and Palmer gave a third written statement, which he also signed. It described the trip to his home and was completed at 8:45 p.m. Following a meal, all three statements were read and recorded on tape. Palmer was then left alone until approximately 12:30 a.m. on May 21st, at which time he was slated and taken to a cell room where he was later arraigned. In all, eighteen hours had elapsed between the arrest and the time he was taken to the cell room for arraignment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

What is clear, however, is that during this two hour interval the police did not question Palmer. Moreover, once the questioning began, Palmer’s <em>Miranda </em>warnings were immediately given. Further, within twenty minutes after the questioning began and just two and one-half hours after his arrest, Palmer confessed to the shooting. Under these circumstances, we cannot find Palmer’s first statement to be a product of the delay. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

It contained the same averments as the first statement, with the only difference being a reference to the disposition of the weapon. This, however, merely constituted an embellishment of the first statement’s admission that Palmer used a gun. That fact already admitted, the second statement was in essence a reiteration of the first. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>Finally, there was no error in admitting into evidence the gun and the third written statement. The statement, while not being recorded until fourteen hours after Palmer’s arrest, added no new facts to those already properly admitted into evidence. It merely described the trip to his home in search of the gun. Moreover, the actual recovery of the gun was not crucial since Palmer in his initial statement admitted having fired it at the decedent. Thus, even assuming the gun and statement were products of an “unnecessary delay”, their admission constituted harmless error.</p>

Following commencement of the afternoon session, defense counsel made a motion for a mistrial. He averred that at the close of the morning session, the trial judge asked to confer with him, first at sidebar and later in chambers. The assistant district attorney was not invited to participate. In chambers the trial judge allegedly <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> “suggested that [defense counsel] have [his] client plead and, whether the decision was voluntary manslaughter or second degree, [the trial judge] would still insist that the defendant get a minimum of no less than five and a half <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>years.” Defense counsel stated he would not recommend such a plea or sentence to his client.

    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[153,563,1149,748]]]'>Based on these alleged facts, Palmer argues that the rationale prohibiting a judge from participation in plea bargaining as enunciated in <em>Commonwealth v. Evans, </em><a href="/pa/434/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="434 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1922661" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0052-01">434 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20A.2d%20689" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="252 A.2d 689">252 A.2d 689</a> (1969), is instantly applicable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> We do not agree. In <em>Commonwealth v. Evans, </em>supra, the sole issue was whether it was proper for a trial judge to participate in plea bargaining. Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for the Court,, stated that “such a procedure is not consistent with due process and ... a plea entered on the basis of a sentencing agreement in which the judge participates cannot be considered voluntary”. <em>Commonwealth v. Evans, </em>supra at 54, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20A.2d%20689" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="252 A.2d 689">252 A.2d at 690</a>. This position was reaffirmed in <em>Commonwealth v.

Sanutti, </em>supra, opposing counsel met with the trial judge in chambers specifically to discuss a potential guilty plea. As in this case, there was no record of the conference. However, opposing counsel stipulated that a guilty plea was discussed and the trial judge made no commitment. Sanutti then plead guilty. When a one to five year sentence was imposed, he attacked the validity of the plea as not being knowing and intelligent. In denying relief, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Pomeroy, delineated the term “participation” as used in <em>Commonwealth v. Evans, </em>supra. <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>“ ‘Participation’, in the sense there used, denotes some active role in discussion or negotiation relative to a plea.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Instantly, we assume the trial judge did take an active role in the discussion of a potential plea. Nonetheless, neither the mandate of <em>Evans </em>or <em>Sanutti </em>is applicable. Those decisions safeguard a defendant’s due process rights during all stages of plea bargaining. Their purpose is to insure voluntary and intelligent pleas. These considerations are not present today. Herein, there was neither a plea bargain nor a guilty plea. Nor was the jury ever informed that the conversation had taken place.</p>
    <p id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[254,1006,1149,690]]]'>Nonetheless, Palmer urges us to extend the <em>Evans </em>rationale to the instant facts because of the potential dangers inherent in this type of situation. He asserts that a judge’s participation in discussions concerning the possibility of a plea is likely to compromise his neutrality when a defendant does not adopt a judge’s suggestion to plead guilty because, as a result, evidentiary issues may not be objectively ruled upon and a jury may not receive fair instructions. In addition, subtle prejudicial actions could occur and go undetected. But most significantly, Palmer voices concern that a penalty via a higher sentence will be imposed on those defendants rejecting the judge’s recommendation.</p>
    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[252,1745,1149,576]],["BL_69.1",69,[149,259,1148,478]]]'>All of the aforementioned circumstances, however, go to judicial misconduct and are not so interwoven with the due process considerations of plea bargaining as to require an application of the <em>Evans </em>rationale. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Dickerson, </em><a href="/pa/449/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="449 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="1945620" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0070-01">449 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=295%20A.2d%20282" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="295 A.2d 282">295 A.2d 282</a> (1972). Palmer’s assignment of error must, therefore, be denied unless he can demonstrate some actual prejudice. He has failed to do so. The allegation that a higher sentence was imposed because he did not plead guilty is not supported by Palmer’s own version of the conference. He admits a maximum sentence was not discussed, <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>and that no threat was made to impose a higher sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In addition, it is significant to note that Palmer does not claim' the trial judge was prejudiced against him; that anything occurred prejudicing him before the jury; or that the province of the jury was invaded in any way. These factors, plus a careful review of the record, convince us that Palmer’s trial comported with due process standards and, as a result, a just sentence was imposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

A request, however, to have the testimony stricken was refused. Palmer claims the lower court’s ruling was error because the testimony was highly prejudicial in that therefrom the jury could conclude his father believed him guilty. Even assuming this is so, the incident does not require a new trial. As we have often <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>noted, “ ‘ [e] very unwise or irrelevant remark made in the course of a trial by a judge, a witness, or counsel does not compel the granting of a new trial’ ”.

Palmer’s argument that the instant delay was unnecessary is premised on the assumption that for purposes of Pa.R.Crim.P. 118, the applicable time period is between arrest and arraignment. This analysis is incorrect. The crucial period is between arrest and the securing of a confession. Any delay after the confession does not taint the admissibility of the confession.

However, the trial judge posited a different version in his opinion denying post trial motions. Therein, he asserted that only in response to defense counsel’s complaint that a lengthy trial might interfere with his future travel plans did he suggest “that counsel speak not to his client, but to the assistant district attorney regarding a plea to second degree murder.” Upon defense counsel’s inquiry as to a potential sentence, the trial judge replied that a second degree murder conviction would receive no less than a five and one-half year sentence.</p>
