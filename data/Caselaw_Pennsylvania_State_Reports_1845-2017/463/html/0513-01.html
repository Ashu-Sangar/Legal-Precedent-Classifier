Act of May 27, 1921, P.L. 1198, §§ 1-11, 52 P.S. §§ 661-71. It was there decided that plaintiffs would bring suit as “persons with a special interest may have public nuisances abated at their own suit;” as private persons “moving the court to enforce a general rule of public policy, intended for the protection of the whole community, <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>rather than as acting simply for their own protection;” and as private attorneys general. <a href="/pa/274/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="274 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="1072836" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0489-01">274 Pa. at 502-03</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.%20491" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="118 A. 491">118 A. at 495</a>. The Act of July 2, 1937, P.L. 2787, 52 P.S, § 1407 et seq. was construed to allow enforcement by private persons seeking injunctive relief and damages as well. <em>See Klein v. Republic Steel Corporation, </em><a href="/f2d/435/0762-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="435 F.2d 762" data-case-ids="2216575" data-case-paths="/f2d/435/0762-01">435 F.2d 762</a> (3d Cir., 1970). The Act of September 20, 1961, P.L. 1538, 52 P.S. §§ 672.1-1,0 (1964) permits the property owner to sue for damages in a civil proceeding. Thus, considering this background, it is logical that the 1966 Act evolved with similar provisions for private remedies. The 1966 Act provides absolute support for existent structures as enumerated in Section 1406.4. In regard to structures erected subsequent to the effective date of the Act, Section 1406.15 sets forth specific detailed procedures to be followed by those who desire to acquire surface support rights. That provision declares that anyone desiring to acquire such support who “shall not take advantage of the provisions of this section shall have no recourse under law for any damage caused by subsidence resulting from coal mining operations.” The section expressly sets forth an exclusive administrative procedure to be followed under those circumstances. It is apparent that where the Legislature desired to provide an exclusive administrative remedy within the Act it did so explicitly. Nor does a fair reading of the Act as a whole reveal any intention on the part of the Legislature to restrict the avenues of redress afforded the property owner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Further, since the purpose of the statute is remedial and the statute is to be construed liberally “such as will best effectuate that purpose,” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> to imply a restriction where none is expressed would be inconsistent with the clear language and spirit of the statute. We believe <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>the chancellor was correct when he stated that the property owner has the distinct alternative of availing himself of the administrative procedure under Section 1406.-6, in which the Department of Environmental Resources can certify non-payment of damages and the Attorney General at his discretion can enter suit in the Common Pleas Court, or the property owner may go directly to court himself.</p>
    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[156,776,1155,1026]]]'>Generally, where the Legislature provides a statutory remedy which is mandatory and exclusive, equity is without power to act. A jurisdictional question within the meaning of the Act of March 5, 1925, P.L. 23, § 1, 12 P.S. § 672 is then presented. However, no jurisdictional issue is presented where a statutory remedy is permissive or alternative or where a traditional equity principle such as the existence of an adequate remedy at law would call for equity to withhold an exercise of jurisdiction. <em>Redding v. Atlantic City Electric Company, </em><a href="/pa/440/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="440 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="1932342" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0533-01">440 Pa. 533</a>, 536, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20680" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="269 A.2d 680">269 A.2d 680</a>, 682 (1970). We must conclude that the Legislature has not made appeal to the Department of Environmental Resources the exclusive and mandatory procedure for redress under the Act but has given the remedy as a permissive one for the purpose of assisting the property owner in seeking compensation and relief. Therefore, no jurisdictional question within the Act of 1925 is raised. <em>See Redding v. Atlantic City Electric Company, supra.</em>

Enforcement of the Act by private parties here only furthers the interest which the Commonwealth has in protecting the public interest declared in the Act. Furthermore, a final decree awarding damages or injunctive relief as to these parties would require no action on the part of the Commonwealth nor cause it detriment. The chancellor correctly observed the Commonwealth’s status here:</p>
