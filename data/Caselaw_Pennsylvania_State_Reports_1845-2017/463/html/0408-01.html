The statute proscribes the pointing of “a gun, pistol or <em>other firearm </em>at any other person.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

Judge Spaeth wrote an opinion in support of reversal which was joined by Judge Hoffman and Judge Cercone. In his opinion Judge Spaeth said:</p>

The statute proscribes pointing ‘a <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>gun, pistol, or other firearm . . . .’ Accordingly, it is not a crime to point a B-B gun unless it is a ‘firearm’. This is so as a matter of grammar; ‘other’ modifies ‘gun’ and ‘pistol’. It is also so as a matter of legal precedent, as may be seen from <em>Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Comm., </em><a href="/pa-super/119/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="119 Pa.

    <blockquote id="b444-7" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[292,1439,1108,674]]]'>“The question, therefore, is not whether appellant pointed a B-B gun that was a ‘gun’ or ‘pistol’ but whether he pointed a B-B gun that was a ‘firearm’, and the answer is that he did not, because a B-B gun is not, and cannot be, a ‘firearm’. The statute does not define ‘firearm’. (Footnote omitted.) When a statute does not define a word, the word is to be understood according to its ‘common and approved usage’. 1 Pa. S. § 1903 (a). The common and approved usage of ‘firearm’ is ‘a weapon from which a shot is discharged by gunpowder.’ Webster’s Third International Dictionary 854 (1961).”</blockquote>

We know, however, that the definition of firearm may not be necessarily limited to those weapons from which a shot is dispersed by gunpowder alone. Weapons using some propellant other than gunpowder might also be properly classified as a firearm. Those activated by mechanical means such as springs, however, are not firearms within the statute.</p>
