Immediately following announcement of his verdict the trial judge imposed sentence on the robbery conviction of not less than six years nor more than twenty years in prison; sentence on the firearms conviction was suspended. No post-verdict motions were filed prior to sentencing. From the judgment on the robbery verdict, the appellee took an appeal to the Superior Court in which he argued that three alleged errors required a new trial. The assignments of error were: (1) that his waiver of trial by jury had been improperly accepted; (2) that the trial judge obtained knowledge during the trial of Carter’s prior criminal record; and (3) that Carter had been denied the effective assistance of trial counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Superior Court reversed the judgment of sentence and remanded the case for a new trial on the first ground — ineffective waiver of jury trial. This holding was considered necessary because of a violation of Rule 1101 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> in that no written jury trial waiver was in-<a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>eluded in the record.

    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[181,460,1155,1028]]]'>Of primary importance in our disposition of this appeal is the effect of the appellee’s failure to file motions in arrest of judgment or for a new trial. The making of post-verdict motions allows the trial court the first opportunity to pass upon claims of error in the proceeding before it. If that court grants the requested relief, an appeal may have been avoided; if the relief sought is denied, appellate courts will have the benefit not only of the arguments of the parties but also of the lower court’s opinion on the issues raised. See Rule 56 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. Thus, post-verdict motions promote judicial economy and the orderly administration of the appellate process. It is for these reasons that, as a rule, issues not raised by way of post-verdict motions in the trial court will not be considered on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.
