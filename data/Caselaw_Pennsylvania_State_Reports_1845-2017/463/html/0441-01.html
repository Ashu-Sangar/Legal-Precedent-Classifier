[Merck] as a chemical operator from January 21, 1952, until August 23, 1966. In his employment, Dunn handled approximately forty-seven different chemicals in various concentrations and combinations in the preparation of medicines. In his petition, Dunn alleged that, as a result of exposure to and inhalation of these chemicals, he had become totally disabled by pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema and, therefore, qualified for compensation under Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This subsection provides, in pertinent part, that the term occupational disease shall include “other occupational diseases (1) to which the claimant is exposed by reason of his employment, and (2) which are peculiar to the industry or occupation, and (3) which are not common to the provisions of Section 108 (n) of the general population.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Referee determined that Dunn, by reason of his exposure to toxic fumes, dusts and solvents while in Merck’s employ, had become totally and permanently disabled on August 23, 1966, due to pulmonary fibrosis with superimposed pulmonary emphysema. Merck then appealed to the Workmen’s Compensation Board which, without taking further testimony, on May 18, <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>1972, reversed the award by the Referee and dismissed Dunn’s claim.

However, after a close analysis of the testimony taken before the Referee, the Board determined that Dunn had failed to prove the existence of pulmonary fibrosis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Because the Board assumed that pulmonary emphysema, by itself, would not constitute an occupational disease within the meaning of Section 108(n),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> it failed to discuss whether Dunn had proved the existence of pulmonary emphysema; nor did it discuss whether Dunn’s pulmonary emphysema was caused by his employment with Merck. Dunn then filed an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas of Northumberland County and his appeal was dismissed.</p>

      <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a> An appeal was then taken to the Commonwealth Court.

Prior to <em>Utter, </em>case law had decreed that diseases which were common to the general population could not be considered as compensable occupational diseases under the provisions of Section 108 (n), even if the disease were caused by the claimant’s employment. See <em>e. g., Perez v.

As noted previously, the Board was under the misconception that pulmonary emphysema could not be an occupational disease under Section 108 (n). Therefore, the Board deemed it unnecessary to decide whether Dunn had proved the existence of pulmonary emphysema. Nor, by natural consequence, did the Board consider whether Dunn’s pulmonary emphysema was demonstrated by him to be peculiar to his occupation by its “causes and the characteristics of its manifestation”. The Commonwealth Court’s determinations in this regard, based upon a tabula rosa, were patently improper.</p>

We have independently reviewed the record and have determined the Board’s conclusion that Dunn failed to prove the existence of pulmonary fibrosis is supported by competent evidence. In addition, we note that under Section 423 of The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, 77 P.S. § 1523, the Board remains the ultimate factfinder and may disregard the findings of fact of the Referee in all cases. This provision stands in contradistinction to Section 423 of The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 854 (amendment effective May 1, 1972) which provides that, in workmen’s compensation cases, the ultimate fact-finding responsibility rests with the Referee <em>unless </em>the Board chooses to hear new evidence.
