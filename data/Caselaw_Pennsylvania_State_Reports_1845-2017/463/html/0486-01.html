At the heart of the present contro<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>versy is appellants’ challenge to the abatement of certain real property specifically devised to appellants in the residuary clause of decedent Ealph H. Mathay’s will and to the application of such property to the marital deduction gift bequeathed to decedent’s surviving spouse. Appellants contend that the surviving spouse’s priority and the abatement of their devise resulted from erroneous computation of the Federal Estate Tax Marital Deduction, incorrect interpretation of decedent’s will, misapplication of the Pennsylvania law of abatement and overfunding of a support annuity.

In return, Hazel promised that she would vacate the Mathay household and remove certain household goods from an apartment belonging to the decedent. Further, and of particular concern in the present controversy, decedent agreed that he would pay his ex-wife the sum of $200 per month during her life “for her support, maintenance and general use” with the commitment to be binding on decedent’s executors and administrators.</p>

Stated otherwise, the surviving spouse must be taxed on a pro rata basis before the appellants’ devise can abate. The Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of June 1961, P.L. 373, § 718, 72 Pa.

In the Smith case, the Florida District Court considered whether a claim by a decedent’s widow that was based on a separation agreement incident to a Florida divorce action instituted by the husband was deductible. The Commissioner claimed that an ex-wife could give up no rights in consideration for transfers from her husband since under Florida law a wife against whom a divorce is granted cannot recover alimony. The Florida District Court, although recognizing the merit of this argument, concluded that since the Smith divorce resulted from collusion the preceding Florida law was inapplicable. Had the proper party, i.e. the wife, who was a resident of Ohio, been the plaintiff in the Florida divorce action, or <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>had she instituted a divorce action in Ohio where alimony is allowed, she would have had support rights.

In this case, monthly sums to be paid to the wife until her death or remarriage in accordance with a separation agreement were held to be exchanged for full and adequate consideration in “money or money’s worth.” However, in construing the separation agreement, the Court applied the law of Georgia which permits permanent alimony after divorce until the wife remarries.</p>

Where there is a statutory duty to support, the question of whether the amount of the claimed deduction is in excess of the wife’s “reasonable support rights” also arises. Thus, in such cases it must be determined 1) whether the entire claim represents relinquished support; and 2) if the support payments are to “continue beyond the period of joint-lives, . . . whether the lifetime payments were less than that to which the wife would have been entitled' under State law.” Rev.Rul. 71-<a href="/citations/?q=67%20I.R.B.%201971" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="67 I.R.B. 1971">67 I.R.B. 1971</a>-16, 37.</p>
