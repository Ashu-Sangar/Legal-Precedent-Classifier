We base our conclusion upon a consideration of the relevant factors spelled out by the legislature to afford guidance to the courts in the ascertainment of the legislative intent when a statute is ambiguous.

Section 1002 authorized the Auditor General to appoint a chief counsel and such deputy counsels as he deems necessary to provide him necessary legal assistance, 71 P.S. § 312. Section 1003 spelled out the powers and duties of the chief counsel to include: (1) the rendering of legal advice to the Auditor General regarding the powers or performance of his duties; (2) the supervision of the legal affairs of the Auditor General; and (3) the representation of the Auditor General in litigation to which the Auditor General may be a party, or in which he is permitted or required by law to intervene. 71 P.S. § 313. Simultaneously, the legislature excepted the Department of the Auditor General from the requirements of receiving and following legal advice from, and representation in litigation by the Department of Justice. See the Administrative Code, Section 512, 71 P.S. Section 192; Section 902, 71 P.S. Section 292; Section 903(b), 71 P.S. Section 293(b); Section 906, 71 P.S. Section 296. In enacting these amendments, the legislature was acting against a historical background of an 1840 statute expressly authorizing the Auditor General to sue to collect an indebtedness owed the Commonwealth; repeal of this statute in 1915, and the enactment of an Administrative Code in 1929 placing the authority exclusively in the Attorney <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>General and the Department of Justice.

Prior to the 1970 amendments to the Administrative Code, it would have been beyond argument, impossible for the Auditor General to bring suit in his own name, rather than through the Department of Justice. Therefore, the legislature must have intended the language “to cause such sums to be recovered” to mean to refer the matter to the Department of Justice for collection. There is certainly no indication in the instant appropriation act that the legislature intended the language in question to carry any other meaning than that which it had to have meant prior to the 1970 amendments. Thus, we feel, if the legislature, in the instant appropriations act, had intended to authorize the Auditor General <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>to bring suit, it surely would have chosen different language to express this change.</p>

In those cases relied upon by the Auditor General for the proposition that a public officer has implied authority to sue in order to effectuate his duties, there was no other available remedy or other proper party-plaintiff to bring suit. In the instant case, there is a comprehensive statutory scheme for the organization of the Executive Department. Under this scheme, as we interpret it, the Attorney General and the Department of Justice alone are empowered to collect debts due the Commonwealth.
