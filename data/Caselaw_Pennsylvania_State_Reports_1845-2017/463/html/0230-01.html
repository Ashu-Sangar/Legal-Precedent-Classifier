Here, on the contrary, the claim is that the account never had such an effect, and that therefore the condition of Sec. 241 of the Act, requiring that the death of a joint tenant have the legal effect of conferring upon the surviving tenant or tenants a right which they did not previously have, does not apply. As we read it, the statute mandates that property must be held by two or more persons, ‘. . .so <em>that, </em>upon the death of one of them, the survivor or survivors have a right to the immediate ownership or <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>possession and enjoyment of the whole property.’ (Emphasis supplied.) The death of decedent had no legal effect whatever upon the ownership of, or any rights to, the funds in this account, as Lois H. Brownback owned and possessed all of them continuously, both before and after the joint account had been opened. . . . Therefore, ‘the death of one of’ the joint tenants did not result in the transfer of any money or rights to Lois H. Brownback. It is true that the Supreme Court has stated that ownership principles are not wholly determinative of taxability, and clearly the Act is not drafted in strict terms of absolute ownership. However, contrary to the contention of the Commonwealth, we do not think that the footnote (no. 4) at p. 485 in <em>Olson Est. . . . </em>means that joint accounts which are purely for the convenience of the creator, and which are proven to be such by clear, precise and convincing evidence as in the present case, are nevertheless taxable. Until our Supreme Court does so hold specifically, thus entirely eliminating the issue of convenience accounts from inheritance tax law, we cannot find that a transfer occurs where the original owner of an account makes it joint for his own convenience solely and then survives his co-tenant, having never allowed the co-tenant any rights in or power over the account.”</p>
