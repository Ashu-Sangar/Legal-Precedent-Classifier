On May 18, appellant wrote to the clerk of courts inquiring when his case would be retried. On May 24, a letter was mailed to appellant informing him of the June 18 trial date. Shortly before the case was due to come to trial, the Commonwealth discovered that appellant was incarcerated in Leavenworth and could not be obtained without 60 to 90 days notice. It then initiated proceedings to regain custody of appellant and obtained a new trial date in September. On August 7, appellant moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to afford him a speedy retrial. This motion was denied and appellant was brought to trial on September 24, 1973, 248 days after we reversed his prior conviction.</p>

Appellant was entitled to assume that the Commonwealth would proceed promptly until events showed otherwise. Moreover, on May 18, he wrote to the clerk of courts inquiring as to the date of his retrial. Even if this is not considered as an assertion of the right to a speedy trial, the clerk’s reply indicating that the trial was scheduled for the following month surely explains the failure to take further action prior to the date of the scheduled trial. It is true appellant did not thereafter assert his right until August 7, 1973. However, in view of the fact that appellant was both uncounseled and incarcerated, we conclude that little significance can be attached to this delay. Consequently, we must consider this a case in which appellant has fully asserted his right to a speedy retrial throughout the relevant period. Compare <em>Commonwealth v.

First, it alleged that appellant’s actions on September 19, 1969, breached the condition that he would commit no crimes while on parole, noting that he had been charged with armed robbery, murder, and certain weapons offenses. Second, it alleged that appellant had been found in possession of a firearm without written permission of his probation officer, as required by the conditions of his parole. The latter ground is entirely unrelated to the instant charge (although appellant con<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>tends that he took the firearm in question from the husband of the deceased in the course of defending himself).

He testified that he had never seen either appellant or Trautman before September 19, 1969. On that day they appeared on his porch, representing themselves to be from the Internal Revenue Service. Robinson invited them in. Immediately after they entered they produced guns, beat him about the head, sprayed him with some kind of chemical, and demanded that he give them money. He told them that if they wanted money, they should come upstairs.</p>

Appellant and <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>Robinson then struggled for the gun, which appellant ultimately wrested away from Robinson. In the course of the struggle, Robinson was shot. Appellant then told Trautman to “get rid of” Mrs. Robinson. Immediately afterwards appellant and Trautman departed. Robinson then discovered that his wife was dead of a gunshot wound. He did not testify to seeing either appellant or Trautman shoot her.</p>
    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[175,729,1151,752]]]'>Appellant’s testimony differed from Robinson’s in a number of important respects. According to him, Robinson was a loan shark from whom he had borrowed money when he lost his job. He had fallen behind in his payments and went to see Robinson to offer an explanation. Trautman agreed to drive him there because appellant’s own car was out of order. Robinson admitted them to his house<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> and appellant began to explain why he had fallen behind in his payments and where he hoped to get the money to satisfy the debt. Robinson then made a statement which appellant construed as a threat to his family and began to strike appellant with a hard object.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Appellant then struggled with Robinson and succeeded in taking the object away from him.</p>

This set of facts would support the inference that appellant and Trautman had conspired to beat Robinson in order to intimidate him into foregoing collection of the debt, at least until appellant’s financial condition improved. If the jury then also believed Robinson’s account of the events in the bedroom, it could conclude that Trautman fired the fatal shot and that appellant was guilty of murder in the second degree as a co-conspirator.</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[130,817,1150,1130]]]'>The judge did not instruct the jury as to the elements of any particular crime which appellant might have conspired with Trautman to commit. Thus the instruction did not, in terms, authorize the jury to convict on the basis of a conspiracy to commit robbery or murder, which bases appellant claims the Commonwealth is estopped to assert. Appellant made no request for instructions forbidding the jury to convict on the basis of a conspiracy to commit robbery or murder. The only objection urged in the trial court was that there was no basis on which appellant could properly be found guilty on the basis of a conspiracy. Consequently, appellant may not urge on appeal that the court erred in failing to give additional instructions allegedly necessary to clarify the instruction objected to.

While the record does not contain any order revoking bond, appellant applied for bail pending this appeal, which was denied on October 12, 1973. Apparently he was kept in custody after his return to this jurisdiction because of the federal sentence he was then serving. He was again paroled from his federal sentence on January 22, 1975, and commenced serving the sentence imposed in this case.</p>

Appellant contends that the revocation was based solely upon his conviction of murder and that he was denied a hearing on revocation in violation of the parole board’s own rules. To the extent that this is true, it is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Appellant’s complaint must be directed to the United States.</p>

In view of the necessity of obtaining custody of appellant from the federal authorities and the delay of 60 to 90 days required for this purpose, appellant’s trial could not realistically have been scheduled before May, 1973. Allowing for an absolute minimum of delay caused by scheduling problems, it does not seem that more than half of the delay in appellant’s retrial could possibly be attributed to the Commonwealth’s negligence.</p>
