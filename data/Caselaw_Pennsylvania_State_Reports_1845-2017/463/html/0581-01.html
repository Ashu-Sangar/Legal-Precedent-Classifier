Stewart was apprehended on October 7, 1972, and returned for trial. Thereafter, both at his own trial and at the trial of Richard Alston, another co-defendant, Stewart testified that he [Stewart] had planned and carried out the Wormley killing and that Tervalon did not participate in any way. Subsequently, at a hearing on the motion for a new trial, Stewart repeated his story, directly contradicting the testimony of the Commonwealth witnesses. He denied Tervalon was ever a member of the Black Liberation Army. He admitted that a vote to kill Wormley had been held, but maintained that Tervalon was not present. And he indicated that two revolutionaries, Hasson and Abdul, not Tervalon, had been detailed to Wormley’s apartment to bring Wormley down to the street.</p>

In rebuttal, to impeach this alibi testimony, the Commonwealth introduced Tervalon’s statement in which he admitted being with a friend named Roger for part of the evening in question; in addition to going to the store in search of his wife’s desired cupcake. Tervalon claims this rebuttal was improper and his statement could properly have been used to cross-examine only <em>his </em>testimony or to rebut evidence presented by him personally.

Tervalon contends we need not speculate as to the effect which Stewart’s testimony would have upon retrial because Stewart’s similar exoneration of Richard Alston, who was on trial for the murder of Ronald Murray, led to a jury acquittal of Alston. It is true that both Williams and Miss Eason testified for the Commonwealth in the Alston case, just as they did at the Tervalon trial. However, their testimony merely named Alston as a member of the Black Liberation Army and did not indicate that Alston participated in the vote to kill Murray or that he was present at the shooting. The only evidence directly implicating Alston was the dying declaration of Murray who had initially told ■ the police he did not know who had shot him. Clearly, the evidence against Tervalon was much stronger than the Commonwealth’s case against Alston and the jury’s acquittal of Alston can, in no way, mandate a new trial for Tervalon.</p>

Tervalon also contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the guilt or innocence of a defendant may be predicated upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. However, this is a correct statement of the law in Pennsylvania and, therefore, a proper jury instruction. See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v.

Meanwhile, they repeatedly sought to obtain a statement from him. At about 4:30 a. m., November 23, their efforts bore fruit when appellant admitted he had been in the victim’s apartment building on the night of the murder. This statement was used at trial to refute appellant’s alibi defense. The claim was properly preserved for appellate review.</p>
