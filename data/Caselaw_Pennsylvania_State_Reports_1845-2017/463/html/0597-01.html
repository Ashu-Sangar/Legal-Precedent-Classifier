    <p id="b634-9" data-blocks='[["BL_634.9",634,[281,1093,1149,365]]]'>Appellant, Domingo Gonzales, was found guilty by a jury of voluntary manslaughter under section 2503 of the Crimes Code, 18 C.P.S.A. § 2503 (1973) stemming from an indictment charging criminal homicide and aggravated assault. Post-trial motions were denied and a sentence of <em>2y% </em>to 10 years imprisonment was imposed. This direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b634-10" data-blocks='[["BL_634.10",634,[272,1481,1153,631]]]'>Appellant first raises a question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. The testimony presented at trial revealed that there had been an altercation between appellant and decedent at the migrant labor camp where each man worked and lived. Although there were no witnesses to the actual shooting, appellant did not contest that he fired the fatal shot. Appellant contended that the shooting was in self-defense and that it occurred as the victim approached him with a knife. The Commonwealth’s evidence indicated that the fatal bullet was fired from a distance of at least 12 feet, and no knife was located at the scene of the incident.</p>
    <p id="b634-11" data-blocks='[["BL_634.11",634,[270,2158,1143,148]],["BL_635.1",635,[141,300,1149,1212]]]'>Appellant contends that under the testimony, the only theory that would justify the manslaughter verdict would have been a finding that he had acted under <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>an unreasonable belief that the killing was justifiable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Proceeding from this premise he submits that the evidence establishes as a matter of law that his belief that he was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm was reasonable. Even accepting the original assumption, we cannot agree with this view of the testimony. The only evidence supportive of a theory of self-defense was the testimony of appellant which the jury was free to reject. <em>Commonwealth v.

Contradicting this testimony was the expert opinion that the bullet entered the body of the deceased at a point when it was at least 12 feet from the muzzle of the weapon. Additionally, no knife was found on the body nor was one retrieved from the area. This testimony obviously precludes a finding of self-defense as a matter of law and requires that the issue be submitted to the trier of fact as was done in this case. Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict winner, we find that the evidence supported the verdict. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>While this is a correct statement of the law, we must agree with the trial judge’s determination that in this case no conflict existed among the testimony of the Commonwealth’s two witnesses, one a police ballistics expert and the other, the county coroner (a medical doctor), who examined the decedent a few hours after death. At trial the ballistics expert testified that if the bullet hit the arm and then penetrated the abdomen his ability to compare the wound with the test shots performed on the murder weapon to determine the firing distance would be affected. Defense counsel’s objection to this witness’ opinion testimony regarding distance was sustained. In contrast the coroner was permitted to testify based on his familiarity with shotgun patterns and shotgun wounds and his examination of this wound and the residue, that the weapon was fired from a distance of about 12 feet. When questioned regarding deflection of the shot by the arm he stated that there was no deflection of the mass of the charge. Thus no conflict existed because the ballistics expert testified simply as to how deflection would affect his opinion, whereas the doctor testified that in this case no deflection occurred.</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[254,1519,1152,795]],["BL_637.1",637,[137,293,1142,94]]]'>Appellant further contends that the doctor, while qualified as to medical matters, was not properly qualified to testify regarding ballistics, specifically the distance from which the shot was fired. The reasons which appellant assigns to support this contention are that the doctor examined decedent only after surgery, that he had no particular experience with deflected shots, and that there were no additional facts such as powder burns upon which to base his opinion. These contentions, however, go principally to the weight the jury may give to the testimony rather than to its admissibility. In the past, this Court has permitted a medical doctor, based on his examination of the wound, to give his opinion regarding the distance from which the shot was fired.
