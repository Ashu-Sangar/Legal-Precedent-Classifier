In the instant case, the Supply Corporation does not question that the parties agreed to arbitrate “any dispute . . . as to the interpretation of the contract documents or otherwise as to the rights and responsibilities of the parties under the contract.” It contends, however, that this language does not encompass the subject matter of the parties’ disagreement. It is argued that the contract contains no undertaking by appellant to furnish grit removal equipment and therefore <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>that any dispute as to whether appellant is obligated to install such equipment is not a dispute “under the contract” and hence is outside the scope of the arbitration provision. This argument must be rej ected.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[259,506,1155,741]]]'>Whether appellant is or is not obligated to furnish grit removal equipment is obviously a question of the nature and scope of its responsibilities under the contract, the resolution of which requires interpretation of the language of the contract. This is so whether the pertinent contract language is clear and precise or is obscure and ambiguous. The possibility that the meaning of the contract is as pellucid as appellant claims it to be does not eliminate the need for an authoritative determination of the matter once a dispute has arisen; interpretation is no less interpretation because it may prove simple. Under the arbitration clause here involved, however, that interpretation is for the board of arbitrators, not the courts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
