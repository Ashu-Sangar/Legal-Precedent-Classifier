Stone, deceased, who was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of defendant-appellee, the American Lacquer Solvents Company [American], a Pennsylvania corporation, on December 7, 1967, and continuously thereafter until his death on November 1, 1968. On December 7, 1967, the Board of Directors of American, in consideration for services rendered the company by Harold E. Stone, adopted a Resolution providing that in the event of Harold E. Stone’s death prior to that of his wife (Rachel Stone), American was to pay an annual pension of $8000 to said wife until her death or remarriage. The <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>Resolution further provided that it could not be revoked without Harold E. Stone’s consent.</p>

Following this Stone contacted his son-in-law Robert Shaw, President and General Manager of American, who was visiting in Florida at the time, and told him he wanted the Resolution providing a pension for his wife cancelled. Shaw contacted the company’s counsel and, acting in accordance with his advice as to the procedure to be followed, prepared a letter from Stone to the Board of Directors of American saying, “It is my wish that the Resolution dated December 7, 1967 concerning a pension for my wife Rachel be rescinded.” Stone signed and personally delivered the letter to Shaw on March 3rd.</p>

    <p id="b457-5" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[138,1041,1155,472]]]'>First, the court concluded that Stone’s letter of March 3, 1968, constituted a consent to the Board’s subsequent action rescinding the pension Resolution. The difficulty with this position is that the applicable statute <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> requires that such a consent be executed <em>after </em>the meeting and that it specifically set forth the action taken, and that it be filed with the secretary of the corporation.

    <p id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[141,1546,1148,367]]]'>Secondly, the court concluded Stone’s letter of March 3, 1968, constituted a waiver of receipt of notice of the meeting of March 11, 1968. The difficulty with this position is that the letter does not refer to the meeting or indicate in any way that notice thereof is waived. The letter amounts to no more than an expression of desire or consent to rescind the pension Resolution.</p>

This analysis overlooks the rationale for the salutory rule that all directors receive notice of special meetings. That rationale is that “each member of a corporate body has the right of consultation with the others, and has the right to be heard upon all questions considered, and it is presumed that if the absent members had been present they might have dissented, and their arguments might have convinced the majority of the unwisdom of their proposed action and thus have produced a different result.” <em>Holcombe v. Trenton White City Co., </em><a href="/nj-eq/80/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="80 N.J.

We agree with this rationale and, in view of the presumption embodied therein, we cannot concur in the trial court’s premise that Stone and the other Directors were of one mind as regards the pension rescission. In relation to this, we specifically note that another member of the Board of Directors failed to attend the meeting of March 11, 1968, and there is nothing in the record to show if he received notice of the meeting, or ever consented to the action taken at the meeting.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[251,1549,1150,506]]]'>Finally, the court concluded that the rescinding resolution of the Board was voidable only and that Stone’s silence and failure to object thereto prior to his death amounted to a ratification. The difficulty with this posiJ tion is that there is nothing in the record to show that Stone was ever made aware that the meeting of March 11, 1968, had been held or knew the rescinding resolution had been adopted, by the Board. Under the circumstances, it cannot be said a ratification was effected.</p>
