    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[145,1409,1152,801]]]'>On January 21, 1973, at approximately 3:10 A.M., officers of the Pitcairn Police Department responded to a call originating from appellant Charles Boyd’s residence. Upon arriving at the Boyd home, the officers were informed by the appellant that he had shot his wife while demonstrating to her how to handle a weapon. Entering the bedroom of the Boyd home, the officers observed the victim’s partially clothed body in a pool of blood upon the bed. The room was described as being in general disarray with clothes on the floor; other articles of clothing strewn about the foot of the bed; dresser drawers pulled out; three or four suitcases at the foot of the bed; and the receiver of the bedroom telephone disconnected from the base. The weapon, a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson, was found at the foot of the bed.</p>
    <p id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.6",381,[152,2247,1145,96]],["BL_382.1",382,[275,282,1149,198]]]'>Homicide detectives confiscated the weapon and observed that there were two spent cartridges in the cham<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>ber. After further investigation, it was determined that the victim had received one bullet wound and a second bullet was retrieved from the wall in the bedroom three or four feet above the head of the victim.</p>
    <p id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[269,509,1153,421]]]'>Testimony of a forensic pathologist associated with the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office revealed that a bullet entered the left side of the victim’s neck severing the superior thyroid artery thereby causing death. Powder wounds were detected inside the wound leading the pathologist to opine that the murder weapon was held no more than six inches from the victim’s neck at the time it was discharged.</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[263,956,1154,747]]]'>A ballistics expert attached to the Pittsburgh Police Department testified that both the bullet recovered from the victim’s neck and that from the bedroom wall were fired from the same weapon that was originally observed in appellant’s bedroom. The ballistics expert testified further that the only possible manner in which the instant weapon could be fired in the double action position would be to pull the trigger. He specified the amount of pressure required to fire the weapon: to fire the weapon by trigger required from between eight pounds eleven ounces to nine pounds three ounces of pressure and to fire the weapon with the hammer cocked required between three pounds three ounces to three pounds eleven ounces of pressure.</p>

When appellant arrived home early on January 21st, he found garbage cans strewn before his house door and his wife in the bedroom upset due to a fear that prowlers were outside the house. On a dresser near their bed, appellant observed their gun with the hammer pulled back. Appellant proceeded to show his wife how to uncock the gun. Attempting to put the weapon in a double action position it accidentally went off, lodging a bullet in the wall above their bed. The firing frightened the Boyd’s two dogs, a Great Dane and a Doberman Pinscher. As <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>appellant’s wife proceeded to go to bed, the appellant attempted to unload the weapon. Without warning, the appellant’s Doberman Pinscher struck appellant from behind, pushing him forward causing the gun to be fired and the bullet to strike his wife.</p>

There we held, despite Whitaker’s testimony to the contrary, that where it is established that the accused had sole control over the weapon at the time of its discharge and that the weapon was used upon a vital part of the body, a jury could properly infer malice sufficient to sustain the charge of murder. <em>Id. </em>at 145-146, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20886" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="269 A.2d 886">269 A. 2d at 887-888</a>.

In <em>Young, </em>the evidence in question was introduced through the testimony of the clerk of courts who produced a transcript, indictment, and guilty plea thereto of one ‘Thomas Young,’ a black man, nineteen years of age. We there found this evidence insufficient, <em>even in the absence of contradiction, to establish identity for purposes of allowing the criminal records into evidence. </em><a href="/pa/418/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="418 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1896078" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0359-01">418 Pa. at 361-62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=211%20A.2d%20440" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="211 A.2d 440">211 A.2d at 441</a>. Speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Eagen enunciated the rationale for this requirement of clear proof of identity when dealing with impeachment of a criminal defendant’s credibility: ‘The importance of evidence establishing prior convictions of serious crimes for impeachment purposes cannot be overemphasized. It can, and often does, destroy a witness’s credibility and significantly influences the outcome of the trial. In view thereof, it appears to us that the identity of the person should be established by something more than mere similarity in name. The name Young is not uncom<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>mon; in fact a perusal of the current Philadelphia city telephone directory manifests fifteen listings for “Thomas Young”. Under the circumstances, <em>we conclude that it was prejudicial and reversible error to permit the jury to make such an important finding on the basis of inconclusive evidence.’ </em><a href="/pa/418/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="418 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1896078" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0359-01">418 Pa. at 361-62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=211%20A.2d%20440" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="211 A.2d 440">211 A.2d at 441</a>. The instant case lacks even the kind of weak corroborative evidence of identity which was present in <em>Young. </em>Thus, any factual dissimilarity in this regard is, if anything, in appellant’s favor. Moreover, we cannot say that the name ‘Daniel King’ is sufficiently less common than ‘Thomas Young’ to merit our distinguishing <em>Young </em>on that basis. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden of establishing identity and thus, the criminal record was erroneously admitted.”</blockquote>

Yet despite this objection, having called to the trial court’s and prosecution’s attention that their actions were at variance with case law, <em>Commonwealth v. King, supra </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Young, supra, </em>the court permitted the use of prior convictions to impeach appellant’s credibility. The burden of establishing identity rests on the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. King, supra, </em>455 Pa. at 368, n. 4, 316 A.2d at 880 n. 4; <em>Commonwealth v.
