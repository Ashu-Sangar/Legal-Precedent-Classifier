On January 23, 1970, Walter Olen was shot and killed in a real estate office which he managed in Pittsburgh. Approximately five months later the police learned from an informant that appellant was in<a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>volved in the crime. In July 1971, another informant told the police that appellant and one, Augustus Gray, were involved in the shooting. The police then found that Gray’s fingerprints matched a partial thumb and palm print found at the scene. In order to question appellant, the police obtained an order to take custody of him at Rockview Correctional Institution where he was then incarcerated on another offense. Appellant was not questioned during the drive to Pittsburgh. Approximately 20 minutes after arriving at the Public Safety Building in Pittsburgh, appellant was told that he was a suspect in the January 23rd shooting and was advised of his constitutional rights. Approximately 35 minutes thereafter, appellant admitted his involvement in the crime. He stated that he had gone with Gray to the real estate office with the intent to rob it, and that both he and Gray carried guns. He asserted however that when the victim armed himself with a pistol, he (Spriggs) fled the scene and that he did not witness or participate in the shooting in any way. Approximately 3 hours later, appellant gave a taped statement setting forth substantially the same facts as in his earlier oral statement.</p>

The fact that the warnings focused upon the interrogation process, i. e., “answering questions” as opposed to <em>“any </em>statements”, does not create a significant difference between the language employed here and that approved in <em>Miranda. </em>Constitutional inquiry should be directed not at possible esoteric or semantic differences, but should be directed at the substance of the right.

Appellant claims that there was sufficient evidence to justify a finding of withdrawal or abandonment and that accordingly the jury should have received an instruction on the law regarding withdrawal. It is well settled that in <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>order to find abandonment or withdrawal, the actor must abandon the scheme appreciably before the homicide occurs and the actor must communicate his intention to his fellow conspirators so that they also have an opportunity to abandon the scheme.

Appellant contends that these elements were made out by his testimony that he did not hear the fatal shot and he was not reunited with his accomplice until 20 minutes after the robbery. Assuming this evidence would sustain a jury finding as to the first element, i. e., that the abandonment occur appreciably before the homicide; this record is devoid of any evidence of the second element, i. e., communication. Accordingly the trial judge correctly refused to charge on withdrawal.</p>

Subsection (a) of that rule, however, appears to restrict the availability of such motions to those relating to “evidence alleged to have been obtained in violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights.” The exclusionary rule created in <em>Commonwealth v. Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d 417</a> (1972), is based on nonconstitutional law. Nevertheless, it is clear that <em>Futch </em>claims may be raised in pretrial motions to suppress. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Riley, </em><a href="/pa/462/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="462 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="485160" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0190-01">462 Pa. 190</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="462 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="485160" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0190-01">340 A.2d 427</a> (1975). While this is surely preferable prac<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>tice, an accused should not be barred from raising a <em>Futch </em>claim for the first time at trial as long as a reader of Rule 323(a) might be led to believe that such motions are available only for constitutional claims.</p>
    <p id="b417-4" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[113,523,1173,371]]]'>As a result of the wording of the rule and the practice of hearing <em>Futch </em>claims at a suppression hearing, a situ-" ation has been created wherein suppression motions based upon alleged violations of constitutional rights must be raised before trial, but suppression motions based upon alleged violations of rights created by statute or rule may be presented either before or at trial.</p>
    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.5",417,[112,916,1153,525]]]'>Treating a motion to suppress evidence allegedly the product of a violation of constitutionally-created rights different from motions to suppress evidence alleged to be the product of a violation of rights created by statute, decision or rule is unjustifiable. In my view, Rule 323(a) should be amended to make clear that a motion pursuant to that rule is the proper procedure by which an accused may seek the suppression of evidence obtained in violation of any right whether created by constitution or otherwise.</p>
