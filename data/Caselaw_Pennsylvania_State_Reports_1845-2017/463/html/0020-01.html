Thereafter, by agreement, compensation for total disability at $47.50 per week was paid Cerny until he returned to work on June 26, 1962. However, because of his injuries, Cerny could not perform his usual work and was, therefore, given light duties. On September 21, 1962, Cerny was laid off. He has not worked since that time.</p>
