It is also averred that the remaining named appellants did file annual reports for 1971 and 1972 and therefore received their respective shares of the realty tax equivalent for those years as computed pursuant to Section 7.

The theory of this cause of action, as stated in the complaint, is that the forfeiture provision is unconstitutional, and therefore unenforceable, because it violated the directive of Article VIII, Section 4, of the Constitution that sums equal to the aggregate realty tax equivalent be distributed to local taxing authorities each year.</p>

Section 4, then goes on, however, to provide that local taxation of public utility realty may be displaced by “ [p] ayment to the Commonwealth of gross receipts or other special taxes . . . and the distribution by the Commonwealth to the local taxing authorities of the amount as herein provided . . . .” The “amount” to which the provision refers is to be “not be less than the gross amount of real estate taxes which the local taxing authorities could have imposed upon such real property . . . .” This amount is what PURTA terms the “realty tax equivalent.” § 6(a) of PURTA, 72 P.S. § 3276(a) (Supp.1975).

It is argued that this phrase constitutes a mandatory directive that the entire realty tax equivalent collected by the Commonwealth be distributed annually to local taxing authorities, and that Section 6(b) by providing for forfeiture, violates this mandatory directive. Although this argument finds some support in a literal reading of Article VIII, Section 4, the language of that section is not as rigid as appellants would have us hold.</p>

      <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>The phrase “shall be distributed” undoubtedly expresses an intention on the part of the constitutional framers that any Article VIII, Section 4, tax is to be a source of revenue for local taxing authorities, not for the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> It does not necessarily follow, however, that <em>all </em>local taxing authorities must receive shares of the realty tax equivalent in all circumstances. When the constitution clearly sets forth the manner in which something shall be done, that procedure must be followed to the exclusion of all others, including a procedure which the legislature may prefer;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> but when a constitutional provision contemplates the enactment of implementing legislation, the provision should, absent clear language to the contrary, be interpreted as establishing general guidelines for the forthcoming legislation, rather than mandatory directives as to its content. Here Article VIII, Section 4 expressly authorizes the enactment of a special tax such as PURTA in place of local taxation of public utility realty. The nature of the tax, however, and the details of its imposition, collection and distribution are not spelled out in the constitution. It must be assumed that the framers intended that the legislature should have freedom to make reasonable provision in these respects.</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[278,1626,1148,367]],["BL_599.1",599,[145,269,1162,1217]]]'>Turning specifically to the requirement of Article VII, Section 4 that the proceeds of the special tax be distributed it is to be noted that the framers were explicit in providing that distribution should be “in the proportion which the total tax receipts of each local taxing authority bear to the total tax receipts of all local taxing authorities, or in such other equitable proportions as may be <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>provided by law”. This authorization to the General Assembly is surely sufficiently broad to allow a scheme of distribution of the proceeds of the special tax based upon information concerning local real estate tax rates and receipts to be furnished by the local taxing bodies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> To this end the legislature should have latitude to set up an efficient method whereby the state officials can acquire the necessary information; part of establishing such a method is to provide for the consequences of failure of the local units to furnish such information. Accordingly, we conclude that while an Article VIII, Section 4, tax must provide in general for the distribution to local taxing authorities of the realty tax equivalent, it is not necessary that each local taxing authority receive a share in all circumstances. We deem it sufficient that a special tax enactment such as PURTA provide for the apportionment of the entire realty tax equivalent among all local taxing authorities and for the distribution of the re-spective shares to each authority <em>which has fulfilled all reasonable requirements </em>— a reasonable requirement being one which is neither unduly burdensome nor unrelated to the proper operation of the taxing scheme.</p>

For only by providing for forfeiture by delinquent taxing bodies is the Department of Revenue enabled to compute the respective shares of those local taxing authorities which have timely filed their annual reports and to make distribution of those shares notwithstanding the delinquency of some local units. Without forfeiture, it would be impossible to ascertain the shares of any local authorities as long as one of them was delinquent, since the size of each share would be dependent upon the sum total of information sought from all local bodies. Thus a single delinquent local taxing authority could delay indefinitely distribution to all other authorities.
