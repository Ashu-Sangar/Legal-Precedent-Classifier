In <em>Shiomos, </em>I expressed reservations as to whether that extraordinary remedy should be available for the purpose of challenging an order of discovery. See the concurring opinion of this writer, <a href="/pa/457/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="457 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="478275" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0104-01">457 Pa. at </a>110-111 n. 1, <a href="/citations/?q=320%20A.2d%20134" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="320 A.2d 134">320 A.2d at </a>137 n. 1. I believe that an appeal is the preferable route for the Commonwealth to follow in circumstances such as these, where there has been an adverse ruling on a point of law in the trial court which raises serious question as to the scope of one of <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>our rules of criminal procedure. The basis for permitting an appeal (or for entertaining a petition for a writ of prohibition) is the simple fact that if we were not to do so the Commonwealth would forever be precluded from litigating the issue of the validity of the order of discovery. Win or lose at trial, the Commonwealth obviously has no opportunity to appeal at that state. Failure of the Court to consider the issue now forecloses <em>any </em>opportunity for appellate review. Because the issue raised by the appeal is important, see <em>Shiomos, supra </em>at 108, <a href="/citations/?q=320%20A.2d%20134" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="320 A.2d 134">320 A.2d at 136</a>, we should not hesitate to consider its merits.</p>
