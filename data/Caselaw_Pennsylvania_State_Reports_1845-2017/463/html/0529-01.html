So viewed, the evidence established the following: On the evening of September 18, 1973, Albert Cropper, the appellant, entered the Star Bar in the City of Philadelphia in the company of Rodney Fields and one Harlem Brown. The three were old friends and had been shooting dice outside <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>the bar, Fields being the loser. As they came into the bar Cropper and Brown were kidding Fields about having lost. After a few minutes Fields became upset, apparently because he felt that the others had unfairly stopped gambling while they were ahead of him in winnings. When Cropper refused to buy him a drink, Fields suggested that they gamble some more. The others acquiesced and the trio left the barroom.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[270,758,1151,750]]]'>Returning to the bar a short while later, Brown and Cropper again joked with Fields about his losses. Fields again became angry and punched Brown in the lip; Brown’s reaction was merely to laugh because, as he testified at trial, “I knew the man.” Still angry, Fields again swung at Brown. This time Brown ducked, shoved Fields out of the way and headed for the door. Fields then became abusive towards Cropper and shouted at him, “If you even speak to me tomorrow I am going to kill you.” As if to punctuate his irritation, Fields grabbed a bar stool in one hand and shook it at appellant. Cropper, in turn, picked up another stool so as to be able to joust with Fields. After a standoff with the stools, both men dropped them and took to fighting.</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[266,1541,1149,479]]]'>As they were tussling on the floor, Cropper was overheard by the bartender to exclaim, “I got something for you bad ass.” Soon afterwards the appellant drew a knife from his pocket and with it stabbed Fields at least four times. Although appellant and another witness testified that earlier on the day of the stabbing they had observed the victim paring his fingernails with a knife, at no time during the fatal struggle did Cropper or anyone else observe Fields with a knife drawn.</p>

The trial court concluded that the defendant had failed to establish that defense by a preponderance of the evidence. In so concluding, the court found, as stated in its opinion on the denial of post-trial motions, that the circumstances surrounding the homicide were not such as to justify a belief in the necessity to kill; that even if Cropper in fact entertained such a belief, it was not a reasonable belief in the circumstances;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and that appellant violated his duty to retreat. Appellant contends that the court below erred in using the preponderance test for gauging whether he had established self-defense, and hence that a new trial is required; alternatively, he argues that as a matter of law the testimony established that the stabbing of Fields was indeed in self-defense, and hence that the judgment should be arrested and appellant discharged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We find no merit in either argument and will affirm.</p>

In making that review we must apply the standards required by the Crimes Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>. Wholly apart from our decision in <em>Rose, supra, </em>we are of opinion that the General Assembly in enacting the Crimes Code has mandated the same result as we there reached. Nowhere in § 505 of the Code is there any indication that a defendant who asserts self-defense is required to prove that defense by a preponderance of the evidence. This omission is significant when it is considered that in a number of other sections of the Code dealing with defenses to various crimes, the legislature has specifically required that the defenses or certain elements thereof be proved by the defendant by a pre<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>ponderance of the evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Since no similar stipulation appears in § 505, it must be assumed that the legislature intended not to impose on defendants the burden of proving that they acted in self-defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Thus when there is <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>evidence at trial from whatever source that a killing may have been done in self-defense, the burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acting in self-defense. See <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em><a href="/us/421/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="421 U.S. 684" data-case-ids="541415" data-case-paths="/us/421/0684-01">421 U.S. 684</a>, <a href="/us/421/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="421 U.S. 684" data-case-ids="541415" data-case-paths="/us/421/0684-01">95 S.Ct. 1881</a>, 1891, <a href="/us/421/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="421 U.S. 684" data-case-ids="541415" data-case-paths="/us/421/0684-01">44 L.Ed.2d 508</a>, n. 30 [decided June 10, 1975], Viewed in this light, we are satisfied that in the case at bar the trial court was warranted in refusing to arrest the judgment for insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.</p>

Admittedly, there was the decedent’s conditional threat, “If you even speak to me tomorrow I am going to kill you,” but that was hardly sufficient to justify a <em>present </em>belief on the part of appellant in the necessity to kill in order to protect himself. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the evidence would support beyond ■ a reasonable doubt the determination of the trial court that “the circumstances were neither adequate to raise nor sufficient to justify a belief in the necessity to take life [e]ven if appellant’s testimony as to his fear were believed, it was a fear not reasonably justified by the immediate circumstances,” (opinion of Judge Stout at 11).
