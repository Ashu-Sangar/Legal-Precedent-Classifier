We cannot agree. A review of the record reveals that although there has not been strict adherence with our procedural rules, there has been substantial compliance and a motion to quash is not justified. On January 29, 1973, the Chancellor entered'an order entitled “Preliminary Injunction or Decree Nisi.” This novel caption was explained by the Chancellor in his opinion which accompanied it:</p>

    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[171,559,1154,1333]]]'>Thus, the appellant was given the option to treat the ruling of January 29th as an order granting a preliminary injunction and appeal directly to this Court from that order pursuant to the Act of February 14, 1866, P.L. 28, § 1 and the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, 1970, July 31, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. V, § 501(a), 17 P.S. § 211.501(a). However appellant apparently agreed with the Chancellor that an additional evidentiary hearing was unnecessary and elected to treat the Chancellor’s action as a decree nisi. Appellant thereupon filed exceptions and also amended exceptions which were both subsequently dismissed by the court en banc on December 6, 1978.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It is that decree of December 6th from which this appeal was taken on January 3, 1974, pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, <em>supra, </em>§ 202(4). It is also apparent that the decree of December 6th is a final one implicitly affirming the decree nisi. Thus, we reject appellee’s contention that this was an improper appeal from an interlocutory order. While appellant, in his answer to the Motion to Quash, suggests that the appeal is from the order of January 29, 1973, it is apparent that his intention was to appeal from that order after its affirmance by the decree of December 6, 1973.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Sometime in September 1972 David McMullin, Esquire, attorney for General Press, attempted to schedule a deposition of the President of Chatham for the purpose of discovering the presence of Chatham’s assets. Pa.R.C.P. 3117. Shortly thereafter Chatham, through its attorney, Albert Feczko, Esquire, contacted Mr. McMullin and indicated that they would make a $400,000 payment on account of the judgment and would continue to make periodic installment payments if General Press would agree not to execute on its judgment. A payment of $400.00 was made by Chatham and accepted by General Press in the early part of October 1972. A second check in the amount of $400.00 was accepted at the end of November. General Press further responded by postponing the taking of depositions indefinitely. On or about January 11, 1973, General Press executed its judgment by attaching the bank account of Chatham. It was at this point that this suit in equity was instituted seeking to restrain appellant from proceeding with this execution.</p>
