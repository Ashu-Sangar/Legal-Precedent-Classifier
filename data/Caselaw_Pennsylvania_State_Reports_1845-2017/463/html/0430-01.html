Shortly after her death a will dated November 12, 1965, was offered for probate. Two caveats were filed to the probate of that will, and the matter was certified to the orphans’ court. Prior to a hearing in the orphans’ court a later will, dated 1969, was discovered and offered for probate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This 1969 writing was rejected by the register of wills because of apparent alterations.

The heirs repeatedly argued in the orphans’ court that the failure to file bonds was fatal to the appeals.

I agree with Judge Taxis in his opinion of March 14, 1974 wherein he observed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[323,499,1114,1076]]]'>“It is unfortunate that appellants were neglectful in respect to the filing of their bonds; but we do not believe that this failure in and of itself requires us to dismiss the present appeal, under the exact circumstances present. The estate itself is ample security for costs; both appellants, in fact, represent the interests of the trust estate. If Glenmede can possess the assets of estate and administer them in its corporate capacity without entering any security at all, as it can, a small bond for costs would serve no purpose, at least none so important as to warrant dismissal of the appeal. The heirs can show no harm suffered by them on account of these omissions. Moreover, the language of the statute is that an appeal not perfected by filing a bond shall be considered abandoned, but the parties had full notice in this particular case that no abandonment was thereby intended. Undoubtedly the requirement of a bond serves a real purpose in protecting the appellee, especially if an appeal may be capricious, but no such purpose is served here.”</blockquote>
