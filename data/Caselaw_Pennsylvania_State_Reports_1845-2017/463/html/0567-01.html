Additionally extensive argument was engaged in by counsel for appellant which consumed some sixty-three pages of this record. The record reveals that appellant made no request to offer any additional testimony prior to the Chancellor’s ruling although the opportunity was clearly available.

Thus, for appellant to invoke either res judicata or collateral estoppel the issues presented before Judge Blatt in the Commonwealth Court must be the same as those raised in the instant action. Here the element of the identity of issues is absent and therefore neither the doctrines of res judicata nor collateral estoppel will serve to bar the proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[131,735,1150,1074]]]'>The issue presented in the action commenced by the Commonwealth Insurance Department before Judge Blatt was the right of the Commonwealth to preliminary injunctive relief due to its immediate and irreparable harm occasioned by alleged breaches by Safeguard Mutual of the insurance statutes enforced by the Insurance Department. Specifically, the Insurance Department sought to enjoin actions by Safeguard Mutual which allegedly violated Section 4 of the Act of June 5, 1968 (P.L.) No. 78, 40 P.S. § 1008.4. In seeking preliminary injunctive relief the Insurance Department asserted that it had no adequate- remedy at law because the only remedy at law ran exclusively to the individual policyholders who might or might not bring an action to protect their rights. In seeking to establish irreparable harm the Insurance Department pointed to the alleged violation of the insurance statutes and the resultant administrative burden on the Insurance Department should there be a great number of policyholder cancellation appeals under the insurance statutes.</p>

The record establishes that a vast majority of the policyholders are persons of limited means, who would experience great difficulty if this added financial burden was imposed. The ramifications of improper cancellations by Safe<a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>guard Mutual would substantially impair the policyholders’ ability to protect or defend their rights in actions that might arise during the pendency of this litigation.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[275,470,1152,678]]]'>In the earlier litigation the court was concerned with the alleged wrong to the Insurance Department when one of the companies under its aegis acts in violation of statutory law and the irreparable harm that could occur to that Department and the Commonwealth. In the instant litigation the court was concerned with alleged violations of individual policyholders’ contractual rights and the irreparable harm that could occur to them should their insurance policies be improperly cancelled. It is clear, therefore, that the identity of issues which is required for the application of the doctrine of either res judicata or collateral estoppel is not present here.</p>

The court sustained the objection.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The limited nature of the policyholders’ participation in the action in the Commonwealth Court provides yet another reason why the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not applicable here. <em>In Re Estate of Ellis, <a href="/pa/460/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="460 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="482787" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0281-01">supra.</a></em>

Proceeding from this premise it is contended that this ruling on the merits of the controversy, in appellant’s favor, would justify invoking collateral estoppel as a bar. Judge Blatt’s order and decision, however, only denied the Commonwealth Insurance Department’s request for a preliminary injunction. The fact that Judge Blatt did not give an opinion explaining her ruling cannot be used by appellant here to claim that she decided the case on the merits.

As has been observed, many of the policyholders are people of meager means. Many found it necessary to finance the agreed-upon premiums and would have significant difficulty in attempting to meet the additional financial burden that would be occasioned by the assessment. It is equally clear that cancellation of their policies during the pendency of this lawsuit would result in irreparable harm to them. As noted by the learned court below, the 12,000 policyholders whose policies would be terminated in the event they could not meet the additional assessments would find themselves without insurance coverage. During that period of time they might lose lawsuits because of their inability to pay for the services of counsel or find themselves losing operating privileges under the Vehicle Code, Act of April 29, 1959, P.L. 58, §§ 1401-1436 as amended, 75 P.S. §§ 1401-1436 (Supp.1974-75). Many of the possible consequences are of such a nature that monetary damages would be inadequate.

Appellant does not contend that the requirements of Rule 1581(b), Pa.R.C.

If Safeguard Mutual is solvent it is difficult to see what harm can come from the injunction granted below since in such an event they would not be entitled to levy the requested assessment. If, on the other hand, the Insurance Department is correct in stating that the company is in fact insolvent, any inability to collect an assessment due to the delay occasioned by this lawsuit could not be charged against them by the Insurance Commissioner in view of the Insurance Commissioner’s position that a demand of assessment or cancellation should be delayed until the culmination of the suit.</p>
    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[275,899,1152,914]]]'>Considering the financial resources of the majority of the policyholders, see <em>Brookins v.

This is particularly so in view of the modification of the injunction made by this Court’s order of February 20, 1974. Under the present arrangement those policyholders who are in a position to meet this additional financial burden and who are willing to do so without the threat of cancellation may pay the monies into an escrow account. We believe that this arrangement represents a fair balancing of the equities of the respective sides and adequately preserves the status quo pending the final outcome of the suit.</p>
