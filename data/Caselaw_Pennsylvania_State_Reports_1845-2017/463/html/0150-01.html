One share was bequeathed “to my son, Robert F. Campbell, if he survives me. Should my said son, Robert F. Campbell, predecease me, then his share shall fall into my residuary estate and shall thus increase the shares of the other residuary legatees.”</p>

    <p id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[168,1364,1151,481]]]'>The issue presented on this appeal is whether the will of Martin Luther Kohler created an <em>exclusive </em>power of appointment in Else K. Campbell or, more specifically, did the will give Else K. Campbell the power to exclude her son’s issue from participation in the trust. The appellants contend it did not and maintain that there is nothing in the will of Martin Luther Kohler giving Else K. Campbell “the right to distribute her share of the estate to ‘such of her issue’ as she might by will appoint”.</p>

    <p id="b188-3" data-blocks='[["BL_188.3",188,[254,281,1150,695]]]'>
      <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>In support of their position that no power of appointment was created by the Kohler will, appellants urge that a gift in default of appointment, although not a sine qua non to a valid power of appointment, is generally included in wills drafted with the aid of counsel, such as the instant one. The answer to this contention, as the court below correctly concluded, is that the testator, although not expressly referring to a gift in default of appointment as such, did effectively provide for disposition of the unappointed share of his estate. In the event no appointment was made the unappointed share was to be paid to each daughter’s issue per stirpes as such issue reached the age of twenty-five.</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[248,1031,1157,1068]]]'>Secondly, the appellants argue that the language of the Kohler will, properly interpreted, provides for a gift to Else K. Campbell’s issue per stirpes with power in her merely to vary the time and method of distribution. This argument is premised solely upon an interpretation of the words “such issue”. Even if we were to accept this interpretation, however, the phrase “in such manner and such sums” gives Else K. Campbell more than the discretion to vary the time and method of payment. As defined by the Restatement, “ [A] power of appointment, . is a power created or reserved by a person (the donor) having property subject to his disposition enabling the donee of the power to designate, within such limits as the donor may prescribe, the transferees of the property <em>or the shares in which it shall be received.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.] Restatement, Property § 318 (1944). It is clear to us that Else K. Campbell was granted a power of appointment, since she was given the discretion to determine the shares in which the property of the Kohler trust were to be received.</p>

Campbell had <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>the right to favor some of her issue to the exclusion of others under the terms of the Kohler will.</p>
    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[166,434,1149,473]]]'>Specifically, appellants contend that the term “such issue” in the clause “or that the same be paid to such issue” has as its antecedent the phrase “issue per stirpes” as used previously in the clause “I direct the share of such daughter to be paid to her issue per stirpes”. From this it follows, they assert, that the testator did not intend that either daughter have the power to exclude any of their respective issue from a distributive share of the trust.</p>
    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[167,935,1146,96]]]'>Appellants would have us read the disputed language as presenting the following alternatives:</p>
    <blockquote id="b189-6" data-blocks='[["BL_189.6",189,[211,1053,1102,315]]]'>“Upon the death of either of my said daughters, then I direct the share of such daughter to be paid to her issue per stirpes [1] as such issue shall arrive at the age of twenty-five years, or [2] that the same be paid to such issue in such manner and in such sums as my said daughters shall by their respective wills direct.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b189-7" data-blocks='[["BL_189.7",189,[159,1393,1152,370]]]'>Such an interpretation, we believe, would render superfluous the words “that the same be paid to such issue”. If the power in the daughters to vary the time <em>for distribution </em>of the shares of payment were intended merely as an alternative to distribution at the age of twenty-five, there would be no apparent reason to have repeated the words “or the same be paid to such issue”.</p>
    <p id="b189-8" data-blocks='[["BL_189.8",189,[160,1794,1151,95]]]'>Given the structure of the language actually used, we feel a much more natural interpretation is the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b189-9" data-blocks='[["BL_189.9",189,[205,1920,1104,314]]]'>“Upon the death of either of my said daughters then I direct [1] the share of such daughter to be paid to her issue per stirpes as such issue shall arrive at the age of twenty-five years, or [2] that the same be paid to such issue in such manner and such sums as my said daughters shall by their respective wills direct.”</blockquote>

Since wills are to be construed so as to give effect to every word employed by the testator, see <em>Benedum Estate, </em><a href="/pa/427/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="427 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1910356" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0408-01">427 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20129" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="235 A.2d 129">235 A. 2d 129</a> (1967); and <em>Keffalos Estate, </em>supra, we deem the latter interpretation preferable.</p>
    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[259,601,1150,420]]]'>In addition, appellants’ interpretation would have us interpret the term “such issue” to mean “said issue”. However, the fact that the testator in the introductory phrases of the contested sentence used the adjective “said” to refer back to his previously mentioned daughters indicates that if he did, in fact, intend to have the term “such issue” refer to an antecedent, he would more likely have used the term “said issue”.</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[257,1062,1151,423]]]'>In view of the interpretation we adopt, there can be little doubt that the testator intended the power of appointment to be exclusive.
