Under numerous decisions of this Court, appellant’s first two claims are waived for failure to pursue them on direct appeal where such claims were cognizable.

Additionally there were other factors in appellant’s background that would have justified the imposition of a maximum sentence under the charge of second degree murder. Through co-counsels’ diligent efforts, an agreement was reached whereby the Commonwealth was willing to recommend a maximum sentence of not more' than 15 years and a minimüm sentence of not less than three years. These negotiations were known to the appellant and ostensibly were concurred in by him. The record reveals that it was not until the outset of the sentencing hearing, some five months after the entry of the plea, that co-counsel for the defense were <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>advised that their client desired to reject the agreement and stand trial. At this point counsel immediately advised the court of this decision by their client and saw to it that the court was provided with all of the information germane to a decision on the request. The court however proceeded to deny the request for withdrawal.</p>
    <p id="b217-4" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[133,633,1153,860]]]'>The only basis presently urged in support of the incompetency of counsel claim is counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness in asserting their client’s request for the withdrawal of the plea. Reading this record we can find no basis for this claim. Immediately upon the communication of their client’s desire to withdraw the plea, trial counsel communicated that fact to the court and attempted to obtain a favorable ruling. The mere fact that counsel in their professional judgment may have questioned the wisdom of their client’s decision is not controlling. There was ample reason to support the view that a withdrawal of a plea and exposure to trial might well not have been in appellant’s best interest. Accordingly, appellant’s claim is without merit. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967).</p>
