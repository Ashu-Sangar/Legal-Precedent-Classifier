By the mid-1960’s it was evident that the hat industry in general and the Stetson Co. in particular were declining. The Stetson Co. had ceased earning a profit, the market price and book value of its shares were decreasing, and the ability of the company to continue paying dividends was in jeopardy. In 1966, Fidelity determined that the trust’s shares of the Stetson Co. should be sold if a satisfactory price could be obtained.</p>

On March 27, Fidelity responded that it “had concluded that we would be willing to accept the offer of $20.00 per share for the common stock but we could not accept the offer for the preferred stock.” Fidelity indicated that it would be “glad to discuss this further with you.”</p>

Henry Stetson, a son of the decedent residing in California and an income beneficiary of the trust. G. Henry both personally and through counsel, communicated adamant opposition to the sale on the grounds of inadequate price and conflict of interest. The conflict of interest claim arose from the facts that the Rameo group already controlled the Stetson Co. and that the president of the Stetson Co. was a director and former officer of Fidelity. G. Henry threatened to institute litigation against all parties to the sale for rescission and damages and to request investigations by the federal securities and banking authorities.</p>

Henry’s opposition and threats, it would proceed with the sale, but that it should inform the Rameo group of the situation. Fidelity informed Ramco’s counsel of G. Henry’s threats on April 5; on the same day Ramco’s counsel replied that Guilden and Roth were unwilling to become involved in any litigation and that Rameo (i. e. Best &amp; Co.) would not consummate the transaction as long as any possibility of litigation existed. Fidelity was requested to return the letter-agreement unexecuted. Fidelity unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Rameo to complete the sale.</p>

Counsel informed Fidelity, orally and later in writing that litigation would be inadvisable. Specifically, counsel opined that 1) Fidelity would face the colorably meritorious defenses that a) no enforcible contract had ever arisen and, upon learning of G. Henry’s threats, the buyer had withdrawn an unaccepted offer, or b) even if a contract had resulted, the buyer was relieved of its obligation to consummate the sale because Fidelity was unable, in light of G. Henry’s objections, to perform the condition of delivering a certificate representing and <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>warranting that the shares were being sold “free and clear of any and all . claims of every kind and nature whatsoever” (see note 3 supra); 2) Fidelity would have great difficulty proving any damages; and 3) litigation would be costly, especially since it might have to be brought in New York. So advised, Fidelity determined not to institute litigation. It excised the signature of its officer who had signed the letter-agreement and returned it to Ramco’s counsel.</p>

During this period Fidelity expended great effort in seeking to effectuate a sale. In May and June, 1967, Fidelity offered to sell the stock to Rameo at $25.00 per share, because G. Henry indicated that he did not oppose a sale at that price. However, Rameo had been buying from other sellers at less than $25.00, and therefore refused.</p>
    <p id="b107-6" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[160,1303,1148,533]]]'>Fidelity thereafter resumed its efforts to complete a sale at $20.00 per share on two fronts. First, on numerous occasions it unsuccessfully sought to persuade G. Henry to drop his opposition. It urged him to agree to sue Fidelity only and not the buyers, but he refused. Second, Fidelity frequently attempted to interest the Rameo interests in purchasing the shares, but Rameo refused as long as any threat of litigation remained. In short, despite great effort on the part of Fidelity, both G. Henry and the Rameo group remained unmoved.</p>
