Petitioner also alleged a denial of effective assistance of counsel both at an earlier evidentiary hearing held to determine the voluntariness of his plea and on the appeal therefrom. The trial court denied petitioner’s second petition on the ground that the voluntariness of the plea had been finally litigated in the earlier proceeding, but without holding a hearing to determine whether petitioner had the benefit of competent counsel in that proceeding.</p>
