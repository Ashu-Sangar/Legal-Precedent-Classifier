The principal ground for this conclusion is that appellant was a juvenile (17 years old) and thus was incapable of making a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights. The inculpatory oral statement in question was made shortly after Wilson’s arrest at his home at approximately 7:00 A.M. on October 12, 1970. According to the arresting officer, appellant had been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and had waived his rights. The statement Wilson then made to the officer was that <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>he hadn’t shot anyone, but that he would show the police where the gun was hidden.

That act provides that upon arrest, juveniles in Philadelphia County are to be brought “immediately” before a juvenile court judge. By its terms, however, that statute applies only to “dependent, delinquent, or neglected children under the age of <em>sixteen years." </em>(emphasis added). Since the appellant in this case was seventeen at the time of his arrest, the statute was not applicable here.
