This conclusion is supported by the language in the last sentence. “In case any of <em>them become </em>deceased,” which indicates testatrix’s recognition of the possibility that one or more of her then living children might predecease her at some time in the future. <em>Schappell Estate </em>is therefore clearly distinguishable and not authority for the relief sought by appellants here.</p>
