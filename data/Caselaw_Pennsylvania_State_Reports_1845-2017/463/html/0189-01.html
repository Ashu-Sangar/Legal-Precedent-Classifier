The Commonwealth’s testimony established that on April 14, 1973 in Father Divine’s Mission cafeteria in Philadelphia, Methuselah Abolition, a caretaker in the mission, woke the appellant who was sleeping at one of the tables and asked him to leave. Appellant became quarrelsome and began to fight with Abolition, who was seventy-one years old and whose right arm had been amputated at the shoulder. Appellant struck Abolition with his fists until he was restrained by Calvin Alford, a patron of the cafeteria. Appellant broke from Alford’s restraint and began backing towards the front door of the cafeteria as Abolition followed him carrying a stick at his side telling appellant to leave. When Abolition was six to eight feet from the appellant, appellant pulled a gun out of his pocket and fired at Abolition. Wounded in the leg, Abolition fell to the floor. Seconds later, appellant fired again this time into Abolition’s stomach. Abolition died as a result of these gunshot wounds.</p>

As a result of information from two eyewitnesses to the shooting a police wanted poster containing a detailed description and composite drawing was prepared. When approached by the informer and supplied with the information referred to heretofore, Officer Flaherty had the poster in his possession. Flaherty showed the composite drawing to the informer who confirmed that it was the individual to whom he had been referring. Thus at the time of the arrest the officer was armed with a detailed description supplied by two eyewitnesses, a composite drawing made from the description and under the direction of these witnesses, further confirmation by a police informant, and finally his own determination as to the silimarity be<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>tween description, drawing and the suspect to whom he had been directed. Even where the realiability of informers has not been established we have found such information sufficient to support probable cause where the same information is received from independent sources. <em>Commonwealth v.

When two <em>independent </em>informants both supply the same information about a particular crime to the police, each source tends inherently to bolster the reliability of the other. Although the information supplied by one questionable source may be insufficient, the probability is extremely small that a second independent source would supply identical information if it were not probably accurate. When faced with such a situation, the police undoubtedly have a reasonable basis for further investigation. As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Beck v.
