        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nNIX, Justice.\nThis direct appeal from a conviction of murder in the second degree results from an altercation which occurred in a tavern in Allegheny County during which the proprietor was fatally shot in the back seven or eight times by appellant. Appellant presses two assignments of error to justify the reversal of the judgment of sentence and the grant of a new trial. We do not agree and now affirm.\nOn October 28, 1974, appellant, Mario DiGiacomo, and his friend, John Hruska, went to the \u201cSome Place Else\u201d Tavern owned by Raymond Anderson, the victim. During the course of the evening, a fight erupted between Hruska and Anderson. In the sequence of events which followed, appellant fired the shots which caused Anderson\u2019s death. At trial, appellant admitted causing the death of Anderson but asserted that he fired the shots in an effort to protect his friend, Hruska, from serious bodily injury. The first assignment of error charges that the Commonwealth improperly prevented Hruska from testifying and thereby denied appellant his Sixth Amendment Right to Compulsory Process.\nIs is unquestioned that our Federal Constitution assures the right of an accused to be provided with an adequate opportunity to present his version of the incident to the trier of fact. Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 18, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967); In Re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948).\nIn recognition of this right, this Court has required the Commonwealth to advise the defense of, and to make available to the defense is possible, all known eyewitnesses, Commonwealth v. Jones, 452 Pa. 569, 308 A.2d 598 (1973); Commonwealth v. Gray, 441 Pa. 91, 271 A.2d 486 (1970); Commonwealth v. Carter, 427 Pa. 53, 233 A.2d 284 (1967). We have however held that the Commonwealth has no duty to call as its witness an eyewitness if there is reason to believe, after examination or investigation, that the testimony of that witness would be unreliable or unworthy of belief. Commonwealth v. Horn, 395 Pa. 585, 150 A.2d 872 (1959); Commonwealth v. Palermo, 368 Pa. 28, 81 A.2d 540 (1951).\nHere the existence of the witness, Hruska, the knowledge possessed by him concerning the fateful events, and his whereabouts were known to the defense. The alleged violation of the Sixth Amendment in the instant appeal is the allegation that the Commonwealth improperly intimidated the witness and caused him to elect to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege and thereby made him unavailable as a defense witness. If the record bore out these contentions, there would be substantial merit in appellant\u2019s position. Cf. Webb v. Texas, 409 U.S. 95, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972); United States v. Smith, 156 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 478 F.2d 976 (1973).\nThe witness, Hruska, was subpoenaed by both the prosecution and the defense. The Commonwealth advised the court that it would not call Mr. Hruska as a witness because they were of the view that he was not worthy of belief. The Commonwealth concedes that during its trial preparation Mr. Hruska was interviewed. During that interview, Mr. Hruska was advised that evidence from other eyewitnesses strongly suggested that he might well have been an accessory to this crime. He was also advised of his right against self-incrimination. At some point after this interview, Mr. Hruska communicated to the defense his intention to' invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege if he was called as a witness in the matter.\nAlthough appellant alleged threats and intimidation, there is no evidence of what transpired during the pre-trial conference between the prosecutor and Mr. Hruska beyond that conceded by the Commonwealth and set forth above. Interestingly, there was no effort on the part of the defense to introduce additional evidence which would support their claim that the witness had been coerced to remain silent. See Commonwealth v. Sistrunk, 460 Pa. 655, 334 A.2d 280 (1975).\nWe do not believe under the facts of this case that the conduct of the prosecutor was improper or that he violated the Sixth Amendment rights of appellant. First, it is significant that the prosecutor did in fact have evidence from other sources which would tend to establish Mr. Hruska\u2019s criminal involvement in this murder. Secondly, there was no evidence to suggest that the decision to prosecute would depend upon whether his version of the event was favorable to the defense or the Commonwealth. The mere advising of one individual of his rights where there is a justifiable occasion for doing so, does not in turn infringe upon the constitutional rights of another even though the election to exercise those rights may deprive the other of a possible advantage in his defense. Here, there was a proper occasion for advising Mr. Hruska of the possible consequences of his testimony and thus the fact that he subsequently elected to invoke his privilege if called as a witness was not an impermissible infringement upon appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.\nThe appellant\u2019s reliance on Webb v. Texas, supra is clearly misplaced. In that case the trial judge gratuitously singled out the only defense witness and proceeded to admonish him as to the possible punishment for perjury. As a result of these remarks the witness refused to testify. That Court properly concluded that the selection of this particular witness, the excessively strong admonition, and the unwarranted assumption that this witness intended to lie, violated defendant\u2019s right to due process in that it \u201ceffectively drove witness off the stand.\u201d Here, where the occasion for the admonition was obvious and its nature was not that of a threat, there is no basis for finding a parallel with the facts in Webb, supra.\nIn his brief, appellant alludes to a more serious problem concerning the prosecutor\u2019s reference, during summation, to the failure of the defense to call Mr. Hruska, the appellant\u2019s friend, and the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion thereby that this omission would justify an inference that if called, the witness would have testified adversely to appellant\u2019s position. While defense counsel objected to these remarks when they were made, the objection to the propriety of the remarks and suggested inference was not properly preserved on post-trial motions and accordingly it is waived. Commonwealth v. Bronaugh, 459 Pa. 634, 331 A.2d 171 (1975); Commonwealth v. Reid, 458 Pa. 357, 326 A.2d 267 (1974); Commonwealth v. Goodman, 454 Pa. 358, 311 A.2d 652 (1973).\nAppellant\u2019s second and final argument concerns the trial judge\u2019s refusal to permit the introduction of certain hospital records where the doctor who made the records was unavailable to testify. The records were permitted to prove the fact of hospitalization and the duration of the hospital stay, but not to show diagnosis or medical opinion. Appellant asserts that they were admissible to show Mr. Hruska\u2019s injuries as well.\nThe law is clear that hospital records are admissible to show the fact of hospitalization, treatment prescribed, and symptoms given. Act of May 4, 1939, P.L. 42, No. 35, \u00a7 2, 28 P.S. \u00a7 91b; Commonwealth v. Mobley, 450 Pa. 431, 201 A.2d 622 (1973); Platt v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 361 Pa. 652, 66 A.2d 266 (1949). Medical opinion contained in the records and proffered as expert testimony is not admissible however where the doctor is not available for cross-examination. See Jones Appeal, 449 Pa. 543, 297 A.2d 117 (1972). Here, appellant attempted to have the custodian of records testify as to the admitting diagnosis of the injuries sustained. Such testimony is in the nature of expert opinion testimony and accordingly was properly excluded. See, generally, McCormick, Handbook of the Law of Evidence, 732 (2d ed. 1972).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS and POMEROY, JJ., filed concurring opinions.\nMANDERINO, J., concurs in the result.\n. The fact that Mr. Hruska may have properly invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid questions concerning the shooting did not prevent him from being called to establish that he had been intimated or threatened by the Commonwealth.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice\n(concurring).\nBecause I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s assertion that diagnoses contained in hospital records are never admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, I cannot join in the opinion of the Court.\nAppellant was charged with the murder of Raymond Anderson. At trial, appellant admitted he fired the fatal shot but asserted the homicide was justifiable because done to protect the life of a friend who was being beaten by the deceased. In order to demonstrate that his friend\u2019s life was truly endangered, appellant sought to introduce into evidence hospital records. These showed that, following the fracas, the friend was admitted to a hospital. They also contained the treating physician\u2019s diagnosis of the friend\u2019s injuries. Although appellant recognized that these records were hearsay, he maintained they were admissible under the business records exception statutorily created by the Act of May 4, 1939, P.L. 42, \u00a72,28 P.S. \u00a7 91b (1958).\nThe trial court admitted the records only in so far as they proved the fact of the friend\u2019s hospitalization and the duration of his stay in the hospital. It refused to admit that part of the record that contained the diagnosis of the physician who treated the friend.\nThe majority today breezily affirms the trial court\u2019s ruling, concluding that hospital records are admissible only to show the fact of hospitalization, treatment prescribed and symptoms given. It asserts, moreover, because the physician\u2019s diagnosis is opinion evidence, it is not admissible where the physician is not available to testify.\nIn my view, the majority\u2019s resolution of this issue is inconsistent with the rationale underlying the business and professional records exception to the hearsay rule. McCormick gives the following reasons for the exception:\n\u201cThe exception is justified on grounds analogous to those underlying other exceptions to the hearsay rule. Unusual reliability is regarded as furnished by the fact that in practice regular entries have a comparatively high degree of accuracy (as compared to other memoranda) because such books and records are customarily checked as to correctness by systematic balance-striking, because the very regularity and continuity of the records is calculated to train the record-keeper in habits of precision, and because in actual experience the entire business of the nation and many other activities constantly function in reliance upon entries of this kind.\u201d\nMcCormick\u2019s Handbook of the Law of Evidence \u00a7 306, at 720 (2d ed. E. Cleary, 1972). Wigmore finds that the fact that hospital records are \u201cmade and relied upon in affairs of life and death\u201d renders them especially reliable. VI Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1707, at 36 (3d ed. 1940).\nThe physician\u2019s diagnosis is probably the most important element in the hospital record in determining what treatment is necessary to preserve the patient\u2019s life and health. It would seem, therefore, that the reliability of the diagnosis is sufficiently safeguarded to allow its admission even where there is no opportunity for the non-offering party to cross-examine the recording physician. Cf. Commonwealth v. Harris, 351 Pa. 325, 41 A.2d 688 (1945).\nFurthermore, I question the efficacy of cross-examination to uncover discrepancies in the physician\u2019s diagnois. As Professor Wigmore has recognized,\n\u201c[a]'midst the day-to-day details of sources of hospital cases, the physicians and nurses can ordinarily recall from actual memory few or none of the specific data entered; they themselves rely upon the record of their own action; hence to call them to the stand would ordinarily add little or nothing to the information furnished by the record alone. The occasional errors and omissions, occurring in the routine work of a large staff, are no more an obstacle to the general trustworthiness of such records than are the errors of witnesses on the stand.\u201d\nWigmore, supra. See generally, 4 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, \u00b6 803(6) [04] (1975); but see McCormick, supra, \u00a7 313.\nFinally, although the use of the record deprives the non-offering party of the opportunity to explore the physician\u2019s qualifications, the fact that the diagnostician is a physician on the staff of a hospital assures at least minimal qualifications. The fact that no greater competence is indicated by the record can be adequately communicated to the jury.\nHowever, even assuming that there may be some danger in admitting diagnoses without cross-examination of the recording physician, this does not dictate that all records containing diagnoses must be excluded from evidence. Judge Weinstein reports that \u201cmost federal courts reached an accommodation between the need for relevant information and the fear of uncross-examined opinion. They drew a distinction between diagnoses involving \u2018conjecture and opinion\u2019 and diagnoses upon which \u2018competent physicians would not differ.\u2019 \u201d 4 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, \u00b6 803(b) [04] at 803-158 (1975). Records containing diagnoses tending toward the former were excluded, those tending toward the latter were not. McCormick finds a similar development in several state courts. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 313. A sample of cases in which other jurisdictions have held that, at least in some situations, diagnoses are admissible include Thomas v. Hogan, 308 F.2d 355 (4th Cir. 1962); Bailey v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & RR. Co., 261 Ala. 526, 75 So.2d 117 (1954); Tyron v. Casey, Kan.App., 416 S.W.2d 252 (1967); Brown v. St. Paul City Ry. Co., 241 Minn. 15, 62 N.W.2d 688 (1954) (dictum); Allen v. St. Louis, 365 Mo. 677, 285 S.W.2d 663 (1956); Weis v. Weis, 147 Ohio St. 416, 72 N.E.2d 245 (1947) (dictum); McReynolds v. Howland, 218 Or. 566, 346 P.2d 127 (1969); Travis Life Insurance Co. v. Rodriguez, 326 S.W.2d 256 (Tex.Ct.Civ.App.1959); Joseph v. W. H. Groves Latter Day Saints Hospital, 7 Utah 2d 39, 318 P.2d 330 (1957); Noland v. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co., 57 Wis.2d 633, 205 N.W.2d 388 (1963).\nOn th\u00e9 basis of these authorities, I cannot agree that a prohibition on the admission of all hospital records containing diagnoses is necessary. However, I need not determine in what circumstances diagnoses should be admissible or whether in the present case the report in question was admissible. In my view, the exclusion of the report if it were error, was harmless.\nAs stated previously, appellant sought to have admitted the hospital record to show that his friend had been badly beaten by the deceased. Although the trial court refused to admit the part of the record containing the physician\u2019s diagnosis, it did permit the admission of the part of the record indicating that the friend had to be hospitalized as a result of the struggle and that he remained thereafter in the hospital for two months. From this evidence, the jury must have realized that the deceased had inflicted an awful beating on appellant\u2019s friend. The evidence describing the exact nature of the friend\u2019s injuries which was contained in the physician\u2019s diagnosis would have virtually no additional effect on the . jury in light of other testimony about the beating. I am therefore convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that had the excluded evidence been admitted, it would have had no effect upon the judgment. Thus the error was harmless.\n. Section 91b provides:\n\u201cA record of an act, condition or event shall, in so far as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of business at or near the time of the act, condition or event, and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission.\u201d\n. To be sure, there is some support in the cases for the majority\u2019s holding. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Mobley, 450 Pa. 431, 301 A.2d 622 (1973); Platt v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 361 Pa. 652, 66 A.2d 266 (1949); see generally Commonwealth v. McCloud, 457 Pa. 310, 322 A.2d 653 (1973) (admission of autopsy report offered by prosecution in a murder trial violates confrontation clause). The statute itself is silent on this point.\nThere is apparently no question that the record otherwise met all the requirements of the act.\n. The arguments for and against the admission of diagnoses in hospital records are cogently summarized by Judge Weinstein:\n\u201cThose who objected to admission of records containing diagnoses argued that the \u2018difference between a \u201cfact\u201d and an \u201copinion\u201d is one of the fundamental differences in the law of evidence;\u2019 that \u2018under the traditional rules of evidence, a witness must be shown to be qualified before he is permitted to give an expert opinion;\u2019 that the accuracy of the'.'opinion cannot be evaluated without the safeguard of cross-examination; and that the jury would be so impressed by the opinion that even subsequent rebuttal could not overcome the initial reaction.\n\u201cBy contrast, proponents of the admissibility of medical records containing diagnostic opinions stressed the need for such evidence and the accuracy of such records on which \u2018[h]uman life will often depend.\u2019 They contend \u2018that if it is proven or judicially noticed that the hospital from which the records come is a reputable institution of high standards this would justify the inference that what purports to be diagnoses made by physicians are made by doctors duly qualified to give such opinions,\u2019 and they pointed out that the adversary \u2018may himself call the declarant and thus bring-out, if he can, any weaknesses of the diagnosis.\u2019 In addition, failure to call the doctor may permit an opponent a field day in showing \u2018shortcomings\u2019 in the procedures used which might have been readily explained if the doctor who prepared the report was present; there is a self-limiting feature that minimized abuse.\u201d\n4 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 803(b)[04] at 803-156-58 (1975) (footnotes omitted).\n. Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) not permits the admission of diagnoses whether they are routine or speculative. The rule, however, permits the trial court to exclude a particular record where indications of trustworthiness are lacking. The rule permits admission of:\n\u201cA memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, unless the source of information or the method or cirumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. The term \u2018business\u2019 as used in this paragraph includes business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for profit.\u201d\nPub.L.
