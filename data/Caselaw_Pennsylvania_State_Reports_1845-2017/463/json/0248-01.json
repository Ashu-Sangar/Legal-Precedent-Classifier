Thereafter he filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and denial of his constitutional rights generally.\nAlthough the specific grounds for relief alleged in the petition were meritless, appellant requested permission to amend the petition claiming to have a meritorious basis for PCHA relief. The PCHA court denied permission to amend and dismissed the petition without a hearing. By its per curiam order today, this Court affirms that order. I dissent.\nThe Post Conviction Hearing Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7 7, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-7 (Supp.1975) provides: \u201cAmendment shall be freely allowed in order to achieve substantial justice. No petition may be dismissed for want of particularity unless the petitioner is first given an opportunity to clarify his petition.\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Satchell, 430 Pa. 443, 450-51, 243 A.2d 381, 384 (1968).\nI would therefore reverse the order and remand with directions to allow the amendment.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\nAct of January 25 (Supp.1975), 1966, P.L.
