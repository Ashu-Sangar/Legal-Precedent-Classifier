        "text": "POMEROY, Judge\n(dissenting).\nThis case presents the question of the appealability by the Commonwealth of an order by the lower court permitting the defendant-appellee, pursuant to Rule 310 of our Rules of Criminal Procedure, to inspect and copy a tape recorded confession made by the defendant, together with police notes of any oral statements made by appellee during interrogation. After specially allowing the Commonwealth to appeal and hearing oral argument, the Court today dismisses the appeal as improvidently granted. For the reasons stated hereinafter, I would permit the appeal to stand and reverse the order of discovery in part.\nIn my view, the Court\u2019s reliance upon Commonwealth v. Gullett, 459 Pa. 431, 329 A.2d 513 (1974) and the cases cited therein as authority for dismissing the appeal is misplaced. Gullett was a case in which the Commonwealth sought to appeal an order suppressing certain evidence which the Commonwealth proposed to use at the trial of the defendant Gullett. We there stated the rule that \u201cthe Commonwealth may appeal from an adverse ruling below where it appears either that the order of suppression will necessitate the termination and conclusion of the prosecution or that the adverse order will substantially impair the prosecution in the presentation of its case. Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 190 A.2d 304, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 204, 11 L.Ed.2d 149 (1963).\u201d Id. at 435, 329 A.2d at 515 (emphasis added). It is clear that the Court in Gullett was referring solely to the appealability by the Commonwealth of orders of suppression. In the case of orders granting discovery we have never, to my knowledge, established similar requirements.\nAs to discovery orders, we have in the past permitted the Commonwealth to seek a writ of prohibition against their enforcement by the lower court. Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Shiomos, 457 Pa. 104, 320 A.2d 134 (1974); Commonwealth v. Caplan, 411 Pa. 563, 192 A.2d 894 (1963). In Shiomos, I expressed reservations as to whether that extraordinary remedy should be available for the purpose of challenging an order of discovery. See the concurring opinion of this writer, 457 Pa. at 110-111 n. 1, 320 A.2d at 137 n. 1. I believe that an appeal is the preferable route for the Commonwealth to follow in circumstances such as these, where there has been an adverse ruling on a point of law in the trial court which raises serious question as to the scope of one of our rules of criminal procedure. The basis for permitting an appeal (or for entertaining a petition for a writ of prohibition) is the simple fact that if we were not to do so the Commonwealth would forever be precluded from litigating the issue of the validity of the order of discovery. Win or lose at trial, the Commonwealth obviously has no opportunity to appeal at that state. Failure of the Court to consider the issue now forecloses any opportunity for appellate review. Because the issue raised by the appeal is important, see Shiomos, supra at 108, 320 A.2d at 136, we should not hesitate to consider its merits.\nRule 310 provides in its entirety:\n\u201cAll applications of a defendant for pretrial discovery and inspection shall be made not less than five days prior to the scheduled date of trial. The court may order the attorney for the Commonwealth to permit the defendant or his attorney, and such persons as are necessary to \u00e1ssist him, to inspect and copy or photograph any written confessions and written statements made by the defendant. No other discovery or inspection shall be ordered except upon proof by the defendant, after hearing, of exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons. The order shall specify the time, place and manner of making discovery or inspection and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are necessary and proper. In no event, however, shall the court order pretrial discovery or inspection of written statements of witnesses in the possession of the Commonwealth. Adopted June 30, 1964. Eff. Jan. 1, 1965.\u201d\nAs can be plainly seen, the rule limits discovery, absent \u201cexceptional circumstances and compelling reasons\u201d, to a defendant\u2019s \u201cwritten confessions and written statements.\u201d While the term \u201cwritten\u201d literally refers only to something expressed in writing, for the purposes of the rule I would interpret the rule to permit discovery of sound recordings of a defendant\u2019s confession or statements. Like a writing, recordings are in permanent form and indubitably pertain to the defendant. Such a view is in accord with the preferable interpretation given to the applicability of the \u201cbest evidence\u201d or \u201coriginal writing\u201d rule. McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 232 at 562 (2d ed. 1972). Therefore I would permit the lower court\u2019s order to stand insofar as it permitted discovery of the defendant\u2019s tape recorded statement.\nOn the other hand, I do not believe that by any reasonable interpretation of our current rule the defendant is entitled to discovery of the notes made by interrog\u00e1ting police officers of oral statements made by the defendant. Such notes are not the defendant\u2019s statements but the police officer\u2019s recollection of what the defendant said. Furthermore, such notes may well contain the observations and reflect the impressions and opinions of the questioning officer. A defendant is not entitled to this information and I am of the opinion that the lower court erred in permitting the defendant to copy and inspect any such notes.\nOne further point deserves mention. While I continue of the belief that our rule relating to discovery should be liberalized, see my concurring opinion in Shiomos, 457 Pa. at 110-111, 320 A.2d at 137-38, I believe that revision of that sort must occur through the orderly process of amendment rather than haphazardly, on a piecemeal basis. As Mr. Justice Eagen so aptly put it in Shiomos: \u201cIf the rules are liberalized on a case by case basis by this Court, or by individual interpretation by lower court judges, the inevitable result would be judicial inconsistency and confusion. The undesirability and unfairness of this result is self-evident.\u201d 457 Pa. at 110, 320 A.2d at 137.\n. 19 P.S. (1975 Pamphlet).\n. Rule 16(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specifically permits discovery of any relevant \u201cwritten or recorded statements\u201d by a defendant.\n. See also Rule 1001 et seq. of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n. Not even the liberal federal rules would permit discovery of the actual notes made by an interrogating officer; they would constitute work product, which is specifically nondiscoverable. Rule 16(a)(2). A defendant, however, is entitled under the rule to the \"substance of any oral statement which the government intends to offer in evidence at the trial made by the defendant.\u201d Rule 16(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).",
