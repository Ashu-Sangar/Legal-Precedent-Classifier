The Commonwealth Court reversed the judgment due to governmental immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8541-8564, holding that the “sidewalk exception,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(7), did not pierce the city’s immunity in this case.

Her fall caused serious injury, and she brought a personal injury action against the city. The city raised the defense of governmental immunity under the tort claims act, moving for summary judgment, which was denied, and the case was tried on stipulated facts. Judgment was entered for appellant in the stipulated amount of $203,500.</p>

The city argues that because grease does not derive or originate from the sidewalk, it is not a defect of the sidewalk itself; therefore, as a matter of law, grease cannot be considered a dangerous condition of the sidewalk.

Clearly, the Legislature could not have intended to hold the City to such a duty with regard to its sidewalks without intending it to be liable for injuries resulting from a breach of such duty. Once again, all that is required for the exception to apply is a dangerous condition of the sidewalk of which the City possessed actual or constructive notice, and I conclude that few citizens of this Commonwealth would agree that grease on a sidewalk does not, <em>and can never, </em>constitute a dangerous condition of the sidewalk.</p>
    <p id="b802-5" data-blocks='[["BL_802.5",802,[251,1492,1154,468]]]'>This proposition is further borne out by the Majority’s conclusion that piercing the Commonwealth agency’s immunity is warranted only upon proof of things such as the existence of an “improperly designed sidewalk, and improperly constructed sidewalk, or a badly maintained, deteriorating, crumbling sidewalk.” Maj. Op. at p. 605. Obviously, as a practical matter, a sidewalk cannot act in a negligent manner. Rather, it is conduct attributable to the political subdivision that is being subject to scrutiny.</p>

Similarly, the City’s potential liability for a sidewalk that is dangerous by virtue of defective design or construction would result from the negligence of the individuals who created the defective design or performed the defective construction for the City. Given this, I cannot comprehend how the Majority can logically conclude <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>that the negligence of the City in depositing the grease and/or in failing to correct the dangerous condition it knew about somehow compels a different result.</p>

During the pendency of this particular appeal the Commonwealth Court rendered a decision in the case of <em>McRae v. School District of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/a2d/660/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="660 A.2d 209" data-case-ids="7867296" data-case-paths="/a2d/660/0209-01">660 A.2d 209</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1995). The Plaintiff in that case slipped and fell on hills and ridges of ice remaining on the improperly maintained sidewalk abutting the McMichael School in Philadelphia. The trial court entered judgment on the pleadings for the school district and the Commonwealth Court affirmed. The Commonwealth Court, relying upon its earlier opinion in <em>Finn, </em>(now being affirmed by the Majority) determined that snow and ice are not defects emanating from the real estate itself; therefore liability does not attach. The impact of this absurd conclusion that the defect must emanate from the sidewalk itself is glaringly obvious when taken to such an absurd extreme as was done by the <em>McRae </em>decision. Do we really want to send a message to our school districts that they no longer need to carefully remove the snow and ice from their sidewalks?</p>
