The sole issue raised by Appellant is whether the Superior Court erred in concluding that her cause of action for negligent procurement of criminal proceedings was invalid as a matter of law. For the following reasons, we affirm the entry of summary judgment.</p>
    <p id="b358-12" data-blocks='[["BL_358.11",358,[234,1731,1153,530]]]'>Appellant was employed as a secretary from February 20, 1986, to March 6, 1986, at Green Acres Home Park (Green Acres), a mobile home park owned by Appellee, Fred Jaindl. The other Appellees, Mark Jaindl and Margaret Wehinger, were Appellant’s superiors at Green Acres. In March 1987, Joyce Reed, an employee of Green Acres, notified Mark Jaindl that although certain rents had been paid, the money had not been deposited in the bank. Mark, who was the financial controller for Green Acres, conducted his own investigation and confirmed that rent money was missing.</p>

Ryan of the Pennsylvania State Police, who conducted an investigation <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>into the matter. Trooper Ryan concluded that the money had been stolen, and arrested Appellant as the prime suspect. At Appellant’s preliminary hearing, the district justice concluded that the Commonwealth had established a prima facie case on the charges of theft by failure to make the required disposition of funds, theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and tampering with records of identification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Following a jury trial, Appellant was acquitted of all charges.</p>

Appellant also filed complaints on these same counts against Mark Jaindl and Margaret Wehinger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellees filed preliminary objections, which the trial court dismissed, and the court consolidated all related actions.

When the parties appeared for trial in March, Appellant indicated that she wanted to amend her pleadings and the trial was continued.

However, even a cursory reading of these cases indicates that negligent procurement of criminal proceedings was not an issue in either case; <em>Little </em>involved a claim of negligent misrepresentation, <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>§ 552, and <em>Motheral </em>involved claims of malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of mental distress, and negligent supervision. In fact, our research has not revealed any jurisdiction which has considered the tort which Appellant proclaims we already recognize, nor have we uncovered any other authority which indicates that negligent procurement of criminal proceedings is a cognizable cause of action. Thus, we must consider Appellant’s remaining arguments as an attempt to have us recognize negligent procurement of criminal proceedings as a new cause of action.</p>

In <em>Davis, </em>police were investigating the robbery of Equibank when Malesky, one of the bank tellers and an eyewitness, identified Davis as the alleged perpetrator from a photo array.
