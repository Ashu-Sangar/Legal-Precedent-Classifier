Instead, it argues that because the MA appeal procedure does not contain a provision granting interest on improperly held cost reimbursements and the HIM-15 does, no conflict exists and HIM-15 controls.

Both HIM-15 and the state manual contained provisions regarding the allowance of interest expense and the offsetting of interest income. The state manual, however, was silent as to related party or home office investment income. The Court therefore held that the federal manual applied since it provided detailed cost accounting procedures in that regard. In the instant case, the state manual is not silent on the issue of MA provider appeals.</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[200,1003,1156,826]]]'>Another significant distinction is that in Northwood» the issue directly involved an allowable operating cost, i.e., a subsidiary nursing home’s allowable capital indebtedness expense. Section 1181.65, which directs us to the federal manual when the manuals differ, applies to “allowable operating costs.” Here, Western Reserve is appealing the denial of <em>interest </em>on an underpayment of reimbursement of allowable costs. We question whether § 1181.65 is even applicable under these circumstances. Allowable costs are defined in the Code as “[c]osts which are necessary and reasonable to the proper care of Medical Assistance patients and which are identified in this subchapter.” 55 Pa.Code § 1181.2102. An interest payment on additional monies paid to a provider as a result of its successful legal appeal is not a cost “necessary and reasonable to the proper care” of MA patients and therefore not an “operating cost.”</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[199,1852,1154,463]]]'>In summary, the DPW is not required to pay MA providers interest on underpayments of reimbursements for nursing home services. The appeal process in the federal manual, which includes an interest provision, does not govern MA provider appeals since the state manual has its own appeal provisions. The Commonwealth Court therefore erred in remanding the case for calculation of interest according to federal regulations. The order of the Commonwealth Court is hereby reversed.</p>
