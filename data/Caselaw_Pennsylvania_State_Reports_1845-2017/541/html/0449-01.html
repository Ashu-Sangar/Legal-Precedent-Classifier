No appeal was taken and Appellant filed a praecipe to enter judgment on July 30,1987. State Auto paid the $25,000 policy limit.

When the $25,000 policy limit was paid by State Auto, the outstanding judgment of $75,000 was reduced to $50,000. By accepting the $50,000 underinsurance benefits from Erie, Appellant did not reduce the <em>amount </em>of the tortfeasor’s liability. Beane is still liable for $50,000. The question becomes <em>to whom </em>is he liable. Because we are not dealing with a situation where the liability of a tortfeasor is being reduced or extinguished, the collateral source rule does not apply.</p>

    <p id="b652-7" data-blocks='[["BL_652.7",652,[244,1107,1161,1069]]]'>For example, in footnote two the Majority claims that “[tjhere is no basis in law for a [bad faith garnishment action].... ” Op. at p. 453. Although this Court has never addressed this issue and does not now have the opportunity to address it here because the issue was not raised, this type of action has been recognized by the lower courts of our Commonwealth. <em>See, e.g., Shearer v. Reed, </em><a href="/pa-super/286/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="286 Pa.

The Majority’s statement in footnote three that “[t]here is no common law remedy in Pennsylvania for bad faith on the part of insurers” is also an incorrect assessment of law. Granted, a common law action for bad faith based on <em>tort </em>law was rejected by our Court. <em>D'Ambrosio v. Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/494/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="494 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1769147" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0501-01">494 Pa. 501</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="494 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1769147" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0501-01">431 A.2d 966</a> (1981).

For example, in footnote two, the Majority cites <em>Gray v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/422/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="422 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1901730" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0500-01">422 Pa. </a><a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a><a href="/pa/422/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="422 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1901730" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0500-01">500</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%208" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="223 A.2d 8">223 A.2d 8</a> (1966) for the proposition that an actual assignment from Beane to Johnson was required here. In <em>Gray, </em>the tortfeasor had in fact assigned his bad faith cause of action against his insurance company to the injured party; <em>Gray </em>did not, however, mandate such an assignment. Furthermore, I am uncertain as to the applicability of <em>Gray </em>since the cause of action in <em>Gray </em>was one in <em>assumpsit, </em>and thus a direct action, rather than <em>garnishment </em>as was the case here. It would seem that this distinguishing fact may indeed be critical and render <em>Gray </em>inapplicable under the present facts even if the issue had been raised here.</p>
    <p id="b653-5" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[228,956,1154,261]]]'>It is beyond peradventure that the Majority’s discussion in footnotes two and three is dictum and devoid of precedential authority.
