    <p id="b735-5" data-blocks='[["BL_735.4",735,[183,729,1156,1415]]]'>The evidence regarding Clara Johnson, a six foot tall black woman, was that on August 5,1992, while she waited for a cab at the Uptown Grill (a bar in Harrisburg), appellant and a friend of his offered her a ride. After the friend was dropped off, Johnson testified that she asked appellant to take her back to the bar because she had only consented to the ride when she believed that the friend would be present. Appellant pretended to agree to take her back to the Uptown Grill, but, after stopping at a mini-market for cigarettes and gasoline, he began driving in a direction away from the Uptown Grill, and in a direction away from Johnson’s home. Johnson became nervous and, when she tried to get appellant to stop the car, a struggle ensued. Appellant told Johnson that he had something to do with her and that she “wasn’t going anywhere.” Appellant proceeded to drive at a high rate of speed to an isolated area near Conrail train tracks and, when Johnson tried to jump from the moving vehicle, appellant slammed on the brakes, causing the car door to hit her in the head, dazing her. Appellant then attempted to run over Johnson with the car, but she fell down an embankment. Upon finding her approximately a half mile away from the car, appellant beat her in the head and face and raped her. After consuming a beer, he bound her with duct tape, and placed a knife to her throat. Appellant then informed Johnson that he was going to rape her again, after which he would have to kill her. He also told Johnson that all women were alike and that he had killed other women.</p>

By happenstance, a Conrail security officer came upon the scene as appellant was dragging Johnson to the ditch. Upon seeing the Conrail officer, appellant fled on foot, leaving behind his car with a bloody knife stuck in the "window well. Clara Johnson fortunately survived her ordeal and testified against appellant.</p>
    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.4",736,[260,732,1156,898]]]'>A registration check of the car left at the scene revealed that it belonged to appellant. Based on this information and on Johnson’s statement, police went to appellant’s home at 6:00 a.m. the next morning, August 6, 1992, to arrest him. Appellant fled to the roof of a multi-story apartment building, where he was apprehended after a six-hour standoff during which he had threatened to jump. Appellant was arrested and charged "with the rape, aggravated assault, kidnapping and attempted murder of Clara Johnson. After being read and waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant told Detective Thomas Brennan that Johnson had voluntarily accompanied him to the Conrail yard to have sex, and that a fight had ensued after an argument. At the end of the interview, Detective Brennan told appellant that he believed appellant had probably been involved in other assaults and that appellant could get in touch with him if he wished to provide further information or take him to any other bodies.</p>

Pursuant to appellant’s request, Detective Brennan and appellant met at the prison between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. After again waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant further stated to Detective Brennan that he had killed a woman named Selina Franklin in 1987, and told Detective Brennan that he would take him to the body. Appellant also asked at the meeting to speak to a representative of the District Attorney’s Office. Complying with appellant’s request, Detective Brennan transported appellant to the District Attorney’s Office at about 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. to meet with First Assistant District Attorney William Tully. En <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>route to the District Attorney’s Office, appellant told the detective that he had killed yet another woman in 1989, but that he did not recall her name.</p>
    <p id="b737-5" data-blocks='[["BL_737.4",737,[185,520,1155,405]]]'>At the District Attorney’s Office, appellant told Mr. Tully, in Detective Brennan’s presence, that he had committed several homicides and wanted the death penalty because he did not wish to further embarrass his family. Appellant further told Mr. Tully that the bodies were located at the Swatara Township landfill. While awaiting the assistance of other police departments to join in the search of the landfill, appellant gave Detective Brennan more details of the murders.</p>
    <p id="b737-6" data-blocks='[["BL_737.5",737,[186,956,1154,829]]]'>Specifically, appellant said in his statement that he had picked up Selina Franklin and her friends,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and, after dropping off the other women at their homes, he took Franklin to the landfill where Franklin agreed to have sex with him for thirty-five dollars. He told Detective Brennan that after having sex with Franklin, he found an electrical insulator with which he beat Franklin over the head until she was dead.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> He then retrieved the thirty-five dollars from her pocket. Appellant said that several days after being questioned by police in connection with Franklin’s disappearance, he had returned to the landfill, located the body and moved it to a different location, removed some of the victim’s clothing and scattered it around the landfill and buried the body along with the insulator. When he returned again several months later, he found bones sticking out of the ground, which he threw down a hill.</p>

Appellant told the detective that sometime in 1989, he had picked up this second victim on the streets of Harrisburg and <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>taken her to the same landfill where he had taken Franklin and that he and the second victim had sexual intercourse. He then took a piece of pipe from a junked car with which he beat her over the head until she was dead. Appellant told Detective Brennan that he then dragged her a short distance off the access road through the landfill and coveréd her body, along with the pipe, with lumber, shingles and tires.</p>
    <p id="b738-4" data-blocks='[["BL_738.4",738,[252,737,1151,311]]]'>Appellant also recounted the assault on Johnson which led to his arrest. Although appellant claimed that Johnson had accompanied him to the Conrail yard voluntarily and that they had had consensual sex, he also told Detective Brennan that sometimes he just got “the urge to go out, pick up a black female, rape her and kill her.” (N.T. 159).</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.5",738,[247,1073,1155,851]]]'>After his detailed statement to the first deputy D.A. and Detective Brennan, appellant was taken to the Swatara Township landfill between 6:00 and 7:00 that evening, where he pointed out the general location of the two bodies to police. Because police were not equipped to conduct a search at night, appellant agreed to return to the landfill the next morning to aid in the search for the bodies. On August 12, 1992, Detectives Brennan and Wenner secured appellant from the prison, advised him once again of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he waived, and took him to the landfill. During the drive, appellant marked two areas on an aerial photograph provided by the detectives as the general areas where the bodies were located. These corresponded to the areas he had indicated the previous night. En route to the landfill, appellant began to laugh for no apparent reason and told Detective Brennan that he previously had been lying about the murders.</p>

The position of the body indicated that it had been dragged to the location where it was discovered.

      <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>Here, the trial court expressly allowed testimony by Johnson and others regarding the Johnson incident for the limited purpose of establishing a common scheme, plan or design. The common scheme was relevant to establish that appellant was the person who had committed the murders of Franklin and McDuffey and to establish that appellant possessed the requisite mental state to commit first degree murder. Thus, the issue is whether there was a logical connection between the crimes that would allow admission of this evidence to prove the identity of the perpetrator and the appellant’s <em>mens rea of </em>the murder. In the three incidents at issue here, all three victims were tall, heavy-set black women who, for one reason or another, initially consented to get into appellant’s car voluntarily. Each was then taken against their will at night from Harrisburg to remote, unlit areas used as dumping grounds. Appellant contended that all three women consented to have sex with him, even though Johnson denied consenting to sexual intercourse. All three women were severely beaten in the head and face with blunt objects, and at least two of the women, Johnson and Franklin, were bound. These facts, when taken together, establish that appellant had a common design in luring similar type victims into his vehicle, taking them to remote areas for sexual purposes against their will and brutally beating them in a similar manner, attempting to cause or causing their deaths. <em>Commonwealth v.
