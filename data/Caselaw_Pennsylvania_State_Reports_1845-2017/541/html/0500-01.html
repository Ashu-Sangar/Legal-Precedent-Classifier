Thus, in order to serve justice an accommodation must be made, however, that arrangement should not place the “witness” in a better position as to possible criminal prosecution than he had previously enjoyed. A grant of immunity should protect the witness from prosecution through his own words, yet it should not be so broad that the witness is forever free from suffering the just consequences of his actions, if his actions can be proven by means other than his own words.</p>

However, to elevate the right against self-incrimination above the right of the public to every person’s evidence would not achieve a proper balance of these competing interests. Transactional immunity offers complete <em>amnesty </em>to the witness, a measure of protection clearly greater than the privilege against self-incrimination. The practical consequences, otherwise known as the “web effect,” created by immunizing a witness should not tip the balance so far in favor of the witness that the Commonwealth is only left with the option of granting complete amnesty to a witness in order to fully investigate criminal enterprises and serve the public need for justice. Use/derivative use immunity strikes a better balance between the need for law enforcement to ferret out criminality and the right of the witness to be free of self-incrimination.</p>

Generally three types of immunity are recognized, although some scholars treat "use” and "use and derivative use” immunity as one and the same. <em>See </em>Leonard Sosnov, <em>Criminal Procedural Rights Under the Pennsylvania Constitution: Examining the Present and Exploring the Future, </em>3 Widener Journal of Public Law 217 (1993). "Use” immunity provides immunity only for the testimony actually given pursuant to the order compelling said testimony. “Use and derivative use” immunity enlarges the scope of the grant to cover any information or leads that were derived from the actual testimony given under compulsion. Thus, under either "use” or "use and derivative use” immunity a prosecution against the witness is not foreclosed; any prosecution must, however, arise from evidence unrelated to the information which is derived from the witness’ own mouth. "Transactional” immunity is the most expansive, as it in essence provides complete amnesty to the witness for any transactions which are revealed in the course of the compelled testimony.

However, we find <em>D’Elia </em>to be strictly limited to its facts which involved testimony being compelled from a witness before the Crime Commission, a body not recognized as empowered to grant immunity under the Act at issue. Our conclusion is based upon the fact that only two members of the <em>D’Elia </em>Court joined in the opinion of Mr. Justice Zappala, while the other four members of the Court joined in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Papadakos. Clearly a majority of the court failed to endorse the reasoning set forth in <em>D’Elia.</em>
