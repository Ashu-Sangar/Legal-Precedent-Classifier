Lee, his girlfriend, and his child, had lived with Mrs. Brown and her four children for approximately one year before Mrs. Brown asked him to leave. On February 26,1986, between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Lee and Cox knocked on the front door of the Browns’ apartment and asked to use the telephone. After Sonya Brown, one of Mrs. Brown’s daughters, refused to let him in, Lee repeatedly kicked and banged on the door for several minutes. Lee then wrote a message with a magic marker on door which read, “All you bitches, hit man Butter.”</p>

At approximately 2:00 a.m., Denise Williams, a neighbor of the Browns, saw the two men standing outside the Browns’ front door. Williams observed Cox conversing through the closed door and heard the voice of one of the female occupants of the apartment while Lee stood to the side with his back against the wall, outside the view of the peephole in the door.</p>

Gilbert had known Lee and his mother since Lee was a child, and Lee had occasionally stayed with Gilbert after he was evicted from the Browns’ apartment. Lee awoke Gilbert and told him, “I did something bad.” (N.T. 5/1/87,1075-76). He then admitted, “I stabbed Evelyn.” (N.T. 5/1/87, 1076). Lee then took some clothes that he had left at Gilbert’s apartment, put them in a bag, and said that he was going to his mother’s house.</p>

Her hands and feet had been tied behind her back and she was in a kneeling position with her back against the bed. A pair of panties had been stuffed into her mouth.

The police recovered two knives, a pair of scissors, and various items of clothing that were removed from Lee’s person. Although it was never established that the knives and scissors were actually used in the commission of the killings, they were consistent with the types of wounds inflicted upon the two victims. In addition, lab analysis of Lee’s clothes confirmed that human blood was present on his pants and sneakers; however, there was not a sufficient quantity of blood to determine a blood type. Likewise, a blood type could not be ascertained from the soap obtained from the crime scene because the substances in the blood that would have allowed an identification had been destroyed by the soap.</p>

When viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, the evidence, and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom, must support the jury’s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

Gilbert’s testimony consisted primarily of Lee’s admission that he killed Evelyn Brown. At the conclusion of the hearing, the presiding judge found probable cause to hold Lee over for trial for the deaths of both Evelyn Brown and Tina Brown. It is Lee’s position that insufficient evidence was presented to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case with respect to the homicide of Tina Brown.

The Commonwealth clearly met its burden of proving the offense beyond a reasonable doubt in this case as evidenced by the jury’s determination of Lee’s guilt for the murder of Tina Brown. Moreover, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the presiding judge should have recused himself from the preliminary hearing, the jury’s guilty verdict renders harmless any allegation of such impropriety. Accordingly, Lee’s arguments concerning the defects in his preliminary hearing must be rejected as meritless.</p>

Additionally, Lee claims that he was prejudiced by the admission into evidence of three of Cox’s statements to police which implicated Lee in the killings.

The four mitigating circumstances were: that the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); that the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2); the age of the defendant at the time of the crime, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); and other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).</p>

Lee does, however, claim that the prosecutor, while reading one of Cox's redacted statements in open court, either intentionally or accidently read the name "Percy" instead of "X.” Our review of the record reveals that this allegation is meritless.

The prosecutor indicated to the trial court that he intended to use the medical examiner’s testimony to establish the approximate time of death of the victims. (N.T. 4/30/87, 996). On appeal before this Court, the Commonwealth represents that the prosecutor elicited the testimony “to show that the bodies had remained in place for an extended period, so as to establish defendant's opportunity to commit the crimes."

      <blockquote id="b470-9" data-blocks='[["BL_470.8",470,[325,2058,1085,153]]]'>It is conceded that an evidentiary hearing was never held regarding the character witness issue in this matter.

Lee fails to cite another portion of the closing argument where the assistant district attorney stated, "I say they should die.” (N.T. 5/22/87, 2429). Following an objection by defense counsel, the court promptly admonished the jury that they were not to construe the prosecutor’s comments as an opinion concerning the credibility or weight of the evidence. (N.T. 5/22/87, 2429). The assistant district attorney then advised the jury, "That’s not my personal opinion. That's my opinion based on reading this law, knowing how it should be applied, and looking at the facts in this case, I say based on that, they should die.” (N.T. 5/22/87, 2429-30). Based on the trial court’s limiting instruction and the context of these comments, we conclude that this comment likewise does not entitle Lee to relief.</p>
