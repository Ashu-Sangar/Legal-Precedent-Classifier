Miller, Jr., appeals an order of the Superior Court which affirmed the judgment of the Clinton County Court of Common Pleas following a verdict in favor of The Brass Rail Tavern, Inc. and Thomas E. McMaster, Appellees. We granted allocatur in this case in order to address whether a non-physician coroner can testify as to time of death.</p>
    <p id="b671-6" data-blocks='[["BL_671.6",671,[183,865,1153,796]]]'>This action, brought pursuant to the Dram Shop Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> was commenced after Ronald A. Miller, Jr. was killed in an automobile accident. During a non-jury trial, it was established that on July 8, 1989, the day prior to the accident, Ronald, Jr. began consuming alcoholic beverages around 12:00 noon while riding all terrain vehicles with two of his friends. After spending the afternoon together, Ronald, Jr. and his friends went to a local tavern in Beech Creek called Bobby’s Place. The group remained at Bobby’s Place for approximately one hour, and, in that time, Ronald, Jr. consumed at least two beers. Thereafter, and having been joined by yet another companion, the group of friends decided to proceed to The Brass Rail Tavern in Lock Haven. However, before they left Bobby’s Place, they purchased a six-pack of beer which they consumed, in part, while en route to The Brass Rail.</p>
    <p id="b671-7" data-blocks='[["BL_671.7",671,[184,1687,1152,633]],["BL_672.1",672,[262,337,1148,246]]]'>They arrived at The Brass Rail at approximately 10:30 p.m., and again began to consume alcoholic beverages. Around 1:30 a.m. on July 9, 1989, the bartender announced the last opportunity to purchase alcohol. At that point, the group decided to return home. Before actually leaving the tavern, Ronald, Jr. attempted to buy more beer. However, because last call had already been given, his request was refused. Thereupon, the group set out to return to the Beech Creek area, but based on Ronald, Jr.’s inability to drive safely, another member of the group, Kevin Peters, drove Ronald, Jr.’s vehicle. Kevin drove to his house first, and, at that point, Ronald, Jr. resumed operation of the vehicle. Ronald, Jr. dropped his other two <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>friends off between 2:15 a.m. and 2:30 a.m., but before parting company with them, Ronald, Jr. indicated that he intended to return to The Brass Rail Tavern. Some time later, Ronald, Jr. was involved in the tragic accident which resulted in his death.</p>
    <p id="b672-4" data-blocks='[["BL_672.4",672,[256,616,1157,939]]]'>At trial, Appellant called the Clinton County Coroner, Dean Wetzler, to testify based upon his investigations at the scene of the accident. At that point, Appellees requested an offer of proof with respect to the testimony of the coroner. After Appellant provided the court with a synopsis of the coroner’s expected testimony, Appellees objected to that portion of the coroner’s testimony which would otherwise constitute expert opinion. Appellees based their objection on Appellant’s failure to identify the coroner as an expert witness in pre-trial interrogatories. The trial court determined that pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 4003.5(b) the coroner would not be permitted to testify to expert matters, and more specifically, to the time of death. In addition to the discovery issue, the trial judge also addressed a competency issue, concluding that only an individual with a medical degree could render an opinion with regard to the time of death. Therefore, the trial judge excluded the coroner’s testimony on that basis as well.</p>

Even though the judge concluded that Appellant had proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that The Brass Rail Tavern had served Ronald, Jr. while he was visibly intoxicated, the court concluded that Appellant had failed to establish a causal link between the negligence of the Appellees and the accident which resulted in Ronald, Jr.’s death. Specifically, the court determined that</p>

The difficulty with this argument is that there is no evidence from which the Court can infer that the accident <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>occurred at 3:00 A.M., or for that matter at 4:00 A.M., 5:00 A.M., 6:00 A.M., or even 7:00 A.M.

Although he testified that he had determined time of death previously, he did not indicate the number of cases in which he had done so. He did not explain the methodology he used, his basis of knowledge, his investigative techniques, nor his background in this area of forensics.
