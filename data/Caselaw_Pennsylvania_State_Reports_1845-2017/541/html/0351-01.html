Given this enormous volume of criminal cases processed in Philadelphia County, it was impossible for the duly-elected District Attorney to be personally familiar with the details of each and every criminal case prosecuted by his assistants and deputy district attorneys during his or her tenure.</p>

As for petitioner’s appeal to this Court in 1990, I am not aware of any materials indicating that I personally reviewed petitioner’s criminal file or otherwise personally participated in the prosecution of petitioner’s matter as an advisor, or as a trial or appellate attorney. Indeed, to the best of my knowledge and recollection, I have no factual information about petitioner’s underlying criminal case other than the knowledge and information contained in the petitions and briefs that I have reviewed through my duties as a Justice of this Court. I have not prejudged petitioner’s matter nor would I prejudge it simply because I served as a District Attorney and had a general responsibility for all matters that fell within my official capacity, this being one of the many. Given the absence of personal involvement with petitioner’s matter while I served as District Attorney, and upon review of the relevant case law, I see no reason to recuse myself in this matter.</p>
