The first of these states that because the Act only contemplates payment to those who have suffered a work related injury, appellee must have suffered such an injury or the Board could not properly have granted her Petition for Commutation. This reasoning is fallacious.</p>
    <p id="b685-10" data-blocks='[["BL_685.10",685,[232,1484,1153,908]],["BL_686.1",686,[253,345,1151,142]]]'>Here there was never a claim for benefits. Rather, due to the severity of appellee’s injuries, the insurance company for the employer filed a notice of compensation payable, and proceeded to provide benefits while appellee was too disabled to work. The Board commuted these (unsought) benefits to a lump sum because appellee perceived this to be in her interests, noting at the same time that, by agreement, the money would be repayable were it recovered in a common law tort suit. <em>Kohler v. McCrory Stores </em>clearly accepts the regularity of such an arrangement, observing that “There is a significant difference between the situation where an employee requests and is awarded benefits by a referee and where he simply accepts benefits through Notice of Compensation Payable <em>and!or agreement.” </em>Moreover, <em>“Any </em>benefits received in the absence of, or prior to, a final adjudication of compensability can simply be repaid out of damages repaid through the negligence action.” <em>Id. </em><a href="/pa/532/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="532 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1835933" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0130-01">532 Pa. 130</a> at 139, <a href="/pa/532/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="532 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1835933" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0130-01">615 A.2d 27</a> at 32. <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>(emphasis added) There is thus no automatic designation of an injury as work related because benefits have, temporarily, been received in some form.</p>
    <p id="b686-5" data-blocks='[["BL_686.4",686,[252,530,1151,636]]]'>In support of its conclusion that an adjudication has occurred, the Opinion in Support of Reversal advances the notion that the term “work injury,” which appears in the Stipulation of Facts in support of appellee’s Petition to Commute, is an admission that the accident was work related. However, the same Stipulation elsewhere states that appellee’s injuries were incurred “allegedly within the course and scope of her employment.” (Stipulation of Facts at para. 1) There is therefore nothing determinative about the term “work” which is contradicted within the same document. Even assuming that such equivocal language constitutes an admission, still no adjudication has occurred.</p>
    <p id="b686-6" data-blocks='[["BL_686.5",686,[246,1192,1154,798]]]'>The Opinion in Support of Reversal seems to find controlling the fact that the defendant in any tort action brought by appellee would be a fellow employee rather than the employer, and <em>Kohler, </em>in approving the repayment arrangement, does so only in the context of its own facts, that is, where the potentially liable party is the employer. The Opinion in Support of Reversal deduces that because the employer is not attempting to limit its own liability here, the injury must be work related. The logic of this conclusion is less than compelling. The thrust of the holding in <em>Kohler </em>is not merely to legitimize repayment agreements only where an employer may be found liable as a tortfeasor, but to assure that injured employees are not exploited. That it is not the employer but a fellow employee who seeks to capitalize on the situation here does not alter the principle of fairness <em>Kohler </em>enunciates.</p>

In this instance both the circumstances of the accident, and the administrative actions that <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>followed militate against such a findings being rationally made. To decide on the basis of nondeterminative occurrences that what injured appellee was work related is at odds with both the statute and any definition of adjudication.</p>

    <p id="b687-7" data-blocks='[["BL_687.6",687,[212,1174,1154,792]]]'>No such formal proceeding was sought or occurred here. The Board merely acquiesced to the payment, in a different form, of funds that the insurance company had unilaterally decided to award to appellee after the accident, and which the same insurance company agreed to pay out in a lump sum with the understanding that appellee would return these funds out of any award received in a tort action. As <em>Kohler </em>points, out, this is an acceptable arrangement which does no violence to the statute. Necessarily involved in the tort action would be a determination of whether the accident was work related. If it were found to be within the course and scope of appellee’s employment, no refund need be made. The tort action here resulted in a determination that the injury was not work related, a result consistent with law and reality which should not be disturbed.</p>

Prior to the commencement of trial, Appellant sought summary judgment on the ground that Appellant and Appellee were in the course of their employment at the time of the accident; however, the trial court denied this motion. Following a jury trial, Appellee was awarded $767,000.00 for past and future medical benefits, past earning capacity, future lost earning capacity, and past and future pain and suffering. The jury attributed 75% of the liability to Appellant. Appellant filed post-trial motions which were denied.

The employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier issued a Notice of Compensation Payable and paid benefits to Kohler. The parties later entered into a Supplemental Agreement, and Kohler’s benefits were eventually terminated by order of a referee based on the employer’s Petition for Termination, Modification or Suspension of Compensation. Shortly after his benefits were terminated, Kohler filed a complaint in trespass against his employer.

Clearly then, the Board could not properly have granted Appellee’s Petition for Commutation if she had not suffered a work-related injury. Moreover, Appellee admitted in the Stipulation of Facts which she submitted in support of her petition that she had suffered a work-related injury. (Supplemental Reproduced Record at 5a). Specifically, the parties agreed in the stipulation that “[a]ll reasonable and necessary medical expenses causally related to the September 26, 1986 <em>work injury ... </em>will continue to be paid by the Defendant in accordance with the Act.” (emphasis added) <em><a href="/pa/532/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="532 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1835933" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0130-01">Id.</a></em>

In his Opinion in Support of Affirmance, Mr. Justice Montcmuro asserts that the repayment agreement entered into by Appellee and Aetna is acceptable under <em>Kohler </em>because in this situation the employee is simply accepting benefits unilaterally paid by the employer rather than one where the employee sought an award of benefits. I do not agree, as Appellee actively pursued a commutation. At that point, the benefits were no longer unilaterally paid by the employer but were paid pursuant to the Order of the Board at Appellee's request.</p>

The Opinion in Support of Affirmance claims that there was no formal proceeding in the instant case such that there could have been a final adjudication. According to the Opinion in Support of Affirmance, the Board’s grant of Appellee’s petition was mere acquiescence to restructuring the employer's unilateral payments. Clearly, the Board does not merely acquiesce to petitions presented to it, rather, it must follow the provisions of the Act and established case law. When a party goes before the Board, that party is seeking an adjudication of the matter presented.</p>
