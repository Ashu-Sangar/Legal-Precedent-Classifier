After a battery of neuropsychological and neurolaboratory testing, Dr. Wettstein determined that appellant was mentally competent to stand trial. Later, motions were filed with the Honorable Robert E. Dauer of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas in which appellant waived his right to the assistance of counsel at trial and asserted his right to represent himself at trial. Following a hearing and a thoroughly probing colloquy, the trial court permitted appellant to proceed <em>pro se </em>and the Allegheny County Public Defender’s Office was directed to act as standby counsel.</p>
    <p id="b766-7" data-blocks='[["BL_766.7",766,[254,1689,1156,637]]]'>Later, the case was transferred to the Honorable Jeffrey A. Manning, also of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, and further pre-trial motions were filed. Following a hearing, each motion was denied. However, in addition to denying these motions, Judge Manning revoked Judge Dauer’s earlier order granting appellant the right to self-representation and the court then ordered the Public Defender’s Office to assume control of appellant’s defense at trial and at sentencing. Defense counsel then moved for a continuance, which the court denied. In accordance with the second trial court’s order, the Public Defender’s Office proceeded with representation of appellant at trial.</p>

This doctrine refers to a family of rules which embody the concept that a court involved in the later phases of a litigated matter should not reopen questions decided by another judge of that same court or by a higher court in the earlier phases of the matter. <em>See 21 </em>C.J.S. Courts § 149a; 5 Am.Jur.2d Appeal and Error § 744. Among the related but distinct rules which make up the law of the case doctrine are that: (1) upon remand for further proceedings, a trial court may not alter the resolution of a legal question previously decided by the appellate court in the matter;' (2) upon a second appeal, an appellate court may not alter the resolution of a legal question previously decided by the same appellate court; and (3) upon transfer of a matter between trial judges of coordinate jurisdiction, the transferee trial court may not alter the resolution of a legal question previously decided by the transferor trial court. <em>See </em>Joan Steinman, <em>Law of the Case: A Judicial Puzzle in Consolidated and Transferred Cases and in Multidistrict Litigation, </em><a href="/citations/?q=135%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20595" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="135 U.

Courts § 149a; <em>Judicial Puzzle </em>at 604-605. In our view, these considerations should have weighed heavily on the second trial court’s reconsideration of the first trial court’s order which granted appellant’s right to represent himself. The various policies which motivated the <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>development of these rules and which continue to motivate the enduring existence of both the coordinate jurisdiction rule and the law of the case doctrine are of paramount importance in the context of a criminal proceeding where the criminal defendant and his counsel must be allowed to proceed to trial with an established trial strategy and with the security of knowing, for example, that he either will or will not be permitted to represent himself or that his pre-trial statements either will or will not be introduced against him at trial. In this regard, these rules seek to ensure fundamental fairness in the justice system by preventing a party aggrieved by one judge’s interlocutory order to attack that decision by seeking and securing relief from a different judge of the same court, thereby forcing one’s opponent to shift the focus of his trial strategy in the matter. <em>See Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/428/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="428 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="1912410" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0131-01">428 Pa. 131</a>, 133 n. 2, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20772" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="236 A.2d 772">236 A.2d 772</a>, 773 n. 2 (1968) (citation omitted) (a trial judge cannot reverse on the same record at trial the decision made after the pretrial suppression hearing that defendant’s statement need not be suppressed). <em>See also Golden, <a href="/pa-super/410/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="410 Pa.

Accordingly, our consideration of the second trial court’s order within the context of the law of the case doctrine and the coordinate jurisdiction rule weighs heavily against a finding that the second trial court properly rescinded the first trial court’s order permitting appellant’s <em>pro se </em>representation. <em>See Lipchik v.

This approach, like the “best interests” approach, represents the kind of paternalistic concern for a criminal defendant expressly rejected in <em>Faretta. </em>Here, the second trial court asked appellant (1) his education level; (2) how many times he had been in court; (3) if he had ever represented himself at a criminal trial; (4) if he had ever conducted <em>voir dire; </em>(5) if he had ever conducted a cross-examination; (6) if he had ever called witnesses or presented evidence to a court; and (7) if he had ever argued facts or law to a court.

However, on an earlier motion to suppress two earlier incriminating statements made by appellant, the second trial court expressly ruled that appellant chose to forego his right to counsel during the police interrogations conducted on February 21, 1988, by signing a written rights waiver form.

    <p id="b781-5" data-blocks='[["BL_781.4",781,[205,614,1155,1776]]]'>Accordingly, the second trial court found that for purposes of making incriminating statements to the police, appellant could and, in fact, did intelligently waive the right to counsel; but, that same trial court also found that for purposes of representing himself at trial, appellant could not intelligently waive the right to counsel. We find these two rulings from the same trial court fundamentally contradictory and wholly inexplicable. We know of no authority (and the Commonwealth directs our attention to none) which supports the notion that the standard for finding a valid waiver of the assistance of counsel varies according to the stage at which a putative waiver of that right is asserted. To the contrary, the U.S. Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, which has concentrated primarily on the right to counsel and the prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination, has set an invariable standard for a valid waiver of such constitutional guarantees; i.e., that such waivers be knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently rendered. <em>See </em>Brian R. Boch, <em>Fourteenth Amendment </em>— The <em>Standard of Mental Competency to Waive Constitutional Rights Versus the Competency to Stand Trial, </em><a href="/citations/?q=84%20J.%20Crim.%20L.%20%26%20Criminology%20883" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="84 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 883">84 J.Crim.L. &amp; Criminology 883</a>, 889-890 (1994) (citations omitted). Accordingly, because the standard for finding a valid waiver of any of these constitutional rights is invariable, there is no principled basis upon which it may be asserted that the standard for finding a valid waiver of the assistance of counsel varies according to the stage at which the waiver is asserted. It is therefore inconceivable to us how the second trial court could rule on July 26, 1988 (the date of the suppression hearing), that appellant could and did assert an intelligent waiver of the right to the assistance of counsel and then, less than three weeks later, rule that appellant was somehow incapable of asserting an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.</p>

To the extent this statement evidences the belief of the second trial court regarding appellant’s appreciation of the nature of the proceedings against him, this statement fundamentally belies the trial court’s other ruling that appellant could not intelligently waive the right to counsel.

Inexplicably, the second trial court did not directly cite to any such competent "medical information” to support its broad conclusion that these medications impaired appellant’s ability to understand the nature of the proceedings against him.

On this point the Commonwealth argues that the trial court’s use of the phrase "competence to waive counsel” was merely a shorthand reference for the "intelligent and competent waiver” standard expressed in <em>Johnson v.

We find this argument groundless given the trial court’s repeated use of the reference to appellant's "incapability” to waive counsel. Framed in this manner, we are left with the abiding belief that the second trial court believed that appellant indeed was incapable of intelligently waiving counsel.</p>
