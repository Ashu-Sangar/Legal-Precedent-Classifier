Counsel for Graham responded with a letter to the trial judge dated March 19, 1993, indicating that he would be unavailable until May 10, and further stating his belief that no proceedings were necessary because Graham, after consultation with his mother and various attorneys, had decided “that no motions be filed attacking the convictions or the sentences and that no appeal be taken.” On March 24, 1993, the Deputy Director of Criminal Listings issued a Memorandum “to supersede our memo dated 3/11/93” and stating, “Please cancel the present listing of 4/22/93 in Courtroom 453 before the Honorable Robert A.

Graham stated that a woman would come to the apartment with him to shoot drugs and drink liquor. Later, while they were engaged in sexual intercourse, Graham would grab the woman by the neck and ultimately choke her to death. Graham characterized the strangulations as “accidental,” saying that in each instance he did not realize what had occurred until he later woke up and found that the woman lying next to him was dead. He would then dispose of the body in the back room of the apartment.

In other contexts, we have recognized that the death penalty statute may supersede the rules which apply to sentencing proceedings generally. See <em>Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, </em><a href="/pa/521/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="521 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1817450" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0188-01">521 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="521 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1817450" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0188-01">555 A.2d 846</a> (1989) (allocution).

    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[195,570,1153,1695]]]'>Second, the only other statutory references to concurrent and consecutive sentences are found in Subchapter E of the Sentencing Code, “Imposition of Sentence”, specifically sections 9757 and 9761. Beginning with section 9757, however, it would appear that Subchapter E, like Subchapter C, is wholly inapplicable to death penalty cases, different procedures having been provided in section 9711. Section 9757 bears the heading “Consecutive sentences <em>of total confinement </em>for multiple offenses” (emphasis added), and provides that when consecutive sentences are imposed “the court shall indicate the minimum sentence to be served for the total of all offenses.” Read in context, this section can have no application to the death penalty, which is not a sentence of total confinement. Section 9761, which is titled “Computation and order of service of sentences,” states that when a sentence is imposed concurrently with a sentence already being served and the previous sentence would expire first, the defendant shall be imprisoned at least until the last imposed minimum sentence has been served. Again, by its terms, this section is irrelevant in cases where the death penalty has been imposed. Compare <em>State v.

Since discretion with respect to the sentence is channelled in the process of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to allow the court to further exercise discretion when imposing the sentence decided upon would run counter to the statutory design.

To be sure, this case differs from <em>Appel </em>and <em>Heidnik </em>in that those defendants apparently accepted the sentences of death imposed upon them and saw appellate review as an impediment to having them carried out, whereas Graham is satisfied that the sentence imposed on him will enable him to live out the remainder of his natural life and sees appellate review as carrying the risk that the death sentences will be given effect prior thereto.

On one count, No. 3948 August Term 1987, the court found no aggravating circumstances, and thus imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. As no notice of appeal was filed with respect to this count or the judgments of sentence of one to two years imprisonment on the convictions for abuse of corpse, we have no occasion to review those matters. See Pa.R.A.P.1941, Note ("Although Rule 702(b) (matters tried with capital offenses) vests jurisdiction in the Supreme Court over appeals from sentences imposed on a defendant for lesser offenses as a result of the same criminal episode or transaction where the offense is tried with the capital offense, the appeal from the lesser offenses is not automatic. Thus the right to appeal the judgment of sentence on a lesser offense will be lost unless all requisite steps are taken, including preservation of issues ... filing a timely notice of appeal, etc.”)</p>

This rationale carries no weight in explaining whether the court had the power to make the death sentences consecutive to the life term, and is of dubious merit in explaining the effect of doing so. Graham would be ineligible for parole from the life sentence whether the other counts carried sentences of death, life imprisonment, or no penalty at all. Act of August 6, 1941, P.L. 861, § 21, as amended, 61 P.S. § 331.21 (Supp.1995). Moreover, the existence of six consecutive death sentences would not per se have any bearing on the availability of pardon from the life sentence, which is within the exclusive power of the Governor subject to the recommendation of the Board of Pardons. Pa. Const. Art. IV, Sec. 9; 71 P.S. § 299. At most, the sentence structured by the court would stand as a recommendation to the Governor and the Board of Pardons that Graham should never be released from prison. See <em>Commonwealth v.

For example, if we were to recognize discretion in a trial court to order that a capital sentence not be carried out until a previous sentence for a term of years or for life had expired, a judge who was opposed to the death penalty could in almost every case coming before him or her effectively prevent the death sentence from ever being carried out. Other judges might use their discretion to delay execution in this manner in some cases but not others. This is precisely the kind of potential for arbitrary application based on unbridled discretion that rendered the sentencing scheme unconstitutional in <em>Furman, </em>and that Pennsylvania's death penalty statute was drafted to avoid.</p>
