Third, Appellant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of the counsel’s action or inaction. Prejudice in this context has been defined to mean that Appellant must establish that but for the arguably ineffective act or omission there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different. <em>Commonwealth v.

To support this allegation, Appellant did not call his trial counsel to testify but offered only his own testimony at the evidentiary hearing. The PCRA court specifically found this testimony “was not credible and that at least two matters were discussed” by trial counsel and Appellant relating to the presentation at the penalty stage of character witnesses and Appellant’s good work history. <em>Commonwealth v. Crawley, </em>No. 155 February Term, 1984, slip op. at 7 (Common Pleas, 1st Judicial District, Criminal, filed May 19, 1994). Where, as here, the only evidence offered is the uncorroborated testimo<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>ny of Appellant which the trier of fact specifically found to be not credible, we cannot say that the PCRA court abused its discretion. Accordingly, Appellant has clearly failed to meet his burden of proving that the underlying claim has merit and thus this issue does not provide a basis for relief.</p>
    <p id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[194,651,1153,378]]]'>Appellant’s second claim of ineffectiveness is based upon trial counsel’s failure to present evidence of mitigating circumstances. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Specifically, Appellant alleges that trial counsel failed to present a) at least two character witnesses of which counsel was aware; b) evidence of Appellant’s drug use; and c) evidence of Appellant’s good work history.</p>

Gonzalez, </em><a href="/pa-super/415/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="415 Pa.

Again, the only evidence which Appellant offered to prove this claim was his uncorroborated testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Appellant testified that trial counsel was aware of the existence of two women with whom Appellant lived for 6 months prior to the murders. Appellant testified that they were willing and able to come forward to testify to his good character for peacefulness at the penalty stage of the trial. Appellant did not produce the two women at the PCRA evidentiary hearing. On the stand, he explained that their absence at the PCRA evidentiary hearing was due to their fear of Appellant’s family members (who were also the family members of the victims) who had made threats to a relative of the two women to discourage that relative from testifying on Appellant’s behalf at his trial.

Hentosh, </em><a href="/pa/520/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="520 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1815584" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0325-01">520 Pa. 325</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="520 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1815584" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0325-01">554 A.2d 20</a> (1989) (where allegedly helpful witness did not appear at PCRA evidentiary hearing, the Court is unable to determine whether witness’ testimony would have been favorable to the defendant).

Appellant alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to put on evidence of his drug use as a mitigating circumstance. At the evidentiary hearing, Appellant testified that in 1980 he started to use methamphetamine, “speed” and pain killers which he obtained “off the street,” and that in 1982 his use of these drugs increased subsequent to a car accident in which he was injured. Appellant did not testify as to how this drug use was relevant to the murders (i.e. that he was <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>
      <em>influenced </em>by drugs at the time of the murders) or how it would serve as a mitigating circumstance. Appellant did not testify that he informed his trial counsel of the fact of his drug use nor does he allege in his Brief to this Court that counsel was aware of such use or should have been aware of such use. As Appellant has failed to link his drug use with any mitigating circumstances and has failed to show that counsel knew or should have known of same, Appellant has utterly failed to carry his burden of proving that there was merit to the claim that his drug use was a mitigating circumstance. Accordingly, this issue does not afford Appellant relief.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Appellant asserts that although the women were fearful of testifying at Appellant’s PCRA hearing which occurred in 1993, nevertheless they were willing and able to testify at the penalty stage of the trial which occurred in 1984 which is when Appellant states that the threats occurred.</p>

Even were we to conclude that Appellant had established merit, we-would be constrained to conclude that Appellant failed to prove that trial counsel’s refraining from putting Appellant’s character in issue lacked a reasonable basis. Trial counsel was aware that the Commonwealth was in possession of evidence of Appellant’s bad character including Appellant’s physically attacking his own mother and his threatening his brother under circumstances similar to those attendant to the murders. Upon rebuttal of Appellant’s good character evidence, the Commonwealth could have presented evidence of Appellant’s bad character or reputation. Thus we find that trial counsel could have reasonably refrained from putting Appellant’s character in issue for fear that the Commonwealth’s rebuttal evidence would have outweighed the benefit of the good character evidence.</p>

Even if we were to find that Appellant carried his burden with respect to the merit prong of the ineffectiveness claim, nevertheless we would be constrained to find that Appellant failed to prove that his trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to put on Appellant's illegal use of drugs. Insofar as counsel could have reasonably concluded that evidence of Appellant's illicit drug use would have served only to further inflame the jurors against his client, we conclude that such a tactical decision is not outside the bounds of competent advocacy. As trial counsel is presumed effective, <em>Commonwealth v. Cross, <a href="/pa/535/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="535 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="1841430" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0038-01">supra,</a> </em>and Appellant has not offered any evidence that trial counsel’s failure to introduce the evidence of drug use was without a reasonable basis, Appellant has failed to prove ineffectiveness.</p>

As it has not been offered into evidence and therefore not part of the official record, we cannot properly consider it. <em>Commonwealth v. Young, </em><a href="/pa/456/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="456 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="584437" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0102-01">456 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20258" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="317 A.2d 258">317 A.2d 258</a> (1974). However, even if we were to consider it, we find that counsel’s failure to present Appellant’s six year employment history as a janitor and maintenance worker evidenced by the resume did not work to Appellant’s prejudice. In the face of the barbarity of the murders and the presence of two aggravating circumstances which the jury found and this Court upheld on direct appeal, we simply cannot conclude that but for counsel’s failure to present Appellant's work history, there was a reasonable probability <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>that the result would have been different. <em>See Commonwealth v.
