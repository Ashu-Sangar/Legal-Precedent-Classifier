Zuczek estimated that he had fought 6,500 fires throughout the next twenty years. On February 19, 1990, he reported at 4:30 p.m. for night shift duty. He was not involved in fighting a fire that evening, but during his shift he began having chest pains and experienced difficulty in breathing. When the chest pains became progressively worse, he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Zuczek had congestive heart failure. Although he survived the heart attack, he had injured a large area of the heart. His heart no longer pumped blood efficiently-</p>

His treatment was limited to medication. He was advised not to return to his employment because as a fire fighter he would be at extreme risk for other heart attacks or sudden death. On June 19,1990, Zuczek filed a claim petition against the City of Wilkes-Barre alleging total disability as a result of a work-related heart attack suffered on February 19, 1990.</p>

The City of Wilkes-Barre submitted the deposition testimony of its medical witness, Dr. Basil RuDusky, who had conducted an examination of Zuczek on March 11, 1991. The parties then closed the case. Zuczek died on October 4, 1991, prior to the referee’s decision. His widow later filed a fatal claim petition which was consolidated with the claim petition.

He considered the testimony of Dr. Decker, who was not a cardiologist and was Board-certified in geriatric and internal medicine, and of Dr. RuDusky, who specialized in cardiovascular disease and internal medicine. The referee concluded that the evidence failed to establish that Zuczek’s heart attack was work-related based upon the testimony of Dr. RuDusky that his physical examination of Zuczek revealed a significant blockage of the arteries from head to toe, which indicated a pre-existing progressive condition that ultimately resulted in the heart attack.

The court affirmed the Board’s decision granting benefits to Zuczek.

The referee accepted the testimony of the employer’s expert witness that the claimant’s chronic bronchitis and emphysema were solely and directly caused by his forty-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes or less each day and that claimant’s exposure to smoke, fumes, gases and dust while fighting fires did not have any permanent effect on his lungs. The referee concluded also that the claimant was not employed in an occupation in which emphysema, bronchitis, or obstructive pulmonary disease is a hazard.</p>

The amount of myocardial infarctions caused by even temporary inhalation of carbon monoxide are very small. It took me quite a literature search. I forget how long it was, but it was from here to my window, which should be about at least 12 feet from the computer, The National Archives in Medicine. And I think I picked up three cases of heart attacks in fire fighters. And these people all had coronary artery disease already at the time. And that’s not an unexpected event, by the way, under the circumstances because we can get it just it [sic] from working around places in which there’s low oxygen tension if you have advanced coronary artery disease or, like I said, just running up a flight of stairs or two.</blockquote>

Unlike the medical expert in <em>Mareks, </em>Dr. RuDusky recognized the role that the inhalation of smoke and carbon monoxide may play in inducing cardiac arrhythmia and in causing angina pectoris in individuals who have coronary artery disease. He acknowledged that the conditions encountered by fire fighters in the course of their employment may precipitate a heart attack and distinguished this from the factors that contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.</p>

It was his opinion, however, that in this case Zuczek’s heart attack was not induced by his fire fighting activities and that Zuczek had exhibited multiple risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease prior to the heart attack. Dr. RuDusky’s opinion was consistent with the personal and family history given to him by Zuczek and the fact that Zuczek was not engaged in fire fighting activities when he suffered the heart attack. It was only by ignoring crucial portions of Dr. RuDusky’s testimony that the Commonwealth Court created the impression that the physician refused to recognize that existing heart and lung diseases may be aggravated by <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>.extreme over-exertion and the types of dangers which fire fighters are exposed to as part of their occupation.</p>

In this case, the referee chose to believe the testimony of Dr. RuDusky, a specialist in cardiovascular disease, rather than that of Zuczek’s treating physician who specialized in geriatrics. If we do not accord the findings of the referee due deference when supported by competent medical evidence then the nonconclusive presumption of Section 301(e) of the Act would be disregarded and an irrebuttable presumption substituted instead.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In that case, the expert had testified that the fire fighter’s employment had not caused or aggravated his coronary heart disease but acknowledged on cross-examination that a person who has demonstrated progressive heart disease would be more susceptible to myocardial infarction than a normal healthy adult when exposed to toxic fumes and gases. The court determined that the employer’s medical testimony was competent and substantial evidence upon which the referee could properly conclude that the employer had rebutted the presumption that the fire fighter’s heart disease was causally related to his employment.</p>
