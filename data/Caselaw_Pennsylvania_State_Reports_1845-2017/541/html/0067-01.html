      <em>Pavlicic </em>involved an action to recover gifts given to a woman in anticipation of a marriage that never occurred. Sara Jane Mills was twenty-six years old at the time the relationship began; George Pavlicic was seventy-five. The May-December romance started when Mills borrowed the sum of $5,000 from Pavlicic to buy a house. She gave Pavlicic a mortgage on the property, but paid back only $449 on the mortgage in three years. Mills then suggested that he satisfy the mortgage since they were to be married. Pavlicic did so. Encouraged by this, Mills was later able to persuade Pavlicic to fund her purchases of jewelry and automobiles. Mills finally convinced him to give her $5,000 to buy a saloon. Mills disappeared with the money, opened the saloon, and married someone considerably younger than Pavlicic.</p>

The legislation was intended to ward off injustices and incongruities which often occurred when, by the mere filing of breach of promise suits, innocent defendants became unregenerate scoundrels and tarnished plaintiffs became paragons of lofty sensibility and moral impeccability. It was not unusual in threatened breach of promise suits that the defendant preferred to buy his peace through a monetary settlement rather than be vindicated by a trial which might leave his good name in shreds.</blockquote>

In those counts, Mary Lampus is not asserting a breach of promise to marry. The claims instead assert causes of action for the decedent’s negligent or fraudulent conduct in concealing the invalidity of his Mexican divorce decree and his incapacity to enter into a marriage contract with her after performance of their wedding ceremony. Marriage is a civil contract made between parties with the capacity to contract; an individual whose previous marriage has not been dissolved is incapable of contracting to marry another. <em>In Re Estate of Garges, </em><a href="/pa/474/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="474 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1732164" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0237-01">474 Pa. 237</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="474 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1732164" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0237-01">378 A.2d 307</a> (1977).

The Superior Court lost sight of the causes of action asserted by Mary Lampus by focusing entirely upon the nature of damages asserted in the complaint. The tort claims do not arise from the decedent’s failure to marry her, but from <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>the decedent’s negligent or intentional conduct in failing to apprise her of the invalidity of the foreign divorce decree and the resulting impediment to his capacity to enter into a marriage contract with her. A claim of tortious conduct which is not based upon an individual’s failure to keep a promise to marry is actionable.

The Superior Court acknowledged that the causes of action were not pleaded, but stated that a plaintiff is not obligated to identify the legal theory <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>underlying the complaint. Although a plaintiff is not required to specify the legal theoiy underlying the complaint, the material facts which form the basis of a cause of action must be alleged. <em>Schreiber v.

      <p id="b271-14" data-blocks='[["BL_271.2",271,[272,2195,1118,187]]]'>The complaint in this case sets forth five separate counts consistent with Pa.R.C.P. 1020(a); infliction of emotional distress was not among the five counts. An allegation that a plaintiff suffered physical and emotional pain is insufficient in itself to state a cause of action for infliction of emotional distress.</p>
