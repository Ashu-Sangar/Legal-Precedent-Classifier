The <em>Blockburger </em>test focuses on whether each offense contains an element not contained in the other; if <em>each </em>offense does not contain an element distinct from the other offense, the offenses are deemed to be the “same offense” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy protection and therefore, the subsequent prosecution is barred. At issue in <em>Blockburger </em>was whether two offenses were sufficiently distinguishable to permit the imposition of multiple punishments. As enunciated therein:</p>

The crux of the difference between my reading of the cases and that advanced by the Majority is that the Majority would look at the double jeopardy issue in a sterile theoretical vacuum, and find that the two offenses contain “distinct” elements as long as the cold language of the statute says they do. My reading of the cases, however, is that the double jeopardy guarantee is meant to deal with <em>actual </em>defendants and <em>actual </em>circumstances. If it is possible that two offenses could contain distinct elements on paper, but in fact one is subsumed within the other because (as here) the government has declared its intention to prosecute the cases in that fashion, Double Jeopardy is as real and abhorrent as if the same statute had been twice invoked to send the same defendant to jail for the same offense.</p>

Yet the government in this <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>case actively solicited and accepted appellee’s plea of driving at an unsafe speed, and went on to declare that it would then prosecute appellee for homicide by vehicle, based upon precisely the <em>same </em>traffic violation — driving at an unsafe speed. In essence, what the Majority concludes" is that where the subsequent offense (here homicide by vehicle) theoretically <em>could </em>be proven without resort to the prior offense (i.e. unsafe speed), the offenses are not the same under the <em>Blockburger </em>test; even though, in reality, the government has openly announced that it intends to prosecute the cases in an overlapping fashion, such that the homicide by vehicle trial will be — in fact — a trial about driving at an unsafe speed. In other words, the Majority holds that because homicide by vehicle does not <em>necessarily </em>require proof of unsafe speed, the two offenses are never the “same offense” under <em>Blockburger </em>and thus, a subsequent prosecution for one of these offenses following a conviction for the other does not violate double jeopardy. Indeed, the Majority goes so far as to conclude that even if the Commonwealth were to rely on proof of the unsafe speed conviction in the subsequent prosecution for homicide by vehicle, double jeopardy would not be violated, (opinion p. 1052). As I view it, the Majority opinion could be read to stand for the proposition that even if the unsafe speed conviction ultimately constitutes the sum and substance of the Commonwealth’s proof in the instant homicide by vehicle prosecution, there will be no double jeopardy bar as long as the Commonwealth submits a scintilla of proof beyond that which comprises the unsafe speed conviction. My review of the relevant case law reveals that the Majority’s position is incorrect. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court’s most recent decision in <em>Dixon, </em>the case relied upon by the Majority, itself supports a contrary position.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

The Court ultimately remanded the matter to the Illinois state court for further proceedings.

In other words, because the proscription against double jeopardy is peculiar to each defendant, any meaningful determination of whether that protection has been, or will be violated, in a particular case, especially where one of the offenses involved incorporates numerous underlying substantive offenses, demands that the precise circumstances of that case be considered.

Charges of simple assault and trespass were subsequently filed against the defendant as a result of his forcible entry into his wife’s home and his concomitant abuse of her. Several days later, the defendant was charged with, and found in contempt of, that PFA Order. The defendant was later charged with raping his wife during the course of his earlier assault and trespass. All three criminal charges were consolidated for trial. It was the defendant’s contention, <em>inter alia, </em>that double jeopardy barred these criminal charges given his previous conviction of contempt. This Court held, in relevant part, that indirect criminal contempt and simple assault were separate offenses under <em>Blockburger </em>because (1) the two offenses did contain the “requisite ‘separate elements’” since the “defendant could <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>have willfully violated the court order by any number of actions,” and (2) the two offenses served distinct purposes in that the purpose of a contempt order is the protection of our judicial system from abuse, not punishment for a criminal act. <em>Allen, </em><a href="/pa/506/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="506 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1790920" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0500-01">506 Pa. at 514</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="506 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1790920" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0500-01">486 A.2d at 370</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_12" id="ref_footnote_2_12">12</a> This was precisely the rationale <em>rejected </em>in <em>Dixon, and Foster </em>by a majority of the Court. <em>See, </em>footnote 4, <em>supra. </em>Both Dixon and Foster had been tried for criminal contempt of court for violation of court orders that prohibited them from engaging in conduct that was later the subject of a criminal prosecution. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Foster </em>held that the substantive criminal offense which underlay the finding of contempt was a lesser-included offense and thus barred under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. Significantly, the Court there found that the indictment against Foster charging assault was barred because it was based upon the same event that was the subject of his prior contempt conviction. The contempt order violated by Foster was similar to the one at issue in <em>Allen </em>insofar as it enjoined Foster from molesting, assaulting or in any manner threatening or physically abusing his wife.</p>

Beatty, </em><a href="/pa/500/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="500 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1781079" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0284-01">500 Pa. 284</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="455 A.2d 1194" data-case-ids="1781079,1781155" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0284-01,/pa/500/0283-01">455 A.2d 1194</a> (1983), cannot survive. In <em>Beatty, </em>this Court interpreted section 110(l)(ii), and more specifically the terms “and was within the jurisdiction of a single court” as excluding Motor Vehicle Code violations from the requirements of that section. Subsequently, in <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/513/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="513 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1802532" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0547-01">513 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/pa/513/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="513 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1802532" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0547-01">522 A.2d 37</a> (1987), this Court extended that holding to all summary offenses. According to the holding in <em>Beatty, </em>the compulsory joinder rule does not apply where a defendant has been convicted of a lesser offense in an inferior court which had no jurisdiction to dispose of the greater offense, and then is subsequently tried for the greater offense in the “superior” tribunal. This is true irrespective of the fact that the lesser offense could clearly have been consolidated with the greater offense and disposed of by the “superior” tribunal. While clearly addressing the language of Section 110, the <em>Beatty </em>Court nevertheless states that such an interpretation would not violate the principles sought to be protected by the compulsory joinder rule, section 110, or double jeopardy, again clearly recognizing the relatedness of those three principles. <em>Beatty, </em>500 Pa. at 290-291, <a href="/pa/500/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="455 A.2d 1194" data-case-ids="1781079,1781155" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0284-01,/pa/500/0283-01">455 A.2d at 1198</a>. In essence, what that holding does then is provide <em>less </em>protection under state law to an accused than he or she is entitled to under the United States Constitution. Such clearly is not permitted. <em>See Commonwealth v. Edmunds, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">supra, </a></em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">at 374</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d 887</a>.</p>

Our court system, although divided into several facets, <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>is one unified judicial system. A defendant derives his or her rights when thrust into that system from the Constitutions, both federal and state, and the various courts derive then-authority from those same pillars. The constitutional protection against double jeopardy is for the defendant’s protection. Clearly, a rule imposed by the legislature allocating jurisdiction to try criminal offenses between several courts of the same state, must be subordinated to one’s constitutional right not to be twice tried for the same offense. If, indeed, the two offenses are the “same offense” under the prevailing test, whatever that may be, then our jurisdictional exception as set forth in <em>Beatty </em>must fail. Although this Court has indicated that the decision in <em>Beatty </em>can be employed without consideration of the constitutional protections of double jeopardy, <em>see, Commonwealth v.

For example, if the Commonwealth in the instant case had been unaware that the victim died at the time appellee's guilty plea- was accepted, the due diligence exception might permit a second prosecution for homicide by vehicle even though the two charges overlap. The Double Jeopardy clause is not meant to permit defendants to “take advantage” of the system by pleading guilty to "lesser included offenses” to avoid more serious ones unknown to the Commonwealth. That, however, is not the situation here, since the Commonwealth permitted the citation for unsafe speed to stand, and therefore, be subject to final judicial determination, knowing that 1) the victim had died, and 2) a homicide by vehicle prosecution was imminent.</p>
