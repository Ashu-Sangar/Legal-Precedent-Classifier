The transaction at issue in <em>Cucchi </em>was a contract for a burglar alarm system in which the homeowners paid to Rollins Protective Services Company (“Rollins”) a one-time fee for the installation of the alarm system and a monthly fee for service and maintenance of the system. The contract specified that the alarm system was the property of Rollins and that it would be returned to the company upon the termination of the lease. The home was subsequently burglarized and approximately $36,000 of personal property was stolen. The burglar alarm had been activated but did not operate or sound a signal. Consequently, the homeowners brought an action against Rollins alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>breach of warranty under the express and implied warranty provisions of Article 2. A <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>jury returned a verdict in favor of the homeowners on the breach of warranty claim and awarded $30,000 in damages.</p>

However, it also determined that the homeowners’ complaint for breach of warranty under the UCC, 13 Pa.C.S. § 2725, was untimely because it was filed more than four years after the system had been delivered.</p>

This <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>interpretation overlooks the underlying factors that were articulated in <em>Cucchi </em>when the plurality opinion extended by analogy the warranty provisions of Article 2 to the lease in that case. It was stated that the provisions would be extended on a “case by case basis, considering the nature of the specific transaction (lease), the language, purpose, and intent of the UCC provision under consideration, <em>and the practicality of applying the particular provision(s) at issue to the particular transaction in goods.” Cucchi v.

The Superior Court’s blanket extension of Article 2’s warranty provisions to all lease transactions is clearly at odds with the type of case by case analysis contemplated in <em>Cucchi. </em>An inquiry into the details of a specific transaction would obviously be the focal point of a case by case analysis. The Superior Court’s broad interpretation of <em>Cucchi </em>would leave no room for such an inquiry.</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[243,1269,1158,684]]]'>The legislature’s enactment of Article 2A,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which applies specifically to leases, has codified an area of the law that has heretofore not been fully addressed by the appellate courts of this Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, the provisions of Article 2A do not apply to the instant case as Article 2A did not become effective until July 9, 1993. <em>See </em>13 Pa.C.S. §§ 2A102. Accordingly, we must examine the lease transaction in question to determine whether it is substantially similar to a sale of goods such that the extension of the warranty provisions of Article 2 would be justified. In our view, the lease of the front-end loader is not analogous to a sale, and therefore, the extension of Article 2’s warranty provisions to this transaction is not warranted.</p>

The limited time frame in which the front-end loader remained in the lessee’s possession gives rise to a substantial distinction between the expectations and obligations of the lessee in that situation as compared to one who commits to a long-term lease or an outright purchase where a transfer of title occurs. Accordingly, the trial court was justified in distinguishing <em>Cucchi </em>from the present facts and concluding that <em>Cucchi </em>was not applicable to the lease in this case. We can find no fault in the trial court’s refusal to extend the warranty provisions of Article 2 to the lease transaction in this case or in its conclusion that Mrs. Keblish failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted.</p>

The majority concludes that simply because our legislature provided that the Act of July 9, 1992, P.L. 507, No. 97, § 3 (Article 2A — Leases) would be effective one year from the date of its enactment, a judicial extension of the provisions of Article 2 — Sales to the facts of the present case would constitute an unwarranted usurpation of a purely legislative function.

The “case-by-case” analysis set forth in both <em>Cucchi </em>decisions is necessary only to determine whether a specific provision of Article <em>2 </em>— Sales—which <em>has not heretofore been extended by analogy to leases </em>— should be applied to lease transactions. <em>See Cucchi </em><a href="/pa/524/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="524 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1822858" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0514-01">574 A.2d at 569-570</a>, quoting <em>Cucchi </em>546 A.2d at 1141-1142.

      <em>Cucchi v. Rollins Protective Services </em>involved a breach of warranty claim on a leased burglar alarm system. The Cucchis were leasing the alarm system from Rollins Protective Services Company (“Rollins”).

Rather, because leasing was becoming a major force in what otherwise was a traditional buyer-seller relationship, the legislature sought to clarify the application of the Uniform Commercial Code to lease transactions. In so doing, Article 2’s provisions were used as the statutory analogue for that clarification, notwithstanding the effective date of the legislation.</p>
