To further support his contention that we are bound by the decisions of federal courts inferior to the United States Supreme Court, Appellant cites to <em>Schreiber v. Republic Intermodal Corp., </em><a href="/pa/473/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="473 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1730289" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0614-01">473 Pa. 614</a>, 620, n. 5, <a href="/pa/473/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="473 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1730289" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0614-01">375 A.2d 1285</a>, 1288, n. 5 (1977). Appellant states that in <em>Schreiber, </em>this Court has agreed to be bound by Third Circuit determinations that certain acts or practices violate federal constitutional rights. Such a holding, however, would have no application here. Both the 1985 PCHA court and the federal district court resolved a <em>factual </em>matter, and not a matter of constitutional law. Furthermore, even though <em>Schreiber </em>is inapplicable here, we now note that the validity of this case is seriously questioned to the extent that it can be read to stand for the proposition that this Court is <em>bound </em>by federal courts inferior to the United States Supreme Court. We will, of course, continue to turn to the decisions of the Third Circuit for guidance on issues of federal constitutional law where the U.S. Supreme Court has not spoken on an issue in question.</p>

Thus, two factors which the Third Circuit panel found critical to its decision to grant Lesko a new sentencing hearing are not present in Appellant’s case.</p>
