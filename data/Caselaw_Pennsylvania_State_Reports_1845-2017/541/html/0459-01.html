Now Costigan petitions this court for reinstatement pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 218(c)(6). On June 29 and July 13, 1993 a hearing committee heard the matter, and on January 6,1994 the committee filed its report, recommending that Costigan’s petition be granted. Neither party took exceptions and on June 13, 1994 the Disciplinary Board also recommended reinstatement. On July 26, 1994, this court entered a rule to show cause why an order denying reinstatement should not be entered based on petitioner’s failure to prove that his resumption of the practice of law would not be detrimental to the administration of justice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

She indicated that she had informed the FBI of this. Costigan suggested that the three administrators meet in his office the following day. On June 4, 1981 the meeting was conducted in Costigan’s office. At that meeting, John Booras brought to Costigan’s office a bag containing $270,000 in cash which he had removed from the decedent’s house and a safety deposit box which was jointly held with the decedent. With the administrators present, Costigan drafted and then filed a petition for letters of administration, naming the three siblings as co-administrators. The petition disclosed that the decedent had a son, Theodore, but that he had not been seen in some time and might be deceased. Costigan listed the value of the estate at $50,000. After the petition was filed, the four returned to Costigan’s office and the three siblings divided up the $270,000 which was in the bag. Costigan received $10,000 cash, which he characterized as a retainer. Three weeks later, Costigan had still not entered the $10,000 cash payment in his ledger. The next day, the three appeared in Costigan’s office with two cases of coins and bills of numismatic value and <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>jewelry which was subsequently appraised at $27,000 and divided among the siblings.</p>
