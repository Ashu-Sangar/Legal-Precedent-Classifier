    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[252,474,1150,629]]]'>This case presents the issue of whether the Real Estate Tax Sale Law (the “Tax Sale Law”), 72 P.S. § 5860.101 <em>et seq., </em>requires individual notification of a pending tax sale of real estate to each of the three persons listed on the deed to the real estate, each of whom are the trustees of the real estate for an unincorporated association. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the Tax Sale Law does require separate notification under such circumstances. Since appellant, the Lebanon County Tax Claim Bureau, failed to give individual notification to each of the instant trustees, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court which voided the instant tax sale of the trustees’ real estate.</p>
    <p id="b580-6" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[247,1140,1154,574]]]'>The facts are not in dispute. By deed dated October 3, 1961, Robert Krumbine, Harold J. Tice, and Robert E. Henning purchased a parcel of land situated in Lebanon County (the “property”) in their capacity as trustees for the South Lebanon Rod and Gun Club (the “Club”), an unincorporated association. Each of the trustees’ names appeared on the indenture agreement as the purchasers of the property. However, the agreement listed only Tice’s address. Tice’s address was also listed on the Lebanon County Assessment Office records, and all tax bills were subsequently mailed exclusively to that address.</p>
    <p id="b580-7" data-blocks='[["BL_580.7",580,[246,1752,1152,635]]]'>In September 1991, the Lebanon County Tax Claim Bureau (the “Tax Bureau”) sold the property in satisfaction of delinquent taxes for the tax year 1989. The Tax Bureau mailed notice of the tax sale only to Harold Tice; the Tax Bureau did not mail notice of the tax sale to either Krumbine or Henning, even though their names were also listed on the indenture agreement. After the Tax Bureau sold the property, appellees (as the Club’s trustees) appealed the sale to the Lebanon County Court of Common Pleas, arguing that notice of the sale was <em>per se </em>insufficient since the Tax Bureau failed to mail notices of the sale to the other two named trustees, Krumbine and Henning.</p>

There is no dispute that the Tax Bureau gave notice of the instant tax sale by publication and posting. Rather, the sole dispute in this matter relates to whether the Tax Bureau gave sufficient notice by certified mail to each “owner” of the property. For purposes of determining to whom certified mail notification is required to be sent, an “owner” of real estate is defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>the person whose name appears as an owner of record on any deed or instrument of conveyance recorded in the county office designated for recording. 72 P.S. § 5860.102. Here, the instant conveyance document listed “Robert Krumbine, Harold J. Tice, [and] Robert E. Henning, Trustees for SOUTH LEBANON ROD AND GUN CLUB, an unincorporated association” as the purchasers of the property. Since these were the only grantees listed on the conveyance document, only (1) the South Lebanon Rod and Gun Club; and/or (2) Robert Krumbine, Harold J. Tice, and/or Robert E. Henning, as trustees for the Club, could have been the “owner(s)” of the property to whom the Tax Bureau was required to send certified mail notice of the tax sale.</p>

The Tax Bureau maintains that property ownership entails certain rights incident to that ownership interest and that since association trustees do not enjoy all the rights normally associated with property ownership, they should not be considered “owners” of property under 72 P.S. § 5860.602. In support of this argument, the Tax Bureau cites <em>Fuhrman v. Doll, <a href="/pa-super/305/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="305 Pa.

In <em>Fuhrman, </em>a group of trustees bought a hunting camp and took title to the camp in their own names for the benefit of their hunting club. Later, the club removed one of the trustees from their membership; that trustee then sought a judicial partition of the real estate. The Superior Court denied the partition request on the basis that the trustees owned the property for the benefit of the association and not for the benefit of the trustees and that, therefore, an individual trustee could not demand a judicial partition of the property. <em><a href="/pa-super/305/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="305 Pa.

We agree. <em>Fuhrman </em>presented the issue of whether a trustee’s rights to the property as a title holder to the property trumped the association’s members’ rights to the property. The <em>Fuhrman </em>court determined that since the trustee took title to the property not for his own benefit but only for the association’s benefit, he could not seek a partition of the property and, therefore, he did not enjoy all of the benefits of property ownership. Here, however, the instant trustees demanded individual notice of the tax sale in order to preserve, not destroy, the association’s members’ right to <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>benefit of the property.

This legal disparity exists in the law of most of our sister states as well. <em>See, e.g., Hutchins v.

The Tax Bureau also argues that since the instant conveyance document designated Tice as the sole recipient of all tax-related correspondence and because Tice was in fact the sole recipient of all tax-related correspondence, the notice of the tax sale it sent exclusively to Tice was legally sufficient notice. This position ignores, however, the notion that due process requires notification of a tax sale to each owner of property sought to be sold under the Tax Sale Law. <em>Geier, supra, </em><a href="/pa/527/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="527 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="1827731" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0041-01">527 Pa. at 46-47</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="527 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="1827731" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0041-01">588 A.2d at 483</a>. In <em>Geier, </em>it was the contractual responsibility of Geier's co-tenant to pay all property taxes. Geier never received any tax bills and never paid any of the taxes on the subject property. Nevertheless, this Court set aside the tax sale of the property, holding that the county tax claim bureau failed to satisfy the requirements of due process in conducting the tax sale when it sent notice of the sale <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>only to Geier’s co-tenant and failed to send notice to Geier. <em><a href="/pa/527/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="527 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="1827731" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0041-01">Id.</a> </em>Accordingly, we reject appellant’s argument that certified mail notice of a tax sale of property sent to a named agent and not to each owner as required by the Tax Sale Law is legally sufficient notice.</p>
