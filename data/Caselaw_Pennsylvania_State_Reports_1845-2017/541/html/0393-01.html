We reached this conclusion because the offense defined by Section 3731(a)(4) is to drive a vehicle <em>while </em>one’s blood alcohol content is .10% or greater, and delay in BAC testing in those cases could have reflected BAC results that were significantly higher than those possessed while the defendants were operating their motor vehicles.

In addition, he introduced the testimony of an expeit pharmacologist/toxicologist that it was highly probable that Appellant’s BAC was below .10% at the relevant time. However, on cross-examination the Commonwealth was able to solicit an opinion from Appellant’s expert that most people do not slur their speech or begin to exhibit visible signs of intoxication until they achieve a BAC of approximately .15%.

In addition, in response to our decisions in <em>Jarman </em>and <em>Modaffare, </em>the Legislature amended 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731 by adding subsection (a)(5), which eliminates the potential need for the Commonwealth to relate BAC test results to the time of operation of a motor vehicle if BAC testing is performed within three hours after the accused drove, operated or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle. Thus, pursuant to <em>Yarger </em>and subsection (a)(5), Appellant’s BAC test results alone would have been sufficient to sustain his conviction. However, as neither <em>Yarger </em>nor subsection (a)(5) were the law at the time of Appellant’s trial and were not made specifically retroactive, we are compelled to reverse the decision of the Superior Court and vacate the judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Criminal Division.</p>
