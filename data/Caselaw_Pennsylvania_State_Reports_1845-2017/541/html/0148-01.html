In the instant case, the employer is not asserting that Appellant is capable of returning to his preinjury position. If Appellant were able to return to that job, he would not be entitled to compensation for lost wages. However, because he remains disabled from performing his pre-injury position, he is entitled to compensation for lost wages unless his employer finds him a position as required by <em>Kachinski. </em>Moreover, as these cases all precede this Court’s opinion in <em>Kachinski, </em>they are of little help in determining what factors can be considered in determining job availability.</p>

The issue of what constitutes job availability was not addressed, therefore, <em>Carpenter-town Coal </em>is not controlling. The majority also cites <em>USX Corp. v.

Such is the case presently before us. Appellant has not recovered from his work injury and remains unable to return to his pre-injury position without restriction. Therefore, until a position is made available to him which is tailored to his abilities, his loss of earnings does result from his work injury. Moreover, “the ...
