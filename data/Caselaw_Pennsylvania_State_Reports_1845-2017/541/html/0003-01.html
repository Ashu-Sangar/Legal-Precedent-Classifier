Once a police officer retires, the Police Pension Act requires a municipality to provide that officer with pension benefits at a rate of up to one-half of the officer’s average monthly salary. 53 P.S. § 771. However, Section 771 also operates as a recognition that a municipality should be partially relieved of the burden of paying pension benefits to a retiree who receives full federal social security benefits since the retiree would not experience a net negative financial effect from the reduction in pension benefits since that reduction is more than offset by the retiree’s receipt of social security benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Pursuant to 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(1), (3) and (4) it is <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>reasonable to conclude that the legislature enacted this part of Section 771 to ease municipalities’ obligation to pay full police pension benefits when a retired officer receives full social security benefits, in an effort to moderate the depletion of the pension fund into which the municipality contributed.

That statute deems a pension plan “actuarially sound” if it is funded annually at a level <em>not lower than </em>the normal cost of the plan plus a contribution towards the unfunded accrued liability sufficient to complete the funding thereof. 53 P.S. § 881.102 (emphasis supplied). Appellees’ argument therefore fails to consider that any uncertainty created by appellant’s suggested interpretation of Section 771 (i.e., the uncertainty created whereby municipalities would be forced to estimate, on a contingent basis, their pension liability attributable to the payment of benefits for a police officer who retires at age 65 from the police force but continues to work in another capacity) does not necessarily undermine the actuarial soundness of a municipal pension plan. If a municipality currently funds this contingency and later realizes the liability because the police officer elects to continue working (thereby foregoing social security benefits), the pension plan will be adequately funded for that position and the retiree would experience no net negative financial impact. On the other hand, if a municipality currently funds the contingency and the police officer elects to retire altogether, thereby establishing his unconditional entitlement to social security benefits, the municipality will be permitted to reduce his police pension plan benefits; the plan would be financially that much better off and the retiree would experience no net negative financial impact. Under either scenario, the pension plan would not be funded at a level lower than the normal cost of the plan and, therefore, would not be deemed “actuarially unsound.” In short, appellant’s suggested interpretation of Section 771 would neg<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>atively impact the actuarial soundness of a municipal pension plan only if the municipality fails to fund the contingent pension liability attributable to the payment of benefits for a police officer who retires at age 65 from the police force but continues to work for some other employer.</p>

For instance, the municipality cannot control the age at which a police pension beneficiary will die, which is perhaps the single most critical variable in developing a sound actuarial projection of a municipality’s expected pension liability. Indeed, an actuary’s forecast for a particular municipal police pension plan is grounded in various complex probability calculations which, in turn, are based on stated demographic and economic actuarial assumptions and experiences. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 895.201(a) (stating the requirements of the applicable pension plan actuarial valuation report). Therefore, an actuary’s forecast for a particular municipal police pension plan may, without significant modification, also take into consideration that particular plan’s experience regarding the rate at which those retired from the police force continue to work and forego federal social security benefits until age 70. There is simply no reasonable basis to distinguish this one variable from any other variable already included in a police pension plan actuarial forecast. Given this consideration, there is no basis for a municipality to fail to fund the contingent pension liability attributable to the payment of benefits for a police officer who retires at age 65 from the police force but continues to work in another capacity. Accordingly, there is no reason why appellant’s suggested interpretation of Section 771 should undermine the actuarial soundness of a municipal police pension plan as appellees submit. Taking into consideration the consequences of the two opposing interpretations of Section 771 of the Act, it is again reasonable to conclude that the legislature enacted Section 771 to offset a retired police officer’s pension only when that offset is actually supplanted by the receipt of federal social security benefit payments. <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>Thirdly, the Statutory Construction Act requires that this Court take into consideration the former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(5).

Here, as long as appellant continues to work, he simply is not eligible to receive full federal social security benefits until he reaches age 70.
