We conclude that a governmental agency of this Commonwealth may not be a victim for the purposes of restitution under the Crimes Code because such agencies are presently excluded from the definition of a “person” under the Statutory Construction Act and thus, may not be considered as a victim.</p>

Upon noticing that appellant and his girlfriend were involved in the argument, Angela Shaffer told the bar manager that appellant was known to cause trouble wherever he went. After the manager warned appellant to desist, appellant confronted Shaffer and told her that he never liked her and that she was “scum.” Appellant’s boisterous <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>behavior, however, continued and eventually appellant and his friends were asked to leave the bar, with which they complied.</p>
    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[233,461,1152,1128]]]'>Approximately twenty minutes later, Tracey White and her friends left the tavern. As they began to walk down the street they noticed appellant, his girlfriend and three other men approach. The girlfriend confronted Shaffer about telling the manager of the bar that appellant was trouble. Pam Amey stood in between Shaffer and the girlfriend in order to prevent the girlfriend from attacking Shaffer. Tracey White then pushed the girlfriend away from her two friends to which appellant responded by grabbing White by the collar and pushing her up against the outside wall of the bar. Pat Frye, the tavern’s disc jockey, then jumped in between appellant and White, however, after White refused to comply to appellant’s repeated demand that she let go of his shirt, appellant punched her in the right eye. Thereafter, White was rushed to the Hershey Medical Center where she was treated for multiple injuries to the eye. Eventually she needed two operations to repair her eye. Because Tracey White was on welfare at the time of the offense, the medical costs accrued as a result of these injuries were paid in full by the Dauphin County Public Assistance Program, a subagency of the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare.</p>

On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence concluding that the agency could be considered a victim but vacated the portion of the judgment ordering restitution finding that the court failed to <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>adequately determine appellant’s ability to pay restitution and remanded for resentencing.</p>
