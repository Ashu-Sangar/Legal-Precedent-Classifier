On July 3, 1990, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1776 began distributing literature and soliciting employees at Phar-Mor’s location on Franklin Mills Circle in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, identified as Store No. 164. The union appeared at the store during working hours to solicit employees and to distribute literature on the sales floor and within non-public areas of the facility. The union organizers and agents subsequently appeared at Store No. 164 on three separate occasions on August 7, 1990, on October 8, 1990, and on November 14, 1990. Six organizers distributed literature on October 8,1990; eight organizers were present on November 14, 1990.</p>

Vincent stated that on July 3, 1990, the organizers distributed union materials and cards to employees throughout the store during work hours. On July 8, 1990, a store meeting was held at 6:30 p.m. for all store employees. One hour later, 12 vehicles pulled into the store parking lot. The individuals who were in the vehicles handed out union materials and cards to employees as they were leaving and also placed the materials on windshields of cars in the parking lot. Vincent informed the organizers of Phar-Mor’s No Distribution/No Solicitation policy and asked them to vacate the premises. He called mall security and the Philadelphia Police Department when they refused to leave. At that time most of the Phar-Mor employees had gone, leaving the organizers’ vehicles, three mall security chiefs, five Philadelphia police vehicles and one unmarked police vehicle parked in front of the store. This show of security and police force was the manager’s response to the mere presence of the union organizers and leafletting outside of the store. The organizers left.</p>

They were escorted out of the building but attempted to return. The Civil Affairs Division of the Philadelphia Police Department was called, but the store received no response.</p>

He indicated that organizers repeatedly attempted to enter the store after that to solicit employees and distribute literature. The affidavit failed to specify any dates other than July 3, 1990, or even the number of occasions on which the organizers appeared at the store.</p>

Phar-Mor, at all relevant times, maintained and enforced a company-wide policy stated as follows: “Solicitation and/or distribution of literature on Company premises by anyone not employed by Phar-Mor is strictly prohibited.” Phar-Mor managers repeatedly informed the UFCW organizers that soliciting on-duty Phar-Mor employees and distributing literature on the sales floors and in non-public areas of the stores was a violation of the no-solicitation policy and repeatedly requested that the organizers leave the premises.</p>

It follows that the first requirement of 43 P.S. § 206i has been met: “unlawful acts have been ... committed and will be continued unless restrained.” There is no requirement in section 206i(a) that the unlawful acts be aggravated by violence, vandalism, or viciousness.</p>

The Superior Court ignored the allegation of such injury to the goodwill of Phar-Mor customers and the deprivation of its right as owner to exclude others from enjoying its property. These are substantial property interests, loss of which has traditionally been deemed to be irreparable injury. <em>See, e.g., Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em><a href="/us/444/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="444 U.S. 164" data-case-ids="11305447" data-case-paths="/us/444/0164-01">444 U.S. 164</a>, <a href="/us/444/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="444 U.S. 164" data-case-ids="11305447" data-case-paths="/us/444/0164-01">100 S.Ct. 383</a>, <a href="/us/444/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="444 U.S. 164" data-case-ids="11305447" data-case-paths="/us/444/0164-01">62 L.Ed.2d 332</a> (1979).</p>

The Superior Court’s view was that the “inconveniences” suffered by Phar-Mor could not compare with UFCWs “right under the [Labor Anti-Injunction] Act to engage in collective action to protect and further employee economic interests.” 429 Pa.Super. at 401, 632 A.2d at 917. This is a superficial and inadequate comparison. We have already concluded that Phar-Mor suffered more than inconvenience — its injury was substantial and irreparable. Against that must be weighed the loss to the union; inasmuch as the UFCW has no right to conduct its organizing activities on Phar-Mor property, an injunction prohibiting such activities causes no loss to the union whatsoever. In attempting to organize Phar-Mor employees, the UFCW will retain all such <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>rights as are guaranteed by the act and which may be conducted lawfully. It seems clear that the limited injunctive relief which has been requested will result in no loss to the union but is necessary to prevent injury to protected property rights of Phar-Mor.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[188,619,1155,738]]]'>The Superior Court concluded that “the injunctive relief requested by Phar-Mor is specifically prohibited by 43 P.S. § 206f,” 429 Pa.Super. at 402, 632 A.2d at 918, listing seven provisions of the statute supposedly violated by the relief requested by Phar-Mor. The only explanation given by the court is that UFCW “used peaceful, non-destructive means” in its organizing efforts. While its activities were peaceful and non-destructive, they were not legal. Organizing activities which are legal in one time and place may be illegal in another context, and illegal activities are subject to injunction. The injunctive relief sought by Phar-Mor is simply to keep UFCW from <em>trespassing </em>— not <em>to keep UFCW from conducting lawful union activities at any time or any place other than Phar-Mor property.</em>

    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[189,1381,1153,630]]]'>The next requirement of the anti-injunction statute is that there be no adequate remedy at law. The Superior Court stated that “Phar-Mor has an adequate remedy at law since it has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging unfair labor practices.” <em>Id. </em>As to the distinction between legal and equitable remedies, resort to federal labor law has no application whatsoever. Federal labor law manifestly provides equitable, injunctive relief, so it is clear that mere resort to the NLRB does not indicate the availability of an adequate remedy at law. Thus, the requirement of 43 P.S. § 206i(e) has not been violated by Phar-Mor, as equitable relief is the only adequate remedy for the injury.</p>

There, the Supreme Court held that the retail store, Sears, could obtain an orderly resolution of the question whether the union had a federal right to remain on Sears property only by proceeding in state court, despite the fact that the union activities were arguably protected or prohibited by federal labor law, as they are in this case.

If Sears had filed a charge, the federal issue would have been whether the picketing had a recognitional or work reassignment objective; decision of that issue would have entailed relatively complex factual and legal determinations completely unrelated to the simple question whether a trespass had occurred. Conversely, in the state action, Sears only challenged the location of the picketing; whether the picketing had an objective proscribed by federal law was irrelevant to the state claim.

Such a belief on the part of the police department is not surprising in view of the holdings of the lower courts. To affirm such an erroneous conclusion that UFCW’s trespassory conduct was lawful serves only to heighten the inability of the police to understand the law and to enforce it uniformly against all trespassers. Unwillingness of the police to intervene is equivalent to an inability to protect the property rights of the complainant. Certainly from the property owner’s perspective the result is the same — police protection is not available and resort must be had to the courts.
