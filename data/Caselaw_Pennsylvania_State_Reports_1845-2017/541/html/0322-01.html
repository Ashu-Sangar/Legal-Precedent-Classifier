Appellant failed to stop the stolen vehicle and eventually crashed it into a building. Appellant immediately jumped out of the vehicle and onto the hood and roof of Officer Boyle’s cruiser while brandishing a 9mm automatic handgun. Appellant jumped off the vehicle and aimed his firearm at Officer Boyle while warning Officer Boyle not to touch his firearm. As this occurred Officer Boyle quickly attempted to remove his vehicle from the area, and Appellant rapidly discharged his firearm no less than eight times at Officer Boyle. One of these shots struck Officer Boyle in the right temple. Officer Boyle radioed that he had been shot. Upon the arrival of his fellow officers, Officer Boyle, although bleeding heavily and incapable of opening his eyes, said “the guy just got out and shot me.” Officer Boyle died two days later.</p>

The police did not interview Appellant until February 15,1991, after being advised by physicians that Appellant was then well enough. During the interview, Appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and immediately confessed to shooting Officer Boyle.

At trial the Commonwealth introduced overwhelming evidence that Appellant jumped from the vehicle he was operating brandishing a firearm, and then rapidly fired numerous bullets at Officer Boyle as Officer Boyle attempted to flee. One of the bullets struck Officer Boyle in the head. Thus, the jury had sufficient evidence from which it could reasonably conclude Appellant possessed the requisite specific intent to kill Officer Boyle. Moreover, the jury was free to disbelieve the evidence proffered by Appellant in support of claim of reduced intent and/or self-defense. <em>Commonwealth v.

As a result of Appellant’s physical condition, he was physically and mentally incapable of participating in police interrogation or arraignment until February 15, 1991. On February 15, 1991 Appellant’s physician permitted the police to interview Appellant. Appellant expressly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and immediately confessed to the murder of Officer Boyle. Appellant was not arraigned until February 19, 1991, which was the second work day following February 15, 1991, and the first time a bail commissioner was available to appear at the hospital.

Once this necessary delay is excluded it becomes obvious that Appellant’s confession could not be deemed the product of unnecessary delay prior to Appellant’s confession or arraignment.

While Appellant did not testify at trial, in support of this argument defense counsel relied on numerous portions of Appellant’s confession indicating that he shot Officer Boyle out of fear.

This inquiry is rendered more difficult given the existence of the Commonwealth’s ability to establish the requisite specific intent through inference based upon Appellant’s use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of Officer Boyle’s body. However, it must also be reiterated that our decision does not turn solely upon the ascertainment and application of a rule, but must be rendered in light of the well-recognized discretion of the trial court.

In connection with this line of questioning Mr. Curry, somewhat non-responsively, stated “well Chop came to me and said, you know some boy name Ed took and shot a cop.” (N.T. 2/26/92, p. 86). The trial court properly sustained an objection to this hearsay statement. However, we conclude that the potential for prejudice from this statement was limited since it served only to identify Appellant as the shooter, which comported with Appellant’s defense at trial involving degree of guilt rather than innocence. Moreover, immediately after sustaining the objection the trial court gave a curative instruction, which cured any potential for prejudice. <em>Commonwealth v.

Berry reviewed this statement and admitted that it was his statement. When asked if the police statement refreshed his recollection that he had opened the gun case, seen what was in it, and described the gun to the police, Berry indicated that he had not opened the case and had not told the police that he had done so. In response, the prosecutor asked Berry if he remembered telling her a few weeks before that he had opened the gun case, and Berry responded that he had not told the prosecutor that he had opened the case. Thereafter, the relevant portion of Berry’s statement to the police was properly admitted by the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, as Officer Boyle’s un-fired handgun was found to his right on the seat of the police cruiser, this testimony was further relevant to establish that his son was left-handed, and thus, was not threatening the use of force in order to rebut Appellant's claim of reduced intent and self defense. <em>Commonwealth v. Rivers, </em><a href="/pa/537/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="205" data-cite="537 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="775554" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0394-01">537 Pa. 394</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="644 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="775554,7873409" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0394-01,/a2d/644/0710-01">644 A.2d 710</a> (1994); <em>Commonwealth v.

The record further reveals that such testimony was not merely cumulative as claimed by Appellant. Moreover, Appellant has failed to sufficiently argue how, and there exists no basis upon which to conclude that, he was prejudiced by this testimony. Accordingly, trial counsel was not ineffective on the basis of this claim. <em>Commonwealth v.

We note that in connection with this claim Appellant also alleges that the trial court erred in refusing to <em>sua sponte </em>declare a mistrial on the basis of the alleged "emotional outbursts.” Based upon our disposition of this issue we find no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court should have declared, <em>sua sponte, </em>a mistrial in response to these incidents.</p>

We note that Appellant has raised two additional claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel that clearly provide no basis for relief. Trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to an allegedly inflammatory photograph of Officer Boyle in his police car after the shooting where our review of the record, together with counsels’ subsequent acknowledgment, reveals that such a photograph does not exist, and certainly was not introduced at trial. Trial counsel was also not ineffective in failing to object to the accurate instruction of the trial court that the crime of burglary is a crime of violence as a matter of law. <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, </em><a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="217" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">531 Pa. 541</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="218" data-cite="531 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1834316" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0541-01">614 A.2d 663</a> (1992); <em>Commonwealth v.

Despite this instruction the jury nevertheless retained discretion to determine whether Appellant’s prior convictions for burglary amounted to a "significant history,” and thus, whether the Commonwealth had proven the aggravating circumstance of a significant history of violent felony convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). Moreover, invalidation of this aggravating circumstance would not warrant reversal, as the death penalty remains warranted based upon the jury's finding of an additional aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v. Stokes, </em><a href="/pa/532/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="221" data-cite="532 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1835927" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0242-01">532 Pa. 242</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="222" data-cite="532 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1835927" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0242-01">615 A.2d 704</a> (1992).</p>

Given the nature of Appellant’s claims, the evidence of record, and the manner in which we have disposed of such claims, we find that Appellant has advanced no reasonable basis upon which to remand this matter for an evidentiary hearing in connection therewith.</p>
