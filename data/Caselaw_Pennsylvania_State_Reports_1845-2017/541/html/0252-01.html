The Agreement provided for the sale of natural gas by Energy Production to Bethlehem Steel, and the construction and operation of a pipeline by Energy Pipeline to transport natural gas to Bethlehem Steel’s plant in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Energy Production and Energy Pipeline became the Managing Venturers of a joint venture known as Bessie 8, and entered into a joint venture agreement for the purpose of performing the obligations under the Agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Peoples sought interim relief and an injunction prohibiting Appellees from supplying natural gas until they obtained the PUC’s permission to do so as required by the Public Utility Code (Code). The PUC referred the matter to one of its Administrative Law Judges (ALJ).</p>

The ALJ found that Bessie 8’s activities were not subject to the PUC’s jurisdiction because they were private in <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>nature and did not involve any interstate, intrastate or public utility connections. Peoples timely filed exceptions to this decision with the PUC. The PUC then referred the matter to its Office of Special Assistants (OSA) for a report on the matter. Contrary to the ALJ, the OSA recommended that Peoples’ complaint be sustained. The matter was then placed on the PUC agenda for a public meeting and consideration.</p>

During the meeting, the Chairman moved to adopt the ALJ’s initial decision and reject the OSA report. The Commissioners reached a two-two tie vote on this motion. Immediately thereafter, another Commissioner made a second motion to <em>reject </em>the ALJ’s initial decision and adopt the OSA report and recommendation. The Commissioners also reached a two-two tie vote on this motion. Accordingly, the Chairman declared on the record that the Commission had taken “no action” and the matter was tabled for further consideration at a later time. Reproduced Record at 224a. Significantly, the Commission issued no decisions or orders on the matter, on the record or otherwise.</p>

A 4-3 majority of the Commonwealth Court sitting <em>en banc </em>agreed, holding that the PUC effectively “affirmed” the decision of the ALJ when the PUC failed to agree to take the action requested by Peoples on April 6, 1989. The majority also found that Peoples was required to appeal from the decision of the PUC at the April 6, 1989 meeting. Because Peoples did not so appeal, the majority held that the ALJ’s decision became final and the PUC’s December 1992 order was invalid because the PUC had no authority to issue it.</p>

The process by which complaints are handled by the PUC is as follows. First, the ALJ reviews the subject matter of the complaint and makes a decision. This decision is not final, nor is it an order at this point. There are two different routes that may be taken by which a final order will eventually be entered. First, if no exceptions are filed by either party and an appeal is not taken within 15 days of the ALJ’s initial decision <em>and </em>if the PUC does not <em>sua sponte </em>enter an alternate order, the ALJ’s initial decision becomes final. 66 Pa.C.S. § 332(h). However, if exceptions <em>are </em>filed, then the matter is taken to the PUC, where “the PUC has all the powers which it would have had in making the initial decision ...” 66 Pa.C.S. § 335(a). The PUC has the power to conduct its own fact finding, to adopt or reject the ALJ’s decision, or to come to an entirely different resolution. Thus, if exceptions are filed, only the PUC can take action, and the ALJ’s decision cannot take on the force and effect of an order. Importantly, in considering the matter, any.action that is taken by the PUC must comply with the quorum/unanimity provisions of § 301(d).</p>

Nor do the facts of this case support the contention that “final action” was taken by the PUC in this matter at the April 6, 1989 meeting. The Commissioners voted on <em>two </em>different <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>motions, one supporting the ALJ’s recommendation, one supporting the OSA’s recommendation. <em>Both </em>recommendations resulted in a two-two deadlock vote.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

As an initial matter, we note that Appellees, who originally initiated this matter in the Commonwealth Court, now argue that this appeal is erroneously before this Court because the Commonwealth Court was acting as an appellate court, not as a court of original jurisdiction, and no allowance of appeal was granted by this Court. We reject this contention. The Commonwealth Court was not acting as a "reviewing” court. Appellees initiated this action with the Commonwealth Court, requesting that the Commonwealth Court make an original adjudication regarding the scope and the meaning of § 301(d) of the Code. Appellees were not requesting a substantive review of the decision made by the PUC on October 1, 1992, and in fact, no such review was made by the Commonwealth Court. In reaching its decision, the Commonwealth Court did not consider any order or adjudication from the PUC by way of review or appeal, nor did it consider the record of prior proceedings in the PUC. We note that it is somewhat disingenuous of Appellees to now argue that the proceedings in the Commonwealth Court were not directed to the original jurisdiction of that court when Appellees made the contrary argument in their Petition for Review to the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Appellees contend that to permit the PUC to table certain proposals through deadlock votes, only to revisit the issue months or years later, violates notions of fundamental fairness. However, the statute could not be more clear that any action by the PUC must be by unanimous vote. Such statute reflects the will of the legislature that matters before the PUC be determined by a unanimous majority, not by tie votes. Moreover, it is unclear how Appellees have been unfairly affected by delayed action. When Appellees entered into the Agreement, they assumed the risk that at some point their operations may be deemed to be a public utility. The fact that it was deemed to be such later rather than sooner does not appear to be of real consequence.</p>

In <em>AT &amp; T, </em>the Commonwealth Court held that a two-two vote by the PUC was equivalent to a rejection of an ad hoc committee’s recommendation regarding a local telephone exchange carrier’s role in interexchange customer billing inquiries and thus was a final order from which an appeal would lie. Significantly, the court did not put section 301(d) at issue in that case. Rather, the issue was whether the complainants were put “out of court” by the PUC’s two-two vote, and as a result whether the complainants should be entitled to an appeal. Thus, the court was faced with determining whether a vote by the PUC, which has the unofficial "effect” of a rejection, can be considered final for appeal purposes, a judicial conclusion which results from the practical effects of the order rather than a technical interpretation. Here, that question is not before us; neither party was "put out of court” by the April 6, 1989 tie vote and neither party attempted to appeal the tie votes. In this case, the issue is whether under § 301(d) final action had been taken at the April 1989 meeting.</p>
