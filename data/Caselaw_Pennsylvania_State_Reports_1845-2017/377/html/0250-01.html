There is <em>no direction </em>in this paragraph, not even, as we view it, an indication that the stocks and bonds must be preserved intact and without separation until the termination of the trust, but on the contrary, <em>merely a desire that they be retained as long as the trustees think it safe and profitable and proper.</em>

The testator therefore could not have contemplated or intended that the bonds and the stock must be held <em>without separation after 1942. </em>As further indication of testator’s intent he authorized his executors and trustees in the Tenth Paragraph of his will to sell all or any part. of his stocks and bonds “whenever in their discretion they may think proper.” While this general discretionary power of sale would not prevail over a mandatory provision of sale or retention of the newspaper stock, if such were provided in the Sixth Paragraph of his will, the Sixth Paragraph as we have seen contained no such provision, direction or prohibition. ,</p>
