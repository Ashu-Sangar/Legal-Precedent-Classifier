Indeed, it could not relate to any other city of the first class, if any, unless its charter provided for all these same offices (enumerated in §5 of the Act of 1953). That the Act is also a special act cannot be denied, for it clearly grants special privileges and immunities. Of all the city and county offices of the City of Philadelphia, only four were selected to be taken out of the City-County Consolidation Amendment, and only these four were exempted from the provisions of <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>the Charter itself. Section 5 of that Act joins elected officers, such as the Sheriff and County Commissioners, with appointive officers, such as the Board of Revision of Taxes and members of the Registration Commission. In addition, there is no rational, substantial ground for the classification attempted to be made. The offices classified in the Act have no characteristics distinguishing them from other county offices. The classification is therefore arbitrary. If the civil service and merit system is appropriate for the selection and retention of clerks and stenographers in city offices, what rational basis can there be for a legislative determination that employes performing precisely the same type of work, under the same pay and classification plan, are to be excluded from the merit system in the offices designated? And it is impossible to discover any reason for the pronouncement that a stenographer in the office of the District Attorney may be dismissed only for cause, but a stenographer of the same grade, receiving the same compensation, in the office of the Sheriff or the Board of Revision of Taxes may be dismissed arbitrarily.</p>

As we have said, by the terms of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, section 7-100, all the employes of the City were placed under civil service and merit rating, and under section 10-107 political activity on the part of city officers and appointees was forbidden. Under the <em>Lennox </em>and <em>Carrow </em>cases, the Sheriff, the Board of Revision of Taxes, the Registration Commission, the County Commissioners and the Recorder of Deeds automatically became subject to the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter regulating city officers and employes. By the terms of §5 of the Act of 1953, the civil service requirements and the prohibition against political activity by the Sheriff, City Commissioners, members of the Board of Revision of Taxes and the Registration Commission, and the employes of those offices, are declared to he inapplicable. Therefore an immunity is furnished in that the appointees of those offices are exempt from civil service and merit rating and from the prohibition against political activity. But in all other offices of the city, civil service and the prohibition against political activity of such employes are retained. Cf. <em>Wood v.

But, since it has been injected into the discussion, it is not amiss to point out that we are neither holding nor even implying that a resolution of Council, approved by a vote of the people (the procedure for amending the Charter), is the passage of a law within the contemplation of Article III, Section 7, of the Constitution whose operative prohibitions are directed against the passage by the legislature of certain laws.</p>

      <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>The question with which this case is concerned is whether the passage of the Act of 1953, being as the majority opinion clearly demonstrates a local and special law, violates two specific prohibitions of Article III, Section 7, of the Constitution, namely, changing the charters of cities, and granting special or exclusive privileges or immunities. It is argued that the City-County Consolidation Amendment authorizes the enactment by the legislature of laws respecting Philadelphia without restraint from these or, in fact, any of the inhibitions so specified in the Constitution. The fallacy of this contention appears upon a moment’s reflection on the wording of the Amendment concerning local and special laws. All that the Amendment did in such regard was to lift the restraint on local and special legislative action with respect to merely the following two of the twenty-eight inhibited subjects listed in Section 7 of Article III, namely, “Regulating the affairs of counties, cities” and other municipal or political subdivisions and “Creating offices, or prescribing the powers and duties of officers in counties, cities” and such other subdivisions. That leaves untouched by the Amendment the twenty-six other prohibited subjects of legislation among which are the changing of charters of cities, towns or villages and the granting “to any corporation, association or individual any special or exclusive privilege or immunity . . As the majority opinion recognizes and plainly declares, both of those prohibitions are violated by the Act of 1953.</p>

The fallacy becomes all the more apparent when it is realized that the remaining prohibited subjects of local or special legislation embrace such matters as “granting divorces”, “changing the law of descent or succession”, “changing the rules of evidence in any judicial proceeding or inquiry before courts”, “fixing <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>the rate of interest”, “exempting property from taxation”, “regulating labor, trade or manufacturing”, etc. It seems too obvious for discussion that the Consolidation Amendment, by granting to the General Assembly the power by local and special laws to regulate the affairs of the city and create offices or prescribe the powers and duties of officers thereof, did not thereby confer power upon the legislature to enact separate and distinct laws for Philadelphia concerning, for example, the granting of divorces, the changing of rules of evidence in court proceedings, the fixing of the rate of interest, etc. And, if it be conceded, therefore, as it must, that the Consolidation Amendment does not authorize the legislature’s enactment of local and special laws in violation of all <em>such </em>prohibitions, how can it be maintained that the Amendment <em>does </em>permit the passage of laws in violation of the two constitutional prohibitions here involved, which are equally not exempted by the terms of the Amendment?</p>
    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[251,1444,1161,862]]]'>It is argued that the power to regulate the affairs of cities necessarily and inherently involves the right to change their charters. If that were so, the inclusion in Section 7 of Article III of the inhibition against changing the charters of municipalities would have been unnecessary, the regulation of the affairs of municipalities having already been inhibited by the constitutional provision. Manifestly, many laws might be passed by the legislature regulating the .affairs of cities without changing in any way the provisions of their charters, as is strikingly demonstrated by the very Act here under consideration. Sections 2, 3 and 4, the constitutionality of which is not challenged, enact very important provisions regulating the affairs of the City of Philadelphia without changing any of the provisions of the Home.

Our cases are legion which proclaim the principle of constitutional law that, in order to support a grant of special privileges and a withholding of such privileges from others, there must be at least some semblance of a logical and reasonable basis for differentiation between the individuals or groups so relatively classified. In the present instance, the privilege of political activity is not granted, or denied, to <em>all </em>City employees or to certain defined classes of such employees, but merely to the employees of four particular City offices, — clearly an arbitrary selection since, as the majority opinion points out, those offices have nothing in common with one another nor any characteristics which distinguish them as a class from other offices all of which are now a part of the City government. While it is true that the ban of political activity was the established rule in offices of the former <em>City </em>of Philadelphia, whereas the employees of the offices of the <em>County </em>of Philadelphia were not restrained from engaging in political activity, that differentiation, permissible as it undoubtedly was as between the government of counties and the government of cities, clearly became unjustified when, by reason of the Consolidation Amendment, all County offices became City offices and thereby component parts of the municipal government.</p>

This Charter was a voluminous, detailed framework of government, with minute directions and details for every office created or mentioned and the powers and duties of the officers thereunder. It provided, inter alia, that men and women employees in so-called County departments of Philadelphia (which were co-extensive territorially and <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>geographically with the City of Philadelphia) who had always enjoyed the American privileges and immunities of engaging in political activities after working hours, should thereafter become and be called City employees but no longer possess such privileges and immunities and should be under civil service.</p>

In 1874 when the Constitution was adopted, the legislature, and only the legislature, could grant or change a charter. It was therefore both wise and necessary at that time to restrict the right of the legislature by expressly prohibiting it from enacting <em>local or special </em>laws to incorporate a city or change its charter. The Commonwealth argues that this reason and necessity ceased in <em>1922 </em>when the Home Rule Constitutional Amendment, to wit, Article XV, §1, empowered the legislature in its discretion to grant to cities “the right and power to frame and adopt their own charters and to exercise the powers and authority of local self-government, subject, however, to such restrictions, limitations, and regulations, as may be imposed by the Legislature.” If thereafter a charter and certain ordinances were adopted by one city council they would almost inevitably differ in some important particulars from those adopted by other city councils; and legislative acts imposing restrictions and regulations would necessarily deal differently with different charters and different provisions of local self-government; and consequently the prohibition in the 1874 Constitution against local or special laws changing charters <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>was impliedly repealed. Whatever doubts may exist as to this contention, when the Home Rule Amendment of 1922 is considered together with the First Class City Home Rule Act of 1949 <em>and especially with the CityGounty Consolidation Amendment of 1951 </em>(which authorized the legislature to pass local and special laws to regulate the governmental affairs of the City of Philadelphia, to create offices for the City, and to prescribe the powers and duties of officers of the City, in spite of the prohibition thereof in Article III, §7 of the 1874 Constitution) all doubts are completely removed, because these Constitutional Amendments and the First Class City Home Rule Act <em>taken together </em>are <em>absolutely inconsistent </em>with and necessarily repeal the 1874 prohibition of changing a charter by local or special legislation.
