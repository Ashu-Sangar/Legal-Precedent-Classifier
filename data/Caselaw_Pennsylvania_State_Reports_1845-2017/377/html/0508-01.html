Subsequently defendants petitioned for a rule on plaintiff to show cause why the judgment should not be marked satisfied because, as they alleged, they had paid him five installments each of $1,100, being the full amount due on the note. In his answer to the petition plaintiff admitted the receipt of such payments but averred that they were made, not on the note, but on an open book account for merchandise (turkey feed) sold and delivered by him to defendants. He further averred, in New Mattel", that he had furnished defendants with turkey feed on an open book account in the sum of $16,787.80 on the express understanding that the judgment should be and remain a lien upon defendant’s real estate until not only the loan represented by the judgment but the full amount of the book account had been paid.

The court approved the issue as thus framed and the case proceeded to trial by a jury, the result of which was a verdict that the payments were made on account of the judgment note.</p>
