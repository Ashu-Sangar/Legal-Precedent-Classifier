The motor vehicle was owned by Lewis Eberhard, one of the defendants, but was not being driven by him. Since no agency relationship was established between Eberhard and the other defendants, a directed verdict was returned in his favor, which is not questioned by the plaintiffs. The liability of the other defendants, George Cole, William Grubbs and Albert Volker, who were partners trading as Manheim Body Repair, was submitted to the jury and they returned a verdict in favor of the minor plaintiff for $12,500 and for the father in the sum of $7,500. The defendants moved for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial, both of which motions were denied. From the judgments entered on the verdicts, following the dismissal of the motions the present appeal is taken.</p>

So viewed, the following facts appear: George Cole, one of the defendants, was driving a 1949 Hudson sedan which his partners had just repaired. The car was to be delivered to the Roxy Motors Company, located in the German-town section of Philadelphia, for additional repairs, sometime around noon. The accident occurred at 4:45 P.M. Defendant Cole admitted that somehow he had <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>become lost and in tbe process of finding Ms way, turned off the main streets and found himself on Newhall Lane, an improved street which does not exist on the city plan, but which, nevertheless, is open to public use. Newhall Lane is 18 feet wide and has no sidewalks. It runs north and south through a low-cost public housing project from Price Street on the south to Rittenhouse Street on the north, a distance described in the record as about three-quarters of a block.</p>
    <p id="b46-4" data-blocks='[["BL_46.4",46,[260,896,1155,427]]]'>The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Defendant Cole testified that except for an automobile parked on the east side as he first entered Newhall Lane, there was nothing to obstruct his view as he proceeded northwardly in the center of the street. He admitted seeing two signs on the east side of the street which read “Caution — Children at Play” and “Speed Limit 15 Miles” respectively.</p>

She stated that before entering her apartment she observed a group of 10 or 12 children playing in the street and on the curb near the third tree south of Rittenhouse Street (which is approximately in the middle of the block on the east side). She said that she entered her apartment, and, after opening her window to deposit some trash on a ledge, she saw a body (later identified to be the minor plaintiff) flying through the air for a distance of approximately 30 feet; that immediately behind the body, traveling-in the same direction, she saw the automobile operated by defendant Cole. The body was thrown in a northwardly direction and after it landed, rolled about 6 feet toward the east curb. When the automobile stopped, the back portion thereof was at a point <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>42 feet beyond the point where the body came to rest. Mrs. Buffman estimated that about one minute elapsed between the time she saw the children playing and the time she saw the body propelled through the air.</p>
    <p id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[168,570,1148,320]]]'>Mrs. Kelbaugh, another witness for the plaintiff, testified that immediately after the accident there were children playing in the vicinity of the third tree south of Rittenhouse Street, and, further, at the time the automobile came to a stop she could hear children playing in that general direction.</p>

In the <em>Foley </em>case we held “. . . that where an injury may be the result of one of several causes for only one of which defendant is liable, the burden is on the plaintiff to individuate that one as the proximate cause of his injury and to exclude other causes fairly suggested by the evidence to which it would be equally reasonable to attribute the injury: . . .”, citing <em>Lott v.

Even considering this language divorced from its surrounding context, we fail to see where any evidence adduced by the defendants would sufficiently suggest that the accident was caused by the child’s suddenly running into the side of the car. At most an issue of fact was raised for the jury’s consideration. The fact that parts of the child’s skin and hair were found about three feet from the east side of the roadway does not establish that he was bumped by the right side of the car. The same result could have followed a front end collision.</p>

Immediately after the extracted quotation we said, “. . . But on the other hand, where the evidence points to a certain cause which would make the defendant liable the plaintiff will not be denied redress merely because there may be some other <em>possible </em>cause for the accident; in such a case the question is for the jury: . . .”.</p>

Of. course, the presentation of evidence after argument affords opportun<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>Ity for the coloring or manufacture of testimony to supply deficiencies revealed by opposing counsel’s argument, and its introduction must be most carefully and cautiously considered by the court.

Verdict for the plaintiff Carl VanBuren and award him $1,000 to cover all medical expenses to date; and also $300 per year until Bruce is 21 years of age, to be placed in trust for future medieal expenses; an additional $2,500 to be used at the discretion of Carl VanBuren to meet future contingencies until Bruce attains the age of 21. We find in favor of the plaintiff Bruce Van Burén and award him the sum of $5,000 to be placed in trust until he attains the age of 21, to supplement future loss of earnings.”. The trial judge, realizing that the verdict was defective on several grounds, refused to have it recorded and thereupon questioned the jury about the items they had included in the verdict. This provoked a lengthy colloquy participated in by the judge, counsel and individual jurors which covers 8 pages of the printed record. During its course the judge initially asked the jury whether they had taken into account at all the item of pain and suffering, to which one juror replied, “We discussed it.”. The judge then said,' “That is already included? Very well.”. <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>Plaintiffs’ counsel thereupon stated to the court that he did not believe pain and suffering was included. The judge responded, “1 do not know; I asked that question.”. Further comment on this element of damages at that point would seem to have been uncalled for but the judge repeated his instructions to the jury covering this phase of the law as to the damages recoverable, and the jury again retired.</p>
    <p id="b51-3" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[175,791,1149,430]]]'>Upon exception by defendants’ counsel to this additional charge, the judge, in order to clarify the matter and remove all doubt, recalled the jury and asked them if pain and suffering had been included in their award, and this time the jury answered in the negative.

We think the learned and experienced judge in the present case conscientiously endeavored to conform with this rule but, in our opinion, the course and extent of the colloquy with respect to the award of damages inevitably had a prejudicial effect upon the defendants. Pain and suffering as an item of damage which was referred to by the court seven times during the prolonged discussion, became unduly emphasized.

I do not hear such a clarion cry in this case.</p>

The record shows the Trial Judge to be one of competence and long experience and one not only endowed with splendid judicial equipment but obviously motivated by a great will to achieve an impartial and just result in the controversy before him.</p>

It is obvious from the wording of the original verdict, added to what several jurors said in open court, that possibly the jury had missed the item of pain and suffering. In order to determine whether this possibility was reality, the judge questioned the jury as follows: “THE COURT: Mr. Foreman, in order that there may be no doubt, when you reported to the court a few minutes ago that $5,000 was to be awarded to Bruce VanBuren, the minor, what ivas it yon said? JUROR NO. 3: For future loss of earnings was on it, sir. JUROR NO. 6: To supplement future loss of earnings. THE COURT: What does that mean? Did you consider pain and suffering and distress as included in that $5,000? Or was that $5,000 merely to supplement the probable future loss of earnings? JUROR NO. 6: That is right, Your Honor. THE COURT: The latter? JUROR NO. 6: In the event this should incapacitate him so that he couldn’t earn a fair income this would supplement the $5,000. THE COURT: That is what I thought you said. Did you include in that $5,000 compensation for pain and suffering? JUROR No. 6: No, sir. THE COURT: Past or future? JUROR No. 6: No, sir.
