Watson, the appellant, was employed for a number of years by the School District of the City of McKeesport as a teacher under a statutorily prescribed written contract. The employment endured until August, 1949, when the local School Superintendent notified her that she was suspended indefinitely. When Miss Watson applied for reinstatement, the School Board charged that she was suffering mental derangement and assigned the condition as a basis for her dismissal as a teacher. The Board held several hearings on the alleged incompetency at which Miss Watson asserted that the Public School Code of 1949, P. L. 30, unconstitutionally deprived her of a jury trial on the issue of her mental condition. The Board sustained the charge of mental derangement and, in March 1950, dismissed her.</p>

She then appealed to the court below where a hearing <em>de novo </em>was held. The court found from the evidence that the appellant suffered from olfactory hallucinations coupled with paranoid delusions and concluded that the appellant was mentally deranged within the intendment of Section 1122 of the Public School Code of 1949, P. L. 30, 24. PS § 11-1122. Section 1122 specifies, inter alia, that “mental derangement” on the part of a teacher is a valid basis for terminating a contract of professional employment. The court accordingly entered an order sustaining the decision of the Superintendent of Public Instruction that the appellant’s contract of employment as a school teacher was validly terminated by the Board of Directors of the School District.</p>

His detailed and pertinent findings from substantial evidence leave no doubt that the appellant was, in fact, mentally deranged. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider at length the first question posed by the appellant as to whether the facts, as found by the court below, establish a case of mental derangement within the meaning of Section 1122 of the Public School Code of 1949. In interpreting the term “mental derangement”, which the Code does not define, the words are to be accorded their common and ordinary meaning: Section 33 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS § 533. “Deranged”, from which the cognate noun derives, is authoritatively defined as “Disordered; esp. disordered in mind; crazy, insane”: Webster’s New International Dictionary (2nd Ed.). And, such is the meaning the learned court below properly ascribed to “mental derangement”, as used in the Code, when it said that , the- term “means <em>a </em>

      <em>■ </em>The appellant’s principal contention, which her counsel earnestly urges upon us, is that the Public School Code of 1949 unconstitutionally deprived her of the right to a trial by jury on the issue of mental derangement since such right existed in Pennsylvania prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1874 and is, therefore, vouchsafed to her by Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution which provides that “Trial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate.” The fallacy in this argument is that no statute, enacted prior to the Constitution of 1874, entitled a teacher, when discharged for mental derangement, to a trial of the issue by a jury. The fact is that “mental derangement” as a basis for a teacher’s discharge appeared for the first time in Section 2 of the Act of April 6, 1937, P. L. 213 (popularly known as the Teachers’ Tenure Act), which, as an amendment of the School Code of 1911, conferred for the first time rights of tenure upon professional employees. Before the enactment of the tenure provisions contained in the amendatory Act of 1937, it had been held that “by the fact of his employment the teacher submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the board, upon any charge of incompetency, cruelty, negligence, or immorality, which might be preferred against him; and. that the action of the board, if it be properly entered upon the minutes in the form and manner required ■ by. the statute, in case of a dismissal is conclusive, unless, the board can be shown to have acted corruptly or in. bad. faith, or - to have clearly abuséd its <em>powers” McCrea </em>v. <em>Pine Tp.

Neither statute, however, required that an appeal to the court be tried to a jury. Nor is it constitutionally essential that either Act should have done so, for, by both, the rights of teachers were enlarged and not diminished; in short, the statutes conferred upon teachers rights which the common law had not accorded them. The failure to include a provision for a further right (viz., trial by jury of an issue of mental derangement) docs not render the procedure unconstitutional: see <em>Premier Cereal &amp; Beverage Co. v. Pennsylvania Alcohol Permit Board, </em><a href="/pa/292/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="292 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1109633" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0127-01">292 Pa. 127</a>, 132-133, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.%20858" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="140 A. 858">140 A. 858</a>; and <em>School District of the Borough of Duquesne v.

What the Act of 1836 did was to authorize courts of common pleas to determine, upon application of “a relation by blood or marriage” or “a person interested in his estate”, the lunacy or habitual drunkenness of any person by the appointment of a commission to try the issue before a panel of not less than six nor more than twelve jurors and to permit any person aggrieved by a finding of the commission to appeal to the court of common pleas where such finding could be traversed before a jury.
