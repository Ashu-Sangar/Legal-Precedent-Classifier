    <p id="b418-5" data-blocks='[["BL_418.6",418,[258,1125,1154,202]]]'>The Department did issue regulations but in doing so it restricted the scope of the term “establishment” by declaring that it “shall apply only to a factory as hereinafter defined.”</p>
    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.7",418,[257,1347,1156,697]]]'>On June 27, 1950, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Pennsylvania State Legislative Board of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, et al., brought an action of mandamus against the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Industry to compel him (1) to change the Department’s definition of establishment so as to have it conform to the terminology of the Act, and thus include railroads as well as factories; (2) to require him to promulgate rules bringing railroad personnel within the purview of the Act; and (3) directing him to prosecute railroads and “responsible officers to secure safe sanitary conditions on the railroads of this Commonwealth.”</p>

The railroads of today have made remarkable strides in providing comfort, cleanliness and convenience for passengers, but it would be mockery if those who work to assure that safety and sanitation for the travelling public should themselves be denied facilities now universally recognized as minimum American standards for protection of health.</p>
    <p id="b419-4" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[177,936,1150,475]]]'>The exhibits in this case bespeak conditions which beckon the carriers of pollution and invite the germs of disease. The Complaint avers that remonstrances have been made to the Department of Labor and Industry, conferences were had with the cabinet official heading that department, requests were made for opinions from the Department of Justice, inspectors were asked to take action, and the Governor was petitioned, but all to no avail.</p>
    <p id="b419-5" data-blocks='[["BL_419.6",419,[178,1434,1150,697]]]'>The relief which the plaintiffs seek is one of grave moment, one that engaged the attention of the General Assembly and called forth legislation in behalf of the health of the people. Nothing can be more conducive to an enlightened civilization than an effective system of sanitation, drainage and lavtiation which cleanses, scours and purifies, driving contagion into the limbo of incineration and contamination into the distant reaches of the sea. The body of the modern State can not healthily survive unless it is vitalized with the arteries of sanitary plumbing. Soap and water are the most formidable enemies of pestilence and disease.</p>

L. 177, 71 PS 574) constitutes a complete and adequate remedy at law; and that the plaintiffs should seek relief by interposing the “collective bargaining” rights guaranteed by the Railway Labor Act (Act of Congress of May 20, 1926, c. 347, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%201186" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="48 Stat. 1186">48 Stat. 1186</a>, amended, 45 U.S.C.A.

It selected one of its own by holding that if the plaintiffs have a remedy it must be obtained via a declaratory judgment under the Act of 1923, June 18, P.L. 840 (12 PS 831 et seq.) However, if Mandamus actually lies, it is not for the Court to order an alternative procedure. In the first place, it is not certain that declaratory judgment is available here. In <em>List’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/283/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="283 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1090552" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0255-01">283 Pa. 255</a>, we held that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act was not intended for, and should not be invoked in cases where the judgment sought can be had as expeditiously in the ordinary course of legal procedure as it can under the statute. This rule has been confirmed in a number of decisions.</p>

We are satisfied that the plaintiffs were well advised in proceeding via the Rules of Civil Procedure governing Action of Mandamus (354 Pa. lxiii) rather than by declaratory judgment.</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[167,572,1149,1584]]]'>Defendant’s counsel urged in the court below and here that by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, supra, Congress has preempted the field of interstate carriers and has assumed exclusive control over rates of pay and working conditions on interstate railroads, so that the State enactment is superseded and the Federal Act governs. Neither the Railway Labor Act, nor any other Federal statute, can deprive Pennsylvania of its sovereign police power exercised in behalf of the security of the Commonwealth and the health and welfare of its citizens. In the case of <em>Munn v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/94/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="94 U.S. 113" data-case-ids="5647121" data-case-paths="/us/94/0113-01">94 U. S. 113</a>, it was urged against the State of Illinois that one of its statutes, establishing rates of charges for storage of grain in warehouses, was invalid because it sought to regulate interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, in rejecting this contention, said that — “ fit is not everything that affects commerce that amounts to a regulation of it, within the meaning of the Constitution.’ The warehouses of these plaintiffs in error are situated and their business carried on exclusively within the limits of the State of Illinois. They are used as instruments by those engaged in State as well as those engaged in inter-state commerce, but they are no more necessarily a part of commerce itself than the dray or the cart by which, but for them, grain would be transferred from one railroad station to another. Incidentally they may become connected with interstate commerce, but not necessarily so.”</p>

S. 1</a>, is directly in point. There, for the protection of railroad switching crews who were compelled to ride (at risk of life and limb) the top and sides of the rear cars of trains, the Illinois Commerce Commission promulgated an order requiring railroads to provide cabooses on all designated runs within the confines of the State. The defendant contested the order, claiming that it encroached upon the exclusive powers of the Federal Government under the Interstate Commerce Act. Furthermore, that the involved employees could obtain relief under the same Railway Labor Act cited by the defendant in the case at bar. Addressing itself to this argument the Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Jackson, said: “. . . we would hardly be expected to hold that the price of the federal effort to protect the peace and continuity of commerce has been to strike down state sanitary codes, health regulations, factory inspections, and safety provisions for industry and transportation ... We hold that the enactment by Congress of the Railway Labor Act was not a preemption of the field of regulating working conditions themselves and did not preclude the State of Illinois from making the order in question.” (p. 7.)</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[270,1690,1156,597]]]'>In effectuating the order of the Illinois Commerce Commission, cabooses attached to interstate trains were often carried into adjoining States because of the impracticability of cutting off thé cabooses at the State lines. The défendant regarded this a-direct invasion of the Interstate Commerce regulation by Congress, but Justice Jackson said that' the State order “finds its origin in the local climactic conditions ¿nd in the hazards created by particular local physical structures, and it has rather óbvioüs relation to the health and safety of local workmen.” (p. -8.) ■ ' "'</p>

In fact, the lower court here conceded: “There is nothing in the Act which specifically excludes railroads, either intra or inter-state, from its purview. If they are to be excluded it must be for some reason dehors the Act.”</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[185,1125,1148,432]]]'>Since there is nothing within or without the Act to exclude railroads from its operation, a duty manifestly fell upon the Secretary of Department of Labor and Industry to enforce its provisions against railroads.

Discretion, however, does not include capricious, captious or contrary refusal to enforce a statutory requirement. In <em>Hotel Casey Co. v.

The learned court below was in error in holding: “Whether or not they [railroads] are to be excluded involves a construction of "the Act and consideration of factors such as police <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>power of the State, interstate character of the railroads, federal legislation, constitutional limitations, and the like.
