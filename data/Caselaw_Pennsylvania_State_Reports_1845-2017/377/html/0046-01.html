Santos was indicted for the murder of Kate Nadab and her small boy. Santos called at the Nadab home and shortly afterwards several shots were heard. Kate and her son were shot to death and Santos was wounded in the head. The defense was that Kate had shot him and the child and then committed suicide. Defendant at the trial offered to prove that Kate had a conversation with the witness within three weeks of her death in which she stated that “unless [Santos] mended his ways and ceased from cheating and defrauding her she would kill him, . . . and after she had killed him she would kill herself.”</p>

Under these facts and circumstances we believe the Trial Judge properly exercised his discretion and did not commit reversible error in refusing the aforesaid offer of proof, because even from the viewpoint most favorable to defendant, <em>the proffered statement was too remotely or unreasonably connected with the events which actually or allegedly occurred.</em>

Demands for new or extended rights and privileges for those accused of heinous crimes are constantly being made, with no thought for the rights, the safety, the welfare, or the protection of Society, or for the feelings or rights of the victim’s bereaved family. In these days of organized crime and high powered automobiles, the Commonwealth usually has a very difficult task — first to capture and then to convict a murderer or dangerous criminal. While Courts must continue to carefully protect the constitutional and legal rights of every person accused of crime, they should likewise give careful consideration to the safety and the lives of law-abiding citizens and the protection of the community; and should not <em>extend, </em>unless legally necessary, Court decisions if they favor criminals at the expense of the public safety.</p>
