Fisher and James Bell met at Dad’s Grill in Grove City of Mercer County and planned an automobile drinking party. From Dad’s Grill they proceeded to the City Grill and there invited Ruth Ann Garner, a girl 13 years of age, to accompany them on their contemplated alcoholic spree. Fisher then telephoned his girl friend, 22-year old Dorothy Gregg, and she joined the group in front of Dad’s Grill some time after 11 o’clock. James Bell summoned his wife (Mary A. Bell), and then Ralph <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>King, a friend of Ruth Ann’s, appeared on the scene to complete the party.</p>

Somewhere east of Mercer (by chance in front of Wilson’s beer garden) Fisher ran off the road, but without resulting mishap. This erratic driving was repeated at least twice again on the journey. Some 25 miles out of Grove City, the gay travellers passed through Sharon and continued on to Masury, Ohio, where they entered the Brookfield Inn for an hour’s drinking and then proceeded to the Sky Club, also beyond the Pennsylvania border, where further alcohol was ordered and consumed.</p>

At about 2 a.m., Ruth Ann, the 13-year old, apparently more alert than the older heads about her, voiced the apprehension that Fisher’s excessive drinking cast doubts on his ability to drive with safety. Trepanosky volunteered to ask his friend, John Allison, also in the night club, to take the girls home in his car, whereupon Allison entered the scenario of the impending and unfolding tragedy. Some time later, Dorothy and Ruth Ann proceeded on foot from the Sky Club across the State line into Pennsylvania, this being done because of the fear that some law might be violated by transporting the minor Ruth Ann across the boundary between Ohio and Pennsylvania. Allison waited for the girls on a street in Sharon.</p>

Unconvinced by his persuasions, Dorothy walked away from him and he made the cryptic remark (to become significant in the light of what followed) that she would be “sorry.”</p>

Fisher trailed the Allison car over various streets and was hard on Allison’s rear as it entered Washington Street in Sharon and committed itself to the rumbling advance over the five railroad tracks which cut across that thoroughfare. Overtaking Allison on the railroad crossing, Fisher swung to the right, striking Allison’s right rear bumper. He maneuvered to the right side of Allison’s speeding automobile, apparently trying to outspeed it. As both cars passed over the last railroad track of the crossing, Fisher shot ahead and at a point estimated to be 21 feet 8 inches from the western end of the crossing, he suddenly cut his wheel to the left into the direct path of Allison and stopped. Allison jammed on his brakes and swung to the left to avoid the barricade of Fisher’s car, but the momentum caused him to jump the curb, bound some. 30 feet across a yard and crash head-on into a tree, the impact instantly killing Robert Trepanosky, knocking the two girls and Allison unconscious and inflicting serious injuries on both Allison and Dorothy.</p>

Counsel for John Fisher urges judgment n.o.v. on the ground that the incontrovertible physical evidence shows that the accident could not have happened as described by the plaintiffs’ witnesses. In arguing this proposition he points out that the Allison car left the road 21 feet 8 inches beyond the crossing, that the Allison car had a minimum length of 14 feet and that Fisher’s car was a minimum distance of 6 feet ahead of Allison when it started to turn left. This, he maintains, shows that the Fisher ear was at least 20 feet from the crossing when it allegedly turned in front of the Allison car. “At this point,” he says further, “Allison was within 1 foot 8 inches of the point where he struck the curb.” And then he sums up: “In order to believe the version of the accident of the plaintiff and her witnesses it must then be believed that the Allison vehicle pivoted from its course upon the street in 1 foot 8 inches and went over the curb.”</p>

He speaks of the Allison vehicle being <em>“1J¡. feet to 18 feet </em>in length”; of the Fisher car being in advance of the Allison vehicle <em>“between 6 to 10 feet”-, </em>that Fisher pulled in front of Allison “5 <em>or </em>6 feet from the left curb;” that the Allison car “was <em>aloout </em>in the middle of the road.”</p>

It is to be remembered that the cars were traveling parallel, with the Fisher car being <em>2 to 3 </em>feet away from the Allison vehicle up until this point was reached.”</p>

With the dawning of reason and the cold realization of what his great folly had accomplished, Fisher took refuge in the palpably incredible explanation that he “blacked out” before the accident (although he continued to drive miles all the way home to Grove City) and therefore had no memory of the accident. He admitted driving from the spot where the Allison car had been parked to the bottom of the hill where he stopped for a red light, and from that point on he was unconscious, although still at the wheel! Some of his amazing testimony follows: “Q. Do you remember driving down over the hill? A. Yes. Q. How far down over the hill, do you remember? A. To the stop light and stopped. Q.

To restrict the compass of a trial (criminal or civil) to the pinpoint of the culminating crisis would be to make the verdicts of juries mere guesses. Ten witnesses may have been on the scene at the very moment that A shot B, but unless evidence is allowed as to the events which preceded the shooting it would be impossible to determine whether there was involved in the shooting affray such vital items as self-defense, lying in wait, premeditation, intended robbery, revenge, etc., etc. Examining only the tip of a pyramid can offer no intelligence as to the height, width, breadth or the materials which hold it together and raises the crest toward the sky.

One of the factual disputes at the trial, subsidiary to the main issue of the cause of the collision with the tree, was whether the Fisher car stopped or did not stop after the Allison car left Washington Street and jumped the curb. Riddle did not have a continuous view of the assumed Fisher car as it proceeded on Washington Street into • Irvine Avenue because an intervening house shut , off his visual pursuit of the <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>moving vehicle for some 165 feet. Riddle’s testimony was not so positive and free of equivocation that the defendant Fisher can use it as a firm and solid foundation for argument that Riddle absolutely disproves the testimony of Allison that the Fisher car stopped just before his (Allison’s) forced diversion from Washington Street. For instance, Riddle was asked as to whether the assumed Fisher car stopped at the scene of the accident: “Q. Now, did you see that car continue to move or did it stop? A. I saw the car next turning onto Irvine Avenue. Q. Did it stop? A. I couldn’t say.” Later on he was certain the car did not stop: “Q. From the time you first saw this car until the last time you saw it, you didn’t see it stop any place? A. No. I didn’t see it stop any place.” Still later, he was in doubt again as to whether the car stopped or not: “Q. It didn’t stop at that stop sign? A. Not that I saw.”</p>

The accident occurred at 3:17 a.m., the police officer spoke to Miss Gregg at 3:45 a.m. The injuries Miss Gregg sustained were of such a grave character that even at the time of trial (two years subsequent to the accident) she could not walk and possibly she will be crippled for life. When the car hit the tree she was rendered unconscious, she sustained bleeding cuts to her face, the right femur bone was broken, and a part of it protruded through the skin. She had lain in the debris of the demolished automobile for some time before an ambulance arrived and she had not even been taken into the emergency room of the hospital when the police officer asked her what had happened. She replied that she did not know. In view of the fact that she later testified in detail to the events which preceded the accident, Fisher complains that this probably manifests some deliberate fabrication of testimony on the part of Dorothy Gregg. In point of human experience, it would have been more unnatural for Dorothy to have remembered what occurred when she was questioned by the policeman than that she should not remember. It is common knowledge that even a healthy person suddenly shaken from a sound slumber, in. the middle of the night cannot instantaneously throw his faculties into the high gear of orientation and recollection.
