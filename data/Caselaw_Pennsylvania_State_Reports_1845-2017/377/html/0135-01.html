Route 1 near Parkland, Pennsylvania, when a freight train passed in the opposite direction along a track of the Reading Company, this track being located at that point on an embankment about 10 or 15 feet above the highway and parallel to it at a distance of some 50 feet. Suddenly a dark object came diagonally across the road directly in the path of his truck so that he was unable to avoid cob <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>liding with it. The object in question turned out to be a metal coupler of the type used to hold railroad cars together, weighing upwards of 300 pounds and about 3 feet long; it had broken off from one of the cars and had rolled down the embankment and onto the highway. The owners of the truck, Everly’s employers, brought suit to recover the cost of repairing the damage to their vehicle. Having produced their evidence as to the circumstances of the accident they relied on the “exclusive control” doctrine to take their case to the jury. The trial judge having denied defendant’s motion for a nonsuit, defendant offered evidence to the effect that the breaking of the coupler had occurred on a hopper car owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad which, shortly before, had been turned over to the defendant on car interchange; that the car had then been given a visual inspection of all exposed parts, including both couplers, which revealed, however, no visible defect; that rust on the surface of the part of the coupler remaining in place on the car after the break indicated an old fracture; and that the break had occurred about 14 inches back from the end sill at a point not visible from the outside of the car. The court refused defendant’s point for binding instructions and the jury found a verdict for plaintiff, the judgment entered on which was affirmed on appeal to the Superior Court (<a href="/pa-super/173/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="173 Pa.

      <em>The London and St. Katherine Docks Company, </em>3 Hurlstone &amp; Coltman 596, enunciated the rule of “exclusive control” in the exact language which we have since quoted and followed in a multitude of cases in our own reports, namely, that “. . . where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” We have applied this doctrine only in cases where the evidence as to the cause of the accident was peculiarly or exclusively within the possession of the defendant and not equally available to both parties.</p>

It was said in <em>Janock v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R.

It is not <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>that negligence is presumed in such cases from the mere happening of the accident but that the circumstances amount to evidence from which it may be inferred by the jury: <em>Zahniser v.

Both the equipment and .the operation of the train were, in the exclusive possession, control and management of the defendant and the accident was such as .in the ordinary course of human experience would not have happened had proper care been exercised to prevent it.

    <p id="b161-3" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[161,733,1147,874]]]'>Defendant contends that plaintiff failed to introduce evidence to show that the accident was one which would not ordinarily happen if due care had been used, —in other words, show that couplings do not ordinarily break in the absence of negligence in the method and frequency of inspections. Such a requirement, however, would amount to a complete negation of the very rule of “exclusive control” since it would practically necessitate proof of negligence by positive testimony instead of permitting its inference from the circumstances attending the accident. In all the cases applying the rule the court itself determined, as a matter of common knowledge, that the nature of the occurrence was so unusual that, when it did occur, an inference would reasonably arise that it resulted from failure to exercise proper care.</p>
