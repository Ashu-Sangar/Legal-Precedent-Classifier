The only evidence of a dangerous condition in the sidewalk appears from the photograph. Taken at an undisclosed angle, it shows an elevation of one block of the sidewalk of about an inch. Assuming that this could constitute a dangerous condition, there was no evidence that plaintiff tripped or stumbled over it and since she was going with the grade there was no evidence that she fell over it or that she actually fell at that spot or that that elevation was the cause of her fall. For all the evidence shows, she may have turned her ankle or fallen or stumbled for some unknown reason at or near this elevation. She therefore failed to make out a prima facie case.</p>

In that case plaintiff slipped off a sewer manhole cover in the middle of the pavement which extended approximately 2 inches above the pavement. The judgment non obstante veredicto was sustained on two points: (1) that the evidence was not sufficient to show negligence, and (2) that plaintiff’s evidence did not show that the elevation was the cause of her fall. The Court said (pages 24-25; 24) : “The elevation was slight and of a trivial nature, and consequently there was no negligence in permitting it to exist. See: Burns v.

The photograph introduced in this case reveals the sidewalk on Locust Street in Ephrata to be made up of concrete slabs some 3 or 4 feet square. At a point adjacent to the trunk of a tree, one of the blocks stands at an elevation of an inch or two above the neighboring one to which it should have been laterally joined for a continuous smoothly walking surface. The pavement follows the gentle slope of the contour of the land and the plaintiff was proceeding from the higher end of the grade to the lower end. One walking in the opposite direction would have seen at once that the offending slab sat on an elevation a couple of inches above the lower slab. Mrs. Freund, however, advancing from the higher level to the lower level could very easily have been deceived by the appearance of the pavement because the drop from one slab to the next was not extreme enough to catch the normal eye of a pedestrian and yet it was deep enough to throw one off one’s balance.</p>

We know that we are more apt to detect a fault in a stairway when we are ascending than when we are descending. Careful as we may be, we must take the steps going down a normal looking stairway a great deal on faith because the fall of body weight has often gone too far beyond voluntary control for us to arrest it in the event we should see at the last moment that a tread is out of place, broken or unstable.</p>
