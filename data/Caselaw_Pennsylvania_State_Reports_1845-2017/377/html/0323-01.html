Counsel appeared for the defendants and cross-examined the witnesses called by the plaintiff. On March 25, 1954 the chancellor (Judge Sara Soffel) filed her adjudication granting the prayer of the bill. From the chancellor’s findings which are supported by the evidence and not here challenged, the facts may he stated as follows: Duquesne is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of -electric energy in the City of Pittsburgh • and ' other - municipalities in Allegheny, Beaver and Westmoreland' Counties. It has construct<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>ed and is now operating a power plant known as “Elrama Power Station”, located in parts of Beaver Borough, Allegheny County, and Union Township, Washington County, in which energy is generated by two generating units. It has constructed and operates a substation at Woodville, Collier Township, Allegheny County, from which electric energy for light, heat and power is distributed locally and transmitted to other parts of the Duquesne system. The demand for electric energy for light, heat and power has increased in the Woodville area and elsewhere in the Duquesne system during recent years and it is essential that additional energy be transmitted to the Woodville substation to care for the increased demand.</p>
    <p id="b346-4" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[249,1122,1160,1204]],["BL_347.1",347,[164,345,1148,319]]]'>A peak kilowatt load has become imposed upon the system with the result that the generating reserve capacity system is only 1.65% of the installed generating power. The minimum generating reserve necessary to provide adequately for maintenance and breakdowns and to insure adequate service to customers is 10%. Duquesne is presently installing at its Elrama Power Station a third generating unit which is to be completed and placed in operation on September 1, 1951. In order to provide sufficient generating capacity to supply the system’s peak load demand and to meet the growing requirements of its system, Duquesne proposed to construct a transmission line between the Elrama Power Station and the Woodville distributing substation. This line passes through seven political subdivisions, <em>two </em>boroughs and five townships, including the Township of Upper St. Clair and Collier Township. The location or site of this proposed transmission line from Elrama to Woodville is the result of the studied judgment of Duquesne’s Planning, Engineering, Construction and Right-of-Way Departments. The determining factors, in. the location of the pro<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>posed line were efficiency and economy. The new transmission line will be the principal means of transmitting the output of the new generator at Elrama to Duquesne’s 69,000-volt ring transmission system and of supplying the increased demand for electrical energy in the area served by the Woodville substation.</p>

Subsequently some of the Upper St. Clair property owners whose lands were involved in the applications to the Commission appeared before the Commission’s hearing examiner and, while having filed no answer or protests to the applications on their merits, moved for their dismissal for lack of jurisdiction in the Commission to entertain them, averring that (1) Duquesne does not serve nor intend to serve the public in Upper St. Clair with electric energy; (2) the Act of May 8, 1889, P.

Duquesne has acquired by purchase separate parcels of land and rights-of-way and easements along its proposed line traversing Upper St. Clair Township, including a right-of-Avay and easement acquired from one J. W. Free in and over his land and the fee in property of Fred K. Becker. On November 17, 1953 and on November 20, 1953, Duquesne, because of the pressing need for electric energy for light, heat and power in the Woodville area and elsewhere throughout its system, and for the completion by September 1, 1954 of the new transmission line contemporaneously with the completion • of the third <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>generating unit at Elrama, commenced work on the Free and Becker properties respectively, looking toward the erection of steel towers thereon for the purpose of carrying the new transmission line. On November 30, 1953 the defendant Klancher, a police officer of the township, was duly authorized by the township authorities to serve and did serve on employes of a contractor engaged by Duquesne and then working on the Free and Becker properties, a notice which read in part as follows: “In compliance with a zoning ordinance set up in the township a Building Permit must be secured, through the office of the Secretary, before any further construction work is herewith permitted. This constitutes a notice of work stoppage, and a fine of $100.00 is assessed the owner or builder for failure to meet these requirements. Each day that a Violation is permitted to exist after this notice has been served shall constitute a separate offense.”. Upon receipt of these notices, Duquesne and its contractor stopped working on these properties and have not worked there or elsewhere in the township along the proposed transmission lines. The threat of criminal prosecution contained in the notices, causing the work stoppage, interrupted and prevented and continues to interrupt and prevent the commencement and completion by September 1, 1954 of the proposed transmission line, thus hampering the proper generation and transmission of power from the Elrama Power Station to Duquesne’s customers served by the system. Unless the proposed transmission line is completed coincident with the completion of the third generator at Elrama on September 1, 1954, the energy generated by such generator will in large measure be unavailable to the Duquesne system under operating or emergency conditions and thereby Duquesne will suffer large revenue losses and incur added expenses in at<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>tempting to provide adequate services to its customers. The chancellor also found that there is urgent need for additional energy in the southern part of Duquesne’s system and the situation is expected to grow more serious by the winter of 1954-55 unless the energy generated by the new generating unit at Elrama is transmitted over the proposed transmission line and that unless Duquesne was permitted to resume the construction of the line in and over the township by March 15, 1954, it would not be possible for Duquesne to complete its construction coincident with the completion of the new generator.</p>

      <em>“The First Class Township Law Upon Which Upper St. Clair Relies Provides That It Shall Wot Modify the Public Utility Code. </em>In 1931, six years before the enactment of the Code and while the Public Service Company Law of 1913 was in effect, the General Assembly enacted the existing First Class Township Law. Section 3101 of the latter statute granted general zoning power to first class townships (53 PS 19092-3101), but, significantly, Section 3502, as initially enacted (53 PS 19092-3502), expressly provided that the act should ‘not repeal or modify any of the provisions of the Public Service Company Law’ of-<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>1913. In 1949, Section 3502 of the First Class Township Law of 1931 was amended to provide that the statute was not to ‘repeal or modify any of the provisions of the Public Utility Law’ of 1937 (53 3}S 19092-3502). Thus, long before first class townships ever acquired any zoning powers, the General Assembly had clearly expressed the policy of the Commonwealth to commit the regulation of public utilities to a commission of state-wide jurisdiction, and to impose a duty upon utilities to render adequate and efficient service and to make such changes in or extension of their facilities and service as might be necessary to accommodate or serve the public. That policy remains deeply embedded in the present Public Utility Code and is the law of Pennsylvania.</p>

      <em>“The First Class Township Law Does Wot Expressly or Impliedly Grant Such Zoning Power with Respect to Uses- and Structures, Other Than Buildings, of a Utility Company. </em>The First Class Township Law does not <em>expressly </em>confer power upon townships to regulate public utilities by zoning ordinance, with respect to uses and structures, other than buildings. Nevertheless, Upper St. Clair argues that the First Class Township Law <em>impliedly </em>confers power upon townships to regulate public utilities with respect to uses and structures. It relies upon Section 3110 of the law. That section provides (53 PS 19092-3110): ‘This article (i.e., the article conferring zoning power upon first class townships) shall not apply to any existing or proposed building, or extension thereof, used or to be used by public service corporations, if, upon petition of the corporation, the Public Utility Commission shall, after a public hearing, decide that the present or proposed situation of the building in question is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public.’ Upper St. Clair points out that <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>Section 3110 does not mention uses or structures, such as a transmission line. It argues that since buildings alone are exempted, under certain conditions, from the general power to zone, the <em>inference </em>is that uses and structures other than buildings are subject to that power. With this contention we do not agree. Further, the statute expressly and unequivocally declares that a township shall <em>not </em>modify the Public Utility Code. Now, if a first class township by zoning ordinance can exclude a utility entirely from within its borders, or can dictate where structures of the utility shall be erected or how they may be used, it then most certainly is enabled to (1) regulate the utility, and (2) make it impossible for the utility to perform its statutory duty of rendering adequate and efficient service. Thus, if the zoning article of the First Class Township Law were construed as Upper St. Clair would have it construed, that construction would modify the Code in these respects: (1) First class townships, together with the Commission, and not the Commission alone, would regulate public utility companies; and (2) public utility companies would render adequate and efficient service unless they were prevented from doing so by zoning ordinances of first class townships. Section 3110 merely grants an <em>express power </em>(not contained at all in the section granting general zoning power) to zone with respect to buildings of a public utility company, subject to a determination by the Commission that the present or proposed location of such buildings is not reasonably necessary for the convenience of [or] welfare of the public. This construction in no way modifies the Code, for it can be seen that the Commission — the regulatory body under the Code is entrusted with the vital determination of <em>necessity. </em>We therefore conclude that the policy of the Commonwealth in entrusting to the Commission the <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>regulation and supervision of public utilities has excluded townships from the same field, and that no power in townships to enter that area can be read into the First Class Township Law <em>by implication, </em>Unless the legislature has given an <em>express </em>grant of power to townships, the Commonwealth’s own expressed policy on the subject is undimini shed and supreme. We have been unable to find any case in Pennsylvania involving the question of whether a political subdivision can regulate a public utility company by a zoning ordinance. The instant case seems to be one of first impression. We know of no instance in Pennsylvania where local authorities have contended that the uses and structures of a public utility could be controlled by the application of a local zoning ordinance. Counsel for the plaintiff has cited two cases in other jurisdictions which affirm the basic principle that in event of a conflict between a local zoning law and a statute, the zoning law must give way. See <em>Jewish Consumptive’s Relief Soc. v. Town of Woodbury, </em><a href="/citations/?q=243%20N.Y.S.%20686" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="243 N.Y.S. 686">243 N. Y. Supp. 686</a> (1930), aff’d. <a href="/citations/?q=177%20N.E.%20165" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="177 N.E. 165">177 N .E. 165</a> (1931) and <em>Jennings v. Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>(Conn. Sup. Ct. Err. 1954). In the absence of a clear expression of intent on the part of the legislature to authorize a municipal subdivision by zoning-ordinance to regulate a public utility, no such power can be implied. The Public Utility Code demonstrates without question that the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has therein expressed its policy to commit the regulation of utilities to the Public Utility Commission and to impose a duty upon utilities to render efficient service. It is clear that the proposed transmission line is necessary for the rendition of efficient service to the public and that that necessity transcends the legitimate objectives of any one of the political subdivisions of the Commonwealth. We he<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>lieve that this is the reason why the General Assembly entrusted the regulation of public utilities to a commission of state-wide jurisdiction. Local authorities not only are ill-equipped to comprehend the needs of the public beyond their jurisdiction, but, and equally important, those authorities, if they had the power to regulate, necessarily would exercise that power with an eye toward the local situation and not with the best interests of the public at large as the point of reference. We believe that the General Assembly never intended to bestow a power upon first class townships which is in headlong conflict with the power already given the Public Utility Commission. We believe that the General Assembly never gave any one of the political subdivisions through which the proposed line will pass the power to determine whether the public in another locality shall be served with electric energy, or the means by which they shall be served. It is our conclusion that the Zoning Law of Upper St. Clair Township is invalid and void as applied to Duquesne Light Company.”.</p>

If the power of the municipality were held paramount, the Commission could not compel the utility to provide adequate service or in anywise control the expansion or extension of the utility’s facilities if an order of the Commission conflicted with action taken by any political subdivision of the State. This would mean the complete negation of the powers of regulation and control specifically given as a matter of public policy to the Public Utility Commission in the interest of state-wide public welfare.

The function of the Commission as stated in the Act is to determine whether the exercise of the right of eminent domain is necessary or proper for the service, accommodation, convenience or safety of the public.

The order shows that the issuance of the certificate of public convenience pursuant thereto was predicated upon the approval of the location of the transmission line, following consideration of alternate routes and determination that the proposed route was the most feasible. The law does not provide or require that there be an initial approval by the Commission of the proposed extension of a facility by a utility company before it embarks upon its undertaking. The voluntary expansion or extension of its facilities lies in the discretion of company management. To the extent, however, that it is compelled to acquire property or rights or easements therein through condemnation, it must establish necessity therefore if the latter is questioned.

It is therefore incumbent on the condemning company to decide in the first instance the amount of water deemed necessary to be condemned for its use. This does not mean that the act of the water company in this respect is final and conclusive upon all parties. Indeed, the very opposite is true, because the question of necessity may always be inquired into by a proper proceeding in the courts. . -”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The foregoing language is equally applicable to a public utility company supplying light, heat and power which enjoys the right of eminent domain.

There was likewise uneontradicted evidence that if the transmission line is not completed by September 1, 1954, Duquesne will be forced under various conditions to use less efficient equipment or to curtail service to its customers, at a cost or loss to it of from $150 per day to $350 per hour. Under the administrative procedure provided by Section 3107 of the zoning statute of June 24, 1931, P.

But equity does have jurisdiction to enjoin such a prosecution where it is alleged not only that the statute or ordinance is unconstitutional and void but that its enforcement would cause the plaintiff irreparable loss to his property, either by effecting, if not a total suppression of his business, at least a grave interference therewith, or by subjecting him to the imposition o? cumulative, exorbitant and oppressive penalties pending judicial determination of the validity of the legislation. . .”.
