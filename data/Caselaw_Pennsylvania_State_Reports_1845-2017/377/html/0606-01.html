For a well-considered discussion of the background of the Apportionment Act, its intended scope and effect, see opinion of Judge Klein for the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County in <em>Harvey </em>Estate, 47 D. &amp; C. 12. The federal estate tax, moreover, was not computed merely upon the clear value of the property passing by will but also upon <em>inter vivos </em>transfers of the testator whether by gift, trust or other form designed to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death. Consequently, placing the- estate tax burden upon the residuary beneficiaries frequently created a serious hardship, especially where such beneficiaries were, as was often the case, the widow, children or other paramount objects of the testator’s bounty. It was in this situation that the Tax Apportionment Act of 1937 was passed in order to eliminate, in part, the hardship to residuary legatees resulting from a disproportionate impact upon them of federal estate taxes. That such was the motivation for the Act was recognized by this court in <em>Mellon </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/347/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="347 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="1217350" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0520-01">347 Pa. 520</a>, 532-533, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20749" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="32 A.2d 749">32 A. 2d 749</a>, where Mr. Justice Stearns said, — “Consideration of the incidence of the federal <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>estate tax and of the provisions of the Act of 1987 make it clear that the purpose of the General Assembly was to relieve distributees of inequalities which might result from the imposition of that tax. The estate tax, unlike the normal State inheritance tax, is a tax upon the property of the decedent. Unless the decedent has otherwise provided by will, payment of the tax is to be primarily the burden of the executors, and the interest of the distributees is to be diminished pro tanto by the payment of the tax prior to distribution.”</p>

But, ordinarily, there is no occasion to prorate estate taxes among the beneficiaries of the residue since to do so would be but an act of mathematical superfluity; and, as observed by Mr. Chief Justice Steen in <em>Suchan v. Swope, </em><a href="/pa/357/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="357 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="472119" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0016-01">357 Pa. 16</a>, 23, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20116" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="53 A.2d 116">53 A. 2d 116</a>, ~-“[T]he law is too pragmatic in its philosophy to require the doing of a vain and useless act.” There is no difference in amount between a proportionate share of the net residue and a like share of the gross residue diminished by the same proportionate amount of the estate taxes chargeable to residue. The only instance where apportionment of estate taxes among the beneficiaries of the residue makes a practical difference is where the property received by one or more of the residuary legatees or devisees is not subject to estate taxes because such beneficiaries are charities or other exempted institutions whose shares did not contribute to the im<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>position Of the tax burden. For example, in <em>Wahr Es</em>tate, <a href="/pa/370/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="370 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1234518" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0382-01">370 Pa. 382</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="88 A.2d 417">88 A. 2d 417</a>, the beneficiaries of <em>six </em>of the <em>twelve </em>equal shares into which the residuary estate was testamentarily divided for purposes of .distribution were charities whose bequests were exempt from the federal estate tax and were not, therefore, a responsible cause for any part of the estate taxes imposed. Accordingly, we apportioned the taxes chargeable to the residue to the six . shares which were not exempt from the federal taxation. In so holding, we but followed our earlier pronouncement in <em>Harvey Estate, </em>supra, where we quoted with approval (p. 58) from Judge Bolger’s reasoning in <em>Harvey’s Estate No. 2, </em>49 D. &amp; C. 440, 443-444, as to the intent of the Apportionment Act in such regard.</p>

By Article Nine of her will, the testatrix did direct that the estate and inheritance taxes on the pecuniary legacies bequeathed to retainers and servants by Article Five of her will should be paid from the principal of her residuary estate. But, as to all other <em>specific </em>devises and bequests, the estate taxes were apportion-able. Accordingly, on petition of the executors, the Orphans’ Court, with notice to all parties in interest, prorated the federal estate taxes among the beneficiaries of the specific devises and legacies, not made tax-free by Article Nine. After this proration, there remained $9,784,092.93 of federal estate taxes to be paid out of the gross residue of $14,590,710.33 which left a net residue of $4,806,617.40 for equal distribution among the four residuary legatees, subject, of course, to the specified charge of $125,000, each, against the shares of Katherine Nichols and Harkness’ children, <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>which charges, as we have seen, the testatrix imposed “in order to produce equality among my four children” because of the Walnut Hall devises and bequests to Katherine and Harkness’ widow.</p>
    <p id="b633-4" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[175,576,1151,1432]]]'>The court en banc achieved the desired “equality” by faithfully carrying out the testatrix’s direction with respect to the charges against Katherine and the Harkness interest. This, it did by adding the aggregate of the charges ($250,000) to the net residue for distribution and then dividing the total into four equal shares and debiting the shares of Katherine and Harkness with $125,000 each. The direction could not otherwise have been equitably followed. At best, the distribution of the residue could only approach, and not produce, equality in the circumstances. By virtue of the Walnut Hall devises and bequests, Katherine and Harkness’ widow received out of Mrs. Edwards’ estate property of a net worth of considerably more than the amount of the $125,000 charges to which the testatrix subjected their shares in the residue. When all the various devises and bequests (net after proration of estate taxes) made by the testatrix to her four children are added respectively to the shares received by each in distribution of the residue (as per the final decree of the court below), it will be found that, on the basis of the valuation of the estate’s assets for federal taxation, Harkness’ widow and children and Katherine will have received a total of approximately $48,000 and $58,000 more than Martha and $74,000. and $84,000 more than Lela. ;</p>

The value of Walnut Hall, as settled for federal estate tax purposes, was $1,255,141.62, which valuation the present appellants accepted as a proper basis for the proration of taxes. Deducting therefrom the prorated taxes, the net value of Walnut Hall, its furnishings and equipment, as received by the two beneficiaries without liability for further deduction for taxes or anything else, was $415,000, plus, or a value to each of, roundly, $207,500.</p>

On the basis of the four parts so obtained (each of which includes taxes)- the appellants prorate the total • taxes ■ chargeable to the residuary estate and then separately deduct the four prorated portions of taxes from the respective four parts.,The result, according to the appellants, is the net share to which each of the beneficiaries is entitled-, in distribution -of the residue. -.

The effect of the appellants’ formula for distributing the residue, which the learned auditing judge mistakenly adopted, accentuates the already unequal distribution by increasing the distributive shares of Katherine and of Harkness’ children by an additional $11,712.99, each, with corresponding reductions in the shares of Martha and Lela for a total differential in favor of Harkness’ widow and children and Katherine over Martha of approximately $132,000 and $112,000 and over Lela of more than $157,000 and $167,000. These increases in the differentials in distribution of the residue among the four children are the direct result of the prorated estate taxes on the $125,000 charges against Katherine and Harkness’ children, which taxes Martha and Lela would be made to suffer, and the testatrix’s express desire for equality among her four children would thus be thwarted under the appellants’ proposed scheme of distribution.</p>

The balance for distribution is shoAvn to exceed $4,000,000. By her professionally drawn will, consisting of nine items and a codicil, testatrix, after making bequests and provisions not involved in this litigation, devised real estate, <em>Walnut Hall, near Lexington, Kentucky, </em>(subject to a charge of $250,000 hereinafter referred to) and bequeathed personal property to tAVO of her children, Harkness and Katherine. She devised and bequeathed her entire residuary estate equally to her four named children: Martha E. Lazear, Lela E. Cook, Harkness Edwards and Katherine E. Nichols. In devising Walnut Hall to her two. children, Harkness and Katherine., testatrix directed in Article.

The two children, Harkness and Katherine, are devised the real estate, but take it subject to a $250,000 charge. It follows that what they have inherited is real estate upon which there is said charge. Thus the value of what <em>passes </em>to them is the value of the real estate <em>less the charge. </em>The amount of the charge passes to the other two children. This is true because the $250,000 is to be paid <em>out </em>of the shares of the two devisees. Consequently, in my opinion, the two devisees should only be charged, by the tax proration, with the <em>net </em>value of what passed to them, viz.: the value of the real estate (so appraised for federal estate tax) less $250,000 and their share in the residue. The other two children should be required to pay their proportion of estate tax on whatever else they inherited, plus the $250,000 charged against their brother and sister. Thus <em>each </em>beneficiary pays his proportion of estate tax on whatever he receives. In the words of the Act, they are the persons <em>“to whom such property is .. . trans</em>ferred, . . .”</p>
