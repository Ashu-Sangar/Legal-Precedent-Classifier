The prosecution’s evidence consisted in large part of proof of the defendant’s membership and official position in the Communist Party, his attendance at Party meetings and the introduction of a mass of documentary evidence consisting of books, papers and pamphlets advocating, teaching or promulgating Communist doctrine, found in the Party headquarters and bookstore in Pittsburgh of which the defendant was a supervising principal. The defendant’s motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied by the court en banc in an opinion written by the trial judge. Nelson was thereupon sentenced to pay a fine of $10,000, the costs of prosecution (amounting in taxable items to $13,000) and to undergo imprisonment for a term of 20 years. On appeal from the judgment of sentence, the Superior Court affirmed <em>per curiam: </em>see <a href="/pa-super/172/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="172 Pa.

The appellant’s principal and cogent contention is that the Pennsylvania Sedition Act was suspended by operation of law upon the enactment by Congress of Title I of the Act of June 28, 1940, c. 439, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Stat.%20670" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="54 Stat. 670">54 Stat. 670</a>, known as the Smith Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which defines <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>sedition against the United States and prescribes punishments therefor. If the Pennsylvania Act was so superseded, then the defendant’s conviction cannot be sustained. Accordingly, we are met at the outset with this question which was pressed timely in the trial court, was urged upon the Superior Court on appeal and has been stressed before us. In our opinion, the contention is well founded. Consequently, the motion in arrest of judgment should have been granted and the indictment quashed.</p>

It not only revolves about a serious offense allegedly committed against the Government of the United States but it also calls for a consideration and understanding of the relationship between the Federal Government and the several States and the limitations upon the actions of each in respect of the other. As the question is basic to the appeal, our plain and immediate duty, therefore, is to decide it in accordance with what we take to be the applicable and controlling principles of law as declared by the Supreme Court of the United States. Article VI of the Federal Constitution provides that “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

There are, however, other matters with respect to which both the Federal Government and a State may concurrently legislate. But, even there, if the inference is reasonably deducible that it was the purpose of Congress by its enactment to pre-empt the particular field, State legislation on the same subject is automatically suspended.

      <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>As was also recognized in the <em>Bice </em>case, supra, — “It is often a perplexing question whether Congress has precluded state action or by the choice of selective regulatory measures has left the police power of the States undisturbed except as the state and federal regulations collide.” But, the congressional purpose to preempt a particular field is not made to depend upon a positively expressed legislative intent to that end. Such purpose can as readily be evidenced objectively by what the circumstances reasonably indicate as being necessary for the complete and unhampered effectuation of the federal aims and objectives. “For when the question is whether a Federal act overrides a state law, the entire scheme of the statute must of course be considered and <em>that which needs must be implied is of no less force than that which is expressed”: Savage v. </em>Jones, <a href="/us/225/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="225 U.S. 501" data-case-ids="11341803" data-case-paths="/us/225/0501-01">225 U.S. 501</a>, 533 (Emphasis supplied). So readily does the inference of federal pre-emption arise, when the National Government and a State enter the same field of legislative activity, that concurrent power to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution was expressly included therein in order that it be not inferred that the poAver of the Federal Government in such regard was exclusive even though “each State possessed that power in full measure prior to the Amendment” and the Federal Government did not. Such was the observation made by Mr. Chief Justice Taft in speaking for the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. </em>Lanza, <a href="/us/260/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="260 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="11926061" data-case-paths="/us/260/0377-01">260 U.S. 377</a>, 381, when he said, — “. . . the probable purpose of declaring a concurrent poAver to be in the States was to negative any possible inference that in vesting the National Government with the power of country-wide prohibition, state power would be excluded.”</p>

(Incidentally, the Act of June 28, 1940, supra, whose Title III thus operated to suspend the Pennsylvania Alien Eegistration Act of 1939, is the same Act whose Title I, i.e., the Smith Act, is here involved as to its effect upon the Pennsylvania Sedition Act of 1939.) The grounds upon which the Supreme Court based its conclusion of federal preemption in the <em>Hines </em>case were (1) that the state legislation relating to local registration of nationals of foreign governments might involve international relations which, from the first, have called for broad national authority and (2) that such legislation dealt “with the lights, liberties, and personal freedoms of human beings”, — a field wherein the protection of such rights against unlawful invasion by a State depends ultimately upon the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. What <em>Hines v. Davidowitz </em>decided, as later appraised by the Supreme Court itself in <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator (Corp., </em><a href="/citations/?q=831%20U.S.%20218" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="831 U.S. 218">supra,</a> was that “the [Alien Eegistration] Act of Congress . . . touch [ed] a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on (he same subject.”</p>

The answer, then, to the question of suspension of state legislation in a case such as the present depends upon whether the facts of the case fit the specifications of any of such categories.</p>
    <p id="b88-4" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[267,552,1158,1523]]]'>One of the categories of supersession is when the field, in which both the Federal Government and the State have legislated, is of paramount importance to the Federal Government. What federal interest, it may be ashed, could be more dominant than maintenance of the security of the Federal Government itself which the Smith Act was designed to vouchsafe against subversive political assaults? And what could be more hampering to the exercise of federal power in such connection than to have a State assume to prosecute what is in truth an affront to the National Government? We have already referred to the powers of the Federal Government derived through state concession, either expressly or impliedly, upon the adoption of the Constitution. But, wholly apart from that, the Federal Government has at all times possessed the <em>inherent </em>right to protect and defend itself against enemies domestic as well as foreign. The old saying that “Self preservation is the first law of nature” is as true of nations as it is of animal life. When, therefore, a State assumes to punish, as does the Pennsylvania statute here involved, sedition against the United States, it is intruding in a matter where the national interest is obviously paramount. It follows necessarily that the Federal Government’s control of the field must be exclusive if it is to protect itself effectively and completely. And that means no sharing of the jurisdiction with the States.</p>

Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of an act of sedition against a State in our federated system that is not at once an act of sedition against the Government of the United States, — the Union of the forty-eight component States. Conversely, the duty of suppressing sedition within a State rests directly upon the Federal Government by virtue of Article IY, Section 4, of the Constitution which charges the National Government with the duty of guaranteeing “to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.” This positive constitutional mandate Congress undertook to carry out in the original Smith Act (<a href="/citations/?q=54%20Stat.%20671" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="54 Stat. 671">54 Stat. 671</a>) by expressly making it a crime for anyone to advocate, etc. the overthrow or destruction by force or violence of <em>“any </em>government in the United States” (Emphasis supplied).

In the case now under review, Nelson received a sentence under the Pennsylvania statute of twenty years for his conviction of sedition against the United States. Such a disparity in the sentences prescribed for the same offense, if multiplied by further like instances from other States, could not help but confuse and hinder the attack on sedition which calls for uniform action on a national basis. Uniformity in the range of sentences imposable throughout the country for sedition against the Government of the United States is assured only by the exclusive use of the federal statute.</p>

Indeed, on the Commonwealth’s theory, if each of the other forty-seven States had a Sedition Act like Pennsylvania’s, one chargeable with sedition against the government of the United States could be indicted, convicted and punished in any or all of such States as were able to obtain service of their criminal process upon him, as well as by the Federal Government. In the present instance, after the appellant’s conviction and sentence in the State Court, he, along with others, was indicted in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania under the conspiracy section of the Federal Criminal Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> for conspiring to violate the Smith Act. All have since been tried and convicted, Nelson receiving a sentence of five years. The acts proven in the Federal Court to effectuate the alleged conspiracy consisted of practically the same matter as v/as offered against Nelson in the trial in the State Court. And, so, Nelson’s offense has been independently passed upon by a Federal Court where it properly belongs. If the state conviction were to be upheld, the result would be that both the Federal Government and the State would punish the appellant for substantially the same alleged offense <em>against the United States.</em>

In the <em>Gilbert </em>case a state statute made it unlawful “ ‘to interfere with or discourage the enlistment of men in the military or naval forces of the United States or of the State of Minnesota.’ ” The view of counsel for the State, which the Supreme Court adopted, was that “ ‘The act. . . [did] not relate to the raising of armies for the national defense, nor to rules or regulations for the government of those under arms [a constitutionally exclusive federal power]. It [was] simply a local police measure, ■ aimed to suppress a species Of <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>seditious speech which the legislature of the State ha[d] found objectionable.’ ” As the Supreme Court further observed, — “. . . the State knew the conditions which existed and could have a solicitude for the public peace, and this record justifies it. Gilbert’s [anti-conscription] remarks were made in a public meeting. They were resented by his auditors. There were protesting interruptions, also accusations and threats against him, disorder and intimations of violence. And such is not an uncommon experience. On such occasions feeling usually runs high and is impetuous; there is a prompting to violence and when violence is once yielded to, before it can be quelled, tragedies may be enacted. To preclude such result or a danger of it is a proper exercise of the power of the State.” The irrelevancy of <em>Gilbert v.

Communism by its teachings and by its acts and deeds is our mortal enemy. Marxist Communism, as interpreted, promulgated and established by Stalin, teaches, advocates, plans and plots (a) a world revolution by and for the proletariat; (b) the overthrow and capture of every Government in the world by sabotage, force and violence; and (c) the dictatorial, ruthless, atheistic rule of every Country by ukase and force for the (pretended) benefit of (a tiny percentage of) the proletariat known as Communists.</p>

Congress further knew that onr Country needed, in order to combat the widespread and occult perils of communism, the help not only of the FBI and of all Federal district attorneys and all officials in every Federal department and agency of Government, but it also needed the active assistance and cooperation of all States, and all State Courts, and all State officers and agencies, as well as the enthusiastic help of every patriotic American citizen. Congress also knew that juries are sometimes fooled or duped by false testimony or by clever lawyers and thus acquit those who are guilty of grave crimes, and it would certainly he wise to have State officers, State Courts and State juries give to our Country additional help and protection against those who are attempting to destroy our Government.</p>

For example, State Sedition acts had been sustained by the Supreme Court; State acts which regulated or taxed Interstate Commerce had been sustained; State acts pertaining to counterfeiting (although Congress alone had power to coin money and regulate the value thereof) had been sustained; and State acts restricting or regulating labor activities had been sustained under the State’s police power even though the Wagner Act, the Taft-Hartley Act and other labor legislation had seemingly preempted the field. Moreover, Congress has enacted statutes punishing the same or similar criminal acts as has the State of Pennsylvania involving firearms, narcotic drugs, explosives, blackmail, conspiracy against rights of citizens, counterfeiting of coins, embezzlement, kidnapping, homicide, prostitution, burglary, wrecking of trains, train robbery, bank robbery, sabotage, treason, lotteries, obscene books and pictures, false and fraudulent bank entries, bribery, violation of election laws, and other crimes, too numerous to mention.

In that case a statute of Minnesota made it unlawful to discourage the enlistment of men in the military or naval forces of the United States or of the State of Minnesota, and by another section unlawful for any person to teach or advocate that the citizens of Minnesota should not assist the United States in carrying on war with its public enemies. The statute was sustained as an exercise of the police power and also as a legitimate measure of cooperation by the State with the United States. It was held not to be in conflict with the federal war power nor with the Constitutional right of . free speech. It was argued that Congress had the exclusive power to declare war and to determine among other things the conditions of enlistment; and consequently, just as here, it was contended the states had no such power, especially as their acts might run counter to what Congress or the army or navy might consider the wisest and most effective means of securing support from all the citizens. The <em>minority </em>opinion in that case held, as does the <em>majority </em>opinion in this case, that the state statute was inconsistent with the law of the United States and a cause of real embarrassment and danger to the Federal Government and consequently unconstitutional. All of these arguments or contentions were rejected by the majority which in its opinion said (page 328) : “Undoubtedly, the United States can declare war and it, not the States, has the power to raise and maintain armies. But there are other considerations. The United States is ■ composed of the <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>States, the States are constituted of the citizens of the United States, who also are citizens of the States, and it is from these citizens that armies are raised and wars waged, and whether to victory and its benefits, or to defeat and its calamities, the States as well as the United States are intimately concerned. . . . <em>from the contention that it encroaches upon or usurps any power of Congress, there is an instinctive and immediate revolt. </em>Cold and technical reasoning in its minute consideration may indeed insist on a separation of the sovereignties and resistance in each to any cooperation from the other, but there is opposing demonstration in the fact that this country is one composed of many and must on occasions be animated as one and that <em>the constituted, and constituting sovereignties must have power of cooperation against the enemies of all. . . . </em>The same view of the statute was expressed in State v. Holm, 139 Minnesota, 267, where, after a full discussion, the contention was rejected that the Espionage Law of June 15, 1917, abrogated or superseded the statute, the court declaring that the fact that the citizens of the State are also citizens of the United States and owe a duty to the Nation, does not absolve them from duty to the State <em>or preclude a State from enforcing such duty. ‘The same </em>act/ it was said, <em>‘may be an offense or transgression of the laws of both3 Nation and State, and both may punish it without a conflict of their sovereignties. </em>Numerous cases were cited commencing with Moore v.

Minnesota. </em>Moreover, the Supreme Court cited with approval the <em>Holm </em>case, supra, which sustained a state statute dealing with Espionage and rejected the contention that the Espionage Law of 1917 abrogated or superseded a state statute, and specifically held that the citizens of each state owe a duty to the state as well as to the nation and that nothing precluded a state from enforcing such duty since our sovereign federal government needed the cooperation of its constituent sovereignties against the enemy of all. Moreover, as the Supreme Court there said, the same act may be an offense or transgression of the laws of both the nation and the state and both may punish it without a conflict of their sovereignties.</p>
