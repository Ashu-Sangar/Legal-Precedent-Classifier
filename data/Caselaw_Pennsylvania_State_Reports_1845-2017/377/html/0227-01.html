Mr.: Lifter , directed that- the remainder- of <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>his residuary estate, <em>which arose and, became payable and distributable upon the death of his wife, </em>shall be paid to the Federation for the purpose of erecting and provided they shall erect, a building for such humanitarian purposes as in the judgment of the Federation is most urgently needed <em>at the time of such distribution. </em>Were that all of the testamentary provision its meaning would be clear. However, there was inserted after the word “erect” the following parenthetical clause which is the cause of the present controversy: “(beginning such erection within a period of not more than five years <em>from the date of my death)”. </em>The appellants, who are the ultimate contingent beneficiaries, contend that this parenthetical clause was a condition precedent and that it necessitated and required, as, in its isolated context, it clearly and expressly stated, the Federation to begin the erection of such building within five years of the testator’s death. Cf. <em>Thompson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/304/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="304 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1132416" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0349-01">304 Pa. 349</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.%20925" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="155 A. 925">155 A. 925</a>; <em>Wanamaker’s Estate, </em><a href="/citations/?q=312%20Pa.%20862" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="312 Pa. 862">312 Pa. 862</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20592" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="167 A. 592">167 A. 592</a>. It would be unlikely that the testator intended, and as it turned out, it would be impossible for the Federation to begin the erection of the building within five years of his death in the light of the other provisions of the Eighth Paragraph, because (a) the gift to the Federation takes place only upon the death of testator’s wife and she is still living and (b) no one can possibly know until after, his wife’s death the kind of. a building- which .will be- most .urgently needed, <em>at the time of distribution of his residuary estate </em>(after his wife’s death)'; and because (c) “the building .so .to be erected shall be free of all mortgages and ground rents and <em>shall be paid for fully with </em>the amount bequeathed to' the Federation by me.”, which as above noted was not payable until after his wife’s death.</p>

      <em>by the parenthetical clause </em>that the gift to the Federation should take effect only if testator’s wife died within five years after his death, and only if the Federation commenced to erect the building within that five year period.

The Federation, as we have seen, did not commence erecting the building within the period of five years from testator’s death, and obviously they could not pay for such a building in full with the testamentary bequest until they received it after his wife’s death; but they did accept formally and in writing the bequest and agreed to the conditions thereof within 60 days from testator’s death.</p>
