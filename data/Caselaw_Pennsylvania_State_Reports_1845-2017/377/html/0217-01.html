Section 200 provides for two-story houses as follows: “AA” — 1800 feet minimum habitable floor area, “A” — 1400, “B” — 1125 feet, “C” — 1000 feet, “D” — 1000 feet.</p>

The premises which comprise approximately <em>V/2 </em>acres are situated in a residential district zoned “AA”. Mr. and Mrs. Medinger petitioned for a building permit to erect a residence which contained only 1325 square feet of habitable floor area. They wished and planned to erect an early 1700 Colonial Bucks County farmhouse. For over 20 years they had been collecting materials to build such a home, including original roof tiles, imported Swedish glass, hand forged iron, special lumber and hardware and other authentic material.</p>

The owners appealed to the Board of Adjustment which dismissed the petition. The petitioners, pursuant to the zoning law, then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas which reversed the Board of Adjustment, held the Ordinance unconstitutional, and directed the building inspector to issue a building permit for the house hereinabove described. This was a proper procedure to test the validity, applicability and constitutionality of the Ordinance as it applied to the ground and proposed building of these petitioners. The remedy or method of procedure prescribed by the zoning law must be pursued, but its pursuit does not admit the constitutionality of the Act or of the Ordinance, or prevent the petitioner from raising, or the Court from determining the constitutionality of the Act or Ordinance: <em>Taylor v.
