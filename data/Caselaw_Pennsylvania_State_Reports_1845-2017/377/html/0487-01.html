Less than four years later they shook off the bonds. In the meantime, two children had been born to the union, and, in anticipation of the contemplated divorce, the parents entered into an oral agreement which was later incorporated by the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois, where the parties were living at thé time, into the divorce decree handed down on April 21, 1944.</p>

Specifically Lucinda charged that Robert had violated the integrity of the $8500 insurance by borrowing $1,000 on the policies and by displacing the two children-beneficiaries (to the amount of $6500) by substituting in their place his second wife; that he neglected to make the monthly $30 payments agreed upon for the support of the children; that he did not meet the medical and dental bills incurred for the children; and that he had not delivered war bonds as promised, 34 now being due.</p>

He then argues that she cannot sue on ■the Illinois decree either, because the parties are now ■living in Pennsylvania. This double-barreled defense ignores two things; one, that Pennsylvania and Illinois •are both in the United States, and, therefore, both "subject to the same Constitution which guarantees interstate full faith and credit; and, two, that a valid ■contract is enforcible anywhere that the flag of the law 'floats over a courthouse. “A contract valid under its governing law will be enforced everywhere unless contrary to the positive law or public policy of the forum, unless it would work injury to the state of its citizens.” '(15 C.J.S., Conflict of Laws, section 4g (3) p. 858) ■'“When a contract is valid in the state in which it is made and performable, it will be enforced in our courts •if it is not contrary to the public policy of this State.” '(McCurdy’s Estate, <a href="/pa/303/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="303 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="1130088" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0453-01">303 Pa. 453</a>.)</p>

    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[172,558,1150,367]]]'>Thus, with regard to support payments already accrued, the Illinois decree is a final foreign judgment entitled to full faith and credit under the United ■States Constitution.

    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[172,946,1150,709]]]'>■ It must be interjected here that when the defendant failed to make the payments ordered by the Illinois court, the plaintiff, in proceedings for support, entered the Court of Quarter Sessions of Delaware County and obtained an order for the support of each of the children in the amount of $15.00 weekly from the date of the order. The defendant on his part initiated habeas corpus proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County for a determination as to custody of the children, he having complained that his wife did not live up to the agreement they had entered into in Illinois regarding custody and visitation rights.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.7",511,[173,1668,1149,489]]]'>The defendant, of course, will be entitled to credit for the amount he now pays and will be required to pay under the Delaware County order. The outcome of the habeas corpus proceedings may also affect the support order. Thus, the part of the Illinois decree which calls for future payments for support of the children cannot and will not be enforced here while the Delaware County order stands. The Chancellor properly so héld.</p>

The obligations imposed on the defendant by the Illinois <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>decree in these two connections have to do with performance not restricted to the payment of money. Here the plaintiff is confronted with the rule of longstanding that: “A valid foreign judgment that the defendant do or refrain from doing an act other than ■the payment of money will not be enforced by an action on the judgment.” (Restatement, Conflict of Laws, Section 449 (1). Although the plaintiff may not obtain relief on the decree itself, she may, however, proceed on the agreement which preceded the decree. The promise made by her husband was self-executing in that it was based on a valid consideration and therefore can be enforced in a foreign jurisdiction without an intermediate court’s decree. A question similar to this one arose in the case of <em>Adams v. Knapp, </em><a href="/pa/213/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="213 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="943464" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0567-01">213 Pa. 567</a>, 569-570, where the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County refused relief to a plaintiff in Pennsylvania for the alleged violation of a Federal court decree based on a contract entered into in the State of Ohio. On appeal to this Court we said: “The specific relief asked for in the bill could not be given, for the reason that the court is without power to enforce any but its own decrees; nor can it adjudge the decree of any other court binding, or punish for the violation of any except its own; but under the general prayer for relief, the court could have enjoined the defendant against violating his agreement with the plaintiff-, not to engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture of pipe balls, or other specialties which he had agreed not to manufacture; ,and this much relief we think the plaintiff -was • entitled to under the' evidence submitted.”' '-</p>

    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[168,739,1150,596]]]'>Although the lower court reached the correct conclusion in disposing of all 'questions in the case, it somewhat diverted from the orbit of its reasoning when it accepted defendant’s contention that under Illinois law there was for all purposes a merger of the agreement into the decree into which it was incorporated. The cases cited by the lower court held <em>only </em>that the agreement is merged into the decree to one extent, namely, to the extent that the court has the power to modify the decree insofar as it refers to alimony; not as to property settlement.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[168,1349,1149,599]]]'>It is also to be noted that while a foreign decree of the character under discussion is not enforcible per se in the court of the forum, the factual findings upon which the decree is based will be regarded as res judicata. Section 449 of the Restatement, Conflict of Laws epitomizes and emphasizes this rule: ’“In an action on the original claim, the effect of res judicata will be given to findings of fact in a prior suit between the parties in which a valid judgment was rendered requiring the defendant to do or refrain from doing an act other than the payment of money.”</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[170,1960,1148,368]],["BL_514.1",514,[260,351,1157,821]]]'>With this determination that the plaintiff may properly bring an action on the original agreement, the only question remaining is whether she can obtain specific performance of the contract. This question must be answered in the affirmative because it is obvious that no law judgment could compel the defendant to reinstate the children as irrevocable bene<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>■fieiaries of tlie $8500 insurance policies and restore the policies to their original unencumbered state. Nor could a law judgment compel the defendant to purchase and deliver United States war bonds. Thus, since the remedy at law is clearly inadequate, equity may compel specific performance of the agreement. Moreover, where equity has jurisdiction to decree •specific performance, it may also render money decrees unavoidably attached to the specific performance. “A court of chancery, having jurisdiction for one purpose, will retain it for all purposes and do complete justice as between the parties even though it adjudicates questions which in the first instance would not have warranted the court in assuming jurisdiction.” <em>(Mower v. Mower, </em><a href="/pa/367/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="367 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1228417" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0325-01">367 Pa. 325</a>.)</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[260,1184,1156,653]]]'>The defendant complains finally that his financial condition does not permit him to discharge the financial commitments he made to his wife in Illinois. The Vife gave up a very valuable right when she agreed not to press him for alimony, and this relinquishment on her part was made part of the official decree in Illinois. As she could not now renounce her surrendering of this valuable right on the basis that her financial prospects have changed, so also the husband cannot avoid his ex contractu specific obligations to maintain his children, merely by pleading financial difficulties.
