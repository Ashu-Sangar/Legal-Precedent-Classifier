Lees, and Wilson called upon the Casualty Company to defend it. The Company refused so to do, whereupon Wilson settled the case and then brought action against the Company to recover the amount of the settlement which he had made, $750. Preliminary objections to his complaint were overruled by the court and the Company was directed to file an answer; upon its failure to do so judgment was entered in favor of Wilson. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment and we allowed this appeal.</p>

Lees”; that Lees instituted an action in trespass against the plaintiff to recover damages allegedly sustained by Lees due to the aforesaid injuries. Had the complaint stopped there it might well be that the Company would have been obliged to defend the action because of the averment that accidental injuries were alleged to have been sustained by Lees. But the complaint had attached to it a “true and correct copy” of Lees’ complaint in the action brought by him against Wilson in which it appeared that Lees did <em>not </em>sue for accidental injuries but, on the contrary, his complaint declared that “On January <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>28, 1951, while the said plaintiff was lawfully in defendant’s taproom . . . the defendant [Wilson] then and there unlawfully set upon and with great force and violence assaulted the plaintiff [Lees] with a certain blackjack and struck the said plaintiff on the head with said blackjack. As a result of said assault and battery, the plaintiff suffered injuries to his head . . . Said conduct of defendant was unlawful, wanton and malicious.” Indeed, to emphasize the fact that Lees’ claim was not based on any theory of accident or negligence but on the commission of a wilful tort,— indeed of a crime — the complaint added that he, Lees, was “entitled to exemplary and punitive as well as compensatory damages from defendant.” Since, therefore, insurance against liability on such a claim was expressly excluded from the coverage of the policy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the Company, by reason of the provision that it was obliged to defend only those suits as to which the policy insured against liability, properly disclaimed obligation to defend the Lees suit.</p>

Judge Keller pointed out that the plaintiffs in that action “based their right of recovery, on the defective condition of the elevator, and did not aver, or -specifically rely on, any illegal employment of the minor plaintiff.” Accordingly it was held that the insurance company was not justified in refusing to defend the suit since, it being shown, without any change thereby in the cause of action stated in the complaint, that the employe was in fact 18 years old, the action was brought within the scope of the policy. <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>In the present case the canse of action against the insured, being for wilful assault and battery committed by him, could <em>not </em>be changed by amendment into a totally different cause of action based on negligence so as to bring it within the terms of the policy.</p>

Upon receipt of certain premiums the Maryland Casualty Company agreed to hold Wilson harmless in all legal actions arising out of accident even if such suits should be “groundless, false or fraudulent.”</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.7",618,[264,942,1156,596]]]'>Human nature being what it is and alcohol being what it is, both parties realized that possible altercations in Wilson’s place of business could take on the aspect of ardent belligerencies which could result in assaults and batteries. In full realization of these possibilities, the insurance company agreed to indemnify Wilson even where assault and battery was involved. The pertinent reference in the policy read: “Assault and battery shall be deemed an accident. . .” This interpretation was modified by the proviso “. . . unless committed by or at the. direction of the insured.”</p>
    <p id="b618-6" data-blocks='[["BL_618.8",618,[263,1551,1156,763]],["BL_619.1",619,[172,327,1148,200]]]'>On January 28, 1951, a John A. Lees, while a patron in Wilson’s taproom, sustained certain injuries which he claimed were caused by Wilson’s hitting him with a blackjack. Wilson denied that he had struck Lees and asserted that Lees’ injuries were the result of an accident. When Lees then entered a suit against Wilson, Wilson called on the Maryland Casualty Company to defend him, but the company refused to undertake the defense. Deliberating on the alternatives of going to court, with all the concomitant notoriety accompanying such a trial regardless of outcome (and its consequent bad effect on his business) and paying Lees money even though he was not, from Wilson’s point of view, entitled to any money, Wilson <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>settled Lees’ claim for $750. Wilson then asked the insurance company to reimburse him for the amount he had to pay Lees, but this request also fell on deaf ears.</p>
    <p id="b619-3" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[172,551,1148,430]]]'>Wilson now brought suit against the insurance company, declaring under oath that he had not committed an assault and battery on Lees and that Lees’ injuries were the result of an accident. The insurance company resisted recovery on the ground that Lees had told the truth and Wilson had told an untruth. And the Majority of this Court has affirmed the insurance company’s position.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[172,994,1148,644]]]'>This leads me to inquire: Since when, in our system of jurisprudence, has a litigant been allowed to act as judge and jury? The Maryland Casualty Company is a defendant in a suit brought against it by John Wilson. It replies with the dogmatic conclusion that Wilson struck Lees. How does the insurance company know that Wilson struck Lees? It was not present, through any officer or agent, in the taproom when the incident of January 28, 1951, occurred. On what possible basis can it assert that Wilson was at fault on January 28, 1951, and Lees was without fault?</p>

Let me repeat that clause: “Assault and battery shall be deemed an accident unless committed by or at the direction of the insured.” <em>Unless committed by or at the direction of the insured </em>is as categorical a statement as can be made. <em>Committedby </em>means <em>actually </em>committed by, not assertedly committed by, <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>not hearsayedly committed by. Where is the adjudication in a criminal court, civil law court, equity, arbitration proceedings, or in any other tribunal which proclaims that Wilson committed an assault and battery? The only verdict that Wilson committed an assault and battery comes from one of the officials of a party litigant. And since when does the desk of a litigant substitute for the jury box or the judge’s bench?</p>
    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[252,781,1158,655]]]'>In the present state of these proceedings Wilson is not pressing this Court to decide he is entitled to $750. He is only asking that he be given an opportunity to prove before a jury that Lees’ injuries were the result of an accident and that therefore, under the contract for which he paid premiums, he is entitled to reimbursement for what he was unjustly required to pay Lees. Is this asking too much? Despite all the cases cited in the Majority Opinion, I fail to find one principle of law quoted which declares that where a strict question of fact is involved a litigant may not have that question decided by a jury.</p>
    <p id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[254,1447,1155,873]],["BL_621.1",621,[164,340,1147,479]]]'>The Majority Opinion quotes from Wilson’s Complaint in which he says that “an altercation took place among the patrons of Plaintiff’s restaurant and bar with the result that certain accidental injuries Avere alleged to have been sustained by John A. Lees . . . ,” and that Lees instituted an action in trespass against Wilson to recover damages on account of the injuries Lees sustained. The Majority Opinion then makes the following startling observation: “Had the complaint stopped there it might Avell be that the Company would have been obliged to defend the action because of the averment that accidental injuries Avere alleged to have been sustained by Lees.” The Majority Opinion, however, then adds that since Wilson did not stop there and attached a copy of Lees’ Complaint in Avhich Lees charged assault and battery committed by Wil<a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>son, Wilson thus took himself out of Court. In other words, if Wilson had been less than honest and had said nothing about Lees’ Complaint then the Insurance Company would have been required to defend him. However, since Wilson told the whole truth the insurance company was then entitled to deny all responsibility and, upon this mere naked <em>denial, </em>refuse to pay the sums of money it had contracted to pay under its contract!</p>
    <p id="b621-4" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[161,841,1152,587]]]'>The Majority says that Wilson “presents the curious argument that merely because he asserted that Lees’ charge that he had committed assault and battery upon him was groundless, therefore the Company was obliged to defend the action.” I would say, in this respect, that this observation on the part of the Majority is more curious than the curiosity it attached to Wilson’s position. If, in fact, Lees told an untruth, how else would Wilson assert that untruth except to say that the charge of assault and battery was groundless?</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.6",621,[163,1450,1151,875]],["BL_622.1",622,[264,323,1155,698]]]'>The Majority then goes on to say that if Wilson’s “contention were correct the Company would be obliged to defend any and every action brought against its insured, no matter what its nature, if informed by the insured that the claim was false or if it was in fact false, even though liability in respect to it was not insured by the terms of the policy.” This observation on the part of the Majority is even more curious than its preceding one. And the answer to it is: of course, the company is required to defend in every action brought against its insured which comes within the provisions of the contract. The great fallacy in the whole Majority Opinion is that it fails to distinguish between what <em>is </em>actually outside the contract and what the insurance company <em>says </em>is outside the contract. Certainly the insurance company is only re<a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>quired, as the Majority properly says, to defend such claims as are. covered by the policy. But who is to determine whether claims are or are not <em>covered by the </em>policy? The insurance company? Is the insurance company to be the sole arbiter of its own obligations? The contract specifically says, as heretofore quoted, that “assault and battery shall be deemed an accident unless committed by or at the direction of the insured.” This proviso does not say, as the Majority apparently seems to think it says, “Assault and battery shall be deemed an accident unless, <em>in the company’s opinion, </em>committed by or at the direction of the insured.”</p>

In that case there was actually a trial and the plaintiffs were given an opportunity to show that their claim <em>did </em>come within the provisions of the contract entered into between the insurance company and the insured (the defendant in the original trespass suit). But in the case at bar there was no trial. Wilson was not given an opportunity to supply <em>proof </em>that his case comes within the provisions of the contract he has with the Maryland Casualty Co. If he were allowed what the plaintiffs were allowed in the <em>Fullmer </em>case, he would have no right to complain, and I would not be writing this dissent..</p>

It quotes from the Opinion written by Justice Patterson that it is “the nature of the <em>claim </em>which determines whether the insurer is required to defend.” But in that case there had also been a <em>trial, </em>and in the trial it was demonstrated that the plaintiff’s <em>proofs </em>did come within the provisions of the liability policy.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[165,881,1149,485]]]'>The Majority in its Opinion uses the word “claim” synonymously with Complaint, but as revealed in the <em>Springfi,eld Township </em>case and the <em>Fullmer </em>case the word <em>claim </em>is employed in its over-all generic sense to cover everything that the plaintiff advances as proof at the trial. Again I repeat that Wilson has not been given a chance to show what his <em>claim </em>is. His claim is not what is contained in Lees’ Complaint. His claim consists of what he contends he can prove at the trial.</p>

Superior Ct. 459</a>, quoted by the Majority, is one authority in our own jurisdiction for the plaintiff’s position. There the plaintiff stock yard company was sued by two persons who had been injured by steers that had escaped from a motor vehicle which had transported the steers. The stock yard company called on the Maryland Casualty Company (evidently <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>the same company involved in the case at bar) to defend the suits brought against it. The insurance company refused. The stock yard company then defended on its own and won the suits. It then brought an action against the Insurance Company to recover the expenses incurred in defending the lawsuits. The insurance company replied that it was not liable because the injuries caused by the steers were not covered by the policy which excluded automobile operations, the clause in question reading: “ ‘This agreement does not cover any accident directly or indirectly caused by any automobile, vehicle or by any draught or driving animal or vehicle owned or used by the assured, or by any employee of the assured in charge of such or any such vehicle or animal, unless such accident occurs upon premises owned by or under the control of the assured, or on the public ways immediately adjacent thereto, etc.’ ” Under the theory advanced by the Majority here, this exclusionary clause would have ended the case for the stock yard company since the insurance company stated that the accident occurred in a manner not covered by the policy. But the Superior Court held otherwise. In affirming the verdict obtained by the stock yard company in the court below, the Superior Court said: “It is very evident that the escape of a steer in the process of unloading is not an ‘automobile accident’ in common parlance, and we are not called upon to give the term a broad meaning in order to allow the company to escape liability.”</p>

If the Majority had made this distinction it would not have fallen into the grievous error it has committed by the decision in this case. The Complaint or claim of John Wilson <em>does </em>come within the provisions of the insurance policy.</p>

A contract to insure against such liability would obviously be void as being in violation of public policy.” This again assumes that Wilson <em>did </em>commit an assault and battery just because Lees asserts he did. Wilson denies he committed assault and battery and this Court has refused him an opportunity to prove that denial.</p>
