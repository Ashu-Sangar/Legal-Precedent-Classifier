Marshall, a former bank president, died October 7,1901, leaving a last Will dated July 23, 1896. He was 70 years old when he made his Will. The Will contained the following provision: “It is my will that no distribution be made of my estate . . . both real and personal for and during the full term of her natural life; on the decease of my said.wife, I give devise and bequeath to such of my children as are unmarried at the time of. her decease; all my. real estate situate in the County of Chester, consisting at present of my <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>Messuage and Tract of land in the township of West Goshen, containing about One hundred and forty three acres; My office Building No. 123 North High street West Chester; and my undivided one half interest in sixteen Frame Tenement houses on Poplar and Worthington streets West Chester. Also all my stock in the National Bank of Chester County, to Hold and possess the same so long as they or the survivors or survivor of them shall remain unmarried: On the decease or marriage of the last survivor of them, it is my will that the said real estate and Bank stock be enjoyed by such of my married children as may then be living during their lives or the life of the survivor of them; And on the decease of the last survivor of my children, I direct that the whole of said real estate and Bank stock be sold, and the net proceeds divided among the descendents (sic) of my married children, <em>per </em>stirpes:”</p>

There the testator provided for a gift over in the following words: “ £. . . to pay over the said trust fund of Pour Hundred Thousand Dollars (§400,000) to and amongst the children or descendants, then living, of her sisters, the said fund to be divided amongst such children or descendants per stirpe, upon the principle of representation.’ ” The Court held that per stirpe applied to both children and descendants, and that the then living children of her sisters took per stirpes and not per capita. The Court said (page 341) : “The expression ‘per stirpes’ may be used in two different senses; it may refer, first, to a ‘taking by right of representation,’ and second, to a taking ‘collectively by families and not equally as individuals’: Hogg’s Est., <a href="/pa/329/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="329 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1181494" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0163-01">329 Pa. 163</a>, 167. It is clear that the testator used it in the second sense in the gift to the children of the deceased daughter’s sisters, for otherwise there is no provision for the manner of distribution among them. . . .”</p>
