His beneficiaries were three first cousins: Mary Spratt Aber, a daughter of a sister of testator’s mother, and Ralph Canon and Alice Canon, children of a sister of testator’s father. The will provided for funeral arrangements and for the erection of a headstone. By the second item of the will testator bequeathed his entire estate to the three first cousins as follows: “I give, devise and bequeath TWO-THIRDS (2/3) of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, to my cousin, MRS. L. E. ABER of No. 19 Mackin Avenue, Ingram, Pennsylvania, her heirs and assigns forever, and the remaining ONE-THIRD (1/3) of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, I give, devise and bequeath, in equal shares, to my cousins, RALPH and ALICE CANON, of jancey Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, their heirs and assigns forever.”</p>

Mary Spratt Aber contended that, being the beneficiary of two-thirds of testator’s residuary estate, she was entitled to four-fifths of the one-sixth lapsed legacy. The auditing judge ruled, contrary to both contentions, that no residuary estate existed. He decreed that Alice Canon’s lapsed one-sixth share passed under the intestate law. Both legatees filed exceptions. Upon argument the court in banc sustained the exceptions of Ralph Canon. It was decreed that the portion of Item II reading: “. . . and the remaining ONE-THIRD (1/3) . . . I give, devise and bequeath, in equal shares, to [named cousins] . . .” constituted the residuary clause and that . .[t]he entire one-third of the above estate should, therefore, be distributed to Ralph Canon.”</p>

      <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>The second item of the will being clearly residuary, the question is posed whether or not testator, in disposing of two-thirds of the residue, intended the remaining one-third as his <em>ultimate </em>residuary disposition. In other words, did he intend such latter provision as a “residue of a residue”. The learned court below so regarded it. With this construction we do not agree. A testator1, in disposing of his residuary estate, may carve therefrom portions of the residue and devise and bequeath such portions to designated persons or uses, and then pass <em>that which remains </em>to others. This is a typical situation of a “residue of a residue”. The facts in <em>Carson’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa-super/130/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="130 Pa. Super. 133" data-case-ids="1006104" data-case-paths="/pa-super/130/0133-01">130 Pa. Superior Ct. 133</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.%20527" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="196 A. 527">196 A. 527</a>, illustrate such a situation. But, in the present case testator was manifestly disposing of his <em>entire </em>residuary estate. For reasons now resting with testator he favored one cousin over his two other cousins which was his privilege. In disposing of his <em>entire </em>residue there is no reason why he could not do so in the designated fractional shares. In <em>Carson’s Es</em>tate, supra, had the specific gift exhausted the residuary estate, nothing would remain for distributees of the “residue of the residue”. In the instant case the named fractions necessarily relate to the <em>entire </em>residue.</p>

In the various wills acts culminating in the Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, Section 14 (9), 20 PS 180.14 (9), it is provided that lapsed or void <em>devises </em>and <em>bequests </em>shall be included in the residue. Under Section 14 (10) of the Wills Act of 1947, supra, disposition of lapsed or void devises or bequests is made. This Section of the Act reads: “. . . When a devise or bequest . . . shall be included in a residuary clause of the will . . ., it shall pass to the other residuary devisees or legatees, if any there be, <em>in proportion to their respective shares or interests in the residue.” </em>(Italics supplied)</p>
