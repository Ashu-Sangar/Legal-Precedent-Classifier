A substantially similar petition was also filed August 15, 1952 by the Borough of Norristown.

At the conclusion of the last hearing, the proceedings were closed and briefs were filed by the respective parties. Thereafter on April 8, 1953 an order was issued by the Water and Power Resources Board dismissing the petitions on the ground that petitioners had failed to show any new matter or that new or changed conditions had arisen since the original hearings.

In <em>Myers et al. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em><a href="/us/303/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="303 U.S. 41" data-case-ids="6137092" data-case-paths="/us/303/0041-01">303 U. S. 41</a>, the company sought by bill in equity in the Federal District Court to enjoin the National Labor Relations Board from proceeding with hearing upon alleged unfair labor practices on the ground that its activities did not concern interstate commerce. After noting that this issue was to be decided initially by the Board and that adequate procedures for review by the Circuit Court were provided, Mr. Justice Brandéis, in writing the unanimous opinion of the Court, said: “. . . So to hold would, as the Government insists, in effect substitute the District Court for the Board as the tribunal to hear and determine what Congress declared the Board exclusively should hear and determine in the first instance. The contention is at war with the long settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been ex<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>hausted. That rule has been repeatedly acted on in cases where, as here, the contention is made that the administrative body lacked power over the subject matter.”. In Pennsylvania this principle has been embodied in the Act of March 21, 1806, P. L. 558. We have repeatedly held that equity is not available where a remedy is provided by statute. A recent pronouncement of the rule appears in <em>Oteri Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/372/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="372 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1237996" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0557-01">372 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20772" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="94 A.2d 772">94 A. 2d 772</a>, where the complainant in a bill in equity failed to follow the statutory procedure for appeal from the decision of a zoning board. We said at p. 561: “. . . Mrs. Bartone, complainant therein, could not resort to a bOl in equity in circumvention of the remedy afforded by the statute. We repeat what we said in Derry Township School District v.

When a statute provides a remedy by which a right may be enforced, no other remedy than that afforded by the statute can be used. The Act of March 21, 1806, P.

Since that act has become part of our law, we have held, that our courts have no jurisdiction by bill in equity or otherwise to consider and judge such cases until they come to them on an appeal, by way of the procedure provided by that law. This is so <em>even though the constitutional question of confiscation is involved, </em>whether it be valuation, grade crossing, re-routing of cars, removal of poles and wires, operating in a given territory, or any question arising under that act; all have been referred to the particular remedy following the Act of 1806: [citing many cases] . . .”.

Neither appellants nor any of the plaintiffs in the instant equity action complained nor could they have complained that pursuit of the statutory remedy afforded would cause them irreparable harm. As to the adequacy of the statutory remedy, appellants’ principal contentions are: (1) that a fundamental issue raised by the complaint in equity did not fall within the scope of the Acts of 1939 and 1913, supra, and (2) irrespective of the existence of a statutory remedy, relief in equity has been expressly preserved by Section 42 of the Administrative Agency Law of 1945. The first contention is thus stated in their brief: “Whether the Defendant May Invade a Watershed 'Where It Has No Franchise and Divert That Water to Its Franchised Territory Is a Question Which Was Not and Could Not Be Considered by the Water and Power Resources Board, and' Is Peculiarly Within': Equity Jurisdiction”.

The title of the Act recites, inter alia, that it is “AN ACT Relating to the acquisition of rights to divert water from rivers, streams, natural lakes, and ponds, or other surface waters within the Commonwealth or partly within and partly without the Commonwealth; . . . vesting in the Water and Power Resources Board certain powers and authorities for the conservation, control and equitable use of the waters within the Commonwealth in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth; . . .”.

This public interest is omnipresent wherever there is a State, and grows more pressing as population grows. It is fundamental, and. we are of opinion that the private property of ripar<a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>ian proprietors cannot be supposed to have deeper roots.”.</p>

If so viewed, the obstacle is a most substantial one, consisting of a determination by the Board not only that the appropriation of water and acquisition of water rights by the utility is necessary for its service to the public, but that such appropriation and acquisition may be made consistently with the conservation, control and equitable distribution of the waters of the Commonwealth in the public interest. To perform its duties in this regard obviously the Board was required to consider in the present case not only the particular stream involved, the Perkiomen Creek, but the availability of other sources of supply in order that the conservation, development and equitable' distribution of water in the-public interest should be effected. Nothing in the Act of 1939 expressly or impliedly prevents the Board from permitting the diversion of water from one watershed to another nor confines a water company to appropriation of waters within its franchized territory.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Clearly such limitations would largely negate the intent and provisions of the Act.</p>

It is asserted that these matters limit consideration by the Board to the interest of the Commonwealth “as a whole”. Clearly the Act is not limited to the interest of the Commonwealth as an entity in the sense that it is a consumer of water in State buildings or properties, but as the title of the Act discloses, its purpose is “. . . the conservation, control and equitable use of the waters within the Commonwealth in the interests <em>of the people </em>of the Commonwealth; . . .”.

Admittedly, equity had jurisdiction to inquire into the problems of water supply prior to the Act of 1939. There was no other tribunal authorized to pass upon these problems. However, with the passage of this act the duty of determining these questions was delegated to the Water and Power Resources Board with the right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. Therefore, by virtue of the Act of 1806, equity was ousted of jurisdiction. If the remedy and procedure provided by tlie Act of 1939 meed not be followed, then it is apparent that in this respect, it is practically a dead letter. . . This section clearly adds nothing to plaintiffs’ case so far as the Act of 1939 is concerned, since by 1945, the date of the Administrative Agency Law, no right to equitable relief was ‘heretofore existing’ upon any issue for which the Act of 1939 provided a statutory procedure and remedy. Beyond this, moreover, plaintiffs’ interpretation is clearly wrong. Section 42 merely retains the right to equitable relief insofar as challenging the validity of the statute under which the agency in question is purporting to act. The first paragraph of the section contains two sentences, the first dealing with the rules of procedure applicable on appeals and the second provides that a party may challenge on appeal the validity of the very <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>statute under wbieb he proceeded before the agency and to the appellate court. The reason for the inclusion of this section was to clarify the confusion which had resulted from different interpretations of the Act of 1806, in Taylor v. Haverford Township, <a href="/pa/299/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="299 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1122305" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0402-01">299 Pa. 402</a> (1930), and Taylor v. Moore, supra [<a href="/pa/303/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="303 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="1130077" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0469-01">303 Pa. 469</a>]. In the former case the Supreme Court had held that if you proceeded to appeal under a particular statute you were precluded from attacking its validity in that proceeding. In the latter case the court indicated that this was not the law. Now it is possible to attack the validity of a statute both in equity and by the appeal procedure provided for by a specific statute. If the statute intended a broader meaning for the phrase ‘equitable relief heretofore existing’, there would have been no necessity for using the phrase ‘The remedy at law provided by <em>this section\ </em>It would have been sufficient to state that <em>this </em>Act shall not in any manner impair pre-existing rights to equitable relief. Principles of statutory construction forbid the interpretation suggested by the plaintiffs, as it would tend to repeal the Act of 1806 to a far greater extent than the language requires. Statutes should be construed in harmony with the existing law; repeal by implication is carefully avoided by the courts. Therefore, since the plaintiffs are not challenging the validity of the Acts of 1913 or 1939, section 42 of the Administrative Agency Law does not justify this suit in equity.”.</p>

The impounding of water for public use is a necessity. We know of no case where a water supply reservoir has been found to be a public nuisance per se. Here the Water and Power Resources Board, an arm of the Legislature, authorized the project and the exercise of the right of eminent domain for its accomplishment. Where the Legislature has authorized an act, such act cannot constitute a public nuisance although it would otherwise be such, so long as the terms of the authorization are not abused or exceeded. <em>The Danville, Hazleton and Wilkesbarre Railroad Co. v.

L. 1987, as amended, 35 PS §691 et seq., afforded an administrative procedure for the prevention of such pollution. However, Section 701 of the Act expressly preserved existing rights and remedies. There is no such preservation of remedies in the Acts of 1939 and 1913 with which we are here concerned. We regard the decision in the <em>Shumaker </em>case as grounded on the express preservation of equitable jurisdiction. This is manifested by the emphasis, through the use of italics, placed upon Section 701 of the Pure Streams Act, which, as set forth at page 50 of the opinion, reads as follows: “. . . <em>It is hereby declared to be the purpose of this act to provide additional and cumulative remedies to abate the pollution of the waters of this Commonwealth, and nothing in this act contained shall in any way abridge or alter rights of action or remedies now or hereafter existing in equity, or under the common law or statutory law, &lt;y&gt;'iminal or civil, nor shall any provision in this act, or the granting of any permit under this act, or any act done by virtue of this act, be construed as estopping the Commonwealth, persons or municipalities, in the exercise of their rights under the common law or decisional law or in equity, from proceeding in courts of law or equity to suppress nuisances, or to abate any pollution now or hereafter existing, or enforce common law or statutory rights.”.</em>

Exit even without this provision because of the grave menace to the public <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>interest arising from corruption of waters affecting as it does the health, welfare and comfort of the public, including industries which cannot exist without a plentiful supply of clean water, we have always refused to accept statutes outlawing pollution as restricting the common law right to abate stream pollution.”. But at the end of the discussion of the view thus expressed, the opinion states: . . <em>However this may be </em>[emphasis supplied] the legislature in no uncertain terms made it plain by sec. 701 that the Act of 1937 was not intended to be an exclusive remedy but only an <em>additional </em>remedy to meet what is now recognized as a grave menace to our modern civilization.”. We think it plain that the decision is based upon the express preservation of equitable jurisdiction contained in the Pure Streams Act. Moreover, there is a very great difference between the intervention of a court of equity under the circumstances presented in the <em>Shumaker </em>case to prevent <em>harm to the public </em>caused by the pollution of a stream of water, and an intervention which would obstruct or prevent the conservation, control and equitable distribution of the waters of the Commonwealth for the <em>benefit of the public </em>— a function properly vested in a legislative agency with State-wide jurisdiction. In the former instance, the court is acting in consonance with the statutorily declared policy and purpose of the Legislature; in the latter instance, contrary to it. To hold that a court may interfere with or override an adjudication by the Water and Power Resources Board concerned with the allocation of waters in the public interest, except upon review on appeal, would destroy the legislative creation of unified supervision and control of the supply of a necessity of life. Such regulation is for the sovereign in the first instance, not for the judiciary.</p>
