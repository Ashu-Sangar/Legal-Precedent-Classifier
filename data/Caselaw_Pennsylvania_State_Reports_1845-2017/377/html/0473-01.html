In that case trustees held 200 shares of stock in a bank which, with several other banks, was merged into the Philadelphia National Bank. As a result of the merger the trustees received 200 shares of stock of the Philadelphia National Bank. The book or intact value of the new stock exceeded by $11,000. the book or intact value of the original shares of stock owned by testator at the time of his death. The life tenant claimed that this excess was income payable in stock or cash and immediately distributable to her. This Court rejected her claim and said (pp. 541, 542, 543) : <em>“The merger of two or m,ore corporations is neither a sale nor a liquidation of corporate property,’</em>

      <em> </em>but a consolidation of properties, powers, and facilities of the constituent companies, forming a new corporate entity. ... a merger of two corporations cannot be considered as a sale of their property by the constituent companies, and the issuance of the new capital stock is merely the issuance of new evidence of ownership to the shareholders. <em>Accepting shares of stock in the merged company is not tantamount to a distribution or division of assets ichich calls for an apportionment between a life tenant and remainderman. </em>...

The surplus and all other items of value remain, subject to debts, reverses, losses and decline in value because of business conditions. As long as the stock remains in the hands of the trustee, he is not required to account to life tenants for anything except the dividends received.’ . . . The court below did not err in refusing to direct the apportionment requested by the life tenant. The life tenant is not entitled to any division until (1) the increased value is declared as a cash dividend, or (2) distributed in the form of a stock dividend, or (3) the affairs of the bank are wound up so that assets are distributed to those entitled to receive them, or (4) there is a sale of this stock so that the connection of shareholder is entirely severed.” While there was no capitalization of surplus and undivided profits in that merger, that fact cannot change the principle there established.</p>

In that case a corporation merged with two of its wholly owned corporate subsidiaries and there was a corporate recapitalization.

This Court held that this merger did not entitle the life tenant to an apportionment. After quoting with approval from the opinion in <em>Buist’s Estate, </em>297 Pa., supra, Mr. Justice Stearne said. (p. ..30) : “This action [the award of a portion of the new stock to the life tenant] was premature. . . .
