The lease provided that the premises were to be occupied by the lessee “in the business of washing and cleaning automobiles within the scope of the business of the Philadelphia MinitMan Corporation, . . . and for no other purpose.” As rent the lessee was to pay a sum equal to 12%% on the amount of the annual gross sales but a minimum of f1,800 per year; the term “gross sales” was to include the sales price of all merchandise sold and also all charges for services performed by the lessee in the course of the business conducted on the premises. The lessee agreed to erect and place on the premises the buildings and equipment needed to carry on the business; all buildings and fixtures erected by the lessee were to become the property of the lessor as and when the lease agreement should expire for any reason whatever. If default were made in the observance or performance of any of the conditions or agreements the lessor was to have the right to terminate the lease and re-enter the premises.</p>

Plaintiff urges, however, that in a lease such as that here involved, in which the amount of rental to be paid is based upon the lessee’s gross sales, there arises an implied obligation on his part to continue the business on the premises to the fullest extent reasonably possible. Defendant, on the other hand, contends that, where such an obligation is intended, it must be expressly inserted in the lease, and that the raising of an implied covenant is never justified except where obviously necessary to effectuate the intention of the parties and so clearly within their contemplation that they deemed it unnecessary to express it, and that this is especially true where a substantial minimum rental is provided the obvious purpose of which is to protect the lessor from any unfavorablé circumstances that might subsequently arise whether caused by voluntary conduct of the lessee or by events beyónd his control.</p>

The court said (p. 380, P. p. 589) that it could “only be concluded that the parties considered the stipulated minimum rent to be in itself fair and adequate and any additional sum was in the nature of a bonus which the lessee was willing to pay if his business exceeded his expectations.”</p>

Gross sales is defined in the contract as follows: “The term ‘gross sales’ as herein used shall be held to include the sales price of all merchandise of every sort whatsoever sold, including all charges for all services performed by the Lessee in the course of the business aforesaid.” The “business aforesaid,” of course is the cleaning and washing business.</p>
    <p id="b578-7" data-blocks='[["BL_578.7",578,[267,2114,1150,97]],["BL_579.1",579,[176,333,1145,375]]]'>The Lessee covenants that: “it will keep separate and accurate records of the gross sales covering all <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>business done or transacted in, upon, or from said demised premises.” The Lessee agrees: “to build, erect and complete all necessary buildings on tlie said demised premises in order to begin and carry on the said business aforesaid, including all utilities necessary for the operation and occupation of said building in the manner provided herein.”</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[177,730,1144,97]]]'>I repeat that the “business aforesaid” is the business of cleaning and washing automobiles.</p>
    <p id="b579-5" data-blocks='[["BL_579.6",579,[177,849,1146,364]]]'>Paragraph 6 of the lease prohibits the lessee from going into the liquor business and then declares that the premises shall not be “used for any other purpose than as above specified, nor make any change in the business purposes as now understood and agreed, without written consent of the Lessor first had and obtained.”</p>
    <p id="b579-6" data-blocks='[["BL_579.7",579,[176,1245,1147,759]]]'>Thus, the lease, in the clearest and most direct phraseology possible, declares that (1) the premises are to be used only for cleaning and washing automobiles; (2) that the lessee is to pay to the lessor a certain percentage on the revenue derived from cleaning and washing automobiles; (3) the lessee is to erect a suitable structure and install necessary equipment for cleaning and washing automobiles; and (4) the lessee cannot use the premises for any purpose (except he have written consent from the lessor) other than cleaning and washing automobiles. With this inundation of expressed purpose, how can the Majority say that if there is one thing the defendant is not required to do, it is the cleaning and washing of automobiles?</p>
    <p id="b579-7" data-blocks='[["BL_579.8",579,[177,2026,1145,264]],["BL_580.1",580,[253,338,1151,88]]]'>Paragraph 11 of the lease-contract declares that the lessee <em>covenants </em>and agrees that: “if default be made in the punctual payment of said rent or any part thereof, or in the observance of performance of any of said conditions or agreements, The Lessor may, without no<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>tice to the Lessee, and without demand for rent due, <em>terminate the Lease ”</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[252,457,1153,199]]]'>This paragraph says further that the lessee shall pay all costs and expenses involved in making collection of the said rent and in “enforcing any of the <em>provisions” </em>of the lease.</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[252,686,1153,152]]]'>How can it be said that the agreement to use the premises only for washing and cleaning automobiles is not a <em>provision </em>of the lease?</p>
    <p id="b580-6" data-blocks='[["BL_580.7",580,[252,860,1153,539]]]'>To allow the defendant corporation here to repudiate the agreement it so specifically made and the conditions it so definitively accepted, is to read out of a contract what is so clearly in it and give meaning to language which is directly opposite to what it says. It is to make a mockery of written agreements, turn solemn obligations into writing exercises and introduce the courts into every agreement on the basis that they may be called upon to revaluate, reinterpret and rewrite the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b580-7" data-blocks='[["BL_580.8",580,[251,1421,1153,760]]]'>After the parties had entered into the solemn contract already amply quoted from, they executed an addendum as if to reconfirm what they had already said in their original agreement. In the very last paragraph of this addendum appears this supremely significant statement: “Notwithstanding any of the provisions to the contrary, therein contained in said original lease agreement, it is expressly understood that a certain Minit Man <em>Automatic Oar Washing Machine, </em>intended to be installed in the demised premises, shall at the termination of the lease remain the sole and exclusive property of the Lessee, who shall be privileged to remove the same at such time without any interference on the part of the Lessor.”</p>

    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[170,487,1145,317]]]'>The lower court made the following observation in its Opinion: “We are told the lease before us was drawn by plaintiff’s attorney; it would have been a simple matter for him to have inserted in the lease, as he drew it, a clause requiring full use of defendant’s operation and a forfeiture in the event of his failure.”</p>
    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[169,827,1147,430]]]'>There is no doubt that if the drawer of the contract could have anticipated that the meaning of simple English could be so beclouded in its reading, he might have added the suggested clause and perhaps even illustrated it with pictures, but I doubt that even <em>that </em>could have made it clearer that the lessee agreed, promised, covenanted and obligated himself to use the demised premises for cleaning and washing automobiles.</p>
    <p id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[168,1269,1147,1036]]]'>The Majority Opinion says that there is nothing “in the present case to indicate that defendant’s action in discontinuing the washing and cleaning of cars except as incidental to simonizing and polishing was taken other than in good faith and in the exercise of legitimate business judgment.” The record is absolutely devoid of any factual foundation upon which to erect a superstructure of such laudation. Furthermore, the defendant corporation has no right in the law to use business judgment which will work an advantage to itself at the expense and loss of the other party to the agreement. The <em>plaintiff </em>also used what he considered was “legitimate business judgment” when he offered to lease his property to the defendant on the basis that the defendant would use the premises for the business of washing and cleaning automobiles. Even the name of the defendant corporation is one identified throughout the area with the cleaning and washing of automobiles.</p>

      <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>The lower court says that the phrase “cleaning and washing automobiles” is descriptive, rather than directive. The paragraph in the lease describing the premises is certainly descriptive. Is it any less effective on that account? The manner in which the rent is to be paid is descriptive. Does that mean it can be ignored?</p>
    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.4",582,[260,754,1153,375]]]'>I dissent in this case not only on legal principles but in defense of the integrity of the English language. Despite the tortuous reasoning in the opinion of the lower court and despite the citations quoted in the opinion of the majority of this Court, I can only conclude that cleaning and washing automobiles means the cleaning and washing of automobiles.</p>
