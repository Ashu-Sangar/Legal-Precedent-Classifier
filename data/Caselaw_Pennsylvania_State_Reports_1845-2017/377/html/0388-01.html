Butler, the plaintiff, instituted an action of partition in equity against Frank C. Butler, defendant, who was her divorced husband. The parties were married on July 31, 1936 and lived together until March, 1944 when plaintiff left defendant charging him with abuse and ill treatment. The wife instituted an action in divorce in April, 1946. In September, 1946 the parties resumed cohabitation and thereafter lived together as man and wife until about April, 1948. In October, 1948, while still cohabiting, a decree of absolute divorce was entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant. On August 16, 1947, the plaintiff and defendant, although divorced, accepted and recorded, a deed conveying to. “Frank C. Butler [defend<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>ant] and Fay L. Butler [plaintiff], husband and wife”, the premises in question, 719 Main Street, in the Township of Paint, County of Somerset. On the same day the parties executed and delivered “as husband and wife” a mortgage to a bank, which was duly recorded, the proceeds of which were used in the purchase of the real estate. The plaintiff removed from the premises on March 19, 1948, leaving defendant in exclusive possession, where he still remains. On May 25, 1951, plaintiff instituted the present action in partition which defendant contests. The court below ruled that the court in equity had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter. It decreed that the defendant-husband was the owner in fee of the real estate and dismissed the complaint in partition.</p>
