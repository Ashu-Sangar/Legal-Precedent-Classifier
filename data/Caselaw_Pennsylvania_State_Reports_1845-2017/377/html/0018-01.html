    <p id="b39-4" data-blocks='[["BL_39.6",39,[203,1400,1147,817]]]'>“The question presented in this case is not free from difficulty. Certain principles of law relative to restrictions in deeds are well-settled. Restrictions may arise: (1) By expressed covenants or (2) By implication (a) from the language of the deed, or (b) from the conduct of the parties. To ascertain the intention of the parties the language of the deed should be interpreted in the light of the subject matter, the apparent object or purpose of the parties, and the conditions existing when it was executed. Building restrictions and similar covenants which restrain a man in the fair enjoyment of his property are not favored in the law. They are strictly construed, and are not to be extended by implication unless the parties clearly so understand and intend: Baedertoood, <em>Inc v.

Undoubtedly those lots which were laid out by courses and distances and exact measurements and staked upon the ground must be considered as part of the plan of lots. L. C. D. G-reenough, Township Engineer, and the engineer who laid out the plans of lots for William H. Miller, including the one now under consideration, testified as follows: “Lots 62, 63, 64, and 65 are sketched in to indicate how it could be subdivided in subsequent times. The plotted plan stops at the end of 41, which you can see, as the bearings and distances all correspond.” And he further testified that Mr. Miller was undecided as to completing the plan, for the reason that it might be necessary to cut down trees, and it would be necessary to complete the entrance onto new Route 8. Other engineers testified that the scaling in of lots is not considered as making them a part of a plan of lots. This testimony stands uncontradicted, and must be considered as being correct. Consequently we have ■ a recorded plan of lots, with four scaled in, which are not properly part of the plan as laid out.</p>

The mere fact that William H. Miller in a recorded instrument in 1947 referred to seventy-four lots, and the fact that Lots 62, 63, 64, and 65, were referred to in the settlement of his estate, cannot change the situation. The fact remains that the plots of land so indicated Avere never actually and finally laid out as lots in any “Homewood Plan” of lots. It is to be considered that there is no recorded consent by the owners of lots in the “Homewood Plan” to the so-called revised “Homewood Plan”, recorded in <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>September, 1941. The defendants in this case seek to maintain the position of dominant lots or tenements without formally accepting the revised plan, so as to make their lots servient to the added lots in the revised plan. It is difficult to see how there can be any mutuality of covenants under such circumstances.</p>
