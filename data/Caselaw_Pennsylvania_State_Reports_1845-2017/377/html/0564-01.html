David Nikisher, a minor, ivas a guest passenger in the automobile of Carl H. Benninger, the defendant. The suit is by the guardians of the minor. Julius Nikisher and Thelma B., his wife, parents of the minor, have joined in the suit in their own right. The guardians of the minor appeal because of the inadequacy of his verdict, $1,500. The parents, while entirely satisfied Avith the amount of their verdict, $5,000, appeal, according to their counsel, as “a purely formal proceeding for the purpose of con<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>ferring jurisdiction upon [tlie Supreme] Court”. Counsel for appellants, in their supplemental brief, correctly recite the procedural history: “. . . a judgment of $5,-000 was entered for the parents plaintiffs and a judgment of $1,500 for the minor plaintiff. Initially, one appeal was taken from the $1,500 judgment, but no separate appeal was taken from the $5,000 judgment because there was no complaint as to it. When the original appeal was orally argued before this Court on January 13, 1954, the question was raised from the Bench that the Court did not have jurisdiction of the single appeal from the $1,500 judgment. On January 14, 1954 this Court remitted the appeal to the Superior Court. Thereafter, on January 20th, the parents plaintiffs appealed to this Court from the $5,000 judgment and the case was docketed in this Court as of January Term, 1954, No. 124. A petition was then filed in the Superior Court reciting this fact and calling attention to Section 5 of the Act of May 5, 1899, P. L. 248 as amended and to Section 2 of the Act of June 11, 1935, P. L. 303. On February 4, 1954, the Superior Court certified the appeal on the $1,500 judgment back to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania for consideration and decision, . . .”</p>

Liability must, therefore, be conceded. The trial judge stated in his charge: “It has been a very serious case.” It was testified that the minor plaintiff, at the date of the accident, November 24, 1950, was seventeen years of age, in school and in good health. As a result of the accident he had a compound fracture of the left femur, with the bone protruding through the skin, abrasions of the left hip, both knees and ankles and laceration of the thigh where the bone had torn through the muscles. There was an open reduction operation, with an incision eight to ten inches long, which opened the thigh to the bone. A plate was screwed to the bone fragments .and a ten pound plaster <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>cast applied to the entire leg. The plaintiff required two blood transfusions, catheterization, and was immobilized with sand bags for eight weeks and then taken home and placed in bed. He was able, with the aid of crutches, to get out of bed to attend to calls of nature. On February 2, 1951, while out of bed for that purpose, he slipped and fell and broke the plate which held the bone fragments in position. Until February 2nd he had spent ten weeks in bed and the last two at home. He ivas taken back to the hospital. A twenty-fiye pound plaster cast was then placed on his left leg and around the pelvis which remained on for five weeks during which time the patient could not move or turn. The bone fragments did not unite so a second open reduction operation was performed with another incision eight to ten inches long and another plate screwed in. He was returned home May 5, 1951. Therefore, he liad two serious operations and was flat on his back for twenty-three weeks, twenty-one of which were spent in the hospital. On his return home he remained in bed for another twenty weeks and was taken every month by ambulance to the hospital for X-rays. He was required to wear a heavy leather and metal brace. It was testified that he suffered and still suffers severe pain. He has permanent disfiguring scars and there will be permanent disability of about fifteen per cent in the use of his leg. At the time of the trial, two years and five months after the accident, he still was required to use a cane and walked with a pronounced limp. Plaintiff has not yet been able to engage in any work for which he is fitted.</p>

The trial judge left it to the jury to determine whether the second accident had relation to the first injury. He instructed <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>the jury that if it did <em>not </em>defendant would not be liable for damages for the second injury. The following conversation took place between counsel for <em>defendant </em>and the court: “BY MB. WALKER: T would like you to charge that the fact that the Plaintiff’s hand slipping could be considered contributory negligence on his part, and if that is the proximate cause’ — [BY THE COURT:] Tf they so feel, that the slipping of the hand was a separate act of negligence on the part of the Plaintiff, they may consider that as a separate action in itself and the Defendant would not be liable for that-.’ BY MR. ELDREDQE: ‘Your Honor will grant me an exception to that point?’ [BY THE COURT:] ‘Yes’.” The correct question was not <em>negligence, </em>but whether the injured leg gave way from weakness and not from an independent accident. In other words, if the injured leg had been sound and well, would it have given way when plaintiff’s hand slipped? There was no evidence of <em>negligence </em>before the jury in relation to slipping. The charge as given appears to be accurate, but the answer to defendant’s point for charge confused the issue where the court said the defendant would not be liable “[i]f [the jury] feel[s], that the slipping of the hand was a separate act of <em>negligence </em>on the part of the Plaintiff, . . .” We do not agree with the court in banc: “If there was any error in the instructions in this respect, it must have been harmless error.”</p>
