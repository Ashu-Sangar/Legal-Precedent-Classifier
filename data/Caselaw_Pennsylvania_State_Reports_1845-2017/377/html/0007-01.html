The Glen Alden Coal Company and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as defendants, appealed to the Workmen’s Compensation Boat'd which, after affirming the award to TJnora,, referred that case to the Medical Board appointed under Section 420 (a) of the Act of June 21, 1939. It also referred, before passing on the appeal, the two other cases (Kalena and Drozd) to the same Medical Board.</p>

    <p id="b30-4" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[269,564,1154,759]]]'>The cases were appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County which reversed the decisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Board and sent the eases back for further action. The defendants appealed to the Superior Court which, in its turn, reversed the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County. The claimants then asked for an allocatur from the Supreme Court. The allocatur was granted and the claimants entered this Court on a further extension of the legal pilgrimage they began some 6 and one-half years ago. The zig-zagging journey, however, is still not ended because, in view of the decision herein to be announced, the case must now go back again to the Workmen’s Compensation Board.</p>
    <p id="b30-5" data-blocks='[["BL_30.6",30,[264,1337,1155,593]]]'>Section 420 (a) of The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act provides<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> that when the Workmen’s Compensation Board is required to review the Referee’s findings on medical questions, the Board shall refer the case to the Medical Board “for determination of the medical facts.” Paragraph (d) of Sec. 402 specifies that “The medical board shall have the power <em>and its duty shall be to hear and determine </em>controverted medical issues in cases arising under this act in accordance with the provisions of section 420.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

We agree that counsel’s position is well taken that the Medical Board did not fulfill its duty under the section of the Act referred to. While the Medical Board was not required to follow any rigid formality, nor even, of its own volition, to seek additional evidence, it cannot be said that it met the wording of the Act when it failed to <em>hear </em>the medical issue involved. In law, where a controversy is involved, a hearing intends a judgment bench attended by judges or officials sitting in a judicial capacity, prepared to listen to both sides of the dispute and to consider deeply, reflect broadly, and decide impartially. Studying papers is not a hearing; passing on a report moving across one’s desk is not a hearing. The very genius of American jurisprudence shines in the opportunity it affords every litigant to present his case openly, publicly and untrammeledly. This concept was well stated by the Supreme Court of Montana in the case of <em>Grant v. </em>Michaels, <a href="/mont/94/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="94 Mont. 452" data-case-ids="4969865" data-case-paths="/mont/94/0452-01">94 Mont. 452</a>, <a href="/mont/94/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="94 Mont. 452" data-case-ids="4969865" data-case-paths="/mont/94/0452-01">23 P. 2d, 266</a>: “The power To “hear and determine” is an essential ingredient of jurisdiction, and the quoted words refer to a judicial investigation and settlement of an issue of fact, which implies the <em>weighing of testimony offered on both </em>sides, from a consideration of which the relief sought by the moving party is either granted or denied.’” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

A hearing is not granted to a litigant simply to provide him with a forum for rhetorical expression. The right to be heard constitutes not only the right to talk; it includes the right on the part of the litigant to listen to what the tribunal has <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>to say and to offer advice and counsel. The right to be heard encompasses the right also to give ear to one’s adversary and to object, if necessary.</p>

Total disability, however, in the nomenclature of workmen’s compensation proceedings imports economic as well as physical findings. Professor Arthur Larson, presently dean of the University of Pittsburgh Law School, well stated in his book on Workmen’s Compensation Law (Yol. 2, Sec. 57, 10, pp. 2, 3) that: “. . . the disability concept is a blend of two ingredients, .... the first ingredient is disability in the medical or physical sense, as evidenced by obvious loss of members or by medical testimony that the claimant simply cannot make the necessary muscular movements and exertions; the second ingredient is de facto inability to earn wages, as evidenced by proof that claimant has not in fact earned anything . . .</p>

That same doctor could, however, come to a different conclusion if he saw the patient in the depths of a coal mine laden with heavy equipment, bent under a low ceiling, coughing from bad ventilation and slipping from insecure footing. It is obvious that a one-legged man is only partially disabled at a desk addressing envelopes but entirely <em>hors de combat </em>in a quarry carrying blocks of stone.</p>

Where the injured person can handle only a specially-created job, one light of effort and responsibility but laden with rest and comfort (employment plums that do not often dangle from the tree of everyday economics) the burden is on the defendant-employer to show that such a job is in fact within reach. If proof of that fact is not presented, the claimant then is entitled to a finding of total disability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">1</a> The Medical Board here, however, without the benefit of evidence and counsel that could come from the claimants and their attorneys, and without expressing any opinion on the numerous mechanical, nervous and toxic factors entering into the determination of physical disability in a silicosis case, proceeded to reverse the findings of the Referee based <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>on the testimony of impartial experts (that claimants were totally disabled) and concluded that the claimants were only partially disabled.</p>

How reliable was the medical data which was the basis of the Board’s conclusions? Dr. W. T. Davis, who examined Prank Drozd on behalf of the defendant Glen Alden Company, testified that in his opinion Drozd was not totally disabled, and that Drozd could do work as a road cleaner, gasoline attendant or janitor. Several months later Drozd died, and the death certificate described the cause of death to have been anthraco-silicosis!</p>
