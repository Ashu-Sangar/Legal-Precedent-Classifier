On May 6, 1947, city council <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>enacted an ordinance (No. 176) which prohibited the construction or alteration of any building within the City without a permit so to do. Such permit was obtainable as a matter of course from the city clerk upon the payment of a fee of two dollars. Some time prior to March, 1953, city council, in accordance with Section 41 (b) of The Third Class City Code of 1951, P. L. 662, 53 PS §12198-4110 et seq., appointed a commission to prepare a zoning ordinance for the City. When the commission had completed its preliminary report, notice was given that public hearings thereon would be held on March 19th and April 2nd, 1953. Meanwhile, on March 9, 1953, Ordinance No. 261 was introduced in city council and was finally enacted on March 17th. It is this ordinance (No. 261) Avith Avhich much of the present controversy is concerned. According to its title, the ordinance'provided “for the Issuance of a Building Permit for the Alteration and Improvement of a Build-ing in Existence and for the Erection and Construction of Buildings: . . . for the Type and Use of Said Buildings and the Locations Permissible Therefor: and . . . for a Fee for Said Building Permit, in the City of New Kensington . . . .” The ordinance declared that construction or alteration of any building within the City without a permit was unlawful; that applications for building permits should be in writing and accompanied by a complete set of the plans and specifications for The proposed, construction or alteration; that, applications 'for'.permits must.be approved by a. majority vóte'.of the' <em>city: 'council </em>provided, the application conformed to “the regulations, locations, and purposes and uses”'set forth.in the ordinance, which regulations, by reference To' a “Building Map”, divided -the City into' four districts,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the building regulations in each: dis.: <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>trict being substantially the same imposed by a later enacted zoning ordinance to which further reference will hereinafter be made; that a building permit would be issued <em>by the city cleric </em>(upon payment of two dollars) <em>if city council approved the application </em>therefor; and expressly repealed Ordinance No. 176 enacted May 6, 1947.</p>

A public hearing was scheduled for May 5th. On the same day that the zoning commission presented its final report to city council (viz., April 28th), the plaintiff, A. J. Aberman, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, <em>applied to the city cleric </em>for a building permit for the construction of a shopping center on a tract of land owned or controlled by it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The city clerk advised the plaintiff that its application should, under the provisions of Ordinance No. 261, he submitted to city council where it could be acted upon at its next scheduled meeting on May 5th.

On May 27th, the defendant city and city clerk filed preliminary objections to the complaint in mandamus, contending, inter alia, that city council had not been given an opportunity to exercise, with respect to the permit application, the discretion vested in it by Ordinance No. 261. Argument on the petition for mandamus and preliminary objections thereto was listed for June 8th, but, on that day, “No hearing was had, the matter just being informally discussed before the Court <em>en banc.” </em>On the same day, the court dismissed the preliminary objections and, without opportunity for answer or hearing, issued the writ sought. The plaintiff, upon receiving the permit the succeeding day (June 9th), <em>at once </em>began construction of its shopping center. June 9th was also the very day that the final zoning ordinance was formally introduced in city council. Ten days later (viz., on June 19th), the defendants petitioned to open the judgment in mandamus, asserting that no opportunity had been accorded them to defend on the merits. The rule to show cause already mentioned was granted on the petition which the plaintiff answered on July 3rd. The order granting the rule also provided that all proceedings should be stayed in the meantime. On July 8th, the zoning ordinance was finally enacted and became effective ten days later (July 18th).</p>

Finally, on February 2, 1954, the court made absolute the rule to open, reconsidered and sustained the preliminary objections and denied the writ of mandamus. In its opinion accompanying the order, the court below stated,- — “We are now of the opinion that [Ordinance No. 261, enacted March 17, 1953] requiring the issuance of a building permit by the City Council was valid and that the application of the plaintiff for the writ of mandamus was premature.

L. 662, 53 PS §12198-4110 et seq.; that it did not, therefore, repeal Ordinance No. 176 (the building permit ordinance of 1947) ; that the plaintiff’s application for a building permit was properly made to the city clerk under the provisions of Ordinance No. 176; and that the appellant acquired a vested right in the permit issued to it on June 9th when, in reliance thereon, it began construction of its shopping center.</p>

      <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>Ordinance No. 261 reposed in city council discretionary power to refuse tlie issuance of a building permit when an application therefor conflicted with certain regulations contained in that ordinance even though such regulations were substantially the same as were contained in the then pending and later enacted zoning ordinance. It is the appellant’s contention that, in enacting Ordinance No. 261, city council attempted to enact a “stopgap” or “interim” zoning ordinance such as was struck down in <em>Kline v. Harrisburg, </em>supra. On the other hand, the municipality contends that, in enacting Ordinance No. 261, city council (following decisions of this court to the effect that a property owner has <em>no absolute or vested right </em>to obtain a building permit for a land use in harmony with existing legislation but in conflict with a pending and later enacted zoning ordinance) was merely announcing its intention to refuse any building permit which conflicted with the proposed final zoning ordinance. The contention is well founded.</p>

The application was refused, however, since there was then pending in borough council an ordinance which would prohibit the use. On the day the applicant sought a writ of mandamus to compel issuance of the permit, the zoning ordinance was finally enacted and became effective the following day. The writ was refused although the ordinance was passed daring the pendency of the permit application. In sustaining the lower court, we reaffirmed the principle that mandamus is a discretionary Avrit, not a writ of right, and held that the court was not guilty of error in refusing the writ in the circumstances.

The permit was refused. Speaking for a unanimous court, Mr. Justice Stearne characterized the question involved as “whether a property owner has the right to obtain a permit for the erection of a building where the location of the building on the lot complies with <em>existing </em>law but conflicts with the terms of a <em>proposed </em>(but later enacted) zoning ordinance.” In rejecting the contention that application for a building permit prior to the effective date of the amendatory ordinance conferred a vested right to secure the permit, we held that “a mere application for a permit confers no <em>vested right </em>as of that time, and an application may be refused or permit vacated because of an ordinance passed after the date of the application [citing cases] unless the holder of a permit previously issued does something of a substantial character toward construction, in good faith, before the enactment of the new zoning ordinance [citing cases].” Again, in <em>Mutual Supply Company Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/366/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="366 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="8845641" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0424-01">366 Pa. 424</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20612" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="77 A.2d 612">77 A. 2d 612</a>, we declared, — “It is true, as the appellants assert, that the area in which [the] property is located was reclassified for single-family-dwelling use while the application for the permit was pending. But, that affords the appellants no ground for complaint. The Board disposed of the application according to the law in effect at the time of its action with respect thereto; and that is sufficient.”</p>

On the very day the appellant applied for its building permit, the zoning commission, which had been officially and publicly created several months earlier, submitted its final report, after hearings, to city council where a still further hearing on the proposed zoning ordinance was scheduled for seven days later. The complaint in mandamus was filed on May 4, 1953, but was not disposed of until June 8th following. Throughout that period the zoning ordinance was pending in city council and two public hearings thereon were held. It is true that the zoning ordinance was not formally introduced in council until June 9th, but it was, nonetheless, finally enacted on July 8th and became effective on July 18th. When the mandamus proceeding was <em>finally </em>disposed of by the court below on February 2, 1954, the ordinance had long since been in full force and effect: see <em>Mutual Supply Company Appeal, </em>supra. In the instant case, the City’s refusal of the appellant’s application for a building permit could have been sustained on the ground of the pendency of the comprehensive zoning ordinance then before council and whose ultimate enactment was virtually but a matter of days. This is so without reliance upon Ordinance No. 261. The voiding of the building permit, which the learned court below had inadvertently caused to be issued, can likewise be justified without regard for Ordinance No. 261 which, in the circumstances, had become superfluous.</p>

Here, however, the zoning com mission had submitted its final report and recommendations to city council on the very day that the appellant first saw fit to make application for a permit. And, while in the <em>Gold, “Ab” Young </em>and <em>Mutual </em>cases, supra, the ordinances had been introduced in council when the permits were sought, in the present instance the zoning ordinance was so far advanced in the process of enactment as to come within the rule announced in those cases.</p>

It will be recalled that it was on the very day (April 28, 1953) that the zoning commission filed its final report, after several months’ study and hearings, and submitted to council a proposed zoning ordinance that the plaintiff first applied for a building permit; and, when the permit was formally refused by the city clerk with the suggestion that the application be renewed before city council, which would meet in regular session on May 5th, the plaintiff deliberately ignored the advice and on May 4th instituted its proceeding in mandamus to compel the issuance to it of a building permit which the City resisted.</p>

Yet, without awaiting further effort of the City, by appeal or otherwise, to obtain relief from the judgment in the mandamus proceeding, the plaintiff claims to have made large expenditures and to have incurred obligations on June 10th, the day succeeding the issuance of the permit. Within ten days (i.e., on June 19th), the City obtained from the court a rule on the plaintiff to show cause why the judgment in mandamus should not be opened and the City let into a defense, — an opportunity which had never been accorded it. Moreover, the court’s order granting the rule expressly provided that all proceedings should be stayed pending disposition of the rule. But, the plaintiff, notwithstanding, went ahead after that and made, according to its allegations, the largest part of the expenditures whieh it asserts entitles it to a vested right in the assailed building per: mit.

As stated in 3 Anderson, Pennsylvania Civil Practice, p. 337, in the Comment on Rule 1098, — “While no time limit is set, the court would act within the proper sphere of its discretion in refusing to open a judgment against a defendant who, after receiving notice of its entry or proposed entry, delayed an unreasonable time before making any objection thereto.” Here, the defendant moved within ten days of the entry of the judgment to have it opened and be let into a defense. In such circumstances it cannot be said that the defendant was dilatory. Any delay in disposing of the rule gTanted on the petition to open the judgment was the responsibility of the court and not of the defendant whose rights could not be prejudiced thereby.</p>

That was a case of opening a judgment at law after the expiration of the term and not a motion to quash a writ of mandamus by way of a petition to open. The court specifically recognized in the <em>Stave </em>case that judgments pro confesso or by default remain within the court’s power regardless of the term time. Here, the judgment awarding the writ was tantamount to a judgment by default, having been - entered on-no <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>more than the plaintiff’s complaint. Furthermore, the opinion in the <em>Stave </em>case, after noting that there was nothing in that casé calling for equitable interference, declared, — “If there had been the ending of the term would not necessarily preclude relief.” Actually, the <em>Stave </em>case is authority for no more than that the fact there relied on for opening the judgment (viz., ignorance of law) presented no equitable basis for avoiding operation of the normal rule as to the opening of a judgment beyond the term of its entry. Even if such rule were unbending and were applicable in respect of peremptory judgments in mandamus (where a petition to open is the equivalent of the former motion to quash), the fact that the writ had been “inadvertently granted”, as the court below expressly conceded, was sufficient justification for opening the judgment, i.e., for quashing the writ.</p>
