    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[257,728,1153,1202]]]'>On February 23, 1943, Florence P. McFarland was declared to be unable, due to weakness of mind, to take care of her property. The Commonwealth Trust Company of Pittsburgh was appointed guardian of her estate. The assets which became subject to the control of the guardian consisted of a piece of real estate formerly occupied by the ward as her home and household furniture of the estimated value of $500.00. The real estate was subject, however, to two mortgages aggregating about $2,700. The guardian filed a petition in the court below on April 13, 1943, requesting authority to sell its ward’s real estate at a private sale for $6,500. The petition contained (1) a recital of the appointment of the guardian (2) ownership of the real estate (3) a copy of the agreement to sell (4) the appraised value for tax purposes at $4,800 (5) the appraisal at $6,500 by two real estate brokers and (6) the petitioner’s opinion that the price was fair and reasonable and better than obtainable at public sale. The court found that the sale was in the best interests of the ward and entered an order on April 13, 1943, approving the sale.</p>

The Act further states that the court may not make such an order unless certain procedural requirements contained therein are fully met. These are restrictions imposed on the power of the court to act. All of these procedural requirements must be complied with before the court has jurisdiction to decree a sale: <em>Bennett v. Hayden, </em><a href="/pa/145/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="145 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="825880" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0586-01">145 Pa. 586</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.%20255" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 A. 255">23 A. 255</a>; <em>Mitchell v.

Because the Act of 1807, supra, states “The guardian, . . . shall have precisely the same powers, and be subject to the same duties, as a committee on lunacy . . .” the appellant contends that the court is subject to the same restrictions contained in the Act of 1836, supra. Such contention fails to distinguish between the powers and duties of the <em>guardian </em>and the powers and duties of the <em>conrt. </em>The later Act does not say that the <em>court </em>shall have precisely the same powers and duties as the court has under the Act of 1836, supra, but specifically designates the <em>guardian. </em>Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous there is no need to resort to rules of statutory construction to determine its meaning: Statutory Construction' Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019,. art. IV, sec. 51, 46 PS 551. The statement in'-the Act of 1907, supra, concerning, the samé <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>powers and duties of the guardian, is a general statement concerning the guardian’s functions and does not in any manner relate to the court’s powers. On the contrary, the Act of 1907 confers entirely new powers on the court. There is no longer any restriction that personalty be first exhausted, but the court has . . full power over the [guardian], . . . and shall enter a decree of sale, . . . whenever in the opinion of the court it is necessary for the support and maintenance of the said ward or his family, ... or where it is for the interest and advantage of the said ward that the same shall be sold, . . The court, then, is given under the Act of 1907, full discretionary power to determine when it is necessary or for the interest and advantage of the ward to sell the real estate. To hold otherwise would be to disregard the Act entirely. Since the court’s power may properly be exercised without being dependent on the procedural requirements of the Act of 1836 the court below had jurisdiction to decree the sale.</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[269,1463,1152,589]]]'>The same result, it will be observed, is reached under the Incompetents’ Estates Act of 1951, June 28, 1951, P. L. 612, 50 PS 1631 et seq. This Act repeals both of the Acts of 1836 and 1907. In section 443, 50 PS 1823, the court is given the power to approve a sale of an incompetent’s real estate whenever it is found to be for the best interests of the incompetent. The court’s jurisdiction is not contingent on any precedent procedural requirements. This Act is cited solely as evidence of legislative intent and does not govern this case. .</p>

IY, .sec,..62, 46 <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>PS 562. But this rule is applicable only if the words of a statute are ambiguous. In 82 C. J. S. Statutes see. 366 b. it is stated: . . It must not be overlooked that the rule requiring statutes in pari materia to be construed together is only a rule of construction to be applied as an aid in determining the meaning of a doubtful statute, and that it cannot be invoked where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous.” It was stated that the statutes were in <em>pari materia </em>in <em>Bideiman Estate, </em><a href="/pa/360/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="360 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="475052" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0195-01">360 Pa. 195</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20355" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="61 A.2d 355">61 A. 2d 355</a>, but there both Acts were silent on the point of the guardian’s powers after the death of the ward. The procedures prescribed in the 1907 Act a,re different from the earlier Act which demonstrates that the Legislature did not intend one to be identical with the other. Under the 1836 Act the ward’s real estate may be sold only when the personalty is insufficient to pay debts and obligations, while under the 1907 Act there is no requirement that personalty be first exhausted, but a sale is permitted when it is for the interest and advantage of the ward. A public sale with notice prescribed by the court is the only method of sale under the Act of 1836. The Act of 1907 provides for either a public or private sale and a designated method of advertisement when sold at a public sale. And as above noted, the Act of 1836 sets forth certain requirements pertaining to the necessity of an inventory, etc., while the Act of 1907 contains no such requirements. These differences prevent the two statutes from being in <em>pari materia. </em>Chief Justice Woodward said in <em>Rich v. Keyser, </em><a href="/pa/54/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="54 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1006276" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0086-01">54 Pa. 86</a>, 89: <em>“. . . </em>Indeed, the words of a statute, when unambiguous, are the true guide to the legislative will. That they differ from the words of a prior statute on the same subject, is an intimation that they are to have a <em>different </em>and not the <em>same </em>construction, . . .” See also <em>State Highway Route </em>No. <em>72, </em>

At the time of her adjudication as a weak-minded person, Florence P. McFarland was married to F. Herbert McFarland. In the petition for adjudication the nearest relatives were listed as her father and three sisters. The petition also stated that she was married, but her husband’s name was not set forth. We have examined the record in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. McFarland v. McFarland, </em>at No. 1891 of 1939, in the County Court of Allegheny County and may, therefore, take judicial notice of the fact that as early as December 12, 1939, Mrs. McFarland’s husband had deserted her. Such being the case, Anthony Fricker, the father, was Mrs. McFarland’s sole next of kin and, therefore, the only person entitled to notice.</p>

Mr. Fricker presented the petition to the court to have his daughter declared to be of weak mind. He admitted in his affidavit that he discussed the need for the sale with a trust officer of the guardian “. . . for the purpose of satisfying the mortgages of record and paying other debts . . .” He also stated “. . . that he had full knowledge of the proposed sale of said property to Charles P. Berndt et ux., for the consideration of f6,500.00, and had full knowledge that a petition would be presented to the Court of Common Pleas asking for authority to sell said real estate; . . .” This was an admission that he had notice and approved of what was being done. Depositions filed by the trust officer and Mrs. McFarland’s former: attorney fully corroborate these statements. However, since the order re<a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>fusing to vacate the decree of sale is herein affirmed the guardian’s appeal becomes moot.</p>
