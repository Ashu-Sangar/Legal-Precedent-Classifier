    <p id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.4",490,[272,644,1156,1755]]]'>On June 8, 1948, Adam Gorczynski, <em>the </em>plaintiff, instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County tbe present action against tbe trustees of tbe Pittsburgh Railways Company for damages for personal injuries suffered by him on <em>October 10, 1938, </em>through tbe alleged negligence of tbe defendant debtor, its servants or employees. As a part of bis complaint, Gorczynski pleaded tbe pendency of tbe reorganization proceeding of tbe debtor in bankruptcy. Tbe trustees filed an affidavit of defense and, as new matter, pleaded in bar to tbe action in trespass tbe Pennsylvania statute of limitations which prescribes that an action for damages for personal injuries not resulting in death must be brought within two years from tbe time when tbe injury was done and not afterwards: Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236, Sec. 2, 12 PS §34. Tbe plaintiff countered by pointing to a clause in Sec. 77B (b) (10) of tbe Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as amended by the Act of June 7, 1934, which was in effect at tbe time of tbe accrual of tbe plaintiff’s right of action. Tbe clause provided that “The running of all periods of time prescribed by any other provisions of this Act, and by all statutes of limitations, shall be suspended during tbe pendency of a proceeding under this section.” Prom that, tbe plaintiff argued there was a conflict between the Bankruptcy Act in such regard and tbe Pennsylvania statute of limitations which, perforce, was to be resolved by according paramountcy to tbe federal enactment in obedience to Article VI, 01. 2, of tbe Constitution of tbe United States. Tbe trial judge thereupon continued tbe bearing and referred tbe legal question involved to a court en banc.</p>

      <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>After argument, the court en banc was of the opinion that the alleged conflict had in fact existed but that it had been obviated by the order entered by the United States District Court on June 14, 1938, upon appointing trustees of the debtor in the reorganization proceeding. The order contained, inter alia, the following provision: “(7) All persons, firms, associations and corporations are hereby jointly and severally enjoined and restricted from instituting and prosecuting and continuing the prosecution of any action, suit or proceeding at law, or in equity, or any other proceeding against the debtor, EXCEPTING, however, . . . actions for damages based on the alleged negligence of the debtor, its servants, agents, or employes, in conduct and operation of the business of the debtor, which said . . . actions for damages may be instituted and prosecuted to final judgment . . . .” On the basis of this provision, the court en banc concluded that the suspension of the time limitation upon the plaintiff’s bringing suit on his cause of action had been lifted and that, consequently, his right of recovery had long since been barred at the time he instituted his suit. The court accordingly entered a judgment of- <em>non pros </em>which, on appeal to the Superior Court, was affirmed for the same reason as given by the court below. While we approve the action taken, we do so for a different reason.</p>

The suspension by Bee. 77B (b) (10) of statutes of limitations affected only actions against <em>the debtor </em>for causes arising prior to bankruptcy and was designed to put all creditors of the debtor on an equal footing <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>with respect to the non-outlawing of claims currently enforceable at the time of the bankruptcy.

Gilbert’s Collier on Bankruptcy, 4th Ed., §1542; see, also, Gerdes on Bankruptcy, §1151.” As the claim there involved was not one against the bankrupt debtor’s estate, the Delaware statute of limitations was held to be operative and controlling. See also <em>Eiffert v. Pennsylvania Central Brewing Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/141/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="141 Pa. Super. 543" data-case-ids="1027584" data-case-paths="/pa-super/141/0543-01">141 Pa.

But, however that may be, the claim in the instant case was not against the debtor but against the trustees of the debtor. In no event, therefore, could the provision in Sec. 77B (b) (10) be thought to have suspended the State limitation upon the bringing of an action on the plaintiff’s claim.</p>

What that provision was intended to do was to enjoin the institution of any action against <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>the debtor, saving, however, from the scope of the injunction, actions for damages based upon the alleged negligence of the debtor, its servants, agents or employees in the conduct of the debtor’s business. Thus, the saving clause permitted claimants for damages for injuries suffered prior to the bankruptcy, due to the debtor’s alleged negligence, to institute and prosecute their actions to final judgment notwithstanding the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding. But, it took no such exception to secure to claimants for damages for injuries due to negligence of <em>the trustees </em>or their agents or employees in their operation of the bankrupt’s property a right to sue and to prosecute their actions. As to such claims, there can be no question that the Pennsylvania statute of limitations was at all times in full force and effect. As a consequence, action on the present plaintiff’s claim was barred by lapse of time on October 10, 1940 — approximately eight years before suit was instituted.</p>
