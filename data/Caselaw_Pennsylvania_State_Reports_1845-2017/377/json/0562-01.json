J., Stearns, Jones, Bell, Chidsey, Musmanno and Arnold, JJ.\nReporter\u2019s Note: The issue in this suit in equity was whether the remaining assets of a partnership should he distributed according to an account stated, prepared by the partnership\u2019s accountant (as plaintiff contended), or according to a subsequent written agreement between the parties (as defendant contended). The chancellor held that (1) the latter was a valid agreement, (2) the evidence did not prove that a term had been omitted from the written agreement by mutual mistake, and (3) the written agreement superseded the earlier account stated. The chancellor also held that the defendant had not proved his counterclaim, and dismissed the complaint. Upon consideration of defendant\u2019s exceptions to the ruling on the counterclaim, they were sustained and a final decree was entered dismissing the complaint and setting forth the amount due the defendant out of the remaining partnership assets.\nPlaintiff appealed.\nISamuel Finestone, with him W. Horace Hepburn, Jr., for appellant.\nFrederick V. Hebard, with him John A. Fichman, 3rd, and Clark, Hebard & Spahr, for appellee.\nMay 24,1954:"
