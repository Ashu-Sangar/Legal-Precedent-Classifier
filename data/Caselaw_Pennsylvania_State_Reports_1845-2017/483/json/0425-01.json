        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant Charles Robert James was arrested for the murder of Charles Colbert on March 14,1975. After trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, the jury returned a verdict of murder of the third degree. Post-trial motions were denied and judgment of sentence imposed. This appeal follows.\nAppellant\u2019s only allegation of error is the trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct on involuntary manslaughter. Appellant concedes that he did not request such a charge and that he did not object to the instructions at trial. Appellant alleges, however, that because of \u201cplain and fundamental error\u201d in the charge, this Court should reach the issue not raised and decided below. We disagree.\nWe have expressly rejected the doctrine of fundamental error. Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974). Where no objection to the trial court\u2019s charge is taken during or after the charge, no error in the charge may be raised as a ground for review. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1119(b); see Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1975).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nO\u2019BRIEN, J., and Former Justice POMEROY, did not participate in the decision of this case.\nPOMEROY, former J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nWe hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1978).",
