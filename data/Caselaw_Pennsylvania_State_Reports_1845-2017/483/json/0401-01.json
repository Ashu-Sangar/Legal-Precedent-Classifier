        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nAt issue on this appeal is whether appellant John Bishop, charged with the offense of criminal homicide, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2501(a), is entitled to a timely requested jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter where the Commonwealth sought to prove that appellant intentionally killed Frank Albright. The Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County charged the jury on the law of murder of the first and third degree and voluntary manslaughter, but refused appellant\u2019s requested instruction on involuntary manslaughter. Because in these circumstances involuntary manslaughter is a permissible verdict, appellant\u2019s request for an involuntary manslaughter instruction should have been granted.\nSection 2501(a) of the Crimes Code defines \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d as follows:\n\u201cOffense defined. \u2014 A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.\u201d\nAt the same time, however, \u201c[t]o safeguard offenders against excessive, disproportionate or arbitrary punishment,\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 104(3), and to \u201cdifferentiate among offenders with a view to a just individualization in their treatment,\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 104(5), the Legislature in Subsection (b) of Section 2501 established a means of classifying the offense of criminal homicide. Section 2501(b) of the Crimes Code provides:\n\u201c Classification. \u2014 Criminal homicide shall be classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter.\u201d\nEach subclass of the offense of criminal homicide carries a different degree of punishment. See e. g., 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(c) (\u201c[m]urder of the third degree is a felony of the first degree\u201d); 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2503(c) (\u201c[voluntary manslaughter is a felony of the second degree\u201d); 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2504(b) (\u201c[i]nvoluntary manslaughter is a misdemeanor of the first degree\u201d). No subclass of the offense of criminal homicide is defined as a separate offense. See e. g., 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(a) (\u201c[a] criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing\u201d). As the Reporter\u2019s Comment to Section 2501 points out, \u201c[Section 2501] defines the unified offense of \u2018criminal homicide,\u2019 which includes murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Toll, Pennsylvania Crimes Code Annotated 307 (1974).\nIn Section 302(e) of the Code, the Legislature establishes the following principle:\n\u201cSubstitutes for negligence, recklessness and knowledge. \u2014 When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly.\u201d\nThe Comment to the Section of the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code upon which Section 302(e) is based, Model Penal Code, \u00a7 2.02(5) (1962), elaborates:\n\u201c[This section] establishes that when negligence suffices for liability, [intent], knowledge or recklessness are sufficient a fortiori, that [intent] and knowledge similarly substitute for recklessness and [intent] substitutes for knowledge. Thus it is only necessary to articulate the minimal basis of liability for the more serious bases to be implied.\u201d\nA person is guilty of \u201cinvoluntary manslaughter\u201d under the Crimes Code \u201cwhen as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.\u201d 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 2504. Applying section 302(e) to involuntary manslaughter, the essential elements \u201crecklessness or gross negligence\u201d under Section 2504 are established where the Commonwealth proves the actor\u2019s conduct was \u201cintentional or knowing.\u201d It therefore must be concluded that, based upon Section 302(e), where, as here, the Commonwealth seeks to prove \u201cintentional or knowing\u201d acts which cause the death of another (a \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d under Section 2501(a)), the Legislature has deemed that the same evidence supports a verdict of involuntary manslaughter under Section 2504.\nIn Commonwealth v. Moore, 463 Pa. 317, 344 A.2d 850 (1975), a grand jury indicted the appellant on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter, along with the charge of involuntary manslaughter. The appellant sought consolidation of the indictments, but the case proceeded to trial only upon the murder and voluntary manslaughter charges. In announcing the judgment of this Court, Mr. Chief Justice Eagen (then Mr. Justice Eagen) wrote:\n\u201cIn those instances where an involuntary manslaughter verdict would be supported by the evidence, the failure to so acquaint the jury prevents it from operating with full knowledge of the relevant law and precludes the defendant from having a fair trial.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Moore, 463 Pa. at 322, 344 A.2d at 853. Here too, fundamental fairness demands that a charge on involuntary manslaughter, if requested, be given. The Legislature makes involuntary manslaughter a permissible verdict in a case involving an intentional criminal homicide and the \u201cfailure to so acquaint the jury prevents it from operating with full knowledge of the relevant law and precludes the defendant from having a fair trial.\u201d\nI would reverse judgment of sentence and grant appellant a new trial.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
