        "text": "OPINION\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Karen Brungard filed a complaint in trespass against appellees, Mansfield State College and John A. Hartman, a chemistry professor at the College. The complaint alleged that Brungard was injured in an explosion in a chemistry laboratory which occurred because of the negligence of appellees.\nThe Commonwealth Court dismissed the complaint against Mansfield State on the basis of sovereign immunity. In Mayle v. Pennsylvania Department of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709 (1978), we abrogated this doctrine. The order of the Commonwealth Court with respect to Mansfield State College is vacated.\nThe Commonwealth Court dismissed the complaint against appellee Hartman on the basis of \u201cofficial immunity.\u201d In DuBree v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 481 Pa. 543, 393 A.2d at 294 (1978), this Court concluded that the liability of officials of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation \u201cshould not have been analyzed solely on the basis of their status as employees of the Commonwealth.\u201d 481 Pa. at 544, 393 A.2d at 294. Rather, \u201can examination is required of whether the considerations underlying \u2018official immunity\u2019 are effectively advanced.\u201d Id. Accordingly, in DuBree, this Court stated: \u201cWhere, but for the defendant\u2019s status, a right of action would lie under analogous rules of law, and no public policy would be promoted in shielding a defendant from liability, and the plaintiff has not failed to pursue existing remedies, denial of the possibility of recovery is unjustified.\u201d Id., 481 Pa. at 546, 393 A.2d at 296. We vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint against appellee Hartman and remand for consideration in light of all the principles enunciated in DuBree.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court vacated and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMr. Justice O\u2019BRIEN and Mr. Justice POMEROY would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court as to Mansfield State College for the reasons set forth in Mayle v. Pennsylvania Department of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 407, 408, 388 A.2d 709, 720, 721 (1978) (O\u2019Brien, J., dissenting; Pomeroy, J., dissenting). In all other respects, Mr. Justice O\u2019BRIEN and Mr. Justice POMEROY join the Opinion of the Court.\nNIX, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., notes a dissent.\nWe hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 203, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.203 (Supp.1978).",
