        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nPittsburgh National Bank has tendered its resignation as corporate trustee of the on-going Frances Cahen, Phillis Heller, and Richard Heller Trusts. On the audit of Pittsburgh National\u2019s First and Transfer Accounts, the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County entered three decrees awarding Pittsburgh National a total of $27,735 in commissions on principal and $7,500 in counsel fees. We agree with settlors Frances Cahen, Phillis Heller, and Richard Heller that the express terms of their trust agreements with Pittsburgh National preclude the award of principal commissions before termination of the trusts. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of each decree awarding Pittsburgh National principal commissions. But we do not agree that the orphans\u2019 court improperly awarded Pittsburgh National counsel fees and therefore we affirm the decrees in all other respects.\nI\nIn 1939, settlors entered into separate but substantially identical \u201ctrust agreements\u201d with trustees Marcus Aaron and Pittsburgh National. Under these trust agreements, Pittsburgh National agreed to administer the trusts settlors simultaneously created. Article Twelve of the agreements fixes the corporate trustee\u2019s compensation:\n\u201cThe compensation of [Pittsburgh National], based upon the gross income collected hereunder, shall be three and one-third (3y3%) per centum, payable at the time or times the income is disbursed or invested hereunder, and upon the final termination of any trust hereunder, with respect to any part of the principal thereof, [Pittsburgh National] shall be entitled to receive additional compensation for its services hereunder upon the principal then being distributed, the amount of said compensation to be not less than one (1%) per centum nor more than three (3%) per centum of the market value of the securities and other property at the time of such distribution. It is further understood and agreed that the amount of said additional compensation for services upon distribution of principal shall be approved by and satisfactory to Marcus Aaron or his successor Trustee appointed as hereinabove set forth.\u201d\nFrom 1939 to 1956, Pittsburgh National received commissions on income for its services as corporate trustee. But beginning in 1956, Pittsburgh National attempted to renegotiate Article Twelve and thus increase its compensation. In 1958, following unsuccessful correspondence, Phillip Kerr, head of Pittsburgh National\u2019s trust department, wrote to settlors:\n\u201cConsistent with my responsibility as head of the Trust Department, the question of compensation and method of management in your trust has been brought to my attention for decision. As I hope Mr. Marshall has assured you, I too wish to assure you that our reasons for requesting an increase in compensation are based upon what we believe principles of fairness. We are nonetheless bound by the original agreement and have no choice but to comply with it unless you agree to a change.\u201d\nFor the next seventeen years, Pittsburgh National continued to serve and received only commissions on income, at the rate provided in the trust agreements.\nIn 1975, Pittsburgh National again sought to renegotiate Article Twelve. Pittsburgh National wrote to settlors that, in its view, \u201cit is now in order to place your trust on [Pittsburgh National\u2019s] then current fee schedule.\u201d The correspondence further provided: \u201cIf you disagree we will take steps to resign immediately.\u201d Settlors disagreed, and in correspondence with Pittsburgh National insisted that if Pittsburgh National \u201cis unhappy with the agreements made by its predecessor to such an extent that it has to resign, it must take the consequences.\u201d\nLike the 1956-1958 negotiations, these negotiations also did not result in alteration of the rate of compensation provided in the 1939 trust agreements. Pittsburgh National filed First and Transfer Accounts in the orphans\u2019 court, claiming more than $42,000 in commissions on principal and $7,500 in counsel fees. Pittsburgh National filed separate \u201cPetitions For Resignation and Discharge of Trustee\u201d and Petitions For Distribution, in which it asked the orphans\u2019 court to confirm the accounts absolutely, approve its resignation, and transfer the balance of the trusts to the individual trustee. In exceptions to the First and Transfer Accounts, settlors challenged Pittsburgh National\u2019s present right to commissions on principal on the ground that, under the trust agreements, no principal commissions are to be awarded until termination of the trusts.\nWhile the Auditing Judge found no justification for altering the express terms of the trust instruments, he took the view that \u201c[t]he fact that a trust agreement provides that a corporate trustee is to receive a certain per cent of principal at the termination of the trust does not bar an interim payment from principal on account.\u201d The Auditing Judge therefore awarded what he termed \u201creasonable compensation on the principal at the termination of [Pittsburgh National\u2019s] service as trustee,\u201d along with counsel fees. The orphans\u2019 court fixed the amount of \u201creasonable\u201d compensation at a pro rata share of the maximum compensation possible under the trust agreements. Both settlors and Pittsburgh National filed exceptions to the Nisi Adjudication. The orphans\u2019 court dismissed the exceptions on the opinion of the Auditing Judge and these cross-appeals followed.\nII\nSettlors contend that Pittsburgh National is entitled to principal compensation only in accordance with the terms of the trust agreements. According to settlors, the trust agreements preclude an award of commissions on principal until termination of the trusts. Settlors argue that the trust agreements do not permit Pittsburgh National, by an act of resignation while the trusts are still active, to accelerate its right to compensation on principal.\nTRUST EXPECTED DURATION YEARS SERVED PERCENTAGE\nRichard Heller 52.3 years 37.5 years 72%\nPhillis Heller 55.0 37.5 68%\nFrances Cahen 58.0 37.5 65%\nThese percentages were then multiplied by the maximum rate of compensation possible under the trust agreements upon termination of the trust:\nTRUST PERCENTAGE COMPENSATION RULE PRODUCT\nRichard Heller 72% 3% 2.16%\nPhillis Heller 68% 3% 2.04%\nFrances Cahen 65% 3% 1.95%\nThis product was then multiplied by the market value of the trust assets:\nTRUST PRODUCT MARKET VALUE COMMISSION\nRichard Heller 2.16% $456,924.55 $ 9,869.57\nPhillis Heller 2.04% 455,455.11 9,291.28\nFrances Cahen 1.95% 439,719.59 8.574.53\nTOTAL $27.735.38\nPittsburgh National responds that the trust agreements are silent regarding the corporate co-trustee\u2019s principal commissions upon resignation before termination of the trusts. Even though the trust agreements provide for payment of principal commissions \u201cupon the final termination of any trust,\u201d Pittsburgh National argues that this silence permits payment of principal commissions on resignation before final termination of the trusts. In its cross-appeal, Pittsburgh National also disagrees with the orphans\u2019 court view of \u201creasonable compensation.\u201d In seeking more than the $27,-735 the decrees of the orphans\u2019 court awarded, Pittsburgh National argues that the contracts\u2019 rate of compensation on principal need not be followed.\nUnder 20 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 7185(a) (1975), an orphans\u2019 court \u201cshall allow such compensation to the trustee as shall in the circumstances be reasonable and just . . . .\u201d Section 7185(b) states: \u201c[njeither the fact that a fiduciary\u2019s services has not ended nor the fact the trust has not ended shall be a bar to the fiduciary\u2019s receiving compensation for his services out of the principal of the trust.\u201d But Section 7185(c) provides:\n\u201cCompensation prescribed by will or other instrument.\u2014 Where the compensation of a fiduciary is expressly prescribed either by provisions of a will or deed of trust or other instrument under which he is acting or by provisions of an agreement between him and the creator of a trust, nothing in this section shall change in any way the rights of any party in interest or of the fiduciary.\u201d\nArticle Twelve of the trust agreements \u201cexpressly prescribe^]\u201d Pittsburgh National\u2019s commissions on principal. At the time settlors created their trusts, settlors and Pittsburgh National negotiated a comprehensive timetable for Pittsburgh National\u2019s compensation. Their writings provided that amounts \u201cbased upon the gross income collected\u201d would be the exclusive form of compensation during the lives of the trusts. These commissions on income were to be \u201cpayable at the time or times income is disbursed\u201d under the terms of the trust agreements. In contrast, \u201cfinal termination of any trust,\u201d not particular services, activates Pittsburgh National\u2019s right to commissions on principal. These commissions, unlike commissions on income, are \u201cadditional compensation,\u201d to be calculated \u201cat the time ... of distribution.\u201d The trusts have not yet terminated and therefore, under the express terms of the trust agreements, Pittsburgh National cannot be awarded commissions on principal.\nPittsburgh National\u2019s argument, resting upon the silence of the compensation clause on the subject of principal commissions on resignation, must be rejected. The compensation clause must be viewed in light of the entire trust agreement. See e. g., Shehadi v. Northeastern National Bank of Pennsylvania, 474 Pa. 232, 378 A.2d 304 (1977) (writing must be interpreted as a whole, giving effect to all its provisions). Article Ten of the trust agreements provides:\n\u201cThe [settlor] reserves the right to appoint by an instrument in writing to be delivered to [Pittsburgh National], co-trustee hereunder, from time to time, an individual as co-trustee to succeed Marcus Aaron as Trustee hereunder, in the event of the death or resignation of said Marcus Aaron; and the [settlor] likewise reserves the right to appoint by an instrument in writing to be delivered to said [Pittsburgh National] an individual to act as co-trustee with it whenever any co-trustee hereunder shall have died, resigned or become incapable of performing his duties. Upon the acceptance in writing by such successor, the title to the trust property shall thereupon vest in him as co-trustee with said [Pittsburgh National].\u201d\nThe parties foresaw the possibility of the individual trustee\u2019s \u201cdeath or resignation\u201d and therefore agreed to a mechanism for replacing him.\nYet the parties made no similar provision for the corporate trustee. In bargaining for and obtaining a corporate entity as a co-trustee, settlors sought and procured the services of an institution with theoretically perpetual life. As Professor Casner has observed,\n\u201c[i]f it becomes essential to change from one fiduciary to another before the fiduciary\u2019s work is completed, an interruption in the continuity of the supervision of the property results and this may be undesirable. Assurance of continuity of supervision is obtained by the selection of a corporate fiduciary.\u201d\nCasner, II Estate Planning 1161 (3d ed. 1961). Settlors were therefore assured that their trusts would be administered by an institution capable of providing continuous services to supplement those of individual trustees. Both the absence of a clause providing for replacement of the corporate co-fiduciary and the settlors\u2019 selection of a corporate entity demonstrate the parties\u2019 intent that the corporate trustee would serve until termination of the trusts. Therefore, the parties\u2019 expectations are incompatible with a clause providing the corporate trustee principal compensation on resignation.\nIn Breyer Estate, 475 Pa. 108, 379 A.2d 1305 (1977), the trustee sought principal commissions while the trusts were active, even though the trustee, in agreeing with the settlor to administer the trusts, also agreed to commissions of \u201c2% on the income as received and 1% on the principal at the termination of the trusts.\u201d This Court concluded:\n\u201c[T]he parties intended to fix the amount and the timing of payments. Income commissions were to be paid \u2018as received\u2019 and the principal commission paid \u2018at the termination of the trust.\u2019 This express agreement bars payment of interim commissions from principal.\u201d\n475 Pa. at 116, 379 A.2d at 1310. Here, as in Breyer, the parties by \u201cexpress agreement\u201d have \u201cfix[ed] the amount and the timing of payments\u201d of both income and principal commissions. Their trust instruments contain the express understanding and agreement that the corporate fiduciary would be paid principal commissions only at termination of the trusts. We therefore must agree with settlors that these express trust instruments foreclose a present award of principal commissions. A contrary conclusion would permit a corporate fiduciary, by unilateral action, to depart from the express terms of trust contracts, alter the contracts\u2019 timetable for principal commissions, and abrogate settlors\u2019 careful trust plans.\nPittsburgh National suggests that it would be \u201cinequitable\u201d to deny it commissions on principal for its years of service as corporate trustee. But it makes no claim that it has not been paid income commissions in accordance with the terms of the trust instruments. Nor does Pittsburgh National mention the burden its resignation places upon the trusts. Present payment of principal commissions contravenes the express terms of the trust agreements and thwarts settlors\u2019 express plan not to invade corpus for payment of principal commissions until termination of the trusts. Pittsburgh National\u2019s failure to serve through the lives of the trusts places settlors in a position which their 1939 agreements were designed to avoid. All these consequences are imposed by a corporate fiduciary, in which settlors justifiably placed their greatest confidence. See Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 464, 164 N.E. 545, 546 (1928) (Cardozo, J.) (\u201c[a] trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place\u201d); see also Killey Trust, 457 Pa. 474, 326 A.2d 372 (1974) (corporate fiduciary procuring appointment by representing its greater than ordinary skill held to represented standard). In these circumstances, present recovery is unjustified. Those portions of the decrees of the orphans\u2019 court awarding present payment of principal commissions must therefore be vacated.\nIll\nBecause we conclude that the trust agreements expressly foreclose present payment of commissions on principal, we must, of course, reject Pittsburgh National\u2019s argument that the orphans\u2019 court erred in not awarding it more principal commissions. We also reject settlors\u2019 contention that Pittsburgh National is not entitled to counsel fees in connection with the filing of accounts for audit. Under 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7181, \u201c[a] trustee shall file an account of his administration at the termination of the trust and may file an account at any other time.\u201d Pittsburgh National\u2019s filing of accounts upon resignation was therefore an authorized and appropriate measure. See also e. g., Band Estate, 182 Pa.Super. 8,124 A.2d 498 (1956) (resigning trustee advised to file account for audit). Pittsburgh National\u2019s accounting advanced orderly administration of these trusts. Settlors do not dispute the reasonableness of the fees and these were Pittsburgh National\u2019s first accounts. On this record, we find no basis for disturbing the orphans\u2019 court award of counsel feels for filing the accounts.\nDecrees of the orphans' court vacated insofar as they approve present award of principal commissions. In all other respects, decrees affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nPOMEROY, J., concurs in the result.\n. We hear these appeals pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), .17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp.1978). Settlors are appellants at Nos. 280, 281 and 282 March Term, 1977. Pittsburgh National is the appellant at Nos. 286, 287, and 288 March Term, 1977. In its appeal, Pittsburgh National seeks more commissions on principal than the $27,735 the orphans\u2019 court awarded. In view of our disposition, we reject this claim. See infra Part III.\n. Fidelity Trust Company was the original corporate party to the trust agreements. In 1959, Fidelity and another institution combined to form Pittsburgh National Bank and Pittsburgh National assumed Fidelity\u2019s responsibilities under the trust agreement. We refer to the corporate fiduciary as Pittsburgh National throughout this opinion.\n. Each trust agreement provides settlors income during their respective lives and power to invade principal upon disability. Upon each settlor\u2019s death, the principal of the respective trusts is to be distributed to named beneficiaries. Each settlor reserves both the right to increase principal \u201cfrom time to time\u201d and the right to revoke the trust. Since 1939, the parties have twice revised the investment powers of the co-trustees, but have not otherwise altered the 1939 trust agreements. Each trust is presently active.\n. The present individual trustee, Robert Rosenthal, did not join in these accountings and intends to continue to administer the trusts. Marcus Aaron, the individual trustee named in the trust agreements, died in 1954. Rosenthal became the individual trustee in 1975. There was no individual trustee from 1954 to 1975.\n. The Auditing Judge expressly rejected any argument that \u201ceconomic changes since 1939 [(the year the parties entered into their trust agreements)] and the change in trust procedures render the trust impossible of fulfillment or so burdensome that this court would have the power to alter the express charges set forth plainly in the trust instrument.\u201d Rather, the court held that Pittsburgh National\u2019s \u201ccompensation is clearly set forth in the Deed of Trust.\u201d\n. The Auditing Judge calculated the percentage of the life expectancy of each trust the corporate trustee served:\n. Settlors make two other arguments which, in view of our disposition, we need not address. First, settlors assert that Pittsburgh National\u2019s current attempt to recover principal commissions is a \u201creplay\u201d of the 1956-1958 negotiations. They argue that the corporate fiduciary \u201cspecifically acquiesced\u201d in settlors\u2019 understanding in 1956-1958 that no compensation on principal is payable upon resignation. Settlors state that they were \u201clulled . into a false assumption of permanency, to [settlors\u2019] detriment.\u201d According to settlors, the fiduciary is now \u201cestopped\u201d from seeking additional compensation.\nSettlors also claim that, even if Pittsburgh National were entitled to commissions on principal, the orphans\u2019 court erroneously applied a three per cent rate of principal compensation in calculating Pittsburgh National\u2019s commissions. Under the trust agreements, the parties agreed to principal commissions of \u201cnot less than one (1%) per centum nor more than three (3%) per centum. . . . \u201d But the parties further agreed that \u201cthe amount of said additional compensation for services upon distribution of principal shall be approved by and satisfactory to Marcus Aaron or his successor Trustee appointed as hereinabove set forth.\u201d Robert Rosenthal, the \u201csuccessor Trustee,\u201d see supra note 4, did not approve the three per cent rate the orphans\u2019 court applied. Still assuming that the trustee can presently recover commissions on principal, settlors conclude that the corporate co-trustee is contractually bound to a maximum of one per cent principal commissions for service through termination of the trusts, and less than one per cent for the portion actually served.\n. This legislation, enacted in 1953, applies to all trusts created both before and after 1953. E. g., Breyer Estate, 475 Pa. 108, 379 A.2d 1305 (1977) (20 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 7185 governs rights and obligations of trustee of 1934, 1954, and 1958 trusts). Section 7185 changed the common law rule which barred, absent unusual or extraordinary circumstances, a trustee\u2019s recovery of principal commissions during the life of a trust. E. g., Williamson Estate, 368 Pa. 343, 82 A.2d 49 (1951).\n. Pittsburgh National cites Reed Account, 467 Pa. 371, 357 A.2d 138 (1976), for the proposition that a trust agreement silent on principal compensation to be awarded a resigning corporate fiduciary does not foreclose an award of reasonable principal compensation. In Reed, a testator\u2019s will specified the trustee\u2019s commissions on income, but did not specify what amount was to be paid on principal. The individual trustee died before termination of the trust. We concluded that 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7185 authorized the orphans\u2019 court to award the trustee\u2019s estate principal commissions from the active trusts. Here, however, the parties\u2019 trust instruments express their agreement that the corporate trustee cannot recover principal commissions until the trust terminates, and the bargain that the corporate fiduciary would serve until termination of the trusts. On these facts, Reed is inapposite.\nOther cases Pittsburgh National cites do not support its view. In Kennedy Trust, 364 Pa. 310, 72 A.2d 124 (1950), both the estate of the deceased individual co-trustee and the corporate trustee recovered principal commissions on a portion of the corpus of the active trust which settlor and his wife had withdrawn. But, as in Reed and unlike here, no provision of the trust agreement fixed the timing of payments of principal commissions. Ehret Estate, 427 Pa. 584, 235 A.2d 414 (1967), Snyder Estate, 346 Pa. 615, 31 A.2d 132 (1943), and Bosler Estate, 161 Pa. 457, 29 A. 57 (1894) state the general rule that \u201cthe labor, care and responsibility pertaining to the conservation of the capital itself are properly a charge on it [(the capital)], and are to be deducted from it when the trust expires or the particular trustee\u2019s relation to it ends,\u201d Bosler Estate, 161 Pa. at 462, 29 A. at 60, but do not involve instances where \u201cthe particular trustee\u2019s relations to it ends.\u201d Finally, McCaskey Estate, 307 Pa. 172, 160 A. 707 (1932), states the above rule in a case where a testator\u2019s will was read to authorize payment of commissions, to a resigning individual co-trustee, on the corpus from accruing income. The trust agreements in the present case, however, contain express provisions that principal commissions are to be paid only upon termination of the trusts.\n. Neither Pittsburgh National nor the orphans\u2019 court expressly rely upon a theory of \u201cunjust enrichment,\u201d and on this theory, these decrees could not stand. Pittsburgh National bargained with settlors and agreed to perform through the termination of the trusts under a specified timetable of compensation, but now has chosen not to adhere to the bargain. Pittsburgh National is therefore a \u201cbreaching plaintiff.\u201d Assuming that a breaching fiduciary may recover in unjust enrichment, recovery could be justified only if the requirements set forth in Section 357 of the Restatement of Contracts (1932) were satisfied.\nSection 357 provides:\n\u201cRESTITUTION IN FAVOR OF A PLAINTIFF WHO IS HIMSELF IN DEFAULT\n(1) Where the defendant fails or refuses to perform his own contract and is justified therein by the plaintiffs own breach of duty or non-performance of a condition, but the plaintiff has rendered a part performance under the contract that is a net benefit to the defendant, the plaintiff can get judgment, except as stated in Subsection (2), for the amount of such benefit in excess of the harm that he has caused to the defendant by his own breach, in no case exceeding a ratable proportion of the agreed compensation, if\n(a) the plaintiffs breach or non-performance is not wilful and deliberate; or\n(b) the defendant, with knowledge of the plaintiffs breach of duty or non-performance of condition has occurred or will thereafter occur, assents to the rendition of the part performance, or accepts the benefit of it, or retains property received although its return in specie is still not unreasonably difficult or injurious.\u201d\n* * * # * *\nEven assuming that the prerequisites set forth in subsections (l)(a) or (l)(b) were satisfied here, Pittsburgh National still has not demonstrated that the trusts have incurred a \u201cnet benefit ... in excess of the harm that he has caused to the defendant by his own breach.\u201d Moreover, a present showing of \u201cexcess benefit\u201d would require speculation concerning both the value of services rendered and \u201charm caused\u201d to settlors. As comment g to Section 357 points out, \u201c[t]he plaintiffs right to restitution is merely to the excess of benefit received over the harm suffered. It is necessary for the plaintiff to show with a reasonable degree of certainty that there is an excess and its amount, in order to get judgment.\u201d",
