        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThe Local Tax Enabling Act authorizes the City of Pittsburgh to \u201clevy, assess and collect\u201d taxes upon \u201cpersons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property,\u201d but denies the City the authority to tax \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d Pursuant to the Act, the City imposes a \u201cBusiness Privilege Tax.\u201d Appellants, radio and television broadcasters, brought an action in equity, alleging they are \u201cmanufacturers\u201d not subject to the City\u2019s tax. Appellants sought to enjoin the City from collecting its Business Privilege Tax upon their revenues. The chancellor concluded that appellants are \u201cmanufacturers\u201d and enjoined collection of the tax. On the City\u2019s appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed. We granted allowance of appeal and now affirm.\nI\nThroughout these proceedings, appellants have maintained that they \u201cder\u00edve their revenues from those who seek to convey commercial messages to the public in the same fashion that the newspapers derived their advertising receipts from those who buy space in their newspapers.\u201d Our task is to determine whether the activity which produces appellants\u2019 revenues is \u201cmanufacturing\u201d for purposes of the Local Tax Enabling Act. The Legislature provides no definition of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d for purposes of the Act, and this Court has not yet considered the term as used in the Act. But \u201c[t]his definitional vacuum has been filled by a judicial definition of the term which has emerged from a long line of cases extending back over a hundred years\u2019 time.\u201d Commonwealth v. Deitch Co., 449 Pa. 88, 92, 295 A.2d 834, 837 (1972) (discussing \u201cCapital Stock Tax\u201d Act). Deitch summarizes the \u201cjudicial definition\u201d that has \u201cemerged\u201d from our \u201clong line of cases:\u201d\n\u201c \u2018The meaning of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d has been restated by this Court in Philadelphia School District v. Parent Metal Products, Inc., 402 Pa. 361, 364, 167 A.2d 257, 258-59 (1961): \u201c \u2018Manufacturing\u2019 as used in a legislative enactment is given its ordinary, and general meaning) It consists in the application of labor or skill to material whereby the original article is changed into a new, different and useful article: Commonwealth v. Weiland Packing Company, 292 Pa. 447, 449, 141 A. 148 (1928); Pittsburgh v. Electric Welding Company, 394 Pa. 60, 145 A.2d 528 (1958). Whether or not an article is a manufactured product depends upon whether or not it has gone through a substantial transformation in form, qualities and adaptability in use from the original material, so that a new article or creation has emerged: General Foods Corp. v. Pittsburgh, 383 Pa. 244, 118 A.2d 572 (1955). If there is merely a superficial change in the original materials, without any substantial and well signalized transformation in form, qualities and adaptability in use, it is not a new article or new production: Commonwealth v. Wei-land, supra; Pittsburgh Electric Welding Co., supra.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nCommonwealth v. Deitch Co., 449 Pa. at 93-94, 295 A.2d at 837, quoting Commonwealth v. Berlo Vending Co., 415 Pa. 101, 104, 202 A.2d 94, 96 (1964).\nDeitch demonstrates that \u201cmerely a superficial change in the original materials, without any substantial and well signalized transformation in form, qualities and adaptability in use,\u201d is not \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d In Deitch, this Court held that a scrap metal dealer is not entitled to the \u201cmanufacturing\u201d exemption under the Capital Stock Tax Act. \u201c[AJppellant does begin and end with scrap or junk metal. It adds nothing to the mass as it arrives at the . yard, but rather subtracts by cleaning away unwanted elements. . . . [T]he legal reality is that the transformation is merely superficial since the steel contained therein remains totally unchanged as a result of this activity.\u201d Deitch, 449 Pa. at 97, 295 A.2d at 839.\nSeveral other cases of this Court illustrate that \u201cmanufacturing\u201d involves more than \u201cmerely a superficial change.\u201d For example, in Berio Vending, supra, a company mixed \u201cpopcorn\u201d kernels, coconut oil, and salt and heated the mixture until the kernels \u201cpopped,\u201d \u201cincreasing the volume of each kernel from 30 to 36 times its original size.\u201d Berlo Vending, 415 Pa. at 103, 202 A.2d at 95. Merchantable \u201cpopped\u201d corn was placed in bags and shipped in the company\u2019s trucks to the company\u2019s concession stands in movie theatres and other places of entertainment. This Court denied the company \u201cmanufacturing\u201d status for purposes of the Capital Stock Tax Act: \u201c[Ajlthough there is a change in form, the kernel of corn is expanded to many times its original size and with the addition of some oil and salt, such change is merely superficial.\u201d Id., 415 Pa. at 105, 202 A.2d at 96. In Commonwealth v. Sunbeam Water Co., 284 Pa. 180, 130 A. 405 (1925), a corporation which subjected ordinary water to heat, converted the water to steam, and condensed the steam to obtain distilled water did not \u201cmanufacture.\u201d This Court observed: \u201cThe distilled water produced by the [corporation] is subjected to certain additional refinements in cleansing it of impurities, but in its main essentials the process is the boiling of it to the point where it becomes steam and cooling it back to water.\u201d Id., 284 Pa. at 181-82, 130 A. at 406. And in General Foods Corp. v. Pittsburgh, 383 Pa. 244, 118 A.2d 572 (1955), this Court concluded that \u201cdecaffeinated and instant coffee, tapioca, and certain canned products\u201d were not manufactured. \u201cNone of those articles is a manufactured product, not having gone through a substantial transformation in form, qualities, and adaptability in use so that a new article or creation has emerged.\u201d Id., 383 Pa. at 251-52, 118 A.2d at 576.\nII\nRealistically viewed, appellants are not \u201cmanufacturers\u201d in the common and approved usage of that term. Advertisers produce and record, either in transcript or on film, virtually all of the commercial messages appellants broadcast. Appellants\u2019 announcers read transcribed materials into electronic microphones and appellants\u2019 technicians project light through filmed materials and onto a surface from which an electrical signal can be extracted. Appellants then amplify and radiate the resulting electronic signals on appellants\u2019 exclusive, governmentally assigned wavelengths. Like the popcorn company which converts popcorn kernels into popcorn and markets the converted product, the firm which distills water, and the company which markets its decaffeinated and instant coffees, appellants effect \u201cmerely a superficial change in the original materials.\u201d See also Assessors of Springfield v. Commissioners of Corporations and Taxations, 321 Mass; 186, 72 N.E.2d 528 (1947) (conversion of human sound into electrical impulses for use in telephone system not manufacturing). Any changes appellants effectuate are geared to appellants\u2019 own transmitting equipment, and do not produce \u201ca new, different and useful article.\u201d Deitch, supra. As President Judge Bowman correctly summarized,\n\u201cthe essential function of broadcasting is the transmission rather than the manufacture of visual and sound information. While broadcasting certainly makes that information more useful and useable, there are many processing functions that do likewise but do not result in the manufacture of a product.\u201d\nGolden Triangle Broadcasting, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 31 Pa.Cmwlth. 547, 563, 377 A.2d 839, 847 (1977) (footnote omitted). See Commonwealth ex rel. Luckett v. WLEXTV, Inc., 438 S.W.2d 520 (Ky.1968).\nIt is true that appellants devote substantial energies to the procurement, scheduling, editing, and transmission of the many programs ultimately viewed and heard by their television and radio audiences. Indeed, a portion of these programs, including news broadcasts, are produced in appellants\u2019 stations. But to determine appellants\u2019 Business Privilege Tax liability on the basis of these activities would be to ignore economic realities. See e. g., Commonwealth v. Arrott Mills Co., 145 Pa. 69, 74, 22 A. 243, 243 (1891) (\u201cthe corporation must be measured not by what it calls itself, but what it does\u201d). Through program selection, production, and scheduling, appellants provide advertisers access to a consumer market with predictable characteristics. Just as in Arrott, supra, where this Court concluded that a corporation generating steam power for commercial tenants of the corporation\u2019s buildings is not a \u201cmanufacturer,\u201d but rather a \u201clandlord supplying its tenants with steam-power in order to enable it the more readily to rent its buildings and rooms,\u201d 145 Pa. at 74, 22 A. at 243, appellants\u2019 program selection and production activities serve to enhance the value of the air time they offer advertisers.\nIll\nWe are mindful that the Tax Enabling Act withholds from the City the authority to tax \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d and doubts concerning the status of appellants\u2019 activity are to be construed in favor of appellants and against the City. See Fischer v. Pittsburgh, 383 Pa. 138, 142, 118 A.2d 157, 159 (1955) (\u201c[a]ny doubt . . . concerning the construction of the [\u201cTax Anything Act\u201d (predecessor of Tax Enabling Act)] must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer and against the city\u201d). But in view of the common and approved usage of the term \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d see supra note 7, our many cases requiring more than a \u201csuperficial change in the original materials,\u201d and of course, the overriding presumption that \u201cthe General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable,\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(1) (Supp.1978), it must be concluded, upon a proper view of the record, that appellants are not engaged in \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d The Commonwealth Court correctly reversed the chancellor\u2019s decree.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joined.\nMr. Justice O\u2019BRIEN and Former Justice POMEROY did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, \u00a7 2, 53 P.S. \u00a7 6902 (1972).\n. Section 2 of the Act provides in part:\n\u201c[L]ocal authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this act:\ns|c * * # # #\n(4) To levy, assess and collect a tax on goods and articles manufactured in such political subdivisions or on the by-products of manufacture, . . or on any privilege, act or transaction related to the business of manufacturing, ... by manufacturers . with respect to the goods, articles and products of their own manufacture . . . .\u201d\n. Appellants include Golden Triangle Broadcasting, Inc., Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., WIIC--TV Corp., and WKJF FM, Inc.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellant Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1978). According to the City, this Court is not presented with a \u201cfinal order\u201d for purposes of Section 204(a) of the Act. The Commonwealth Court reversed the chancellor on statutory grounds and remanded for consideration of appellants\u2019 alleged grounds for relief the chancellor did not reach. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s order decides a question which at least \u201ctwo justices of [this] Court,\u201d id., deemed deserving of further review. No further proceedings involving this question are contemplated by the order of the Commonwealth Court, and we view the order \u201cfinal.\u201d\n. Brief for Appellants 65. When asked, \u201cWhat is it you sell?,\u201d G. Edward Wallis, Regional Vice-President of one of appellant-broadcasters, summarized, \u201cWe sell advertising.\u201d Record at 58a. In their complaint, appellants identify the \u201cprimary source of sustaining revenue as payments for advertising and commercial messages.\u201d Id. at 7a.\n. Act of June 1, 1889, P.L. 420, \u00a7\u00a7 21 et seq., formerly 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1871 et seq. (1949), repealed, Tax Reform Code of 1971, Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 92, \u00a7 605, 72 P.S. \u00a7 7605 (Supp. 1978). The Capital Stock Tax Act and the Tax Enabling Act are two of several taxing statutes which accord \u201cmanufacturing\u201d special status, but do not define the term. See also, e. g., \u201cTax Anything Act,\u201d Act of June 25, 1947, P.L. 1145, as amended, Act of May 9, 1949, P.L. 898, formerly 53 P.S. \u00a7 6851, repealed, Tax Enabling Act, \u00a7 23, 53 P.S. \u00a7 6923; Local \u201cMercantile License Tax\u201d Act, Act of June 20, 1947, P.L. 745, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 582.1 et seq. (1962). This Court\u2019s decisions interpreting \u201cmanufacturing\u201d for purposes of a particular taxing statute draw upon \u201cmanufacturing\u201d cases under the several statutes. Indeed, in General Foods Corp. v. Pittsburgh, 383 Pa. 244, 118 A.2d 572 (1955), this Court analyzed \u201cmanufacturing\u201d under the \u201cTax Anything Act\u201d and the Local \u201cMercantile License Tax\u201d Act together, citing cases under both statutes (Armour & Co. v. Pittsburgh, 363 Pa. 109, 69 A.2d 405 (1949) (\u201cTax Anything Act\u201d and Local \u201cMercantile License Tax\u201d Act); Rieck-McJunkin Dairy Co. v. Pittsburgh Sch. Dist., 362 Pa. 13, 66 A.2d 295 (1949) (Local \u201cMercantile License Tax\u201d Act)) and the now-repealed State Mercantile License Tax Act, Act of May 2, 1899, P.L. 184, formerly 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2621 et seq. (Commonwealth v. Weiland Packing Co., 292 Pa. 447, 141 A. 148 (1928)).\n. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903(a) (Supp.1978) (\u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage\u201d); see also First Data Corp. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, Mass., 357 N.E.2d 933, 935 (1976) (\u201c[a]s the [Massachusetts taxing] statute does not itself effectively define \u2018manufacturing,\u2019 . [Massachusetts] Legislature should be supposed to have adopted the common meaning of the word, as assisted by a consideration of the historical origins of the enactment\u201d).\n. Many other cases of this Court are in accord. In Commonwealth v. Denston Felt & Hair Co., 304 Pa. 536, 156 A. 164 (1931), a corporation purchased hair from a tannery, washed and dried the hair, baled some of the cleaned product for upholstering and other commercial purposes, and made felt from the rest. This Court agreed with the Commonwealth that, \u201cdown to the point where the cleaned hair is ready for use by defendant company in the actual manufacture of felt, the processes detailed \u2018are nothing more than washing, drying, cleaning and assorting the hair.\u2019 A portion not used by defendant is sold, but when sold it is still hair. Its form has not changed. It had undergone nothing more than a cleansing process and has not been transformed into a new product. The sole difference between the washed article and the raw product is that the former is more free from dirt and other objectionable matter.\u201d Denston, 304 Pa. at 538, 156 A. at 165. Commonwealth v. Weiland Packing Co., 292 Pa. 447, 141 A. 148 (1928), denied a \u201cmanufacturing\u201d exemption to a corporation with cut, cured, and smoked \u201chams\u201d from the carcasses of slaughtered animals. Accord, Armour & Co. v. Pittsburgh, 363 Pa. 109, 69 A.2d 405 (1949). Similarly, in Commonwealth v. LowryRodgers Co., 279 Pa. 361, 123 A. 855 (1924), this Court found no manufacturing where a company cleaned coffee beans, removed their outer skins, and roasted the beans, even though the beans changed color, weighed less, and increased in size.\n. Advertisers produce 97% of television commercials and 98.5% of radio commercials, while two per cent of television commercials and one-half of one per cent of radio commercials are produced by advertising agencies using broadcasters\u2019 facilities. Record at 257a. One per cent of both television and radio advertisements are produced by broadcasters. Id. Appellants do not argue that revenues derived from their production of one per cent of advertisements should be segregated as revenues from manufacturing, see generally Commonwealth v. Interstate Amiesite Corp., 412 Pa. 180, 184, 194 A.2d 191, 194 (1963) (\u201c[t]he segregation of a taxpayer\u2019s activities for the purposes of taxation under the pertinent statute is proper and reasonable\u201d), and we do not decide whether production of these advertisements constitutes manufacturing.\n. The record identifies \u201ctapes\u201d as an additional medium from which electronic signals are extracted. Record at 131a-132a. Radio broadcasters, for example, receive tape-recorded commercial messages from advertisers and also record transcribed messages onto tapes for repeated use. Id.\n. Section 602 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 6, 72 P.S. \u00a7 7602 (Supp.1978), now exempts from capital stock tax the stock of companies \u201corganized for manufacturing, processing, research or development purposes.\u201d While the Act provides no definition of \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d it does define \u201cprocessing.\u201d It should be noted that the Legislature includes in \u201cprocessing\u201d the activity of \u201cbroadcasting radio and television programs by licensed commercial or educational stations.\u201d Tax Reform Code of 1971, \u00a7 602(c)(ll), 72 P.S. \u00a7 7602(c)(ll).\n. In reviewing the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order, we are not presented with the question whether any of appellants\u2019 non-advertising, revenue-producing activities constitute \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d Appellants neither sought nor obtained partial relief from that portion of the City\u2019s tax imposed upon revenues derived from non-advertising activities. Rather, throughout these proceedings, appellants maintain that their entire operation is not subject to tax.\n. Appellants rely upon City of Pittsburgh v. Pittsburgh Press Co., 14 Pa.Cmwlth. 551, 322 A.2d 390 (1974), in which the Commonwealth Court before decision in this case held that a newspaper\u2019s advertising revenues are not subject to the City\u2019s tax. Pittsburgh Press was not a holding of this Court and the issue presented there is not before us.",

Prior to the hearing of this appeal I might not have thought of \u201cbroadcasting\u201d as \u201cmanufacturing\u201d had the question been raised in general dinner conversation. In this appeal, however, we are called upon to consider the meaning of the word \u201cmanufacturing\u201d by litigants who are entitled to have the same definition applied to them as has been applied to past litigants. Fairness requires that we apply a given definition uniformly to all those who claim the benefit of the manufacturing exemption. The Legislature has not provided a definition. If this were a case of first impression the word might be considered so vague or elusive in definition that it would be given no legal effect. As the opinions of Mr. Justice Roberts and Mr. Justice Larsen point out, however, this Court has given legal definition to the term \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d Having done so, that definition should be controlling.

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. \u201cManufacturing\u201d, as noted by the majority, consists of the application of labor or skill to raw materials such that the materials undergo a \u201csubstantial transformation in form, qualities and adaptability in use . . . .\u201d and are changed thereby into a new and different article. Commonwealth v. Deitch, 449 Pa. 88, 93, 295 A.2d 834, 837 (1972). However, the majority has misapprehended the nature of appellants\u2019 broadcasting activities and has, therefore, incorrectly concluded that appellants are not manufacturers.\nThe Chancellor made the following findings:\n\u201cThe extensive record in this case provides ample support for the proposition that plaintiffs are engaged in manufacturing as that term has been construed by courts. In the broadcast of a TV program, optical information is changed into an electrical signal which is modified in many ways by the application of extremely complex technology. That electrical signal is eventually encoded and placed on the broadcaster\u2019s carrier and sent out to be received by a receiving set, decoded and put into such a state as to be viewed by the ultimate consumer. That which occurs in the television studio before the cameras may be viewed only by those who are in actual visual contact within the television studio, and nothing is available for the benefit of the consuming public until the highly technical process of transforming optical information into an electrical signal and back has been completed by the application of skill and labor, which results in a new, different and useful product. The same thing may be said of the radio broadcasting activities of plaintiffs. There, accoustical energy is changed to an electrical signal and made into a useful product.\nWhat has been here said concerning the manufacturing character of the operations of plaintiffs is true whether the material is produced originally in the broadcasting studio or comes to it by network feed. ... In each case, however, a manufacturing process occurs. Network feeds must be picked up when transmitted, monitored, taped and prepared for rebroadcast at the particular time that they are to be carried on the air. Each such network feed goes through the process of transformation which occurs when live programing occurs. No matter which form of news or entertainment or feature or sports is being broadcast, the chancellor is convinced that a manufacturing process occurs. One need only read the testimony of the witnesses to establish the highly technical nature of the transformation which must occur between the origination of the material and its consumption by the viewing or listening consumer even if his technical education is insufficient to establish a full understanding of the scientific nuances of the process.\u201d 74 D. & C.2d 156, 162, 165-66 (1976) (emphasis added).\nMy review of the record confirms that, no matter what the source of the broadcast (i. e., whether live studio broadcasts, videotape, film or network feed), a substantial transformation of materials does occur. The record establishes that light or sound energy from the various sources are transformed by the use of labor, skill and complex machinery into electricity in the form of electrical signals, which are then amplified, shaped, modulated and further transformed through various processes into electromagnetic waves. These electromagnetic waves are then impressed upon, and combined with, a \u201ccarrier wave\u201d so that they can be transmitted in a new and useful form, namely television or radio waves. A substantial metamorphosis occurs in both the form and quality of the materials used in the broadcasting operation \u2014 indeed, the transformation must occur before the materials can be of any use to the viewer or listener. Under the Deitch definition, therefore, appellants\u2019 broadcasting activities are \u201cmanufacturing\u201d for purposes of the Local Tax Enabling Act.\nFurther, a proper application of the appropriate standard of appellate review compels the conclusion that appellants are manufacturers. Since the Local Tax Enabling Act imposes a limitation on the authority of the City to tax \u201cmanufacturing\u201d, any doubts concerning the status of appellants\u2019 activity must be resolved in favor of appellants. Fischer v. Pittsburgh, 383 Pa. 138, 142, 118 A.2d 157, 159 (1955). Apparently, the majority has no doubts. In my opinion, however, the evidence produced in the case is more than sufficient to raise doubt regarding appellants\u2019 status as a manufacturer. Fischer requires us to resolve that doubt by finding appellants\u2019 activities to be manufacturing. Therefore, the City is without authority to tax appellants\u2019 revenues.\nFinally, it is important to remember that the limitation placed by the legislature on the City\u2019s authority to tax is intended to encourage the growth of manufacturing in this Commonwealth. The courts, in their development of standards for determining whether or not a particular enterprise is engaged in manufacturing, should be concerned with achieving that legislative objective. To that end, the standards must be flexible and the courts must be willing to adapt the standards to comport with rapid technological and scientific progress. As research and development in countless areas produces techniques and processes that may have been hitherto unheard of, we must not rigidly bind ourselves to outmoded concepts. That we cannot physically grasp or feel the product of the broadcaster\u2019s manufacturing process does not mean manufacturing has not taken place. As the \u201cStar Trek\u201d era is ushered into our lives, this Court must be prepared to keep its perspectives progressive and its definitions flexible, or else this Commonwealth will fail to acquire modern, technological manufacturing operations.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. This opinion was also shared by the Chancellor and by Judges Rogers and Crumlish dissenting in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision.",
