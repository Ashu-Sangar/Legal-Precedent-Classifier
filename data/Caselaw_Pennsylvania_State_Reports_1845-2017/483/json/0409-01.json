        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellee George David Mason was arrested and brought to trial on several charges, including alteration of a firearm in violation of section 6117 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6117. After the Commonwealth presented its case to the jury, the trial court sustained appellee\u2019s demurrer to all charges. The court held, with respect to the alteration charge, that the Commonwealth had not introduced evidence on each element of the offense sufficient to prove appellee\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt under section 6117 and, alternatively, that the \u201cpresumption\u201d of section 6117(b) is arbitrary and therefore violates due process. The Commonwealth appeals only the demurrer to the alteration charge. We affirm the demurrer on the ground that insufficient evidence was introduced to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant violated section 6117 of the Crimes Code. In light of our holding, we do not address the constitutionality of the presumption. Mt. Lebanon v. County Bd. of Elections, 470 Pa. 317, 322, 368 A.2d 648, 650 (1977).\nThe parties have submitted an agreed statement of record. See Pa.R.A.P. 1924. They agree that on November 17, 1976, appellee, then a police officer with the Nether Providence Police Department of Delaware County, sold to a United States Treasury Department undercover agent a .32 caliber revolver. At the time of the sale, appellee noted that the gun\u2019s serial numbers had been removed. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that the gun had been manufactured in the 1930s or 1940s. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness testified that he could not determine when the gun\u2019s serial numbers had been obliterated.\nTo establish its case, the Commonwealth relies on the \u201cpresumption\u201d in section 6117(b) of the Crimes Code. Section 6117 of the Crimes Code provides:\n\u201cAltering or obliterating marks of identification.\n(a) Offense defined. \u2014 No person shall change, alter, remove, or obliterate the name of the maker, model, manufacturer\u2019s number, or other mark of identification on any firearm.\n(b) Presumption. \u2014 Possession of any firearm, upon which any such mark shall have been changed, altered, removed, or obliterated, shall be prima facie evidence that the possessor has changed, altered, removed, or obliterated the same.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth properly notes that the use of the term \u201cpresumption\u201d in section 6117(b) does not settle its intended legal effect. The Model Penal Code provides that statutory presumptions establishing crimes or elements of a crime, create inferences, not rebuttable presumptions:\n\u201c[W]hen there is evidence of the facts which give rise to the presumption, the issue of the existence of the presumed fact must be submitted to the jury, unless the Court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly negatives the presumed fact. . . . \u201d\nAmerican Law Institute, Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.12. Accord, 9 Wigmore \u00a7 2513 (3d ed. 1940); McCormick, Evidence (2d ed. 1972) \u00a7 346 (\u201cBoth the right of the defendant to trial by jury and his right to have the prosecution prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt are constitutionally protected. A rule that shifted the burden of producing evidence with regard to an element so as to require the jury to find against the defendant in the absence of rebutting evidence or that required that the defendant persuade the jury of the non-existence of such an element would violate both these rights\u201d); F.R.Ev. 303(b) (Proposed). We have held that, \u201cvirtually all so-called 'criminal presumptions\u2019 are really no more than permissible inferences.\u201d Commonwealth v. DiFrancesco, 458 Pa. 188, 193, 329 A.2d 204, 208 (1974). We adopt the position argued by the Commonwealth that \u00a7 6117(b) creates a permissible inference.\nTo avoid a demurrer in a criminal prosecution, the Commonwealth must come forward with evidence which establishes beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime charged. Commonwealth v. Turner, 456 Pa. 116, 317 A.2d 298 (1974); Commonwealth v. Shaffer, 447 Pa. 91, 288 A.2d 727 (1972). There is no dispute that the Commonwealth established that the defendant on November 17,1976, was in possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, however, is not the crime. Rather, under \u00a7 6117(a), the offense is \u201cobliteration.\u201d To avoid a demurrer on the facts of this case, the \u201cpresumed\u201d or inferred fact of obliteration must follow beyond a reasonable doubt from possession.\nIn Shaffer, this Court considered a due process attack upon an inference that one in possession of stolen property is the thief of that property. This Court analyzed whether the inferred fact of theft \u201cmore likely than not\u201d follows from possession of stolen goods. The Court looked to,\n\u201cthe lapse of time between the crime [of theft] and the discovery of the property; the type and kind of property; the amount and volume of the property; and the ease [with] which it may be assimilated into trade channels.\u201d\nId., 447 Pa. at 109, 288 A.2d at 737. While here we must assess a statutory inference against the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard, the Shaffer criteria are equally apposite. Both analyses examine the likelihood that presumed facts flow from established facts; the sole difference is that on the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard, the likelihood must be greater than on the due process \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d standard.\nOn this test, it cannot be concluded that 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6117(b) establishes the Commonwealth\u2019s case. No evidence was introduced indicating when the crime of obliteration occurred. Nor was evidence presented establishing when or the circumstances in which appellee came into possession of the firearm. The Commonwealth presented no evidence that appellee had the technical capacity to effect the crime with which he was charged. Indeed, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness testified that obliteration may have occurred over forty-five years ago. In these circumstances it is at least as reasonable to suppose that appellee, a law enforcement official, in the course of his official duties came upon and acquired the weapon in an already altered condition as it is to conclude appellee obliterated the serial numbers after he came into possession. As the trial court observed, \u201cto apply subsection (b) of \u00a7 6117 under the facts of this case would be to allow an arbitrary and tenuous inference be drawn without indicia of validity in logic or reason or experience.\u201d\nOrder of the court of common pleas affirmed.\nO\u2019BRIEN, J., and Former Justice POMEROY, did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(9), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(9) (Supp.1978). The Attorney General was given notice of the decision holding \u00a7 6117(b) unconstitutional, see Pa.R.Civ.P. 235(a), but has chosen not to appear.\n. \u201cA rebuttable presumption is a means by which a rule of substantive law is invoked to force the trier of fact to reach a given conclusion, once the facts constituting its hypothesis are established, absent contrary evidence. An inference is no more than a logical tool enabling the trier of fact to proceed from one fact to another, if the trier believes that the weight of the evidence and the more experiential accuracy of the inference warrant so doing. . Moreover, an inference does not shift the burden of persuasion or relieve the Commonwealth of the burden of proving every essential element of the alleged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Com monwealth v.
