        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nThis is a direct appeal from judgments of sentence entered upon July 10, 1975, jury verdicts finding appellant guilty of robbery, 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3701 (1973) (amended 1976), and first degree murder (felony murder), id. \u00a7 2502(a) (1973) (amended to second degree in 1974). Appellant has raised the following allegations:\n(1) the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict of felony murder;\n(2) the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the offense of robbery were erroneous;\n(3) the trial court improperly expressed his personal opinion to the jury as to the degree of criminal homicide that would be appropriate based upon the evidence at trial.\nWe have carefully considered appellant\u2019s first two contentions and find them to be without merit. As to appellant\u2019s final allegation of trial error, we note, as does appellee, that appellant raised this point of error for the first time on appeal. Therefore, the question has not been preserved for our review. See Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975).\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction is based upon section 202(1) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970. 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1978-79), superseded by 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 722(1) (1978 Pamphlet, part I).",
