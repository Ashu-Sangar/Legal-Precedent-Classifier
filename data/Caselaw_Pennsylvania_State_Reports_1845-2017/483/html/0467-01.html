Laffey of a magistrate court of the City of Pittsburgh for preliminary hearings on various misdemeanor <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>charges. Relators were held for court and released on bail. Relators then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, naming their bonding company and its agents as defendants. The court of common pleas on September 25, 1975, directed the Commonwealth to respond and not to present relators’ case to the grand jury until further order of the Court. On November 7, 1975, the court issued an order permitting the City to intervene. After a hearing, the court of common pleas, by opinion and order of October 5, 1977, held that the Constitution of 1968 abolished Pittsburgh magistrate courts and that no magistrate appointed after the adoption of the 1968 Constitution is a judicial officer. Magistrate Laffey was appointed after this time and the court therefore ordered the discharge of relators. The Commonwealth and the City of Pittsburgh appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Their principal procedural objection is that relators’ bailment leaves them without standing to challenge the court’s jurisdiction. Further, appellants contend that the power of a court may be challenged only in a quo warranto proceeding and that petitioners have no remedy since quo warranto relief is exclusively prospective. On the merits, appellants argue that Pittsburgh magistrate courts were preserved by the Constitution of 1968, and are provided for by law.</p>

At the same time, section 12(a) unconditionally empowers those in office on January 1, 1970 to serve out their terms. But appellees’ interpretation also forces one to read the first sentence of section 21 as allowing “grandfathered” magistrates to continue in office only as long as not “otherwise provided by law,” and, thus, places a condition on their power to serve out their terms of office despite the clear language of Schedule Section 12(a) to the contrary. Appellants’ interpretation of section 21 avoids a self-contradictory reading of the Constitution. “Grandfathered” magistrates, on their reading, are protected by section 12. Further, appellants argue that the language of section 21 of the Judicial Schedule contemplates that City of Pittsburgh magistrate courts may be eliminated by law, .without constitutional amendment. On appellants’ reading, those serving at a later date as Pittsburgh magistrates, should their jurisdiction ever be affected by law, will not be protected by the provisions of section 12.</p>
