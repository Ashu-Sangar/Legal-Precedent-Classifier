Johnson, Thomas Kearney, and John Chmill, left the state store at 704 Larimer Avenue, Pittsburgh, where they were employed, and proceeded to Kearney’s automobile which was parked a short distance away. As they entered the vehicle and Johnson attempted to close the passenger front door, he was precluded from doing so by a shotgun which was stuck into the car by one John Gates. Gates and Robin Bey, who were outside the car on the passenger’s side, then began to demand money from Johnson and his two companions. The three tried to explain they had no money from the state store, and Johnson began to push Gates away from the car and to close the door. A few seconds later, a handgun was stuck in the passenger door by Bey, who said: “Don’t move or I will blow you away.” Within another few seconds, Bey fired the handgun at Johnson fatally wounding him. Reuben Peoples, who was outside the car on the driver’s side, then demanded and received the car keys from Kearney, who was in the driver’s seat. Peoples handed the keys to Willis, who was also on the driver’s side of the car, and Willis opened the trunk of the car. Willis then informed the others “there was nothing there,” and the four fled on foot.</p>

Gates initially told police he was in the company of Willis the previous night at a location other than where the crimes occurred. As a result of this information from Gates, Officers Carter and Diggs were dispatched to Willis’ residence.

Willis testified at the suppression hearing that, when placed in room 222, Officer Carter advised him of his rights; that he told Carter he wanted counsel; and, that this request was ignored. Willis reasons that, since Officer Carter did not testify at the suppression hearing, his testimony that he requested counsel of Carter was uncontradicted, and that the Commonwealth thus failed to meet its burden of proving an effective waiver of his right to counsel during the police questioning. Willis also testified that moments later, when he was advised of his rights by Officer Freeman, he again requested counsel, and that his request was ignored. Officer Freeman specifically contradicted this testimony. In support of his argument, Willis cites <em>Commonwealth v.

The court’s finding that Willis never requested counsel from either Carter or Freeman has support in the record because Freeman specifically contradicted Willis’ testimony as to requesting counsel from Freeman, and because the testimony, taken as a whole, clearly supports an inference of fact that Willis never requested counsel from Carter. This is so because the testimony shows Carter, prior to terminating all contact with Willis, never considered him a suspect, only an alibi witness. Furthermore, the court’s finding that Willis’ testimony, that he requested counsel from Carter, is not to be credited is supported by the testimony which indicates he was warned of his rights on numerous other occasions but never requested counsel, and by other testimony which directly contradicts certain portions of Willis’ testimony. Finally, the suppression court, since it hears the testimony and views the witnesses, passes on credibility.</p>

First, the testimony showed Carter was detailed to deal with Willis as an alibi witness; hence, he would not have had any reason to warn him of his rights as testified to by Willis. Second, the record shows Carter did not learn Willis had been implicated until after he and Carter had arrived at the Public Safety Building, and Carter had turned Willis over to Freeman’s charge. Third, Willis testified he requested counsel from Freeman very shortly after requesting it from Carter; yet, Freeman specifically contradicted Willis as to this. Finally, on numerous other occasions, Willis was warned of his rights but did not request counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Accordingly, the record, read as a whole, contradicts Willis’ testimony that he requested counsel from Carter.
