Bertolet, and his son by a previous marriage, William H. Bertolet. Under the will executed on June 25, 1962, Clarence bequeathed to his wife the household furnishings and other personalty. To his son he bequeathed all his personal effects, including his jewelry, and “all stock in excess of 485V2 shares of the Laurel Soap Company . . ..” Testator placed the residue of his estate into two trusts and named his executors, William H. Bertolet and Frankford Trust Company, as trustees. Trust “A,” for the benefit of testator’s wife, was to consist of that portion of the value of his estate which, when added to the value of the specific bequest to her, would achieve the maximum federal estate tax deduction under the law applicable at his death. The balance of the estate was to be placed in Trust “B” for testator’s son. Testator’s will also included a clause directing that all death taxes be paid from the residuary estate.</p>

The court en banc concluded, however, that the amendment to section 3703(a) deprived testator of the power to relieve her share of federal <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>estate taxes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Both parties have appealed from this adjudication.

The clause directed all taxes to be paid from the residuary estate “whether or not [the property] passes under this Will.” Testator’s wife elected against the will. This Court concluded that the testator had the power to remove the tax burden from the surviving spouse’s statutory share and that the pay-tax clause clearly and unambiguously rebutted the presumption favoring statutory proration of death taxes. See, e. g., <em>Erieg Estate, </em><a href="/pa/439/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="439 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1931023" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0550-01">439 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=267%20A.2d%20841" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="267 A.2d 841">267 A.2d 841</a> (1970).

    <blockquote id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[230,485,1109,512]]]'>
      <em>“ELEVENTH: </em>I direct my Trustees to pay from the principal of my residuary estate, but in no event from that portion of my estate constituting the marital Trust ‘A’ as hereinabove set up in my Will, all taxes in the nature of estate, inheritance, succession and transfer or other similar taxes of every kind levied or assessed upon legacies, gifts and devises given herein or in any Codicil hereto, and in respect to any other assets which may be included in or added to my estate for the purpose of calculating such taxes.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[188,1027,1151,147]]]'>The widow contends that Article Eleventh, like the pay-tax clause in <em>Neamand, is </em>expansive and fully encompasses her statutory share. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b611-7" data-blocks='[["BL_611.7",611,[187,1194,1152,627]]]'>Although not passing as a legacy, gift or devise, the assets comprising the widow’s elective share are clearly “other assets” and are “included in” the testator’s estate. The pay-tax clause expressly directs that taxes on all such assets are to be paid from the residue. The application of the pay-tax direction in <em>Neamand </em>to “the property forming my gross estate for tax purposes — whether or not it passes under this Will” is closely analogous to the design here where application of the pay-tax clause is not limited to property passing under the will but embraces all assets “included in or added to” testator’s estate. As in <em>Neamand, </em>this language</p>
    <blockquote id="b611-8" data-blocks='[["BL_611.8",611,[229,1838,1108,202]]]'>“ ‘is broad enough to extend to taxes attributable to the spouse’s elective share, and there is not the slightest intimation of intention to exclude such an interest from its all-encompassing scope.’ ”</blockquote>

This testamentary plan thus satisfies the requirement of clarity set forth in <em>Neamand, </em>particularly in view of the fact that in formulating his pay-tax clause testator knew or is presumed to have known that because of his spouse’s right to her elective share not all assets included in his will would <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>necessarily pass through the will.
