    <p id="b512-12" data-blocks='[["BL_512.13",512,[264,1202,1150,635]]]'>At issue on this appeal is whether appellant John Bishop, charged with the offense of criminal homicide, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2501(a), is entitled to a timely requested jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter where the Commonwealth sought to prove that appellant intentionally killed Frank Albright. The Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County charged the jury on the law of murder of the first and third degree and voluntary manslaughter, but refused appellant’s requested instruction on involuntary manslaughter. Because in these circumstances involuntary manslaughter is a permissible verdict, appellant’s request for an involuntary manslaughter instruction should have been granted.</p>

No subclass of the offense of criminal homicide is defined as a separate offense. See e. g., 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502(a) (“[a] criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing”).

    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[264,430,1150,788]]]'>A person is guilty of “involuntary manslaughter” under the Crimes Code “when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.” 18 Pa.C. S.A. § 2504. Applying section 302(e) to involuntary manslaughter, the essential elements “recklessness or gross negligence” under Section 2504 are established where the Commonwealth proves the actor’s conduct was “intentional or knowing.” It therefore must be concluded that, based upon Section 302(e), where, as here, the Commonwealth seeks to prove “intentional or knowing” acts which cause the death of another (a “criminal homicide” under Section 2501(a)), the Legislature has deemed that the same evidence supports a verdict of involuntary manslaughter under Section 2504.</p>
