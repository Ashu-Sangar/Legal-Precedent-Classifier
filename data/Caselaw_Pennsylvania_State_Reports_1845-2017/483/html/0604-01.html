That clause, however, simply incorporates by reference the definitional provision of PERA Section 301(18) as to the phrase “maintenance of membership”; it makes no provision as to what shall or may happen if an employee refuses to allow dues deductions. More specifically, neither the maintenance of membership clause of the agreement nor the statutory definitional clause which it adopts provides for termination of employment as a remedy for non-compliance. The perceived conflict between the contract and the PERA on the one hand and the School Code on the other is, therefore, nonexistent.</p>

While the proviso language is somewhat obtuse, the parties are in agreement that it authorizes the negotiation of a contract provision which would mandate termination of employment of an employee who fails to pay dues and assessments as required by a maintenance of membership clause. Indeed, the proviso goes further and stipulates that non-payment is the only aspect of union membership the disregard of which may be cause for <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>dismissal from employment as a result of collective bargaining.

The Court obviously recognized that the arbitrator, if he is to be effective, must be permitted to employ his experience and judgment in interpreting a contract. In the present case Ms. Hoppe clearly violated the maintenance of membership term in the collective bargaining agreement and the arbitrator had only to decide whether the contract permitted her discharge. The arbitrator permissibly concluded that it was the intention of the contracting parties as evidenced by the contract to permit discharge for the failure to pay dues in order to enforce the contractual duty to maintain membership. The majority, in holding that this decision does not draw its essence from the agreement, wrongly substitutes its judgment for the arbitrator’s and undermines the salutary purposes of the arbitration process.

Since, however, the parties have assumed that Ms. Hoppe’s action was contrary to the requirements <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>of union membership, we accept that assumption for the purposes of this appeal.</p>
