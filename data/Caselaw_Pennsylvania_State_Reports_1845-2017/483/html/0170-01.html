At trial, before voir dire, a conference took place at sidebar between the trial judge, the assistant district attorney, and Duffy’s counsel (hereinafter referred to as trial counsel). Trial counsel raised two matters. First, he objected to the presence of police officers in the courtroom during jury selection. The objection was overruled and an exception noted. Second, he discussed an allegation about his role in the case to be tried:</p>

The trial proceeded without major incident; the court directed a verdict of acquittal on the conspiracy count at the close of the Commonwealth’s case. During his charge to the jury, however, the trial <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>judge referred to the defendant one time as a “prisoner.” The jury found Duffy guilty of accessory before and after the fact to burglary and larceny, and of receiving stolen property.</p>

Before action was taken on the motions, trial counsel was disbarred by this Court because of a conviction in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on mail fraud charges. Later, represented by new counsel, Duffy amended his post-verdict motions to include allegations of error based on: (1) the failure of the trial court to declare a mistrial after referring to him as a “prisoner” in the charge to the jury; and, (2) the failure of the trial court to take action to protect his right to counsel after defense counsel’s alleged conflict of interest was disclosed. The motions were denied, and Duffy was sentenced to four and one-half years imprisonment and ordered to pay court costs and $6,000 restitution to the victim. A divided Superior Court affirmed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Duffy petitioned this Court for allowance of appeal, and the petition was granted. Because of our disposition, we need only consider one argument advanced by Duffy.</p>
    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[181,1568,1149,738]]]'>Duffy claims he was denied effective assistance of counsel when it was “disclosed at trial” that part of the fruits of the crime allegedly were to be used to pay trial counsel for his services. The allegation, made by a prosecution witness, was disclosed, as noted before, to the trial judge at sidebar, before voir dire, in a conference which included the assistant district attorney. While trial counsel initially requested a continuance in order for Duffy to obtain new counsel because of the allegation, once he was satisfied the assistant district attorney planned not to introduce the testimony, trial counsel abandoned his request. The record does not reveal whether Duffy was aware of the allegation concerning his attorney or of the pretrial conference between defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial judge.</p>
