    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.6",489,[211,458,1151,845]]]'>Appellant Allen Ray was charged with murder, robbery and various other offenses arising out of the shooting death of Roosevelt Wilson in Philadelphia on August 2, 1974. Appellant, then sixteen years old, surrendered himself to the police in the early morning hours of August 3, 1974. Soon thereafter, appellant made a statement to police in which he admitted shooting the deceased but said he did so only in self-defense. Later the same morning, appellant made a second statement in which he admitted shooting the deceased during the course of an attempted robbery and revealed where the gun could be found. Although appellant was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he was not given the opportunity to consult with a parent, counsel, or other interested adult prior to making the inculpatory statements. Appellant, however, did not ask to consult with an adult before police questioning began.</p>
    <p id="b489-6" data-blocks='[["BL_489.7",489,[210,1323,1149,418]]]'>Counsel was appointed and appellant pled guilty to murder generally on January 29, 1975, in return for the Commonwealth’s certification that the degree of guilt would rise no higher than murder of the third degree. After a degree of guilt hearing, appellant was convicted of murder of the third degree and was sentenced to serve a term of eight to twenty years in prison. The remaining charges against appellant were nolle prossed. No direct appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b489-7" data-blocks='[["BL_489.8",489,[208,1761,1150,411]]]'>On October 10, 1975, appellant filed a pro se petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25,1966, P.L. 1580, §§ 1 et seq., 19 P.S. §§ 1180-1 et seq. (Supp.1978), in which he alleged that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance and that his guilty plea was unlawfully induced. The Post Conviction Hearing court appointed counsel and held an evidentiary hearing. Post Conviction relief was denied.

      <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>Appellant contends his guilty plea was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered because the guilty plea colloquy fails to demonstrate that appellant was informed of the permissible range of sentences and fines for the offenses charged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, appellant has the burden of proving that he did not “knowingly and understanding^” waive any issue that could have been, but was not, raised on direct appeal. 19 P.S. §§ 1180-3(d), 1180-4(b)(l), and 1180 — 4(c) (failure to raise an issue on direct appeal gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a “knowing and understanding” failure). Where a petitioner proves that failure to raise the issue on direct appeal was justified by “extraordinary circumstances,” no waiver may be found. 19 P.S. § 1180 — 4(b)(2). Appellant’s contention that his plea was invalid could have been raised in post-verdict motions and on direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth v. Greer, </em><a href="/pa/457/0646-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="457 Pa. 646" data-case-ids="477674" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0646-01">457 Pa. 646</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20338" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="326 A.2d 338">326 A.2d 338</a> (1974). Appellant has not alleged any “extraordinary circumstances” which may excuse his failure to file a direct appeal. Thus, the issue of the guilty plea colloquy’s inadequacy has been waived and its merits cannot be reached on collateral attack. <em>Commonwealth v.
