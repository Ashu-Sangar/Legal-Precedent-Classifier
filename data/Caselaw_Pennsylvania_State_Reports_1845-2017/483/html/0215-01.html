    <p id="b326-11" data-blocks='[["BL_326.11",326,[264,1366,1149,410]]]'>Appellant was tried by a judge sitting without a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, and was found guilty of murder of the first degree and possession of instruments of crime. Post-verdict motions were denied. On January 12, 1977, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction and a concurrent two and one-half to five year term of imprisonment on the weapon’s conviction.</p>
    <p id="b326-12" data-blocks='[["BL_326.12",326,[263,1815,1150,247]]]'>Appellant appealed the judgment of sentence on the murder conviction to this court and appealed the judgment of sentence imposed upon the weapons conviction to Superior Court, which certified that appeal to this court for disposition.</p>

    <p id="b327-7" data-blocks='[["BL_327.7",327,[187,736,1150,701]]]'>Appellant filed “boilerplate” post-verdict motions twenty-two months after this court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

See Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123(a). The motions did not contain any references to the above issues. Appellant, however, filed a brief in support of his post-verdict motions, raising the now proffered arguments. The court below, acting in compliance with this court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Blair </em>and Pa.R.Grim.P. 1123(a) declined to consider the issues. Of course, there can be no error or abuse of discretion on the part of the court en banc in adhering to this court’s decision in <em>Blair </em>and Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123(a). See <em>Commonwealth v. McClain, </em><a href="/pa/478/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="478 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="1740629" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0010-01">478 Pa. 10</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="478 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="1740629" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0010-01">385 A.2d 970</a> (1978).</p>

    <p id="b328-9" data-blocks='[["BL_328.10",328,[263,1049,1150,688]]]'>I dissent. The majority is being overly technical in a way that I thought had been rejected by this Court. Appellant filed post-verdict motions and requested permission to file supplemental motions after receiving a transcript of the testimony. Appellant later raised, in writing, additional issues for consideration. These were timely raised in a brief submitted to the post-verdict motion court. The trial court and this Court refused to consider the issues raised because, although in writing, they were submitted in a brief and not in a “supplemental motion.” The distinction is absurd. The error is only one of a <em>caption. </em>Had appellant typed or printed on his brief the “magic words” — supplemental motion, there would be no problem. I must dissent.</p>

Later we only require a notice of appeal and give counsel time to prepare before outlining the questions presented <em>in a brief </em>— not <em>before. </em>Why should we require a “statement of questions presented” (post-verdict motion) at the earliest point in the appellate process? I know our Rules say so — but they should not and should be changed. Since <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>they now do, however, we should not penalize counsel who presents issues in writing but uses, in effect, the wrong caption.</p>
