He had come to the United States from Poland at the age of twelve and worked as a coal miner for forty years. A widower since 1936, Gladowski retired due to disability in 1951 at the age of sixty. Subsequently, he suffered from numerous serious physical ailments. His daughter, Ann Mazuran, lived with him and cared for him during his many illnesses.</p>

On that same day, decedent executed a will naming Ann Mazuran executrix and authorizing her to sell all of his real estate and, after paying his debts and funeral expenses, to divide and distribute the residue of the estate in equal shares to his seven-named children.</p>

Appellants do not now contest these rulings. They challenge only the court’s additional ruling denying their petition seeking to compel Ann Mazuran to pay over to decedent’s estate proceeds of the joint bank account remaining at decedent’s death and to account to the estate for funds which she withdrew from the joint account before his death.

She also stated that, when the account was opened in 1966, her father intended that, at the time of his death, the money in the account was to be equally divided among his children.
