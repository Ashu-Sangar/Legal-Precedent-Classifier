We are required under Article 5, Section 18(h) of the Pennsylvania Constitution to “review the record of the board’s proceedings on the law and facts” and enter an order that is “just and proper.” This Court may dismiss the charges or impose a discipline more severe than that recommended.

      <em>wealth v. Richard Mayberry. </em>Late in the morning session of one of the last days of that trial, which had been in progress for several weeks, the prosecution called as a witness, Robert X. Medonis, an attorney who was under subpoena and subject to a court order that all subpoenaed witnesses be available on fifteen-minute notice when called to testify. After a delay of approximately one-half hour, respondent recessed the court for the luncheon break and ordered that the witness be held in custody, when he appeared, until after the lunch break in order to insure his appearance as a witness when court resumed for the afternoon session. Pursuant to the court’s order the witness, who appeared in the hall outside the courtroom after the recess had been declared, was taken into custody by deputy sheriffs and was placed in an area on a different floor of the court house. This area, was the waiting room portion of the bull pen, a security room where persons are held whose appearances will be required during trials. The bull pen has one section secured by bars and another section referred to as the waiting area. The witness remained in the waiting area in the custody of a deputy sheriff until he was taken to the courtroom to testify during the afternoon session of the Mayberry trial.</p>

Nevertheless, we have been able to ascertain from the proceedings instituted against respondent that the sections of the Canons involved are Canons 2(A) and 3(A)(3). The Board’s two dissenting members concluded that respondent “diligently [attempted] to conduct a trial in a dignified, expeditious manner” and did not violate the Code of Judicial Conduct. These two mem<a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>bers were of the opinion that this charge should be dismissed.</p>

That incident took place during a hearing for three juveniles accused of purse snatching. The June 7, 1976 hearing was the second held concerning these juveniles. The first had been held several weeks earlier. Following the first hearing, a newspaper article appeared and purported to quote certain unidentified police detectives regarding what had transpired at the first hearing. The article included the names of the juveniles involved. From the information contained in the article there is no doubt that someone had violated the law requiring confidentiality in juvenile proceedings.</p>

Respondent read the newspaper article, and questioned the three detectives about their involvement with the illegal breach of confidentiality which had resulted in the article. Respondent also read a letter which he had received from another detective, and his reply to that letter, both of which concerned laws regarding juveniles. Respondent then warned the detectives that the breach of confidentiality was in violation of the Juvenile Act. He then said, “to the extent that any of the three or all three of you participated in that, you are violative of this Act and you are placing yourselves in contempt of court.” Respondent then made some additional comments regarding the first hearing, and indicated that he was about to begin with the proceedings concerning the accusation of purse snatching against the juveniles. At that point respondent asked the detectives if they had enough witnesses with them to testify. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>

Richard Mayberry had been involved in a prior criminal trial in Allegheny County during which he allegedly engaged in disruptive conduct. This prior trial was able to proceed only after he had been gagged, strait jacketed, and removed to an adjoining courtroom into which the remainder of the trial was broadcast. For his conduct Mayberry was held in summary contempt of court. The conviction was reversed by the United States Supreme Court, however, and a trial ordered. <em>Mayberry v.

It was that trial over which respondent was presiding. Because of this alleged disruptive conduct by Mayberry, special time consuming security measures were taken each time Mayberry was brought to and from respondent’s courtroom. Although Mayberry’s conduct during the proceedings before respondent was not disruptive, as the prior alleged conduct had been, nonetheless there was concern that it might be.

Immediately following the witness’s <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>failure to respond to the call, respondent was told by the prosecuting attorney, who had requested the subpoenaing of the witness, that the witness was in a courtroom in a building across the street.

Upon his return to the courtroom, the prosecuting attorney told respondent that the subpoenaed attorney was tied up in another courtroom, and indicated that the witness would soon return.

Respondent did not say that the detectives were the guilty parties, and it is clear from the record that, although he had strong suspicions, he was only issuing a warning “if they were the guilty parties.” There is nothing in the record to indicate that respondent was conducting a hearing which was to culminate in a finding of guilt. He had a newspaper article before him indicating a violation of the law and quoting unidentified detectives. <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>Respondent’s suspicion that these men may have been responsible for the leak was not unreasonable. It is obvious from the transcript, however, that respondent had brought his warning to an end without any intention of further action or to impose any consequences for his suspicions. We are not certain what rights with which the Board was concerned since only a warning — with no imposition of punishment — was involved. Nonetheless, we note that at one point during the warning, one of the detectives said that he thought he should have an attorney present before answering questions. The following then took place:</p>

Again, a hindsight analysis may indicate that a different course of conduct would have been a better way to warn the detectives. Warnings in open court from judges to witnesses, <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>litigants, and counsel most often take place in front of other persons. Indeed, on many occasions the public transcripts of trials will show that warnings are regularly given to lawyers even in criminal cases, sometimes in the presence of juries when, unlike the present situation, such warnings might seriously affect the rights of the person on trial.</p>
    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[257,657,1149,353]]]'>Respondent was quite properly concerned about a breach of confidentiality that arose out of an earlier proceeding before him. Another judge may have handled the matter privately in chambers. Respondent’s decision to do so in a private hearing not open to the public or the press and in the presence of a limited number of persons does not warrant the imposition of a reprimand.</p>
    <p id="b350-5" data-blocks='[["BL_350.6",350,[256,1033,1151,713]]]'>The evidence concerning respondent’s manner during the above proceedings was sharply in conflict. Although some witnesses described respondent’s conduct as angry, antagonistic, and belligerent, other witnesses completely disagreed. These witnesses testified that respondent, although speaking in a loud voice, was speaking as he normally does in the court room so that he could be heard in all parts of the room. These witnesses said that respondent was not angry, antagonistic, or belligerent. Some of these witnesses testified that it was the detective who was aggressive in manner and speech when he interrupted respondent as the juvenile proceedings were about to begin. The evidence in this regard is not clear and convincing and is insufficient to sustain the imposition of an official reprimand.</p>
    <p id="b350-6" data-blocks='[["BL_350.7",350,[256,1765,1148,605]]]'>We arrive at this conclusion after reading the official transcript of what transpired. There is no indication in respondent’s comments that he was acting without restraint. When asked by one detective about his right to counsel respondent properly answered that the detective was entitled to a lawyer and if he so desired would not be questioned without one. No further questioning took place. When the detective held in contempt indicated a desire to answer what respondent had implied by his warning respondent indicated that if formal charges , were ever brought against the officers for any future conduct an opportunity to answer would be afforded.</p>
    <p id="b351-4" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[187,303,1152,307]]]'>
      <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>When respondent held the one detective in contempt, it is obvious he was not doing so because of the newspaper article, but because he thought that the detective was not speaking with decorum. He warned the detective who then replied “then you are going to have to find me in contempt, Judge.”</p>
    <p id="b351-5" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[187,630,1151,414]]]'>At best it is most difficult on this record to conclude that the respondent’s manner was clearly of a kind that warrants an official reprimand. No doubt the truth of the matter may well lie in a conclusion that both respondent and the detective were speaking at the crucial moment in loud and aggressive voices. Considering all of the circumstances, however, we reject the Board’s conclusion that an official reprimand should be imposed.</p>
    <p id="b351-6" data-blocks='[["BL_351.6",351,[187,1065,1150,255]]]'>In the past, when we have had before us contempt citations which have been reversed, we have indicated the need for judges to be ever vigilant in guarding against the erroneous use of the contempt power.

On various prior occasions we have held that a trial judge acted erroneously in holding individuals in contempt. In doing so we have quoted with approval from <em>Craig v. Harney, </em><a href="/us/331/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="331 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6157728" data-case-paths="/us/331/0367-01">331 U.S. 367</a>, 396, <a href="/us/331/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="331 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6157728" data-case-paths="/us/331/0367-01">67 S.Ct. 1249</a>, 1255, <a href="/us/331/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="331 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6157728" data-case-paths="/us/331/0367-01">91 L.Ed. 1546</a>, 1562 (1947) that “the law of contempt is not made for the protection of judges who may be sensitive . . . . Judges are supposed to be [persons] of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate.” Although we have indicated our displeasure with the injudicious use of the contempt authority, we have not officially reprimanded or censured a judge whose contempt order has been reversed. The authority of a judge to hold one in contempt, depriving as it does a person of liberty, is an authority that should be used rarely, and with extreme caution. Nevertheless, judges overly sensitive, or judges acting in pressure-laden situations, should not be required to fear automatic discipline because a contempt ruling might <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>later be reversed on appeal.
