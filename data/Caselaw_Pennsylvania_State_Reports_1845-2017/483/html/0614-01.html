It was the second marriage for each, and they entered into an antenuptial agreement on the day of their wedding in which each renounced any interest in the estate of the other. Eleven days later Edward died, leaving a will executed in 1967, under which Beatrice takes nothing. In the court below Beatrice attacked the validity of the antenuptial agreement and asserted a breach by Edward of an oral contract to bequeath practically all of his estate to her. The orphans’ court upheld the antenuptial agreement and declined to find that a contract to make a will had been entered into. We affirm.</p>

After Edward’s 1967 will was admitted to probate, appellant filed a petition in the orphans’ court division in March 1975 alleging that the antenuptial agreement was invalid and claiming her widow’s share in his estate and the family exemption. The decedent’s sisters-in-law by his prior marriage, who were the beneficiaries of his probated will, filed answers denying the allegations. In August 1975 Beatrice commenced an action in assumpsit against the executor of Edward’s estate claiming nearly all of the estate by reason of an alleged oral contract to make a will. The executor took the position of a stakeholder and the sisters-in-law (as residuary legatees under the 1967 will) were permitted by stipulation of counsel to intervene as parties defendant. The suits were consolidated and tried without a jury as a proceeding in the orphans’ court division, and the court thereafter dismissed the petition and entered a compulsory non-suit in favor of the defendants in the assumpsit action. Exceptions to the decree nisi were dismissed and a motion to take off the <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>non-suit was denied in a single decree, and these appeals followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Resolution of these issues requires a rather detailed recitation of the evidence, to which we now turn. The legal questions are discussed thereafter.</p>

Beatrice’s first husband died in 1967; two children were born of that marriage. At the time of their marriage, Edward was 71 years of age and Beatrice 58. As stated above, Edward lived only eleven days thereafter. Both Edward and Beatrice possessed substantial estates at the time of their marriage; statements appended to their antenuptial agreement indicated that Edward was worth at least $532,000, while Beatrice had assets of at least $300,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

McDonald, Esquire, who drafted the antenuptial agreement in issue and the proposed wills for Edward and Beatrice. <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>His testimony may be summarized as follows. On Friday evening, November 30, 1973, McDonald received a telephone call at his home in Latrobe from Edward Friedman, a neighbor whom he had represented from time to time over the years. Edward stated that he intended to remarry on Thursday, December 6, and asked whether, in view of his discussions with his prospective wife concerning property matters, McDonald could meet with them on Sunday, December 2. McDonald went to the Friedman home on that day and met with both Edward and Beatrice for about two hours. No one else was present.</p>
    <p id="b729-4" data-blocks='[["BL_729.5",729,[199,920,1145,86]]]'>McDonald described the nature of their conversation as follows:</p>

[W]e did get into the actual discussion of what a Pre-Marital Agreement was, what it meant, as I understood the laws and cases of Pennsylvania. I indicated the difficulty of drawing a Pre-Marital agreement which in my opinion would be valid stressing to Ed primarily . the absolute necessity of making a complete and detailed disclosure of all the assets that he owned. This took some time in order to be sure in my mind that Ed understood that it had to be in complete detail . . . . In these discussions I learned that he and [Beatrice] prior to my visit apparently had been discussing their desires as to property, subsequent to the marriage and that Ed had some knowledge of the assets which [Beatrice] had. I then explained to Ed and [Beatrice] what would happen to her interest ... in [certain] real estate in the event of marriage and in the event she should die prior to Eld having died. In these discussions then [Beatrice] further indicated other assets which at least led me to believe that these assets would be substantial ... . After what I would call a give and take conversation among the three of us, as to the ramifications of the marriage, what effect it would have on each of the other’s property, it was Eld’s desire that they have a Pre-Marital Agreement. He wanted no interest in Mrs. Friedman’s property and he indicated that he wanted his property, if the marriage <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>were existing at the time of his death to go substantially to [Beatrice].</blockquote>

Edward would serve as executor but would receive nothing under the will. Beatrice also gave McDonald the names of two attorneys in Illinois who could aid in describing her assets; one was a relative of hers who prepared her income <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>tax returns. McDonald then explained that because of his schedule (which, as it happened, included an unrelated business trip to Chicago in two days) it would be impossible for him to draft the agreement and the wills by Thursday, and consequently the couple agreed to postpone their wedding one day.</p>

Approximately fifty percent of the estate was then placed in a so-called marital deduction trust for federal tax purposes, from which appellant would receive the income for life, with a right to take down principal as desired. Upon her death the balance of principal would go to such persons as she might appoint under a general testamentary power of appointment. The residue of the estate was also to go in trust to pay income to appellant for her life, with the remainder to her children outright.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The next day, McDonald dictated at his office the antenuptial agreement and the drafts of wills for Edward and Beatrice. After another out-of-town business trip on Thursday, McDonald returned to Latrobe that night and reviewed the typed documents. The lists of assets had been delivered in the meantime and were also reviewed by McDonald on Thursday night.</p>

Following this, he summarized Edward’s will, and at this point Edward raised a question regarding the three $5,000 legacies to his two nephews and his niece. “He expressed an opinion that he really didn’t owe them anything” and stated that “he might want to leave those legacies” to his sisters-in-law (the residuary legatees under the 1967 will). This, said McDonald, “was not a firm statement. [The] [indication was he wanted to give it some consideration.” Because it would be impossible to redraft the will for signing before Edward and Beatrice were to leave for their wedding later that morning, McDonald (after ascertaining that the couple would remain in Latrobe after the wedding) suggested that the antenuptial agreement only be signed, and that the drafts of the wills and copies of the agreement be delivered to the Friedman home on Saturday. In this way “after review Mr. Friedman could then call me and we would either sign the will as prepared or if there were any changes to be made we could make them.” This suggestion was <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>agreed to by the couple. Duplicate copies of the antenuptial agreement were then signed and witnessed.</p>
    <p id="b733-4" data-blocks='[["BL_733.5",733,[192,443,1149,1088]]]'>On Saturday night, December 8, McDonald delivered the agreement and the wills to Edward at home. There was no conversation concerning the substance of any of the documents. McDonald’s next contact with the Friedmans was on Wednesday, December 12, when Edward telephoned “to decide upon a time when we could meet and discuss the Wills and any changes Ed might want to make.” A meeting was arranged and held on Friday, December 14, one week after the wedding, at the Friedman home. At this meeting, which lasted about an hour, Edward, Beatrice, and McDonald were, as before, the only persons present. The central topic was Edward’s will, and he directed two changes therein. First, the specific bequests were to go to his sisters-in-law. Second, the will was to provide that if Beatrice predeceased him, Edward’s estate was to be divided equally between his sisters-in-law and Beatrice’s children. No other changes were to be made, and Edward “was just as specific as he had been before, that if [Beatrice] were in fact living at the time of his death he wanted her to have his estate and in the same way that we had set it up as a result of the December 2nd meeting. . . . ”</p>
    <p id="b733-5" data-blocks='[["BL_733.6",733,[191,1551,1148,395]]]'>McDonald dictated these changes on Friday afternoon and the revised draft was typed on Monday, December 17. Edward Friedman never saw this new document, however, because he died on Tuesday, December 18. He had signed neither of the two wills prepared for him by McDonald during the preceding two weeks. The will of decedent which was admitted to probate was, as noted above, one which he had made in 1967.</p>

How much more is shown by the inventory filed by the executor of Edward’s will in which all his assets, including the stocks, are valued at $612,303.45. Since the effective date of this valuation is but eleven days after the date of the contract, the values were sufficiently contemporaneous with the contract to allow the lower court to take the inventory into account in deciding whether appellant had sustained her burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the disclosure was insufficient.

As the lower court noted, neither party had seen the agreement as reduced to writing by McDonald before they met on the day of the wedding. But the inference we are asked by appellant to draw from this evidence is severely weakened by other evidence. McDonald’s testimony, which was accepted by the court below, showed that appellant and decedent discussed the effect of marriage on their estates for about two hours in a “give and take conversation” five days before they executed the agreement; that appellant had two attorneys in Illinois who were familiar with her affairs and her interests; that McDonald insisted on a full disclosure by decedent, and that decedent understood these instructions; and that McDonald on the day of the wedding, while not reading the agreement verbatim, “went down the Agreement through the Preamble and then paragraph by paragraph and said this is what this paragraph says and means,” and that a copy of the agreement was available for Beatrice to review and follow. In addition, as noted above, the evidence shows that the disclosure contained no material misrepresentations of the value of decedent’s estate. In view of this evidence, most of which was part of appellant’s own case, the lower court was unwilling to conclude that appellant had carried her burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the agreement was invalid. We will not disturb this conclusion, for “[i]t is not our task to try the case anew.” <em>Ziel Estate, </em><a href="/pa/467/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="467 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1717334" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0531-01">467 Pa. 531</a>, 537, <a href="/pa/467/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="467 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1717334" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0531-01">359 A.2d 728</a>, 731 (1976).

Five days later, Edward indicated that he was unsure who should receive the specific legacies. Pursuant to McDonald’s advice, Edward and Beatrice decided not to sign their proposed wills, but did sign the antenuptial agreement. Although Edward later instructed McDonald to make certain changes in the draft of his will, he died before he could execute the will prepared for him. McDonald also testified that when, on the wedding day, Edward decided not to sign the proposed will, McDonald did not specifically advise Beatrice that if she survived Edward she would receive nothing from his estate unless the will was signed.</p>

In so holding, the majority produces a result which, of course, would shock both Beatrice and Edward, as well as any other person familiar with the antenuptial agreement the couple so carefully formulated. Indeed, the undisputed facts demonstrate the existence of a clear and complete pre-marital plan. A will favorable to Beatrice is an essential and integral part of the package. Beatrice and Edward were afforded only enough time by Edward’s attorney to sign but one instrument. The majority views this single writing in isolation so as to deny Beatrice everything. Beatrice and Edward signed a single writing not through any fault of their own, but because of the scrivener’s asserted inability to make minor technical adjustments before Edward’s unanticipated death. The parties clearly did not realize that a hasty signing of the antenuptial writing, without the simultaneous execution of Edward’s will, could lead to the disastrous effects the majority’s decision now produces. The majority ignores the circumstances of the execution of this single writing, including the fact that Beatrice was without counsel, and overlooks the time pressures on the parties. Only by abandoning the cardinal principle that parties to an antenuptial agreement share a uniquely confidential relationship and owe each other “the duty of frank and unreserved disclosure of all circumstances which materially bear on the contemplated agreement,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> can the majority give exclusive and controlling effect to the antenuptial writing signed in a less than “frank and unreserved” atmosphere.

At that meeting, Edward expressed his wish that Beatrice receive all of his property upon Ms death except for $15,000. While disavowing all interest in Beatrice’s property, Edward expressed his desire to retain control over Ms own property only if the marriage ended in divorce. Beatrice stated that she wanted her property divided between her children upon her death. Following this meeting, FlcDonald undertook to prepare an antenuptial writing and wills embodying the clearly expressed intentions of Edward and Beatrice.</p>
    <p id="b749-4" data-blocks='[["BL_749.5",749,[186,1013,1149,1006]]]'>Because attorney McDonald did not have the antenuptial writing and wills prepared, the marriage planned for December 6 was postponed for one day. The documents were presented to Edward and Beatrice for the first time on December 7 in McDonald’s office, shortly before the marriage ceremony was to take place. Under the written terms of the draft of Edward’s will, Beatrice was to receive all of Ms assets except a $15,000 bequest to two nephews and a niece. Edward, however, expressed some reservation about the $15,000 bequest. McDonald said he could not redraft the $15,000 bequest in time for the scheduled marriage ceremony. instead, just minutes before the ceremony, McDonald suggested that the antenuptial agreement be signed immediately and the wills be taken care of after the marriage. At no time did FlcDonald or Edward offer any suggestion or evidence the slightest concern that this action might deprive Beatrice of the only significant benefit she was to receive from the antenuptial agreement and at the same time work a forfeiture of all her rights.</p>

Unless she was provided for in Edward’s will, she received nothing in return. On the other hand, upon execution of the antenuptial writing, Edward received all that he expected. In these circumstances, it is simply not enough to say, as the trial court did, that “[bjoth the decedent and the claimant may have acted unwisely and with little caution in regards to the consequences of their haste in signing this [antenuptial] agreement.” The failure to inform Beatrice that the delay in the execution of Edward’s will might have adverse consequences upon her interests such as in the circumstances of this case, should compel this Court to respect the parties’ clear, mutual, and express intention rather than to view the antenuptial writing as the complete expression of their contract.</p>

Whatever suspicion may fairly be cast upon such testimony it is clear that in the present case there is no cause for such doubts. Here the decedent’s attorney has testified without contradiction or impeachment that Edward Friedman intended to devise all of his estate (except for $15,000) to his wife Beatrice and that he specifically directed his attorney to carry out that intention in drafting his will. The evidence, moreover, is clear that this bequest was to be part of a complete antenuptial agreement consisting of the writing and the wills. McDonald testified that he explained to Edward and Beatrice that their wills “fit together” with the antenuptial writing. To illustrate this point to Beatrice and Edward, McDonald interlocked his fingers. Assenting to that specific agreement, the parties were married. Edward’s drafted will, approved by him in all respects pertaining to Beatrice, itself demonstrates the exact terms of his expressly intended bequest. The draft of Beatrice’s will, by providing for the disposition of the bequest from Edward, further revealed that Edward’s will was an essential component of their understanding and agreement. It is unreasonable to conclude that there is no clear, direct, precise and convincing evidence that the execution of Edward’s will was a part of Edward’s contractual promise to Beatrice.

The testimony of Edward’s attorney firmly demonstrates that the parties intended to execute Edward’s will at the same time as the antenuptial writing. Their failure to execute the will in no way demonstrated an intent to modify their unmistakable antenuptial plan and agreement. Moreover, the suggestion that the signing of the will be delayed was made at a time just prior to the marriage ceremony when Beatrice, without independent counsel, was least likely to be able to exercise businesslike judgment. Her failure to ob<a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>ject to the delay and her failure to object specifically to paragraph six, under the circumstances, does not in and of itself defeat Edward’s contractual promise to make a will.

That will was emphatically described as an interlocking part of the overall ante-<a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>nuptial plan. Beatrice was likewise entitled to assume that her prospective husband and his attorney would not deprive her of this benefit by a course of conduct which all concerned believed to have only technical significance. This Court stated the fundamental principle in <em>Hillegass Estate, </em><a href="/pa/431/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="431 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1917381" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0144-01">431 Pa. 144</a>, 149, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20672" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="244 A.2d 672">244 A.2d 672</a>, 675 (1968):</p>

Recognition that the antenuptial agreement here included a contract to make a will does not threaten, as the trial court feared, to convert “virtually every estate plan prepared by a lawyer for a husband and wife” into a “contractual relationship.” Plainly, not every such plan may be an essential and integral part of an agreement by which a prospective wife otherwise forfeits all her rights to her husband’s property.</p>
