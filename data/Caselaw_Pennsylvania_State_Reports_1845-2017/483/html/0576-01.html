Sentence was suspended on the conspiracy conviction. Appellant appeals only from the judgment of sentence for murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant contends that certain comments made by the prosecuting attorney in closing argument were so prejudicial as to deny appellant his right to a fair and impartial trial and that appellant’s oral and written inculpatory statements were inadmissible products of unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment.

Police took appellant to the Police Administration Building and placed him in an interrogation room. Appellant sat in the room with his uncle from 7:35 until 8:30 when police entered to obtain preliminary information. At 8:45, appellant was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Appellant then made an oral inculpatory statement which he completed at 9:45. The police gave appellant a polygraph examination from 10:21 until 11:15. At 11:25, after again receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, appellant made a formal statement in which he reiterated his prior oral statement.

Two of the boys decided to “get” Anderson and told the others of their plan. When Anderson left the luncheonette all five youths followed him, passed him, and waited around the corner of 28th and Titan Streets. As Anderson turned the corner, Young told him to give up his money. Purdie hit Anderson after which appellant and Young kicked him. Gilmore then fatally stabbed Anderson.</p>
