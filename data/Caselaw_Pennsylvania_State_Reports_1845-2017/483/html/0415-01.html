Lofton was in her home with several friends, including Charles Reed and Samuel Edwards. The doorbell rang and Lofton sent Reed to answer it. William Hagans, Edward Hagans and Samuel Williamson entered and forced everyone to lie down on the living room floor, taking money and cigarettes from the victims.

The motion was made because the Commonwealth proposed to introduce a confession by Edward Hagans, appellant’s brother.

In his opening statement, the district attorney told the jury that a detective would testify about a confession by one of the defendants, but he did not specify which defendant. During the trial, the court ruled that the confession was inadmissible. Counsel then moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecutor’s statement irreparably prejudiced defendants and denied their right of confrontation. The motion was denied. Counsel did not request a curative instruction referring to the confession because of a belief that it would prejudice defendants by calling attention to the confession. Without referring to the confession, the court said in its closing charge that the jury was to consider only the sworn testimony and not the statements of the attorneys.
