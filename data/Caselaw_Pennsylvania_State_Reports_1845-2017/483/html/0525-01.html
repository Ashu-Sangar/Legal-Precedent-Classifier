      <em>Deitch </em>demonstrates that “merely a superficial change in the original materials, without any substantial and well signalized transformation in form, qualities and adaptability in use,” is not “manufacturing.” In <em>Deitch, </em>this Court held that a scrap metal dealer is not entitled to the “manufacturing” exemption under the Capital Stock Tax Act. “[AJppellant does begin and end with scrap or junk metal. It adds nothing to the mass as it arrives at the . yard, but rather subtracts by cleaning away unwanted elements. . . . [T]he legal reality is that the transformation is merely superficial since the steel contained therein remains totally unchanged as a result of this activity.” <em>Deitch, </em><a href="/pa/449/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="449 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="1945623" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0088-01">449 Pa. at 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=295%20A.2d%20834" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="295 A.2d 834">295 A.2d at 839</a>.</p>

Fairness requires that we apply a given definition uniformly to all those who claim the benefit of the manufacturing exemption. The Legislature has not provided a definition. If this were a case of first impression the word might be considered so vague or elusive in definition that it would be given no legal effect.

Since the Local Tax Enabling Act imposes a limitation on the authority of the City to tax “manufacturing”, <em>any doubts </em>concerning the status of appellants’ activity <em>must be resolved in favor of appellants. Fischer v. </em>Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/383/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="383 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1261937" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0138-01">383 Pa. 138</a>, 142, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.2d%20157" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="118 A.2d 157">118 A.2d 157</a>, 159 (1955). Apparently, the majority has no doubts. In my opinion, however, the evidence produced in the case is more than sufficient to raise doubt regarding appellants’ status as a manufacturer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
      <em>Fischer </em>requires us to resolve that doubt by finding appellants’ activities to be manufacturing. Therefore, the City is without authority to tax appellants’ revenues.</p>

The courts, in their development of standards for determining whether or not a particular enterprise is engaged in manufacturing, should be concerned with achieving that legislative objective. To that end, the standards must be flexible and the courts must be willing to adapt the standards to comport with rapid technological and scientific progress. As research and development in countless areas produces techniques and processes that may have been hitherto unheard of, we must not rigidly bind ourselves to outmoded concepts. That we cannot physically grasp or feel the product of the broadcaster’s manufacturing process does not mean manufacturing has not taken place. As the “Star Trek” era is ushered into our lives, this Court must be prepared to keep its perspectives progressive and its definitions flexible, or else this Commonwealth will fail to acquire modern, technological manufacturing operations.</p>
