Two assailants approached the three from behind. One assailant attempted to steal Mrs. Inej’s pocketbook. Mrs. Inej resisted, the assailant stabbed her several times, and she died from the stab wounds. The other assailant, also carrying a knife, stabbed Mr. Maidatschewsky in the arm. Both assailants fled with Mrs. Inej’s pocketbook. Appellant was arrested and charged with criminal <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>homicide, robbery, criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, simple assault, and possessing an instrument of crime generally for his alleged participation in the incident.</p>
