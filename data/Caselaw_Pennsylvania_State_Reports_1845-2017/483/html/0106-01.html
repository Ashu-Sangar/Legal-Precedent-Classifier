This Act provides that all claims for malpractice against doctors of medicine, osteopathy, and podiatry, as well as hospitals, nursing homes, health maintenance organizations and their officers, employees or agents must, in the first instance, be submitted to arbitration before access to the courts is permitted. In an effort to challenge the validity of the Act, appellants, David and Lether Parker, Jorge Garcia and Leonard Bost, Jr. instituted three separate malpractice actions in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Preliminary objections raising the jurisdictional question were filed by all defendants.

Act of July 81, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. IV, § 402(1), 17 P.S. § 211.402(1) (Supp.1978-79). The Commonwealth filed an appeal in this Court from that portion of the order holding Section 510 to be unconstitutional. See Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673 No. 223, art. II, § 202(9), 17 P.S. § 211.202(9) (Supp.1978-79). The appeal lodged in the Commonwealth Court was transferred to this Court and the two matters are now before us for disposition.</p>

A compulsory arbitration system was devised in an effort to reduce frivolous claims and to expedite the disposition of cases in this area. While the Act conditioned the right of trial by jury upon first proceeding to arbitration, it also attempted to assure a successful plaintiff that any judgment ultimately entered would be satisfied by the malpractice insurance which the various health care providers were required under the Act to maintain. Additionally, a fund administered by the state was established to pay judgments in excess of the insurance limits. Additionally, the Act addressed the competency of medical services by giving various state health care licensing and regulatory boards additional funds, authority and personnel to investigate and institute license suspension and revocation cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The first weakness in appellants position is the assumption that there will necessarily be a need for the second proceeding to obtain a fair recovery for the injured party’s loss.

We are aware of many instances where arbitration has been used in other areas of dispute-resolution where it has produced significant results in expediting the disposition of those matters. The stated purpose of the Act expressly provides as an objective that one who sustains injury or death as a result of the fault of a health care provider <em>“can obtain a prompt determination and adjudication of his claim and the determination of fair and reasonable compensation.” </em>See § 102. In conferring upon the administrator the power to promulgate rules and regulations the General Assembly charged that the power was given to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Appellants have cited statistics which would indicate that the present performance of this procedure has been far from impressive in demonstrating its capacity to provide an expeditious disposition of these cases. Nevertheless the period of time covered by the accumulated data is insufficient to establish either that the legislative scheme is incapable of achieving its stated purposes or that the administrator is unable or unwilling to provide the administration that will insure the prompt and fair resolution promised. It is an accepted principle of constitutional law that deference to a coequal branch of government requires that we accord a reasonable period of the time to test the effectiveness of legislation.</p>

First, the court expressed concern as to the probative value of this evidence because the panels included only two members who are health care providers. While initially the non-health care members of the panel may not have a particular expertise in the area, it is reasonable to anticipate that it should be quickly acquired in the discharge of their responsibilities. Moreover this approach ignores the obvious legislative purpose in drafting the section. Section 510, like that portion of section 509 to which we previously referred, was placed in the Act to discourage the use of the arbitration phase of the proceedings as a dress rehearsal or as an additional discovery stage. As we have indicated it was reasonable for the legislature to attempt to assure that arbitration be viewed as a serious dispute-resolution forum and that capricious, frivolous and unreasonable appeals be discouraged. This is not incompatible with the <em>Smith's Case </em>mandate for the access to trial by jury prior to a final determination of the respective rights of the parties. While this section admittedly is designed to discourage the merit-less appeal it does not foreclose the right to seek a jury resolution of the controversy nor does it abridge or curtail <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>any of the incidents of that right. The section speaks only to the admissibility of the decision and the findings of fact of the arbitrators. It neither places that information in the status of a presumption nor does it shift the burden of going forward with evidence or change the burden of persuasion. The jury remains the final arbiter of the issues raised and the facts presented.</p>

When this practice was finally discarded, we did so only because the Court was of the view that the position of the judge in a criminal trial was such that the jury would feel compelled to accept the court’s view without exercising their independent judgment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em><a href="/pa/448/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="448 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1944724" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0090-01">448 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%2072" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="290 A.2d 72">290 A.2d 72</a> (1972).

Appellants contend that the power conferred under the Act to the Administrator to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to fulfill the provisions of the Act violates Article V, Section 10(c) which vests in the courts the exclusive power to prescribe rales of practice and procedure for the courts. In this context appellants set forth in detail instances where the procedure for arbitration proceedings are at variance with the rales of court. Appellants also point to the power of the Administrator to pass upon motions prior to the appointment of a panel chairman as illustrative of an improper delegation of a judicial function in violation of Sections 1, 12 and 13 of <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>Article V.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The appellants’ argument relating to the vesting of alleged judicial functions in the Administrator must necessarily rest upon a finding that the arbitration procedure is in fact a judicial function.

Using this test they argue that where there has been a traditional common law remedy it may not be replaced by an administrative remedy. In response we again stress that the legislature has not here removed the traditional judicial remedy but rather has added a new administrative remedy. It has long been recognized that the exercise of adjudicative functions by administrative bodies is not a withdrawal of the judicial function from the courts in contravention of the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers. <em>Crowell v.

The Act accords the disappointed party to the administrative process the absolute right to a trial <em>de novo </em>wherein both factual and legal questions may be fully relitigated before the court.

The only thing this Act has successfully done is create a bureaucracy which impedes the resolution of disputes of its citizens. The poor citizens (both plaintiffs and defendants) must now undergo two lengthy trials, endure two court backlogs and pay double the expenses which are not uncommonly in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. Additionally, it is humanly impossible for one person (administrator) to manage, control and make all legal rulings on the pleadings of well over one thousand cases — hence the cases will not be disposed of. Lastly, as a practical matter, it is almost impossible to form an arbitration panel. Two health care providers (Doctors, etc.,) are required to sit on the arbitration panel and no doctor, worth' his salt, will be able to devote the necessary two or three weeks plus serve on the panel. The legislature sincerely meant well when they created this Act;. but it just hasn’t worked out and yet, its burdens and unworkability will continue.
