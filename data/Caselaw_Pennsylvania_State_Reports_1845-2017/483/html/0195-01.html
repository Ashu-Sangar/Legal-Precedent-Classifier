I am mindful of the fact that Pa.R.Crim.P. 1101, as-interpreted by the <em>Morin </em>decision places upon the trial judge the obligation of seeing to it not only that the colloquy relative to jury waiver shall “appear on the record,” but also that the colloquy which appears on the record shall be sufficient to support the court’s finding that the waiver is knowing and intelligent. This, however, is no different than any other duty a judge has to perform which may bear on a litigant’s constitutional rights; we expect a judge to apply the law as it has been written — this is the trial judge’s burden, as it were.
