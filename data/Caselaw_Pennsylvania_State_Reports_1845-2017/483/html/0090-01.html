Any other doctrine would necessarily lead to the degradation of the judicial authority and the destruction of its usefulness. Unless judges, in administering justice, are uninfluenced by considerations personal to themselves, they can afford little protection to the citizen in his person or property.

Liability to answer to every one who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge, would be inconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy that independence without which no judiciary can be either respectable or useful.

Although the complaint set forth numerous instances in which it charged malpractice appellant has confined his complaint in this appeal to the failure to plead the statute of limitations. Appellee charges that this issue was not properly pleaded and thus should not be considered. It is quite true that in the initial complaint this allegation was not made. Appellant filed a second pleading entitled, “An Amended Complaint” which also failed to set forth the charge. However, appellant subsequently filed what he termed a, “Traversal Brief of Plaintiff’ wherein the question of failure to plead the statute <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>of limitations was specifically raised.

We note that some of the language in <em>imbler </em>has been interpreted as leaving open the question as to whether the prosecutor enjoys an absolute privilege when he is acting in the role of an administrator or investigative officer. <em>See e. g.

The legitimacy of this distinction in this inquiry is questionable since the language relied upon in <em>Imbler </em>was in a discussion of the applicability of the common-law rule of immunity under § 1983 (<a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C.A. § 1983</a>).
