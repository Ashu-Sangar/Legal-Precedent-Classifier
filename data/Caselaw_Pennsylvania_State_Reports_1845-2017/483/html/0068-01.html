Independence Federal Savings and Loan Association, </em><a href="/pa/456/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="456 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="584387" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0402-01">456 Pa. 402</a>, 404, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20677" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="319 A.2d 677">319 A.2d 677</a>, 678 (1974). In determining what constitutes a final order we have followed the approach of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation, </em>337 U.3. 541, <a href="/us/337/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="69 S.

Ed. 1528">93 L.Ed. 1528</a> (1949), in that we look to “a practical rather than technical construction” of an order. In <em>Cohen, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States carved out an exception to the final judgment rule for situations where postponement of appeal until after final judgment might result in irreparable loss of the right asserted. Under <em>Cohen, </em>an order is considered final and appealable if (1) it is separable from and collateral to the main cause of action; (2) the right involved is too important to be denied review; and (3) the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, the claimed right will be irreparably lost. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 59 S.Ct. at 1226, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%201528" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="93 L.

The order of the trial court is, indeed, collateral to the basic liability question, and it does involve a right too important to be denied review. The order does not, however, adversely affect a claimed right which will be irreparably lost if review is postponed. Although appellants must in the first instance pay the required amount of costs and fees <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> they do not thereby lose their right to question the validity of the fee payment as a condition to their right to trial <em>de novo </em>either at the termination of this proceeding or in a collateral action. The issue is neither waived nor mooted by the inability of appellants to appeal at this stage. Appellants are not “out of court”, either on the merits of the automobile accident claim or on the right to jury trial question. Upon payment of the fee and costs appellants’ appeal from the adverse arbitrators’ award will proceed in the customary manner. If they or either of them should not succeed in that <em>de novo </em>trial, the alleged error in requiring the payment of the $60 fee as a condition of the ability to have a jury trial can be raised on appeal in the normal course, along with any other assignments of error. If, however, either appellant or both should prevail in their trial <em>de novo, </em>they will not be precluded from seeking the return of the fee from the court, for the ruling on the fee payment will have become a final adverse ruling from which an appeal would then lie. Alternatively, they might choose to proceed by a collateral action. While either method may be more cumbersome for them than it would be if this court were to reach and decide the merits on this present appeal, each alternative would comport with our <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>policy of discouraging a multiplicity of appeals in a single case, or, as it has sometimes been put, the policy of precluding “piecemeal determinations and the consequent protraction of litigation.” <em>McGee v.
