    <p id="b521-10" data-blocks='[["BL_521.10",521,[204,1034,1151,992]]]'>Appellee George David Mason was arrested and brought to trial on several charges, including alteration of a firearm in violation of section 6117 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6117. After the Commonwealth presented its case to the jury, the trial court sustained appellee’s demurrer to all charges. The court held, with respect to the alteration charge, that the Commonwealth had not introduced evidence on each element of the offense sufficient to prove appellee’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt under section 6117 and, alternatively, that the “presumption” of section 6117(b) is arbitrary and therefore violates due process. The Commonwealth appeals only the demurrer to the alteration charge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We affirm the demurrer on the ground that insufficient evidence was introduced to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant violated section 6117 of the Crimes Code.

There is no dispute that the Commonwealth established that the defendant on November 17,1976, was in possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, however, is not the crime. Rather, under § 6117(a), the offense is “obliteration.” To avoid a demurrer on the facts of this case, the “presumed” or inferred fact of obliteration must follow beyond a reasonable doubt from possession.</p>

While here we must assess a statutory inference against the “reasonable doubt” standard, the <em>Shaffer </em>criteria are equally apposite. Both analyses examine the likelihood that presumed facts flow from established facts; the sole difference is that on the “reasonable doubt” standard, the likelihood must be greater than on the due process “more-likely-than-not” standard.</p>
    <p id="b524-7" data-blocks='[["BL_524.7",524,[263,1164,1150,1011]]]'>On this test, it cannot be concluded that 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6117(b) establishes the Commonwealth’s case. No evidence was introduced indicating when the crime of obliteration occurred. Nor was evidence presented establishing when or the circumstances in which appellee came into possession of the firearm. The Commonwealth presented no evidence that appellee had the technical capacity to effect the crime with which he was charged. Indeed, the Commonwealth’s expert witness testified that obliteration may have occurred over forty-five years ago. In these circumstances it is at least as reasonable to suppose that appellee, a law enforcement official, in the course of his official duties came upon and acquired the weapon in an already altered condition as it is to conclude appellee obliterated the serial numbers after he came into possession. As the trial court observed, “to apply subsection (b) of § 6117 under the facts of this case would be to allow an arbitrary and tenuous inference be drawn without indicia of validity in logic or reason or experience.”</p>
