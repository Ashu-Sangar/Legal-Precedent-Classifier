These commissions on income were to be “payable at the time or times income is disbursed” under the terms of the trust agreements. In contrast, “final termination of any trust,” not particular services, activates Pittsburgh National’s right to commissions on principal.

Settlors make two other arguments which, in view of our disposition, we need not address. First, settlors assert that Pittsburgh National’s current attempt to recover principal commissions is a “replay” of the 1956-1958 negotiations. They argue that the corporate fiduciary “specifically acquiesced” in settlors’ understanding in 1956-1958 that no compensation on principal is payable upon resignation. Settlors state that they were “lulled . into a false <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>assumption of permanency, to [settlors’] detriment.” According to settlors, the fiduciary is now “estopped” from seeking additional compensation.</p>
      <p id="b274-8" data-blocks='[["BL_274.2",274,[270,1594,1119,623]]]'>Settlors also claim that, even if Pittsburgh National were entitled to commissions on principal, the orphans’ court erroneously applied a three per cent rate of principal compensation in calculating Pittsburgh National’s commissions. Under the trust agreements, the parties agreed to principal commissions of “not less than one (1%) per centum nor more than three (3%) per centum. . . . ” But the parties further agreed that “the amount of said additional compensation for services upon distribution of principal shall be approved by and satisfactory to Marcus Aaron or his successor Trustee appointed as hereinabove set forth.” Robert Rosenthal, the “successor Trustee,” see supra note 4, did not approve the three per cent rate the orphans’ court applied. Still assuming that the trustee can presently recover commissions on principal, settlors conclude that the corporate co-trustee is contractually bound to a maximum of one per cent principal commissions for service through termination of the trusts, and less than one per cent for the portion actually served.</p>
