Thus, a fugitive emission is an emission of any air contaminant in a specific manner, and the term is applicable not just to particulate matter, but also to sulfur compound, odor, and visible emissions if emitted other than through a flue. Section 1933 of the Statutory Construction Act provides that, when a general provision and special provision of a statute are in conflict, the two shall be construed, if possible, so as to give effect to both. Therefore, the special treatment accorded by the regulations to emission of fugitive air contaminants must be given deference. This conclusion is further supported by Section 1921(a) of the Statutory Construction Act, which provides that a statute is to be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions.

Section 4005 of the Act empowers the Environmental Quality Board to adopt rules and regulations prohibiting or regulating any process or source and requiring installation of specified control devices or equipment. Section 123.1 is a technology-forcing regulation, that is, it evidences an intent to pressure owners and operators of sources to either eliminate unmeasurable emissions or to make them measurable. In light of the policy in favor of making emissions of air contaminants measurable and the uncontroverted testimony of two Commonwealth witnesses that rates of fugitive emissions are not measurable by any existing scientific device, the rulemakers clearly intended Section 123.1 to stand alone.</p>
