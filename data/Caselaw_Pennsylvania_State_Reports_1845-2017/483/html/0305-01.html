Appellant worked the second shift (3:30 p. m. to 12 a. m.). At 10:30 p. m., shortly before the end of the second shift, appellant and several of his fellow employees began drinking beer that had been delivered to them by the wife of one of appellant’s co-workers. By midnight appellant had consumed about six, sixteen ounce bottles of beer. Just after midnight appellant and two of his drinking friends went to the nearby home of one of these friends and continued drinking until approximately 2:30 a. m., August 13, 1976. During the period of this visit appellant ate a sandwich and drank four or five twelve ounce bottles of beer. At about 3:00 a. m., appellant’s host drove him home.</p>

At that point he became violent and chased his mother outside and around the house twice; appellant did not physically harm his mother. During the chase, appellant was screaming and growling. Having wrapped a jacket around his hand, appellant broke one of his neighbor’s windows, pounded on the neighbor’s air conditioner, and then ran down the street, stopping occasionally to pound or punch parked cars. Four houses down the street, appellant went to the side entrance to the home of the victim, Mr. Lampe, tore the screen door off of its hinges, broke the glass storm door, and entered the Lampe house. Once inside, appellant accosted Mr. Lampe and a struggle ensued; Mr. Lampe was <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>on top of appellant when another neighbor entered the room and helped Mr. Lampe restrain appellant. While Lampe and the neighbor restrained appellant, appellant continued to struggle, at one point biting Mr. Lampe. Moments later police arrived at the Lampe residence, in response to a call from another neighbor. Just as the police entered the Lampe house, Mr. Lampe collapsed. One officer handcuffed appellant and took him out of the room and two other officers administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to Mr. Lampe, who was then unconscious. Minutes later rescue squad personnel transported Mr. Lampe, via ambulance, to a nearby hospital emergency room. Subsequent CPR proved unsuccessful, and Mr. Lampe died without regaining consciousness. It was later determined that Mr. Lampe, who was sixty-three years of age, died of acute cardiac failure due to a pre-existing arteriosclerotic heart disease which was aggravated by the severe stress of his struggle with appellant.</p>

Appellant suggests that in view of the state of intoxication he did not act with .the requisite malice. Appellant therefore concludes that he could only have been properly convicted of the crime of involuntary manslaughter. This analysis completely misinterprets our opinion in <em>Graves, <a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">supra.</a> Graves </em>does not stand for the proposition that voluntary intoxication could negate <em>malice </em>and thereby reduce murder to manslaughter. To the contrary, we expressly stated in <em>Graves </em>that murder could not be reduced to voluntary manslaughter by a showing of intoxication. <em><a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">461 Pa. at 125</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="461 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="483651" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0118-01">334 A.2d at 664</a>. Just as it cannot provide the provocation for voluntary manslaughter, it is also incapable of diminishing the reckless disregard which constitutes malice so as to support a verdict of involuntary manslaughter. In <em>Graves </em>we focused upon the effect of inebriation upon the ability to form a specific intent; third degree murder does not require a specific intent.

The weakness of this position is that it is dependent upon a <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>finding of fact that the alcohol consumption alone would have been insufficient to produce the condition. The finder of fact was not required on this record to find that the prescribed medication was a significant factor in producing the state of mind. There was sufficient evidence for the court to have found, as it did, that appellant’s behavior resulted from the voluntary ingestion of alcohol alone.
