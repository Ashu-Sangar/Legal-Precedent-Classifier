At trial, the Commonwealth established, through the testimony of the complainant, Wilson, the following facts:</p>

Easley, accompanied by his brother,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> entered the apartment and shoved the complainant against a refrigerator. He then pointed a gun at <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>her and threatened to “blow her brains out” because she allegedly beat his mother. Wilson fell to the kitchen floor, and Easley kicked her, threw hot grease on her, and struck her with a kitchen utensil. As the complainant lie on the floor, Easley attempted to fire the gun at her, but the bullets kept ejecting and falling on the floor. He then threw Wilson into the living room and struck her with a wine bottle. Easley next demanded the address of a person who previously lived with the complainant. When Wilson went into her bedroom to get the address, Easley pushed her .onto a bed and shot her in the chest.</p>

    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[268,1138,1151,897]]]'>Testifying in his own defense at trial, Easley claimed the shooting was in self-defense. He admitted visiting Wilson’s apartment on the day of the shooting, but only to determine the veracity of rumors which related she had been involved in the beating of his mother. Easley accounted that he was conducting a friendly conversation with the complainant until he mentioned his mother’s beating; that, at that time, she tried to “dash” a pan of grease on him; that he jumped out of the way; that she then took a gun from between the stove and sink and pointed it at him; that he then grabbed a wine bottle and threw it at her; that, as she flinched, he rushed her and grabbed the gun; and, that, as they tussled, the gun went off wounding her. According to Easley, he then emptied the gun of the remaining bullets, confiscated a box of ammunition from between the stove and sink, and exited the apartment in order to take the gun, the clip, and the ammunition to the police.</p>

Instantly, defense counsel’s objection to the prosecutor’s comment was overruled, and the reason for the objection was obvious. Moreover, since the objection was overruled, the trial judge was in effect saying the assistant district attorney’s comment was proper. As in <em>Commonwealth v. Maloney, </em><a href="/pa/469/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="469 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1722104" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0342-01">469 Pa. 342</a>, 352, <a href="/pa/469/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="469 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1722104" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0342-01">365 A.2d 1237</a>, 1242 (1976) (plurality opinion), a motion for a mistrial under these circumstances would have been an exercise in futility.</p>

Easley also argues the trial court erred: (1) in charging Easley had the burden of proving self-defense, and in failing to define that <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>burden; (2) in refusing defense counsel’s request for a charge on justification under The Uniform Firearms Act; (3) in overemphasizing, in a prejudicial fashion, Easley’s interest in the outcome of the case; (4) in misstating Easley’s testimony in such a manner as to make it appear incredible; (5) in suggesting there was no basis in the record for questioning the credibility of the complainant; (6) in allowing the prosecutor to tell the jury that potential witnesses resided in California, and that the jury should not consider their absence in any way unless otherwise instructed by the judge; (7) in charging the jury it could not draw an inference from evidence not produced at trial; (8) in denying Easley’s requested charge that the jury is permitted to draw a negative inference from the failure of the prosecution to call a material witness to testify; and, (9) in approving the prosecution’s argument that the jury could infer that, had he been called, Easley’s brother’s testimony would have been unfavorable to Easley. In view of our disposition of this case, we need not pass upon these alleged errors.</p>

Support for an argument of this nature is found in <em>Doyle. </em>There, the United States Supreme Court held the use for impeachment purposes of an accused’s silence at the time of arrest, after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violated his right to remain silent. The Court, however, noted in its opinion that “the fact of post-arrest silence could be used by the prosecution to contradict a defendant who testified to an exculpatory version of events and claims to have told the police the same version upon arrest. In that situation the fact of earlier silence would not be used to impeach the exculpatory story, but rather to challenge the defendant’s testimony as to his behavior following arrest.” <em>Doyle, </em>supra at 619 n. 11, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%202245" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="96 S. Ct. 2245">96 S.Ct. 2245</a> n. 11. See <em>United States v.

      <p id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[296,1779,1121,583]]]'>While Easley did <em>not </em>claim to have told his version of the events to the police, the Commonwealth asserts his trial testimony, that he exited the apartment <em>intending </em>to summon the police, created the same type of impression noted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle. </em>In light of our determination that the prosecution’s reference to Easley’s silence suggested an inference of guilt, we need not decide today whether or not the prosecution may make reference to an accused’s silence at arrest for the limited purposes of attacking the defendant’s testimony regarding his behavior following arrest or regarding his <em>intended </em>behavior at time of arrest. Although the dicta of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle </em>lends some support for use of the accused’s silence for these limited purposes under federal constitutional law, we note the use of an accused’s silence in such a manner is still an undecided federal constitutional, state constitutional, and state evidentiary issue.</p>
