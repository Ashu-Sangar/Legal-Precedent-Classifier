On July 7, 1975, the Association charged the District with unfair labor practices under Sections 1201(a)(1), (3), and (5) of Pennsylvania’s Public Employee Relations Act, popularly known as Act 195.</p>

Under this agreement, the District agreed to pay premiums for medical and hospitalization insurance for employees and their dependents, premiums for life insurance for employees, and tuition expenses for employees. The agreement expired on June 30, 1975, while negotiations for a new agreement were in progress. On July 2, 1975, the District terminated payments for the health and life insurance plans. At the same time, the District notified teachers it would no longer pay educational expenses. During this period the employees were not on strike.</p>

The Board also found in support of the District’s countercharge that the Association committed a technical violation of the Act when it mailed an offer to continue the terms of the present contract to the School Board President instead of to the chief negotiator as agreed upon in the ground rules. In its final ruling, the Board ordered the School District to reimburse or make whole the payment necessary to keep the employees’ insurance coverage and limited cost reimbursement plan current.</p>

The distinction between the public and private sector cannot be minimized. Employers in the private sector are motivated by the profit to be returned from the enterprise whereas public employers are custodians of public funds and mandated to perform governmental functions as economically and effectively as possible. The employer in the private sector is constrained only by investors who are most concerned with the return for their investment whereas the public employer must adhere to the statutory enactments which control the operation of the enterprise. We emphasize that we are not suggesting that the experience gained in the private sector is of no value here, rather we are stressing that analogies have limited application and the experiences gained in the private employment sector will not necessarily provide an infallible basis for a monolithic model for public employment.” <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">461 Pa. at 499-500</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">337 A.2d at 264</a> (footnote omitted).</blockquote>
