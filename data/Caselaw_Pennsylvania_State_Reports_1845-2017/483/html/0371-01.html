As realists, we have and will continue to recognize that one’s will and self-determination may be overborne without the presence of physical abuse. Psychological coercion or pressures may be just as and even more effective in lessening one’s power to resist suggestion. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth v.

In determining if psychological coercion or pressures impinged upon Holly’s will, all of the attending circumstances are important. In view of Holly’s age, the fact that he was subjected to periods of interrogation over a span of at least eighteen hours before incriminating himself, and the fact that, during <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>this period, he was held incommunicado, we conclude his capacity for self-determination was seriously impaired, and evidentiary use of his incriminating statement offended due process.</p>

Implicit in that court’s review of the merits of the issue and our approval of its review is a recognition that a PCHA court, in circumstances such as here presented, has the power to overrule the determinations of courts of equal jurisdiction, namely, the suppression court and the post-verdict motion court. Compare Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123. But the function of the PCHA court in this posture is that of an appellate court reviewing the determination of the suppression court, not that of a suppression court. We note this fact because, while no new testimony was taken at the PCHA hearing relevant to the voluntariness of the statement and while the notes of testimony from the suppression hearing were incorporated into the record as evidence, the PCHA court clearly indicated it would be willing to receive additional testimony as to admissibility of the statement. Although no new testimony was presented, the court’s position was incorrect because, had the evidentiary hearing on the suppression issue been reopened, the procedure would have provided an additional opportunity to obtain suppression, rather than a procedure to finally litigate the issue through the appellate process. Holly is entitled only to the latter, but not the former. He had already been afforded the former.</p>
