As the bartender placed the potato chips on the bar, he heard a “pop” and saw the victim, Ernest Reidel, put his hand to his neck which was bleeding profusely. The man with the gun then directed the <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>bartender to “empty the register,” but, upon noticing the victim’s wound, the gunman fled without any money.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
