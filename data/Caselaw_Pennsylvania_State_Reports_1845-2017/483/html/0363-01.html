Immediately after the recommendation of sentence by the jury, appellant and his trial counsel indicated that no post-verdict motions would be filed. Appellant was then sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction, with a consecutive prison term of ten to twenty years for the attempted robbery conviction. He was also sentenced to a probationary term of two years for the conspiracy conviction, this term to begin at the completion of the prison term imposed on the attempted robbery conviction. No direct appeal was taken from these judgments of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[191,1175,1149,364]]]'>On April 4, 1968, appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> where, along with the various allegations of error, he requested the appointment of counsel. While counsel was appointed, no amended petition was filed and his petition was dismissed without an evidentiary hearing. No appeal was taken from this dismissal of appellant’s petition.</p>
    <p id="b475-8" data-blocks='[["BL_475.8",475,[189,1564,1151,689]]]'>In August of 1971, appellant filed with this court a petition <em>in propria persona </em>for a writ of mandamus <em>in forma pauperis </em>and for appointment of counsel. This court remanded the matter to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County with directions to treat the petition as one seeking post-conviction relief. This court also ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine if appellant had been denied his constitutional right to appeal from the 1967 judgments of sentence. Thomas Harting, Esquire, Public Defender of Lancaster County, was appointed to represent appellant. Following the evidentiary hearing, the court below, on January 28, 1972, denied appellant’s petition. No appeal was taken from the order denying that petition.</p>

This court further ordered that the appeal be filed on or before December 11, 1972. On November 16, 1972, the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County again appointed Thomas Harting to represent appellant on his appeal to this court.</p>

On August 17, 1977, this court granted appellant’s petition for permission to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>It is the propriety of the January 28, 1972, order dismissing appellant’s second PCHA petition that is now before this court.</p>

Since the 1968 proceedings must be treated as uncounselled, <em>Commonwealth v. Fiero, </em><a href="/pa/462/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="462 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="485208" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0409-01">462 Pa. 409</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="462 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="485208" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0409-01">341 A.2d 448</a> (1975), forbids any theory of waiver being predicated on such uncounselled proceedings.

As appellant testified, he was aware that he had a right to appeal, but after his attorneys testified they did not intend to file post-verdict motions, he did not know, nor was he told, that other counsel, free of charge, could be appointed to represent him on appeal. The evidence on which the court based its finding that appellant had been fully informed of his <em>Douglas </em>rights simply concerned what appellant had been told prior to the attorneys’ in-court statements that they would not file any post-verdict motions. Thus, when appellant was informed of his continuing right to counsel, he may reasonably have understood the information to mean that trial counsel would represent him on appeal. Further, our review of the record reveals not a scintilla of evidence that following trial counsel’s statements concerning their lack of willingness to file post-verdict motions, appellant was told he was entitled to other counsel, free of charge, on appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As the record does not indicate that appellant was fully informed of his <em>Douglas </em>rights, the PCHA court erred in finding a knowing and intelligent waiver of said rights.</p>
