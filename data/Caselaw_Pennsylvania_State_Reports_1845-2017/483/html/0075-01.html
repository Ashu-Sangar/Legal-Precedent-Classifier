Two interior concourses, or walkways, encircle the stadium on its second level. One concourse, at the outer circumference of the stadium and away from the playing field, houses concessions and restrooms. The other, located behind the seating and scoreboard areas, runs, in part, directly behind and above “right field.” Built into the concourse wall above right field, are large openings through which pedestrians may look out over the field and stands. Ramps lead patrons from this second walkway to the seating areas overlooking the field of play. Appellant was standing in this second walkway in the vicinity of one of the large right field openings when she was struck in the eye by a ball hit during batting practice.</p>

Appellant testified that as she entered the right field area of the concourse, she directed her attention away from the walkway, approached one of the right field openings and scanned the playing field. She testified that, although she saw some activity on the field, she was not aware that batting practice had begun and did not see home plate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> After this stop, she decided not to continue around the walkway, but to walk back to get some food in the “concession” concourse. Appellant turned away from the field of play, started back, and almost immediately heard a cry of “Watch!” As she turned, again, toward the <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>field, she was struck in the eye by a batted ball. Appellant testified, in addition, that she was a fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates and that she had attended many of the “home” games played at Forbes Field, the Pirates’ former stadium. The day she was injured marked her first visit to Three Rivers Stadium. She testified that in Forbes Field patrons were not exposed to batted balls until they had left the walkways and emerged onto ramps in the seating area.</p>

Appellees contend that the outcome in this case is controlled by “the universal rule” that batted balls in baseball stadiums do not present an unreasonable risk of harm, and thus, do not create liability in trespass for negligence. Appellant concedes the existence of such a rule, but maintains that its application is limited to injuries which occur during games and regularly scheduled batting practice sessions. Appellant maintains that any injury which occurs on a concourse behind the stands, from which the injured party could not and did not see the source <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>of danger, and which results from an unusually early batting practice falls outside the scope of the above rule.</p>
