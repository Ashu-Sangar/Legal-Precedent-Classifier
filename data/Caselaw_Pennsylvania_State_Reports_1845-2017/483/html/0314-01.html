The prospective <em>employees’ </em>use of prohibited employment criteria in an advertisement cannot reasonably be said to aid an employer who might be predisposed to utilize such forbidden criteria. Knowledge of such forbidden criteria — age, sex, race, color, etc., — is readily obtainable by the employer simply by scheduling a pre-employment interview, or by requesting submission of an employment resume.

Today, a majority of this Court has found the prohibition of situations wanted advertisements identifying the race, color, religious creed, age and sex of the applicant under circumstances prohibited by the Human Relations Act, Act of Oct. 27,1955, 43 P.S. § 951, <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1978-79), P.L. 744, <em>as amended, </em>to be impermissible under the first amendment. To reach this startling result, the majority has given <em>Press I </em>an unwarrantedly narrow interpretation and has read into the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in the commercial speech area unjustified implications. The majority in its zeal to extend the protection to be given commercial speech, totally ignores this Commonwealth’s strong commitment to an egalitarian society. <em>See e. g. Pa.Const. </em>Art. I § 28. I therefore must express my most vehement disagreement.</p>

Section 5 of the Act specifies those practices which have been declared illegal in an effort to eradicate the evils of discrimination. Section 5(g) prohibits an individual seeking employment from attempting to influence the employment decision by supplying information relating to those factors or qualities which have been proscribed in making such a judgment. Section 5(e) prohibits a third party from aiding and abetting the transmittal of the prohibited information for the purpose of influencing the employment decision. It is conceded that the ads which form the basis of this lawsuit were in violation of Sections 5(g) and (e) and therefore illegal under the law of this Commonwealth. Notwithstanding the fact that it has been conceded that the publishing of these ads was <em>illegal commercial activity </em>under the terms of the Act, the majority seeks to support its result by finding that the advertiser’s <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>rights, as guaranteed by the freedom of expression amendment of the federal constitution, have been improperly curtailed by the mandate of Section 5(g).</p>

The ads encourage the employer to make the employment decision based upon the prohibited considerations. The commercial speech being restrained is simply a solicitation for discriminatory hiring.

In both instances the illegal activity condemned was discriminatory employment. In <em>Press I, </em>the regulation was directed to the conduct of the prospective employer. In this appeal, the conduct of the prospective employe is being regulated. Both regulations were directed to the same end, i. e. discriminatory hiring. Further, both regulations did not impinge upon the free flow of commercial information necessary to make the employment decision. The only information restrained was information not lawfully relevant to the proposed commercial transaction.</p>

There, is obviously no greater right derived by the newspaper to communicate the expressions of a potential employe than its right to disseminate the needs of a potential employer. I am therefore of the view that the employe’s rights of freedom of expression under the first amendment have not been abridged by the state’s legitimate exercise of its police power in an attempt to eradicate one of the most pervasive and elusive evils in our society today.</p>
