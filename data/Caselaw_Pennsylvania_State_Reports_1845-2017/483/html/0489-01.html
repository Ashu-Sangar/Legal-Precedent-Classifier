    <p id="b601-11" data-blocks='[["BL_601.11",601,[196,1122,1151,664]]]'>Appellee, Manfred Hude, was arrested on drug charges in Lehigh County. He was unable to post bail and was incarcerated awaiting trial. On April 9, 1975, prosecuting authorities from New Jersey filed a detainer against appellee. About three months later on July 3, 1975, appellee filed a petition for habeas corpus as to the detainer contending that the writ should be granted because more than thirty days had elapsed since the detainer was lodged during which period extradition proceedings had not been initiated by the governor of New Jersey. The trial court dismissed appellee’s petition. On appeal the Superior Court reversed, granting a writ of habeas corpus and dismissing the detainer lodged by New Jersey prosecutors.</p>
    <p id="b601-12" data-blocks='[["BL_601.12",601,[194,1804,1150,555]]]'>In granting the writ the Superior Court held that the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Act of July 8, 1941, P.L. 288, §§ 1-31, 19 P.S. §§ 191.1-31 was applicable and it required a dismissal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hude, </em><a href="/pa-super/242/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="242 Pa.

If that Act is applicable there is no issue before us concerning the propriety of the Superior Court’s order and it must be affirmed. A detainer under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act is valid for only thirty days unless pursuant to certain hearing procedures an extension is granted. No hearing was held in this case to effect an extension.</p>

      <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>In granting the prosecution’s petition for allowance of appeal we limited the appeal to a consideration of two issues. One issue involves the prosecution’s standing to prosecute this appeal. The other issue which will be discussed first is whether the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act is applicable to the matter before us or whether, as the prosecution contends, the applicable law is the interstate Agreement on Detainers. Act of September 8, 1959, P.L. 829, No. 324, § 1, 19 P.S. §§ 1431-38. The Uniform Criminal Extradition Act and the Agreement on Detainers are two separate acts both of which have been adopted in Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[267,1489,1150,363]]]'>The prosecution does not attempt to distinguish <em>Knowles </em>which involved a situation exactly the same as the one before us but rather contends that the Agreement on Detainers essentially overlaps the Extradition Act and that out-of-state authorities may proceed under the Agreement on Detainers which Act does not specify any time limits for the validity of the detainer lodged.</p>
    <p id="b602-7" data-blocks='[["BL_602.7",602,[268,1884,1146,257]]]'>We reject as other courts have done the prosecution’s contention.

The Act specifically refers to “a <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>person [who] has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution.” 19 P.S. § 1431, Art. 3. The language throughout the Agreement on Detainers Act leaves no doubt that the Act is only applicable and permits detainers under that Act against one already convicted and incarcerated under an imposed sentence. When a detainer is lodged under the Agreement on Detainers Act the appropriate official, under certain circumstances, having custody of the prisoner is to issue a certificate “stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.” 19 P.S. § 1431, Arts. 111(a) and IV(b). These references are typical of references throughout the Act to one who is serving a term of imprisonment.</p>
