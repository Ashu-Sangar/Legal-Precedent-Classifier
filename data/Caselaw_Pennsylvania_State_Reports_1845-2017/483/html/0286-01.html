Therefore in order to show that a motion for change in venue would have been of arguable merit, appellant must demonstrate that the pre-trial publicity did in fact create a fixed opinion as to guilt or innocence in the minds of the prospective jurors, which opinion could not be readily set aside. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hoss, </em><a href="/pa/469/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="469 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1722066" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0195-01">469 Pa. 195</a>, 204, <a href="/pa/469/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="469 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="1722066" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0195-01">364 A.2d 1335</a>, 1340 (1976).</p>

At the PCHA hearing appellant offered the affidavit of one Mrs. Mattson wherein she stated that another woman, a Mrs. Waite, had told her (Mattson) that several fellow employees of the man ultimately selected as jury foreman had told her (Mrs. Waite) that prior to his being summoned for jury service, the foreman had expressed his belief that appellant was guilty. Noting correctly that the affidavit contained triple hearsay, the PCHA court ruled the affidavit inadmissible. The only other evidence even remotely relevant to a showing of actual jury prejudice was the equivocal testimony of one courtroom observer to the effect that he thought he saw prospective jurors mingling in courthouse corridors with witnesses and the victim’s family. Appellant has not provided any evidence showing that his trial counsel was aware of the purported statement made by the jury foreman, nor has appellant shown that if there was intermingling of jurors, witnesses, and relatives of the victim, counsel was cognizant of that fact., In fact, at the PCHA hearing appellant’s trial counsel testified that he was not aware of any such objectionable juror exposure. Nor is there any showing that his lack of awareness of these allegations was as a result of his failure to exercise due diligence in his preparation and trial of the case. Confronted with the information available to him there was no basis upon which to assert an arguable claim for change of venue. Even if these improper jury contacts had been established, it would have only supported a removal of the particular jurors concerned. It would not have provided a basis for <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>concluding that a fair jury could not have been drawn in Mercer County. Therefore, counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to file a futile motion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/452/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="452 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="575106" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0316-01">452 Pa. 316</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="305 A.2d 354">305 A.2d 354</a> (1973).</p>
    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[194,529,1150,616]]]'>Appellant also alleges that trial counsel was ineffective in his handling of appellant’s recall testimony. The trial context out of which appellant makes this assertion was as follows: Appellant’s primary defense to the murder indictment was to negate malice. <em>See Commonwealth v. O’Searo, <a href="/pa/466/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="466 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1714948" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0224-01">supra.</a> </em>Appellant was one of the last witnesses in the defense case-in-chief. On direct examination as well as during cross-examination, appellant testified to the effect that during the fatal encounter, “something grabbed him” and caused the gun he was holding to discharge and kill the victim. Shortly after this testimony, the trial was recessed for the weekend.</p>
    <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[195,1174,1149,309]]]'>On the following Monday, defense counsel, upon appellant’s request, recalled appellant as a witness and asked him what caused the gun to discharge. At that time he responded that, “something grabbed my hand and pulled it . .” Later that day the trial court in its charge referred to that testimony as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[237,1499,1107,191]]]'>“Mr. O’Searo was recalled, and he was asked if he knew what caused the gun to go off, that was today. He said someone grabbed my hand and pulled it, that is all I know, or words to that effect.”</blockquote>

Appellant attacks counsel’s decision to permit his client to be recalled as a witness and that appellant was not properly prepared for being recalled. Appellant attempts to minimize the difference between his original testimony as to the cause of the weapon’s discharge and his statements upon being recalled. The specific reference to something grabbing his hand which held the weapon was obviously significantly more supportive of his claim of accident than the previous vague reference to something grabbing some unspecified part of his body. From a reading of the post <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>conviction hearing testimony it is fair to conclude that this more precise version was first related to trial counsel in a Sunday evening conference during which the decision to recall appellant was made. When recalled, appellant testified in accordance with his statements to counsel on the previous evening.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[252,650,1152,635]]]'>At the outset it is clear that there is no merit to the claim that he was not properly prepared to give this testimony. Since the second version strengthened the defense that was being pressed throughout the trial the position of appellant could only have been enhanced by having the jury hear this testimony. The fact that a jury may not believe a witness’s version of the facts is an ever present hazard. Nor was the hiatus between the conclusion of his original testimony on Friday before the recess and his recall on Monday when the trial reconvened so great as to prevent it from being a reasonable trial tactic to attempt to introduce this evidence through the only source available.</p>
