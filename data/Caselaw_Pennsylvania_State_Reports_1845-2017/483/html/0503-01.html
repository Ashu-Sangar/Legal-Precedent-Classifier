The term of the contract was from June 15, 1970 to June 14, 1971 and thereafter from year to year subject to cancellation by either party on sixty days written notice. On April 14, 1971, the Commonwealth sent a telegram to UEC announcing the cancellation of the contract. Shortly thereafter, high officials of the Commonwealth, namely Governor Milton Shapp, Attorney General J. Shane Creamer and DPW <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>General Counsel Marx S. Leopold, informed UEC that, notwithstanding the telegram of April 14th, negotiations to extend the contract were reopened. During the negotiations on contract extension, UEC agreed to maintain its operations at a reduced level in order to avoid new start-up costs should the contract be renewed. Operations continued until October 14, 1971, at which time the Commonwealth informed UEC, for the first time since its telegram of April 14th, that the contract would not be renewed. UEC immediately terminated operations under the contract.</p>

At some point during this period, however, a dispute arose as to the exact amount of compensation remaining to be paid (some $1,130,000 of the total amount had been paid). Thereafter, on or about January 18, 1972, Secretary Wolgemuth and General Counsel Leopold orally agreed with UEC that the Commonwealth would pay, and UEC would accept in compromise and settlement, an amount to be determined through an audit conducted by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> HEW was to calculate the amount owed to UEC on a quantum meruit basis, i. e., the reasonable value of the services performed.</p>

The first asked for enforcement of the contract price and for consequential damages caused by impairment of UEC’s cash flow, damage to its business reputation and deprivation of the opportunity to obtain similar contracts with other states. The second cause of action sought enforcement of the oral compromise and settlement agreement. The Commonwealth Court sustained DPW’s preliminary objections reasoning that the first cause of action was barred because the action was not brought within six months of the accrual of the cause of action (which they calculated to be October 14, 1971), as required by statute for claims brought against the Commonwealth. Act of May 20, 1937, P.L. 728, No. 193, as <em>amended, </em>72 P.S. § 4651-6, as <em>amended </em>(1968).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The second cause of action was also, according to Commonwealth Court, barred by statute, the Administrative Code of 1929, Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177 § 512, <em>as amended, </em>71 P.S. § 192, as <em>amended </em>(Supp.1978-79),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which statute was construed by the Commonwealth Court to preclude DPW from entering into a “compromise and settlement agreement” with UEC without first refer<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>ring the matter to the Department of Justice. Having failed to so refer the case, the court held that DPW was without authority to bind the Commonwealth to the oral agreement and, therefore, UEC could not enforce said agreement.

    <p id="b621-4" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[190,636,1151,1168]]]'>Initially, appellants assert that the Commonwealth Court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because appeals are allowed only from actions of the Board either dismissing the claim or making an award, see 72 P.S. § 4651-8(b), and that, therefore, the order of Commonwealth Court should be vacated. Appellant’s argument ignores the distinction between appeals as of right and discretionary appeals. While it is true that appeals as <em>of right </em>may only be taken from the two Board actions mentioned above, 72 P.S. § 4651-8(b) imposes no prohibition against the utilization of the discretionary appeal process. This was the procedure used in the instant case. The Board certified their interlocutory order dismissing DPW’s preliminary objections as involving a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate determination of the litigation. The certification thus complies with section 501(b) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, 17 P.S. § 211.501(b) (Supp.1978-79) regarding discretionary appeals from interlocutory orders, and the Commonwealth Court acted well within the bounds of their discretionary authority to hear the appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

High Commonwealth officials, including the Secretary of DPW and its General Counsel, repeatedly gave UEC their assurances that the Commonwealth would compensate them (UEC) under the contract. In fact, they made partial payment and merely questioned the remainder owed. At no point has the Commonwealth ever denied liability for the debt owed UEC. Quite the contrary, the conduct of Commonwealth officials during the period from October 14, 1971 through February 15, 1973 was entirely consistent with an admission of liability for the debt. Seemingly amicable negotiations continued during that entire period, with full cooperation by UEC. These negotiations resulted in the HEW audit, requested by DPW (and consented to by UEC) which audit determined the reasonable value of UEC’s services. Since the audit was, pursuant to the oral compromise and settlement agreement, necessary to establish the balance owed under that agreement, UEC reasonably delayed any possible legal action pending completion of the audit. Even after the audit was <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>completed, the Commonwealth <em>continued </em>to assure UEC of its intention to pay its obligation, lulling them into a false sense of security regarding the necessity for initiating legal action.</p>

UEC has performed valuable services for the Commonwealth in the amount of over $2,500,000, has cooperated with the Commonwealth and has been more than accommodating in all respects. Yet the Commonwealth now seeks to avoid its contractual obligation by saying “too bad, you shouldn’t have believed us when we told you we’d pay you.” Such callous disregard for the rights of Commonwealth creditors cannot be tolerated.</p>

These cases, however, hold that <em>subject-matter </em>jurisdiction cannot be supplied by waiver, estoppel or agreement of the parties. Where a tribunal has no authority to hear a particular <em>type </em>of case, actions of the parties cannot supply that authority. Where, however, the limitation on jurisdiction is <em>over the parties, </em>they can supply the requisite jurisdiction by their conduct. <em>See Schleifer v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, supra. </em>In the instant case, the Board is empowered to hear cases involving claims against the Commonwealth, i. e., they have <em>subject-matter </em>jurisdiction. 72 P.S. § 4651-6 operates as a limitation on jurisdiction over the Commonwealth as a party — it is a limitation on jurisdiction over the person/par<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>ty and inures to the benefit of the Commonwealth.

Even if there was a duty on the part of DPW to refer the matter to the Department of Justice, the failure to do so was in no way caused by UEC. In fact, UEC would have'no way of knowing whether or not the matter had been so referred unless notified by DPW or the Department of Justice. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth is estopped from asserting lack of authority to compromise and settle their agreement with UEC.</p>
