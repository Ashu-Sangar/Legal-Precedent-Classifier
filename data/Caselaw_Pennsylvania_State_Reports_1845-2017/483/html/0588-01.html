Since Walton raised no objections in the trial court, his only basis for appellate attack on the order of probation was the jurisdictional ground that it lacked legal authority.

In the other cases cited in <em>Flashburg, </em>however, probation was not involved at all, and the court merely held that the applicable statute did not authorize a sentence of restitution <em>in addition to </em>the punishment imposed. Moreover, the Superior Court in <em>Jackson </em>merely cited in support of its holding <em>Rouchie, </em>supra, in which restitution was ordered in addition to the statutory punishment, and the statute defining the extent of the punishment for aggravated assault and battery.

Rather, particularly since no specific conditions were expressly authorized by the Act, it appears that the discretion conferred upon courts to fashion appropriate conditions of probation was a broad one. The practice of ordering restitution or reparation as such a condition is widely established and highly favored in the law, as an aid both to the criminal in achieving rehabilitation and to his victim in obtaining some measure of redress. See ABA Standards, Probation, § 3.2(c)(viii) (Approved Draft, 1970); Annotation, Propriety of Condition of Probation which Requires Defendant Convicted of Crime of Violence to Make Reparation to Injured Victim, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.L.R.%203d%20976" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="79 A.L.R. 3d 976">79 A.L.R.3d 976</a> (1977), and cases cited therein. Although modern probation statutes customarily contain specific authorizations for this practice, broad discretionary statutes such as 19 P.S. § 1051 have generally been held sufficient to permit courts to enter such orders in appropriate cases. See, e. g., <em>Basile v. United States, </em><a href="/a2d/38/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="38 A.2d 620" data-case-ids="8138916" data-case-paths="/a2d/38/0620-01">38 A.2d 620</a> (D.C.Mun.App.1944) (failure of Congress specifically to authorize restitution does not indicate a lack of power in the court to impose such a condition).</p>
