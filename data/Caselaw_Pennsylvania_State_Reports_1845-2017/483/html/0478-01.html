Once appellant filed his motion to suppress the inculpatory statement, the Commonwealth was obliged to demonstrate the lawfulness of the statement by a preponderance of the evidence. See Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 323(h) (“[t]he Commonwealth shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence and of establishing that the challenged evidence was not obtained in violation of the defendant’s rights”); <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

While the Commonwealth produced evidence concerning the voluntariness of appellant’s statement, it came forward with no evidence supporting the lawfulness of appellant’s arrest. Nor did it meet its burden of demonstrating that appellant’s inculpatory statement was not the product of the allegedly unlawful arrest. See e. g., <em>Brown v.

Indeed, the claim was an important and meritorious issue which counsel should not have disregarded. That appellate counsel, because of a personal view of facts outside the record, considered pursuit of the claim improper, does not justify a contrary conclusion. “The constitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process can only be attained where counsel acts in the role of an active advocate in behalf of his client, as opposed to that of <em>amicus curiae.” Anders v.

Several hours after that arrest, appellant confessed to his participation in the Somerset County robbery. Appellant was then arrested for the Somerset County crimes and charged with murder, robbery and conspiracy. Prior to the trial in Somerset County, defense counsel, acting solely upon the appellant’s information that no rape ever occurred, no warrant ever issued and the alleged rape victim never existed, sought to suppress the confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest. His application to suppress the confession alleged that the unrelated Pittsburgh arrest on charges of rape and assault was illegal in that it was 1) without warrant and 2) without probable cause.
