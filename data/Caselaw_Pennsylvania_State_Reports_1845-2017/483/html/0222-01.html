Appellant, through his attorney, has filed an appeal alleging 27 errors. Only two of appellant’s contentions warrant discussion.</p>
    <p id="b334-8" data-blocks='[["BL_334.8",334,[273,1087,1146,150]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that the trial court erred in not allowing defense counsel to ask the following questions during the voir dire of prospective jurors:</p>
    <blockquote id="b334-9" data-blocks='[["BL_334.9",334,[314,1255,1107,370]]]'>If you were to hear evidence about a person having used drugs, would you be more inclined to give his testimony less weight than any other witness that you did hear? If you were to hear testimony concerning drug addiction or use of drugs, do you think, deep down inside of you, you would be inclined to reject any evidence offered by parties indicating that they have used drugs?</blockquote>
    <p id="b334-10" data-blocks='[["BL_334.10",334,[273,1658,1151,688]]]'>This Court has held that “the examination of jurors under voir dire is solely for the purpose of securing a competent, fair, impartial and unprejudiced jury. . Neither counsel for the defendant nor the Commonwealth should be permitted to . ask direct or hypothetical questions designed to disclose what a juror’s present impression or opinion may be or what his attitude or decision will likely be under certain facts which may be developed in the trial of the case.” <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/452/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="452 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="575343" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0130-01">452 Pa. 130</a>, 134, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%205" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="305 A.2d 5">305 A.2d 5</a>, 7 (1973). “A trial court’s refusal to permit certain hypothetical questions on voir dire will not be disturbed absent a palpable abuse of discretion.” <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>At the beginning of voir dire, defense counsel stated during a sidebar conference that he wanted to ascertain whether the prospective jurors had “any prejudices or bias that would gravitate against the interest of my client if there is any evidence presented by us to show that my client, perhaps, was using drugs at the time he was arrested, and this may have some effect upon whether he intelligently waived his right to counsel”. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting the aforementioned line of inquiry because defense counsel was improperly trying to determine what the prospective juror’s reaction might be <em>when </em>and <em>if </em>defense counsel presented evidence that appellant was under the influence of narcotics when he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>
    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[184,1087,1152,1055]]]'>Appellant’s second contention is that the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial on the grounds that two jurors were improperly influenced. On the fifth day of trial, a juror and an alternate juror reported to a court officer that as they were leaving City Hall (where the trial was taking place) at the conclusion of the preceding day’s proceedings, they were approached by three women who had been present for a portion of the trial. These three women had been seated on the defense side of the courtroom. One of these women asked the jurors, “Do you think the defendant is guilty or not guilty?” The alternate juror replied, “I don’t know. We have not even thought about it yet.” The woman said, “We think that he is not guilty.” The jurors reported the incident to a court officer who, in turn, reported the incident to the trial judge. The trial judge offered to separately voir dire the two jurors to determine whether the incident would have any effect on them; however, defense counsel objected to such an examination because he felt that this would “compound the situation”. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial and this motion was denied.</p>

Craig, </em><a href="/pa/471/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="471 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="1725159" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0310-01">471 Pa. 310</a>, 313, <a href="/pa/471/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="471 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="1725159" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0310-01">370 A.2d 317</a>, 319 (1977). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in not declaring a mistrial. The remarks made by the spectator to the jurors were not prejudicial to appellant. Further, throughout the trial, the trial judge told the jury that they should decide the case solely on the evidence presented at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Four months after appellant’s conviction, defense counsel (in his post-trial brief) alleged that defense counsel was informed by a “reliable source” that a third juror knew of this incident. Appellant now argues that the trial court erred in not conducting an investigation to ascertain whether the other jurors knew of this incident. Since, appellant did not ask for such an investigation, the matter is waived.</p>
