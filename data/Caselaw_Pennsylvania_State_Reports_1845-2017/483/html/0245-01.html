When Zeth returned, his companion Paul Glass told him what had happened. In appellant’s absence, Zeth then retrieved the beer. The testimony reveals that appellant discovered this and instigated an argument which escalated into a fist fight with Zeth. Appellant was ordered to leave the bar, and on departing was heard to say to Zeth, “You’re dead.” Minutes later appellant reappeared in the doorway of the bar bearing the .22 caliber rifle. Robert Hammel, a friend of appellant who was not involved in the earlier fight, approached him. Appellant fired, fatally wounding Hammel in the abdomen. Soon thereafter appellant fled the bar, and was later arrested at another bar near his home. At trial appellant testified that on the day in question he had consumed more than a case (twenty-four pints) of beer and that he had no recollection of shooting Robert Hammel, arguing with Zeth or Glass, or making any threatening remarks.</p>

Included in the offense of murder charged in this case is the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. A person who kills an individual without lawful justification, commits a voluntary manslaughter if, at the time of the killing, he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or another whom the actor endeavored to kill but he negligently or accidently [sic] causes the death of the individual killed. You, the jury, must therefore consider in this case whether the defendant acted in sudden and intense passion, resulting from serious provocation. Passion includes anger, terror, rage or resentment. Serious provocation is conduct sufficient to excite an intense passion in a reasonable person. If a reasonable cooling time elapses between the alleged provocation and the killing, the provocation will not reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. <em>Consequently, you cannot find the defendant guilty of murder </em>

Under any of those circumstances, a finding of guilty of voluntary manslaughter would be applied. In other words, if he caused the death and there was serious provocation by Mr. Hammel, then he could not be convicted of voluntary manslaughter. If he caused the death but there was a reasonable belief that he was only using the defense necessary, he couldn’t be convicted. But, if he caused the death, there was no serious provocation, or there was an unreasonable belief of provocation or of the defense thereto, it would constitute voluntary manslaughter.”</blockquote>

Appellant has raised numerous other claims which, because of our reversal of the conviction for murder of the third degree, we need not address. Those claims are: (1) that the court should not have instructed the jury on transferred intent with respect to murder; (2) that the court should not have presented to the jury those charges which were lesser included offenses of murder or, alternatively, should have instructed the jury on merger; (3) that the court erred in denying individual voir dire under Rule 1106(e), Pa.R.Crim.P., where first degree murder was charged; (4) that even though the jury was ultimately told that the Commonwealth did not seek the death penalty the court erred in telling the jury that the death penalty was a possible punishment; (5) that the court erred in its charge on involuntary manslaughter; and (6) that the court erred in its instructions on third degree murder.</p>

We note, however, that the request for charge stated that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty of “terroristic threats to the victim Zeth.” Although counsel erred in referring to Zeth instead of Hammel, we believe the express reference to “victim” adequately presented the issue to the trial court. Counsel’s post-verdict presentation of this issue to the trial court also contained a misstatement. Counsel referred to the wrong Criminal Action number. Yet counsel did at that point make clear that he was alleging a lack of evidence for the crime of terroristic threats against Robert Hammel. Again we believe the substantive issue was adequately presented.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that he was not of a sufficient intoxicated state to destroy the mental element of intent necessary, as evidenced by his statements, by his going to the car, by his getting the gun, by his return, by his leaving, by the fact that he drove his car to his Mother’s home, that he drove his car from his Mother’s home into. Altoona, <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>Pennsylvania, parked it in a parking space in a parking lot near his home, that he made certain statements to the Officers, that he made certain statements to his wife and to others with respect to what had transpired. The Commonwealth contends that that evidences the fact that he was of a capable mind to form an intention and so on. The defendant contends that he does not remember much of that which transpired. The Commonwealth contents that there is a difference between recollection of what transpired and intent what to do at the time and place of the event. These are matters all for you to decide, as the jurors, what are the true facts in this case, and as heretofore indicated, the law permits you to infer from the Use of a deadly weapon a certain intention on the part of the defendant. This is a matter for you to take into consideration and if you conclude as a matter of fact, based upon the testimony offered and the law as the Court gives it to you, that the defendant was not capable by virtue of intoxication of forming a requisite intent then of course he could not be guilty because he must have intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as I have described those terms to you, committed the act in question.”</blockquote>
