Additionally I dissent from the majority’s disposition of appellant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request recusal of the trial judge. On the basis of the trial judge’s post-trial statement in his opinion that he did not hear appellant say “I have to plead guilty,” the majority further concludes that even if such a request would have been meritorious, trial counsel had some other reasonable basis for not raising it. This analysis is misdirected. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967), and in all ineffectiveness cases since then, this Court has held that ineffectiveness claims should not be reviewed from “hindsight.” Rather, the proper analysis is whether trial counsel had some reasonable basis for taking the action he did at the time his decision was made. At the time appellant made his potentially prejudicial remark, trial counsel did not know, and could not be expected to know, that the trial judge did not hear it. Thus, trial counsel’s decision not to request recusal could not be based on the assumption that the trial court was unaware of appellant’s comment. In these circumstances, there is no reasonable basis to justify trial counsel’s decision not to request recusal.</p>

The official transcript is the proper source to determine what was said in the courtroom. Prescribed procedures for amending an inaccurate transcript were not followed in this case. Pa.R.A.P. 1926. The statement by the trial judge in his opinion involves a matter of credibility which may involve among other things an issue of memory. The trial judge can not act as a fact finder as to whether a comment was made when relying on his own “testimony” outside of the hearing procedures provided by law for correcting a transcript.</p>
