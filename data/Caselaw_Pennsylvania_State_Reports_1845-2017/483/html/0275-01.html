Moreover, as previously noted, the SSI program specifically contemplated that states could seek reimbursement from recipients of interim assistance.

We have carefuUy examined the record in this case and find that the worst DPW can be accused of is failure to inform appellants of <em>Philpott </em>and its impact. We are not confronted, therefore, with a situation such as existed in <em>Good v. Wolgemuth, supra </em>note 4, wherein DPW caseworkers took an active role in affirmatively misleading the debtor/claimant. Such active participation prompted the Commonwealth Court to coin the “fair means” test. Here, the DPW caseworkers merely informed appellants how much they owed (and they certainly still owed the debt) and accepted payment when tendered. The regulations of DPW .specifically provide that caseworkers are to cooperate with the Claims Settlement Division and are to accept payment if the debtor has the money and offers repayment.
