This is not the case. The statute requires that nonpublic school students receive transportation opportunities “identical” to those accorded public school students with the proviso that the district is not required to bus <em>any </em>student farther than ten miles from the district’s borders. “Identical” in this context means that public and nonpublic school students must be bused <em>to their schools </em>if such schools are within the ten mile limit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">7</a> School <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>district boundaries are not sacrosanct; they are only flexible political lines drawn to accommodate the efficient administration of the educational system of this Commonwealth.

The maximum distance is the same for both public and nonpublic school students. The fact that the distance was computed in mileage and not confined to school district lines, we think, is of no constitutional consequence. On its face, then, because it confers its benefits equally upon students attending public and nonpublic schools, Act 372 does not violate the establishment clause by favoring a religious group.</p>

The three school districts have adopted pupil busing policies that prohibit the transportation of public school students out of the district. Thus, they contend, by forcing them to bus nonpublic school students out of the district these nonpublic school students receive “favors” or benefits not given to public school students. This argument misinterprets the requirements of Act 372. As stated above, Act 372 requires the school district to bus nonpublic school students to their schools if the district also has decided to bus public school students to the public schools. The maximum permissible distance in both cases is up to ten miles outside the school district’s boundaries. The fact that appellants have of their own volition decided not to bus public school students up to ten miles outside their districts has no bearing on the statutorily imposed duty of the districts to bus nonpublic school students to their nonpublic schools once the district has undertaken to transport public school children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">8</a>

In this portion of appellants’ equal protection claim, however, fundamental rights are not involved. Appellants claim that students attending nonpublic profit-making schools are denied the transportation opportunities that all other children are accorded by Act 372. First, the denial of such transportation opportunities is not an infringement upon fundamental rights in these circumstances. Second, the group denied transportation under the act is not a “suspect class” so as to demand automatic strict scrutiny; and neither is it a “semi-suspect class” so as to demand “intermediate scrutiny” by this Court. Consequently, the traditional equal protection rational basis test is appropriate in resolving appellants’ instant claim.

I disagree with the majority’s interpretation of Act 372. The clear and unambiguous language of Act 372 authorizes school districts to exercise discretion and develop their own policies concerning the scope and nature of the <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>transportation services it will offer its residents, so long as “identical” services are provided public and nonprofit nonpublic school students. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921. As thus construed, appellant school districts are in compliance with Act 372, rendering it unnecessary to reach the federal and state constitutional issues which the majority undertakes to decide. See <em>Mt. Lebanon v. County Board of Elections, </em><a href="/pa/470/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="250" data-cite="470 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1723873" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0317-01">470 Pa. 317</a>, 322, <a href="/pa/470/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="251" data-cite="470 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1723873" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0317-01">368 A.2d 648</a>, 650 (1977) (constitutional questions should be avoided where a non-constitutional ground is dispositive).

Two conditions are placed <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>upon this authority to use school district funds for free transportation. The schools to which resident pupils are transported must be “not operated for profit” and must be “located within the district boundaries or outside the district boundaries at a distance not exceeding ten miles by the nearest public highway.” Thus, the first sentence of Act 372 grants a school board power to provide free transportation to any nonprofit school up to but not exceeding ten miles outside the district lines. The plain language of Act 372 does not require that, once a school board chooses to transport any student to any nonprofit school within the district or up to ten miles outside the district, it must transport all resident students to all qualifying schools. Rather, the Legislature leaves to the discretion of the school board the geographical scope of busing.</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.5",684,[254,1136,1163,1224]],["BL_685.1",685,[185,304,1148,252]]]'>This reading of the first sentence of Act 372 is reaffirmed when compared to the language of the last sentence of the Act’s first paragraph and section four of the Act. See 1 Pa. C.S.A. § 1921(a) (statutes to be construed so as to give meaning to all their provisions). The last sentence of the first paragraph provides: “The board of school directors shall provide such transportation whenever so required by any of the provisions of this act or of any other act of Assembly.” The Legislature’s use of mandatory language here, when contrasted with the permissive language of the first sentence, confirms the view that the first sentence merely grants school districts the power to act. It does not make action of any nature obligatory. Further, Section 4 of Act 372 provides: “Nothing in this act shall be construed to require or authorize the assignment or transportation of any-pupil by any board of school directors to any school outside the boundaries of the district in which the pupil resides, except with the consent of the board of school directors, or in the case of a nonpublic school, the authorities responsible therefor, in the district to which the pupil would be assigned, as provided in sections 1310, 1315 and 1316 of the act of March 10, 1949, (P.L.30) known as the ‘Public School Code of 1949,’ as amended October 19, 1959 (P.L.1324).” Had the <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>legislature meant to impose a mandatory duty on school districts to transport students outside the district lines up to a distance not exceeding ten miles, it would have been unnecessary to use the language “require or authorize” in Section 4.</p>
    <p id="b685-4" data-blocks='[["BL_685.5",685,[187,582,1152,1770]],["BL_686.1",686,[279,308,1148,196]]]'>The “identical provision” requirement imposed by the second sentence of Act 372 does not alter this reading. The second sentence mandates that when transportation is provided for public school pupils, “identical provision” must be made for nonpublic school pupils. It does not require transportation not provided public school pupils be provided nonpublic school pupils. Act 372 forbids school boards from treating public school students in a preferential or special manner. So too it is forbidden to treat nonpublic school students in a preferential manner by providing them with transportation not provided public school students. All resident pupils, whether they attend public or nonprofit nonpublic schools must be treated identically. For example, the same mode of transportation must be offered to all students. Public school students may not be transported on school buses while nonpublic school students are given money to subsidize the cost of public transportation. Public school students may not be provided free transportation if they live more than one and a half miles from their schools, while nonpublic school students are required to walk to school unless they live more than two miles away from school. The “identical provision” requirement simply demands that the nature and scope of services afforded public school students be replicated for nonpublic school students. The “identical” requirement does not impose any duty upon school districts to transport all resident pupils to their schools no matter where they may be located within the maximum limit of ten miles outside the district lines. It merely requires that a policy not to transport students over district lines or only a certain distance over district lines be applied to public and nonpublic school students alike. Had the Legislature intended to require complete extra-district busing whenever any busing whatsoever is undertaken, it could easily have <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>done so. Instead it only required that equal opportunities for free transportation be provided to all resident pupils in a school district. Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
