When White’s claims should be satisfied, he was to convey the property back again to Fisher. A proviso was added to the agreement to the effect that if Wilkins was not paid his money within one year, and White, in three years, from the date of the agreement, November 22, 1862, they should respectively have the right to sell the property at public sale, and, after paying themselves out of the proceeds, return the balance to Fisher.</p>

This sum, it will be observed, is less than the debt due White on January 1st of that year, by more than $2,000.

    <p class="summary" id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[256,1438,1169,846]]]'>It is important to keep in view the relations of the parties at the time the several conveyances and contracts were delivered. The sheriff’s sale divested all the title which Fisher had in the property, and his only interest was the agreement which he had with Wilkins and White. This affected no one else without notice, and it does not appear that Witham had notice of any kind. When White conveyed to Witham, the property passed without qualification, and freed from any equity which Fisher may have had therein. When he executed his deed, no interest or equity passed with it. It is more than probable that it was required by Witham as in the nature of a quit-claim deed, and to free the title from all possible equities. This is the natural interpretation and effect of the conveyance, and there is nothing in the case to give it further import. If this be so, how can Fisher have any equity, unless it be by subsequent contract, of which there is no evidence ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b516-7" data-blocks='[["BL_516.7",516,[257,2300,1164,94]],["BL_517.1",517,[209,361,1164,809]]]'>It will be observed that Witham was in no way connected with the property, or with the transactions of Wilkins, White <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>and Fisher in relation thereto, until he purchased. It is not apparent, therefore, how he could be responsible for their actions. It is conceded that there is no evidence of an express agreement between him and Fisher when the deeds were delivered. and there is no act of his inconsistent with unqualified ownership. It is not apparent that Fisher, in Witham’s lifetime, claimed any legal or equitable interest in the property. By accepting the lease and contract to sell, he disavowed all the rights and claims of an owner. It may not be said that he was ignorant of his rights or the method by which they could be secured. -When dealing with Wilkins and White, in the same matter, he obtained written contracts by which his right to purchase was fully established. Why he did not have his alleged agreement with Witham in writing is not explained. This is a significant fact, and, under all circumstances, calculated to throw doubt upon his stale claim.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[207,1178,1167,760]]]'>The title of the defendants rests upon the sheriff’s deed to Wilkins, his deed to White, and the deeds from White and Fisher to Witham, and his ownership unquestioned and acknowledged for more than ten jmars by Fisher, and their undisputed possession for five years longer. To cast doubt upon such a title the evidence should be conclusive. And yet the master reports that all these conveyances, with all their confirmatory facts, were a mortgage, upon evidence which, to say the least of it, is not “ clear, explicit, and unequivocal.” He has clearly and correctly stated the law as follows: “ An absolute deed executed prior to the act of 1881 may be converted into a mortgage by parol proof. But the evidence must be ‘ clear, explicit, and unequivocal.’ It must show an agreement contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of the deed; subsequent admissions alone are not enough.” 1</p>

The <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>memorandum is not inconsistent with unqualified ownership, and shows only that Witham was willing to convey to Fisher without a profit. This is indicated by the provision in the lease to sell for |23,000. If the declarations of Witham had been fully established and were clear and satisfactory, they would have been insufficient, because they were made long after the delivery of the deeds and do not connect themselves with that event. But the witnesses are not trustworthy, nor do they testify to facts which “ clearly, explicitly, and unequivocally ” show that the deeds were intended as a security for a debt, or that at the time of their execution there was any agreement between Fisher and Witham in relation to the property conveyed. And there is no evidence that Fisher was then indebted to Witham.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[247,1083,1173,603]]]'>But, aside from all this, and conceding that the master has deduced proper conclusions from the law and the evidence as to everjdhing which occurred before the delivery of the lease to Fisher, in 1881, we think that instrument conclusive against the claim of the plaintiff. The master, without evidence, has assumed that there was an indebtedness by Fisher to Witham, at the time of the delivery of the deeds, and this assumption pervades his whole report and leads him to wrong conclusions. He regards the contract to sell as vitiating the effect of the lease. In our judgment it makes it stronger, and is an additional admission by the plaintiff that Witham was the owner without qualification of any kind.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[246,1695,1169,605]]]'>We are disposed to consider this instrument as the concentre of all that preceded, and as conclusive of the rights of the parties at the time of its execution, no matter what they may have been before. It clearly defines their relative positions to be that of landlord and tenant, and owner and contracting purchaser. This was the time for Fisher to assert his rights, if any he had, and certainly when dispossessed, he might be expected to give some indication of his claim. He did not commence proceedings until five years after the death of Witham, and this delay is unexplained. It is easier to work up a claim against a dead man’s estate, than to confront him when living.</p>

    <p id="b519-10" data-blocks='[["BL_519.9",519,[216,1486,1167,505]]]'>While a deed, absolute on its face, executed prior to the act of 1881, may be converted into a mortgage by parol proof, it is well settled that the evidence must be clear, explicit, and unequivocal. It must show an agreement, in the nature of a defeasance, contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of the deed. Subsequent admissions alone are not sufficient. The evidence in this stale case falls far below the required standard,, and we therefore think the court below was clearly right in sustaining exceptions to the master’s report, and dismissing the bill.</p>
