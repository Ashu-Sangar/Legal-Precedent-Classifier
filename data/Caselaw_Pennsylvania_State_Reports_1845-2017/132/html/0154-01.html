    <p class="summary" id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[205,895,1166,901]]]'>“ It seems to me that the encumbrance of the left hand and arm of this plaintiff, at the time ho got upon the car in motion, is a very material part of this case; that is, that the plaintiff had disabled himself before he attempted to get on the car, so as to prevent the use of his two hands and two arms, which it would be necessary for him to have the use of to enable him to get safely on the car. The fact that when he attempted to get on the car, which had not come to a full stop, he was not able to take hold of the supports, or uprights, with his left hand, which otherwise would have been a means of absolute safety to to him, is, I think, too material a point to be overlooked in this ease. If he could have taken hold of the upright with his left hand, then, in all probability, he would not have been thrown off as he was. It was the disabling of himself which prevented him from doing, under the circumstances, what he otherwise might have done, and I think, under the ruling in the Ridge Avenue case, this motion for a nonsuit must be granted.

    <p id="b180-6" data-blocks='[["BL_180.6",180,[252,1250,1176,808]]]'>The learned judge below was justified in directing a nonsuit in this case, for the reason that, according to the plaintiff’s own statement of the cause of the accident, he was not entitled to recover. It occurred as he was attempting to get on one of the defendant’s cars while it was still in motion. His left arm was encumbered with his coat and dinner bucket when he placed his foot on the step. The motion of the car caused his foot to slip, and, having only his right hand free, he was unable to hold on, and fell off and was injured. The only alleged negligence on the part of the driver was in loosening the brake when the plaintiff stepped on the car. It may be a jury would have found this to be negligence, and that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence; but it would have been little short of a burlesque upon the administration of the law. The facts being undisputed, the learned judge below did not need the aid of a jury in determining their legal effect.</p>
