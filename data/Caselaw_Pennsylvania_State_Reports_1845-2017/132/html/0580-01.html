Mrs. Heffron, the plaintiff, in her proofs of loss, gives this as the origin of the fire, and upon being called as a witness she testifies : “ I left the lamp up-stairs with the children. I heard a noise like a report. I paid no attention, thinking it was firing outside. Then I saw a light. Went up-stairs and found the bed on fire. I ran out and screamed, and then went <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>back for the children. Could scarcely get them out, the fire was advanced so. The fire was in the second story.” Again, upon being recalled, she further says: “ The fire was in the evening, about ten or quarter after. It occurred by reason of an explosion of a lamp.” This is the whole evidence in the ease, and from her own mouth we thus have it, that the fire occurred from the explosion of a kerosene lamp which she had left up-stairs in the second story. It is true, Mrs. Heffron did not see it explode, and when she heard the explosion attributed it, to another source. But she was up-stairs almost immediately afterwards, and saw the fire in progress, and we have her unqualified statement that such was the origin of it. This is her conclusion from all the facts, some of which no doubt she has not considered it of importance to give. It can hardly be said that this, for the purposes of this suit, leaves the cause conjectural. Taking the statement of Mrs. Heffron, who is the legal plaintiff, in the light of an acknowledgment or admission, it dispenses with the need of further proof.</p>

To warrant this, however, the mistake must be one which materially affects a recovery in the ease, and in the construction which I give to the eighth clause of the policy, as will be seen further on, the question whether the fire originated from an explosion or not, is immaterial.

The company, however, deny any liability to the assured, and this action is to determine that issue.

Assuming that the evidence shows, and that the referee should have so found, that the fire occurred from the explosion of a lamp, is this within the exceptions made in the eighth clause of the policy? This clause is a limitation upon the general liability and undertaking of the company, and its terms are to be construed most favorably to the assured. If there is any lack of clearness, the court certainly will not strain at a construction which will relieve the company, but a doubt, if any, will be resolved in favor of the assured: Teutonia F. Ins. Co. v. Mund, <a href="/pa/102/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="102 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="502750" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0089-01">102 Pa. 89</a>; Allemania F. Ins. Co. v.

They are all sufficiently defined except the second, which is made ambiguous by the absence of any governing words before the word “ explosions.” Something must in any event be supplied, and the controversy is as to what this shall be. The company claim to have a part of the first section repeated and read into the second, so that it shall read, “ nor for loss in case <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>of fire happening by explosions of any kind whatever within the premises.” The plaintiff contends that the simple insertion of the word “ by ” before the word “ explosions ” is all that is warranted. In the one case, the defendants are exempted from liability for this loss; in the other, it falls within the limit of their responsibility. If either of these constructions is equally sustained by the context, that must be taken which is the most favorable to the assured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[187,776,1163,1014]]]'>A careful examination of the question, convinces me that the exception covered by this section is to be restricted to losses arising from explosions, rather than extended to the much broader ground of losses by fire originating from explosions. The former is not only equally as well sustained, by the context, but even better than the other. It is evident that for complete sense, the introductory words of the clause must be repeated with each section. These introductory words stop with the word “loss.” This company shall not be liable for loss, in case of fire happening by any insurrection, etc. This company shall not be liable for loss by explosions, .... nor by concussions merely. This company shall not be liable for loss, when the fire is caused by the fall of a building. This company shall not be liable for loss, where fire heat is used in any process, to the articles damaged by such process. This company shall not be liable for any damage by heat 'within the premises, without combustion. This company shall not be liable for loss, if the assured keep or use on the premises gun-powder, etc. Each section of the whole clause is thus set in the same frame, and it is made harmonious in construction throughout.</p>

There is nothing in the clause itself, nor in the supposed purpose for which it was introduced into the policy, which leads to a different result. It cannot be urged that the excepted losses mentioned in this clause are those of fire alone. It is true that this is the case in all the sections, other than the one in question; but in this one, we clearly have the exception of losses by concussion merely; and losses by explosions within the premises are not out of place in connection therewith. Indeed, damage by these two instrumentalities are so quite alike, that the two are very nat<a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>urally associated together, and may well appear in conjunction with each other, in the midst of excepted losses by fire.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b610-6" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[247,468,1169,544]]]'>Nor are losses by explosion foreign to the risks assumed by insurance against fire. They are like the damages by smoke and water, losses by theft, destruction by the falling of buildings, or injury by fire agencies without actual ignition, all of which are to be found among the losses excepted against, in clauses in policies of insurance similar to the one under consideration. Losses by explosions, as by concussions merely, which we find joined together in this policy, are thus proper subjects of exception from the general liability assumed thereby, and there is nothing which requires us to hold that more than this was intended to be covered.</p>

Robinson, <a href="/ill/64/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="64 Ill. 265" data-case-ids="5307354" data-case-paths="/ill/64/0265-01">64 Ill. 265</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=16%20Am.%20Rep.%20557" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="16 Am.

The policy there provided that the company should not be liable “ for any loss or damage by fire caused by means of an invasion, etc.; . . . . nor for any loss caused by the explosion of gun-powder, camphene, or any explosive substance, or explosions of any kind.” It was contended that the words,- “ explosions of any kind,” protected the company from liability for loss by fire when the fire had been produced by an explosion. B ut the court held that it merely secured exemption from liability for losses caused by explosions, and not from liability for losses by fire caused by an explosion. The case may well be consulted at length for a full discussion of this question.</p>

The clause of exemption there was as follows: “ This company will not be liable for damage to property by lightning aside from fire, nor for any loss or damage by fire happening by means of any invasion, etc.; nor for damage occasioned by the explosion of a steam boiler; nor for damage resulting from such explosion, nor explosions caused by gun-powder, gas or other explosive substances.” It was held that this did not exempt the company from damage by fire resulting from <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>an explosion of gas. This decision is of peculiar interest and importance, because at the same term the case of Ins. Co. v. Foote, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Ohio%20344" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="22 Ohio 344">22 Ohio 344</a>, was also decided, a case which is much relied upon as materially extending the exemption of insurance companies from liability in cases of explosion. The two decisions by the same court at the same term were certainly not intended to be conflicting. The one, therefore, furnishes a check upon carrying the doctrine of the other too far, and, as thus qualified, the latter is not to be regarded as against the conclusions reached in the present case.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b612-12" data-blocks='[["BL_612.10",612,[243,1650,1164,196]]]'>2. That it does not appear, from the evidence, that payment was ever asked or claim presented for payment at' the office of the company at Kittanning, Pennsylvania, as provided for in the policy.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b612-15" data-blocks='[["BL_612.13",612,[239,2210,1165,239]]]'>Answer: The language of the policy is not accurately quoted in this point. The exception provided for in the policy, is “ loss occasioned by an explosion.” The loss to Mrs. Heffron was occasioned by fire, and not by an explosion. The point is therefore denied.4</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b613-8" data-blocks='[["BL_613.8",613,[190,1171,1161,196]]]'>Answer: This is denied.
