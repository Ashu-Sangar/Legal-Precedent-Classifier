The horse started. I endeavored to rein him in, but he started down Twenty-second street, and when midway between Chestnut and Market streets, while I was still holding him in as well as I could, he was then towards the curb, but in some way bis hoofs struck me on the shin-bone, as I believe it is usually called, throwing me out on my shoulder and bead. At tbis time my wife was still in tbe wagon. The horse kept on until it got to the southeast corner of Twenty-second and Chestnut streets, where it collided with another wagon, and the horse dashed on down the street, leaving my wife in the wreck with the wagon at the corner.” It was claimed on behalf of the plaintiff, from other testimony adduced, that Twenty-second street was one of the most frequented streets of the city; that the neighborhood was built up and it was impossible to see or hear a train until it was right overhead; that this caused no danger when trains were run at a moderate speed, but it was the custom of tbe company to run its trains at the highest speed, and two going in opposite directions at the same time; that the noise overhead was so great that it would frighten men, women and children, much less a horse; that the running of two trains over the crossing, at full speed, was at the risk of the lives of those who had occasion to go upon the street; that the company gave no warning or notice of any kind, nor did it use a known and improved journal that would remove or diminish the noise ; and that accidents were an every-day occurrence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a>

On the contrary, it was the work of competent engineers, approved by the chief engineer and surveyor of the city, and in pursuance of an ordinance of councils expressly authorizing it. The sight and sound of a moving train always have a tendency to frighten horses. In this case, the fright was occasioned by the sound. We cannot measure, nor can a jury be properly allowed to measure, the amount of sound which may be made by a railroad train, either in crossing bridges at overhead crossings or at other places. The defendant company, under all the authorities, has the right to operate its road in a lawful manner; and when it does so without negligence, and1 without malice, it is not responsible for injuries occasioned thereby: Penna. ft.
