Section 2 divided all such venders into classes, according to the amount of their gross annual sales made.

    <p class="summary" id="b345-8" data-blocks='[["BL_345.8",345,[187,2294,1156,97]],["BL_346.1",346,[268,365,1169,341]]]'>Precisely the question presented by this case stated came before the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming county in <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>1883, in a proceeding in equity instituted by George Hadtner and others against the city of Williamsport. It was held by that court that a tax like the one in question here was not illegal: Hadtner v. Williamsport, 15 W. N. 138. The decree in that case was not appealed from. I know of no decision by any court in this commonwealth to the contrary, or supporting the contention of defendant’s counsel.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.4",346,[264,723,1172,858]]]'>It has been argued that Banger’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="109 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="542246" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0079-01">109 Pa. 79</a>, is in conflict with the case first cited. In Hadtner v. Williamsport, like in this case, the city authorities had taxed liquor sellers, graduating the tax by the estimated gross annual sales. In Banger’s Appeal, the city of Williamsport attempted to impose an occupation tax. The assessors ascertained what individuals, laborers, merchants, mechanics, etc., earned a year, and rated them accordingly. The assessments for the occupations of various individuals ranged from $25 to $1,400. The Supreme Court held that such assessment was in direct violation of § 1, article IX. of the constitution, which requires that “ all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax; ” that it was not a tax on occupations, but was an income tax for the levying whereof no authority existed. I cannot see that that decision affects the question raised in Hadtner v. Williams-port, and in the case before the court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b346-7" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[262,1588,1169,807]]]'>It is argued here that the grading of the license tax according to the amount of the annual gross sales is illegal, because it is not uniform ; that all liquor sellers should be required to pay the same amount; and that by making the amount of sales a basis, it is in effect an income tax. But this is not a taxing of the person of the liquor seller, but of his property, estimated by the volume of the annual sales. A tax of this character, graded in the same way for state purposes, has been levied and collected for many years. See acts relative to taxation of venders of merchandise, including liquor sellers, of 1841, and its supplements. Being taxation of a thing and not of a person, the classification makes uniformity, the same as in the case of money at interest and real estate. The man who has $2,000 at interest pays twice as much as he who has but $1,000 ; the owner of three dwellings pays three times as much as he whc owns but one, all being of the same value.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.3",347,[189,370,1160,550]]]'>
      <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>■It might De argued that interest on money loaned and rent received, is income, and that a tax on money at interest, or on real estate not occupied by the owner personally, is an income tax. The reasoning would be the same as that employed to demonstrate that the tax paid by the vender of liquors graded by the sales is an income tax. The unsoundness of the reasoning is so apparent that it is unnecessary to combat it. I adopt the views of Judge Cummin, set forth in his opinion in Hadtner v. Williamsport. That opinion meets every point raised by defendant’s counsel in this case. It demonstrates that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[190,929,1160,449]]]'>The rulings of the Supreme Court relative to the classification of cities : Ayars’ App., <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>, and Reading City v.

The effect of those decisions is, that Allentown is and has been, ever since the adoption by the city of the municipal corporation act of 1874, a city of the third class. Said act was adopted in 1874. The twentieth section of the act authorizes the tax here in question.</p>
