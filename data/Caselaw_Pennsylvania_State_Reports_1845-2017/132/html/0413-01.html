The only fraud there was in the transaction was that after Williams received the money from the discount of the note, he did not send the money-back to Burke Brothers. That was a matter between them, which, of course, could not affect the party who had discounted and held the note. Whatever fraud or whatever bad faith there may have been between Williams and Burke Brothers, it could not affect the holder of the note.</p>

So far as that is concerned, we say that it would not have that effect, for the reason that the proof in this case does not go to show that the note was either fraudulently put into circulation, or that it was put' into circulation by undue means. On the contrary, the burden of proof would fall upon the defendants to show that the plaintiff in this case is not a bona fide holder for value. The defendants would be bound to prove that fact.] 1</p>

So that there is really but one question in this case for <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>you to try, and that is whether this plaintiff is a bona fide holder of this note. Is there sufficient evidence here to warrant a jury in finding that this plaintiff does not hold the note, or that he gave no value for it ?

    <p class="summary" id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[158,621,1170,558]]]'>You have, with regard to that, the testimony of the plaintiff, Dr. Lamb, and you have also the testimony of Jesse Williams with regard to the manner in which this note had been discounted. If you believe that testimony, then there can be no question at all as to what your verdict ought to be; it ought to be in favor of the plaintiff. Is there sufficient here for you to say that these witnesses do not tell the truth ? Is there sufficient other testimony, in the case, to show that they do not tell the truth, or is there any statement with regard to what took place, of such a contradictory character as to convince you that what they say is not true ?</p>

That is evident from the appearance of the note itself. You have here not only the note, but you have the indorsements on the note, of D. Williams and William W. Lamb, the signature of the cashier of the Eighth National Bank, and also the protest of the note on October 19, 1887. All this would go to show that this note had passed out of the hands of the firm of D. Williams, prior to its maturity; and if it had passed out of the hands of D. Williams prior to its maturity, and into the hands of other parties, then they would not be affected by any defence which Burke Brothers might have against the payment of the note to D. Williams, unless the parties who hold the note were either not bona fide holders, or had knowledge of the fraudulent manner in which the note might have been issued.] 3</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b440-8" data-blocks='[["BL_440.8",440,[256,1493,1174,287]]]'>Answer: This point we cannot affirm. The fact that the plaintiff indorsed the note and procured the bank to discount the note and give the proceeds to the firm of D.
