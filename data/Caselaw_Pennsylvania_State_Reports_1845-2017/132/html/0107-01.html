    <p class="summary" id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[244,521,1178,1883]]]'>The defendant company has three tracks upon and along Trenton avenue, Philadelphia. On August 9, 1884, and for two or three days prior thereto, a train of loaded coal cars was standing on one of these tracks, between Dauphin and Ohio streets, occupying nearly the whole length of the square. The cars were coupled together, and there was no break or opening in any part of the train, and the train did not cover any crossing. About noon on the day named, an engine pushing a number of box cars, was brought along the same track on which the coal cars were standing, and the train of box cars was joined to the coal train for the purpose of moving the latter. When the two had been coupled together, and just as they were about to move, Gertrude Horsfall, looking out of the window of her house on Trenton avenue, saw the plaintiff’s son ou the track beneath the coupling between two of the coal cars, lying on his back, his head between the rails and his feet hanging over one of them. The train starting, one car passed over the boj'- and cut off his foot; then four car wheels passed over him, before the train was stopped, in consequence of an alarm given by the witness. The injuries thus inflicted on the boy caused his death about three hours later. When he was picked up, a tin pan, partially filled with coal, was found beside him. Mrs. Horsfall was the only person who witnessed the accident. Her testimony describing it, given on behalf of the plaintiff, is quoted in the opinion of the Supreme Court, infra. No witness could give any account of the movements of the deceased immediately prior to the time when he was seen by her, just as the train was starting. The last previous sight of him by any witness ivas about five minutes before the accident, when he started away from the house of his aunt, on a street parallel with and a square away from Trenton avenue, where he was temporarily residing. At the time of the accident, he was ten years and four months old. Mrs. Horsfall testified that she heard 'no bell rung or other warning given that the train was about to move, and that none of its crew were in sight. Testimony for the defendant tended to prove that warning was given.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b133-8" data-blocks='[["BL_133.6",133,[187,932,1166,911]]]'>What is negligence ? It is a failure to perform a duty which the law imposes upon one, under the circumstances of the case. It is want of proper care according to the circumstances. Therefore I propose to leave the question to you, whether or not the railroad company exercised all the care that was proper under the circumstances. If they did, your verdict should be for the defendant. If you find that they did not exercise proper care, that they were negligent in the performance of their duty in the moving of these cars, then you come to another question, which is this: As these cars were upon a public street, people had a right to go over and across them upon matters of business, and they had a right to require that the railroad company should give proper notice of its movement of the train in order to notify them of the danger. If you find that this boy was there in the proper exercise of his right, and that the railroad company did not fulfil its duty according to the circumstances, then you should render a verdict for the plaintiff in such amount as I have indicated to you would be proper.</p>

Whether that is the real truth of the occurrence; whether that is what he was there for, of course we do not know. You are to judge of that by the evidence, by the people who testified, by the surroundings, and by what you know of life yourselves. Of course, if he was stealing coal under the train, and the railroad company intentionally ran over him, then the company would be responsible for damages ; but I suppose it is hardly contended that they did this on purpose.</p>

The train being a continuous one, without any openings for passage ways, there was no invitation to pedestrians to pass through, either direct or indirect.

The boy was not a trespasser, but was in the exercise of a right. He had rights upon the track, as well as the railroad company, and the jury could infer from the evi-. dence, and their general knowledge, that he was under the train for a lawful purpose. The evidence points to an intention on his part to cross under the train. The fact of his being upon his back when the train was in motion and struck him, is of no importance; that position may have been assumed in his efforts to get from under the cars when he heard them move, or may have resulted from his being struck by some portion of the car. It was not until the train was moving, that he was upon his back. Nor does the fact that a pan with some coal in it was found near the spot, after he was picked up, justify a different inference; there is no testimony that he had anything to do with the pan. Moreover, as no one saw what he was doing before the train started, the plaintiff is entitled to the presumption that the boy was acting lawfully.</p>

In all the cases cited for the appellant upon the question of negligence, the trespasser was either upon the cars of the railroad company unlawfully, or else was walking along the track and was injured by a passing train. It may be said, generally, that all of the cases cited upon the subject of children as trespassers have been restricted, and perhaps to some extent overruled, by Biddle v.

The railroad company, however was itself a trespasser in this case. It had the right to the use of the public street for the purpose of moving trains along its tracks, but had no right to make it a place for the storage of cars, or to leave trains standing there for days at a time. Its leaving this train on the street for three days was unlawful. If both parties are trespassers, neither can take advantage of this against the other, and the question of trespass drops out of the case, leaving only the question who was negligent.

    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[185,678,1166,747]]]'>The witness had previously testified that there was a train of small coal-cars standing on the track, reaching nearly a square, the majority of which were full, and it was under these cars that the boy was lying on his back immediately before and at the time he was run over and killed. She also said the whole train was coupled together; that there was no opening between the cars, and the place of the accident was between two streets. There was no contradiction of these facts; on the contrary, they were confirmed by the defendant’s witnesses as to everything they saw, but none of them saw the actual collision. Several of the trainmen, who were examined, came to the spot immediately after the accident, and one of them lifted the boy out from underneath the car.

The train was just starting, and was moving slowly, so that it was stopped when four wheels had passed over the boy. He was lying underneath the cars, and there is no evidence that he was endeavoring to cross the track. As a matter of course he was not, and could not be, in such circumstances, in the exercise of any legal right. Railroad tracks are not made for persons young or old to lie down upon, in any circumstances ; much less so when cars are standing on the track. They are not intended for any such use, and any person who makes such use of a track is undoubtedly a trespasser.</p>
