The defendants were bound to convey the property, and the plaintiffs to pay $6,000 for it. This appears from the language of the receipt or agreement itself, without resorting to the aid of anjr extraneous evidence. Thus, it recites that $50 have been deposited by the plaintiff to secure the consummation of an agreement entered into for the purchase and sale of the premises “ which I have agreed to sell him, and which he has agreed to purchase for the price or sum of six thousand (6,000) dollars, to be paid in cash upon the execution of a good and sufficient deed of conveyance to him of • said premises within sixty days from this day.”</p>

Evidently, the primary object of the memorandum or receipt was <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>to set forth the fact, so that no room could arise for future dispute, that an agreement had been entered into between the parties for the purchase and sale of the premises, and that $50 hand money had been paid to bind the bargain. The addition of the clause fixing a time limit for the performance of the remaining duties that rested upon the parties, and fixing a penalty for non-performance, in no way changed the character of the writing. At the time the agreement of minds was reached, the equitable title to the property vested in the purchaser, and the defendants’ right to the payment of the purchase money at the termination of the sixty days became fixed.</p>

Thus, it is said by a well-known text writer: “ Where a contract depends upon a condition precedent,.....then equity will not relieve,.....for no court has the power to make a new contract for the parties, which shall confer rights where no rights at all originally existed. But.....if the intention of the parties is that the rights under the agreement shall vest at once upon its conclusion, subject, however, to be defeated or ended upon the non-performance of the provision which constitutes the subsequent condition, or its non-performance at or before a specified day, then equity, by virtue of its general jurisdiction over penalties and forfeitures, has power to relievo the defaulting party from the loss or forfeiture caused by his breach of this subsequent condition. This power of relief would even more certainly exist when the breach was a failure, not to do the thing at all, but merely to do it at or within the time stipulated by the contract. It is therefore held in a great number of cases, that the forfeiture provided for by such a clause as the one described above, on the failure of the party to fulfil at the proper time, unless such failure is intentional, or causes an injury to the other party, which cannot be compensated, will be disregarded and set aside in equity, and the defaulting party performing or being ready and willing to perform, at a subsequent time, will be allowed to enforce the contract notwithstanding his delay: ” Pomeroy on Specif.

Both parties must have a right to a decree; otherwise, it would follow that the court would decree a specific performance when the party called upon to perform it might be in this situation, that if the agreement was disadvantageous to him he would be liable to the performance, and yet if advantageous he could not compel it: ” Meason v.

The court, however, held that the lessee acquired an equitable right by the contract; that time was not essential, and that he was entitled to a specific performance. Per Woodward, J.: “Mere default in the payment of the money at a stipulated time admits in general of compensation, and hence time of payment is seldom treated as of the essence of real contracts.” It would appear, therefore, that even if the agreement of August 9th, would bear the interpretation contended for, viz.: that it gave to the plaintiff a mere option to purchase, unless the non-payment of the price on the sixtieth day worked an injury to the defendants not to be compensated by payment of interest, it could still be specifically enforced.</p>

Heavy prices were paid for neighboring properties as soon as it was discovered that this corporation was the purchaser. The master is not satisfied, however, that in the three days between October 8th and 11th, there was any substantial increase in the value in property in that neighborhood, and it is to these three days that the rise in the value must be traced: Taylor v.

If this delay worked hardship to the defendants, of course he would have to bear the responsibility; but no such results ensued. The defendant, Mr. Born, was in the occupancy of the premises, and under the terms of the agreement was to remain so till January 1st following. He has not shown that he had <em>made </em>any arrangements for the disposition of the purchase money, that were frustrated by its non-payment on October 8th; and the other defendant, Mr. Supplee, who, although he held the title, was so associated with Mr. Born as to permit himself to be governed by his wishes in the matter, has not offered any reasons to conclude that he would have been in any way inconvenienced by the delay.</p>

By not availing himself of his privilege, within that time, the plaintiff lost his right to insist upon a conveyance. The general rule under which courts of equity do not regard time as essential in contracts for the purchase and sale of real estate, is not intended to be applied so as in effect to substitute a new contract made by the court for that agreed to by the parties, but is confined to cases in which its application is necessary to prevent one party from taking an unconscionable advantage of the other; where no such reason exists, the rule has no application, and the court will leave the parties to their remedy at law: Benedict v.

In the case in hand, it will be seen that on October 10, 1888, Supplee had no remedy whatever against Sylvester, for his only cause of action was a money demand. In Pennsylvania, equity will not enforce specific performance in favor of a vendor against a vendee, where only money can be recovered: Kauffman’s App., <a href="/pa/55/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="55 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1470651" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0383-01">55 Pa. 383</a>; Dech’s App., <a href="/pa/57/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="57 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1010460" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0467-01">57 Pa. 467</a>. At law, he was equally remediless. Being in possession, he could not bring ejectment. In a suit on the contract, his measure of damages would be, at the utmost, any depreciation in the value of the property, and against that liability Sylvester was protected by the stipulation making the nominal sum deposited “liquidated damages.” As Sylvester could have been compelled neither to take the property nor to pay damages for not taking it, it follows that he cannot compel its conveyance.</p>

It is not the rule that in equity the time limit stated in a contract will govern, unless equitable ground is shown to avoid it.

Perf., § 1042; Parkin v. Thorold, 16 Beav. 59; Remington v. Irwin, <a href="/pa/14/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="14 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="405874" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0143-01">14 Pa. 143</a>; Day v.

The question on which side the burden of showing equity rests, is, however, not of much importance in the present case, since established and undisputed facts render it clearly most inequitable to forfeit, the plaintiff’s right because of the three days’ delay. The actions of the parties clearly show that neither of them understood time to be of the essence of the contract. It was treated as being in force three days after the limit had expired, and it was only when a collateral dispute arose that the vendor attempted to enforce the time clause. The vendor’s conduct in failing to insist upon a settlement within the specified time, and in subsequently agreeing upon a future day for the settlement, was of itself a waiver of the time limit: Fry on Specif. Perf., § 1090. At all events, equity will not allow the time clause to defeat the plaintiff, in the circumstances: Remington v. Irwin, <a href="/pa/14/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="14 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="405874" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0143-01">14 Pa. 143</a>.</p>

This was neither a verbal sale, nor a unilateral contract, nor an option. It was a binding agreement in writing, signed by the vendor and delivered to and accepted by the vendee. Courts of equity have always enforced specific performance of contracts of sale signed by the vendor alone: Palmer v. Scott, 5 Russ. &amp; M. 391. Even where it is doubtful whether the vendee is bound also, the filing of the bill is considered an acceptance on his part which renders the contract mutual: Woodruff v. Woodruff, <a href="/nj-eq/44/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="44 N.J. Eq. 349" data-case-ids="809825" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/44/0349-01">44 N. J. Eq. 349</a>; Fry on Specif. Perf., § 291. The argument that as the vendor cannot go into equity where his right is solely to receive the purchase money, therefore the vendee cannot do so either, would logically require that the vendee be refused specific performance in every case of a sale for a cash price, and it confounds mutuality of remedy with mutuality of form of remedy. Moreover, the insertion in the contract of a provision for a penalty or for liquidated damages does not prevent specific performance: Fry on Specif. Perf., § 116.</p>
