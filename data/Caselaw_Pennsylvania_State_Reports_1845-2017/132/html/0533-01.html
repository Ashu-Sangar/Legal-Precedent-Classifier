We have been referred to, and have examined these cases, but we find that the statutes of these states are much broader than our act. They authorize a married woman to devise her real estate in the same manner, and with the like effect, as if she were unmarried. Our act of 1887 does not give the devise any effect.

At common law this husband could not have taken as tenant by the curtesy, because there was no issue born alive capable of inheriting. Prior to 1887, he would have been entitled to take, but his right would have been statutory, depending on the act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 316, and not upon any principle of the common law. By §§ 5 and 6 of the Married Person’s Property Act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332, a wife is given full power to dispose of her real estate in the same manner as if she were unmarried, and all acts inconsistent therewith are repealed. In § 5 there are clearly two distinct thoughts; one is, that she may execute her will the same as an unmarried woman, and the other is that she may dispose of her property in the same manner as if she were unmarried. The act contains no provision like § 10 of the act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 537,.excluding from its operation the curtesy of the husband. The words of the act are plain, and the manifest intention of the legislature was, not simply to prescribe the manner of executing a married woman’s will, but to give her a power of testamentary disposition as absolute as that of an unmarried woman.</p>

Our act would seem to be as clear in its purpose as the statutes referred to in the cases cited. Why should not full scope be given to it, instead of frittering it away by efforts to construe it in accordance with our notions of how it ought to have been written ? The construction placed upon the act by sue appellee, that the words, <em>“ </em>in the same manner as if she were unmarried,” refer to the signing, is an unreasonable one. Matrimony can make no difference in the signing; whether married or unmarried, the testatrix must use a signature or a cross. Before the act, a wife could dispose of her real estate by will, but the disposition was subject to the husband’s right to take his curtesy, and the act was intended to remedy this. This is made more clear by the title; it purports to be an act defining the interests of husband and wife in the estates of each other. The fact that the marriage of these parties and the wife’s seisin of the real estate antedated the passage of the act, can make no difference. Notwithstanding those facts, the legislature had power by the act to take away the husband’s inchoate rights: Moninger v. Ritner, <a href="/pa/104/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="104 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="452159" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0298-01">104 Pa. 298</a>.</p>

The construction of the act of June 3, 1887, contended for by the appellant, not only would destroy the estate of curtesy, but would deprive the husband of all right in his wife’s estate as against her will. Every presumption is against an intention on the part of the legislature to work this result. All the legislation upon the subject has manifested a clearly defined intent to preserve the curtesy, and maintain the reciprocal rights of husband and wife in their respective estates: Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 316; act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430; Clarke’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=79%20Pa.%20378" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="79 Pa. 378">79 Pa. 378</a>. The acts of April 22, 1850, P.

The remaining part of the language of § 5 of the act of 1887 simply relieves a married woman from the formalities required by the act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 537, in the execution of her will. This was the spirit and reason of the act, and such an interpretation gives the section a full and beneficial meaning, consistent with former acts: Endlich &amp; Richards on Married Women, § 57; Kneedler v.

In Michigan and New York laws have been enacted which in express terms invest a married woman with power to devise real estate with the like effect as if she were unmarried, and under this language the courts of those states have necessarily held the estate of curtesy to be at an end, but those decisions are not applicable in the construction of this act. Even if it could be given a construction fatal to the estate of curtesy generally, the act of 1887 would not operate against the claim of the husband in the present case, for the reason that at the time of the passage of the law the identical freehold estate now claimed was vested in him, both the marriage and the wife’s acquisition of the real estate having taken place prior to 1887. Under the constitution the legislature was without power to divest this vested estate by any action it might take: Peck v.

This would be a remarkable piece of legislation if capable of such a construction. It would be the more so, from the fact that the same act provides that a married woman shall not convey or mortgage her real estate without the consent of her husband. The plain meaning of the statute is that hereafter a married woman may execute her will in the same manner as if she were single. Prior thereto the law required certain formalities to be observed in the execution of a married woman’s will, which were not necessary in the will of a feme-sole.
