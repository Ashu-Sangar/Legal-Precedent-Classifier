    <p class="summary" id="b257-8" data-blocks='[["BL_257.7",257,[193,1449,1170,594]]]'>The contract discloses an agreement to buy the piano for a fixed sum, the payments to be made in monthly portions; it also discloses an agreement on the part of the owner to sell upon the terms offered. The piano is then delivered. There is a further stipulation that if the terms of sale are not complied with, then the contract of sale shall be converted into a bailment. The down money and the monthly payments are to be treated, in the first instance, as payments on account of the purchase; and it is only in the event of a failure to comply with the full conditions of sale, that these payments are to be considered a compensation for the use or bailment of the instrument.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b257-9" data-blocks='[["BL_257.8",257,[194,2062,1167,291]]]'>In Wire Book S. M. Co. v. Crowell, 19 W. N. 55, the court said: “ This is a clear case of a conditional sale on credit, followed by a delivery of possession, with a provision to convert the sale into a bailment, if the price of the machines should not be paid. This provision was not sufficient to convert the contract into a bailment ab initio.”</p>

If this be true, then two separate contracts existed; first, one of bailment, and secondly, a sale. We cannot so read this paper. One part of the contract did not antedate the other. Robeson did not obtain possession of the piano for use, and then after such possession make a new contract to buy. The paper constitutes but one contract, and delivery was made under it, not under a part of the agreement. This is the evidence and the jury so found.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b258-6" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[282,834,1179,1058]]]'>But if we were to concede to the plaintiff the right to divide his agreement and treat each part as independent of the other, he still stands on very narrow ground. He has a valuable piano delivered for use, with no stipulation for its return or consideration for its use. While these may not be absolutely necessary to constitue a bailment: Edwards’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="105 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="454216" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0103-01">105 Pa. 103</a>, still they are the usual attendants, and of great aid in determining the character of the transaction where doubt arises. Still more, there is no limit of time during which the piano may be used. This alleged lease is without term, without consideration for use, and without any provision for a redelivery.' We must gather the intention of the parties from the paper as a whole, and it is immaterial whether the stipulation for use precedes or follows the other provisions of the contract. It is usually found in conditional sales where the vendor seeks to secure his purchase money. Such a provision is found in Wire Book S. M. Co. v. Crowell, supra, and Forrest v. Nelson, <a href="/pa/108/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="108 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="539268" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0481-01">108 Pa. 481</a>; that is, the vendee is to have no more than the use of the property until all the payments are made. The facts of the cases just cited are in full accord with those of the case at bar.</p>

This was the test applied in Forrest v. Nelson, <a href="/pa/108/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="108 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="539268" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0481-01">supra,</a> and the same test applied to our contract leads to a like conclusion. The parties agreed upon the price of the instrument and the terms of future payment; the delivery followed. The use was to pass to the vendee, but the title was to remain in the vendor for the sole purpose of securing him in <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>the purchase money. The agreement is a contract of sale in its very inception, and a delivery in pursuance of such sale.</p>
