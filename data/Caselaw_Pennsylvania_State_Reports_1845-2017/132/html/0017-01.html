Holmes, by way of remainder under this my will, after the deaths of my sons, James P. and <em>Peter </em>A., and the wife of the latter, that the said'children shall take and enjoy the same in the same proportions as the sums I have given to or for them respectively after the death of the said Ann M.

    <p class="summary" id="b44-7" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[274,1303,1169,390]]]'>The testator had created a number of trusts for the lives of his different children, and had very minutely directed the disposition of the trust funds after their respective deaths. With regard to Mrs. Holmes, after her death the estate held for her was to be distributed as follows: $2,000 to her son, George W. Holmes, absolutely, and $5,000 to be held in trust for her daughter, Harriet Jamison, and the residue to be divided among the children of the testator whom he named in his will.</p>

This would undoubtedly be true if the ninth clause were eliminated from this will, as in the trust for his son, James P., it is provided that in the event of the termination of the said trust by his death and the distribution of the trust estate among his brothers and sisters, they are to hold their respective shares upon the same trusts and with the same conditions and limitations as the testator had directed with regard to the shares of his estate given and devised unto them respectively. But the testator, before he closed his-will by the ninth clause, which is the very last one in which he makes any disposition of his estate, alters and changes all this, so far as it relates to the share of Mrs. Holmes, and thereby declares with <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>regard to any portion of Ms estate that shall come to or vest in the children of his daughter, Mrs. Holmes, under the clause creating the trust for his son, James P., it shall, after the death of Mrs. Holmes, vest, two sevenths in her son, George W. Holmes, and five sevenths in trust for her daughter, Harriet Jamison. Here there is an entirely different disposition of this portion of his estate from what he had previously made with reference thereto. Why the testator made this change is immaterial. That he fully intended to make it is very evident from the fact that this ninth clause was written in the will. It does not mention any other subject, and relates to none of his other children or to any other part or share of his estate, and could not possibly have been inserted without the testator having in his mind some clear and well-defined purpose, and what that purpose was is evident from the words of this clause. If it is repugnant or inconsistent with any previous portion of the will, the other portion must give way, and this be regarded as the testator’s last will and testament. The auditing judge was, therefore, correct in distributing this fund under the ninth clause of the testator’s will, and therefore the exceptions are dismissed and adjudication confirmed.</p>
