It is claimed that the acquisition and holding of said lands was in violation of the act of assembly of April 26,1855, which declares in the fifth section “ that no corporation other than such as shall have been incorporated under the laws of this state, nor shall any foreign government, potentate or power, hereafter acquire and hold any real estate within this commonwealth directly in the corporate name, or by or through any trustee or other device whatsoever, unless specially authorized to hold such property by the laws of this commonwealth.” Section 9 provides: “ That all property hereafter acquired and held by persons, corporations, or associations, forbidden by this act to hold the same, or held contrary to the intent of this act, and all such hereafter acquired and held beyond the limit prescribed as aforesaid by this act, shall escheat to this commonwealth, and upon the same being adjudged to have escheated <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>under proceedings in court by quo warranto in all respects as is provided by law in the case of the usurpation of any corporate franchise, the same shall be taken in possession and disposed of, and with the like compensation to the person or persons informing and procuring the inquisition as in cases of property escheated for defect of heirs.”</p>

That such ownership and business are prohibited by § 5, article XVII. of the constitution of this state, which declares that “ no incorporated company doing the business of a common carrier shall, directly or indirectly, prosecute or engage in mining or manufacturing articles for transportartion over its works; nor shall such company, directly or indirectly, engage in any other business than that of common carriers, or hold or acquire lands, freehold or leasehold, directly or indirectly, except such as shall be necessary for carrying on its business; but any mining or manufacturing company may carry the products of its mines and manufactories on its railroad or canal, not exceeding fifty miles in length.” Section 12 of the same article of the constitution provides that “ the general assembly shall enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.”</p>

We are of the opinion that as the constitution has not provided for any escheat or forfeiture of lands, acquired and held in violation of § 5, article XVII., none can be declared. It was evidently intended by the framers of the constitution of 1874, that the “ general assembly should by appropriate legislation enforce the provisions ” of the fifth section of the seventeenth article, by prescribing what penalties should be incurred for its violation. The general assembly has failed to pass such legislation, and until they do the courts cannot enforce this section in this mode of proceeding. The commonwealth may <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>have a remedy by a proceeding to forfeit the charter of a corporation acquiring or holding lands in violation of this section, but it cannot escheat the lands.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b621-3" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[203,543,1167,1373]]]'>But it is argued that under the provisions of this act of assembly of April 26, 1855, the lands can be escheated, under proceedings instituted under this act. While it is true that the fifth section of said act prohibits any foreign corporation from acquiring and holding real estate within the commonwealth, either directly in its corporate name, or by or through any trustee or other device whatever, and the ninth section provides the penalty for such acquiring and holding, viz., by escheating the lands, yet the third section of the act, in express terms, declares that the shares held by shareholders in mining and manufacturing companies shall be taken to be personal property, conferring a right to receive dividends of the profits and proceeds of the real estate held by such companies, but not to create any title in the shareholders in and to such real estate. Here is a legislative declaration that the ownership of the stocks of a mining or manufacturing company does not constitute the holding of lands under this act, and therefore does not come within its prohibition. Besides, the act of April 15,1869, P. L. 31, makes it lawful for railroad and canal companies to aid corporations authorized by law to develop the coal, iron, lumber, or other material interests of this commonwealth, by the purchase of their capital stock and bonds, or either of them. The words of this statute are plain and of easy interpretation, and the courts should not give such a construction to them as would destroy existing rights.

The introduction of this additional link in the chain of title can make no difference in the result between the two cases.

No interest in any of the lands mentioned in the information accrued to the New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad Co. under the contract between Watson and Earley, or under the subsequent conveyance to the Northwestern Mining &amp; Exchange Co. A resulting trust arises only by the operation of the legal presumption that the intention of the parties is to create it. In the present case, the facts show the intention of the parties to have been that the lands should be conveyed to the mining and exchange company, a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to hold them, and if Earley was trustee for anybody, he was trustee for that corporation. From July 13, 1874, the entire title was in it, until it subsequently conveyed the lands to another Pennsylvania corporation having like authority to take and hold them. In no event could a resulting trust arise in favor of the Erie Railway Co. for a greater proportion of the title than the $25,000, paid prior to the assignment of the contract by Watson, bears to the whole purchase money. But no matter where the equitable title was prior to July, 1874, the defect of title, if any, was cured by the acts of May 8, 1876, P. L. 127, May 22, 1878, P. L. 85, and April 8, 1881, P. L. 9. An acceptance by the Northwestern Mining &amp; Exchange Co. of the constitution of 1874 is not a condition of the application of these acts to it. It is not so, under § 10, article XVII. of the constitution, because that company is not a railroad, canal or transportation company, and is not subject to § 1, act of May 22, 1878, P.

There is a vast difference between the ownership of land by a foreign corporation, and its ownership of shares of stock in a mining company chartered by and under the control of the state. To the latter are incident none of the evils which the statute of mortmain was designed to prevent. The express enactment in § 3 of the very act under which a forfeiture is now claimed, however, renders the decisions cited unnecessary to sustain our position. That section enacts that shares in certain classes of corporations, including mining companies, shall be taken to be personal property and not to create any title in the shareholder to the real estate held by such companies. As this was but a re-statement of what had been the law before, the only purpose of its insertion was to cut up by the roots the possibility of the very argument now advanced in the commonwealth’s name. In the construction of a statute every part of it must be viewed in connection with the whole: Potter’s Dwarris, 144, rule 12. By the section referred to, the legislature unmistakably intended to declare that for the purposes of the act the holding of stocks, in the classes of corporations named, shall not be considered a holding of land “ by device,” though the holding of stocks in other corporations may be so. The purchase of stock made in the present instance was authorized expressly by the act of April 15,1869, P. L. 31. <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>Upon, the right to aid mining companies by purchasing their stock which it confers, no restriction as to amount is placed.

The operation of § 5, article XVII. of the constitution, upon the rights of the railroad company in the lands in question, is not raised upon the present record, because the railroad company is stated by the information to be a foreign corporation, and it is not averred that it owns or operates a mile of railroad in this state; and the constitutional article containing that section assumes to and can regulate only corporations chartered by or doing business within the state. Nor can any es-cheat be declared under the act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 829, under which alone this proceeding is instituted, even if there were a technical infringement of the constitution. The ingenious argument for the commonwealth that because the constitution prohibits the holding of the lands by this railroad company, and its holding of the stock of the corporation which owns them, constitutes substantially a holding of the lands themselves, within the meaning of the constitution, and because the act of 1855 provides for an escheat of all lands held by corporations not authorized to hold them, therefore, these lands may be escheated in this proceeding for violation of the constitutional provision, falls to the ground as soon as we supply the omitted premise that the act of 1855 itself declares that the holding of stock in a mining corporation shall not be deemed a holding of lands for the purposes of its enactments respecting such forfeitures.</p>

Nor was it denied that under the act of April 15, 1869, P. L. 31, the New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad Company had the right to purchase and hold all or any portion of the stock of the Northwestern Mining &amp; Exchange Company.

It was to authorize railroad and canal companies to employ their capital and credit to aid in the development of the mineral resources of the commonwealth. Such development, as every one knows, is in many instances beyond the reach of individual enterprise. It was easy enough to form corporations with all the requisite <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>powers for this purpose. It was a very different thing to find capitalists to take their stocks or bonds. Hence it was that the legislature gave to railroad and canal companies the power to purchase both stocks and bonds of such companies. Nor was any limitation placed upon this power. They might buy a portion or all of the stock. It probably never occurred to the legislative mind that, while the purchase of a portion of the stock of a mining company would be aiding such corporation to develop the mineral resources of the state, the purchase of a majority of or the whole of the stock of such company might be held to be a “device” to evade the act of 1855. However that may be, the act of 1869 was evidently intended to legalize, and perhaps encourage, railroad and canal companies to invest in this species of mining companies. It involved, necessarily, the control of such companies by the corporations making such investments, to the extent of the stock held by them. A majority of the stock controls the corporation; the corporation controls the land held by it. In this sense, and to this extent, the act of 1869 enabled railroad companies to control real estate, the title to which they were forbidden to hold directly or indirectly by the act of 1855. It must not be forgotten, however, that controlling real estate, by means of the ownership of a majority of the stock of such corporation, is a very different matter from holding the title to such real estate. The one is legalized by the act of 1869; the other is forbidden by the act of 1855.</p>

It is admitted that the whole interest in the stock of the mining company was owned and controlled by the railroad company. It was contended that this was not aiding the mining company, but was a mere scheme or “ device ” to hold lands in violation of law. This was the view taken of it by our Brother Sterrett, in the former opinion of this Court, and in that case it was directed that the question whether it was a “ device ” to evade the act of 1855 should be submitted to a jury. That case was not heard before a full bench; those who heard it were not unanimous; it involved a question of grave importance, and a majority of those who <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>heard the argument were in favor of taking the verdiet of a 'jury upon the facts. As the question is now presented here, and as it was presented below, there are no disputed facts. It is conceded that at the time these proceedings were commenced the title to the lands was in the Northwestern Mining &amp; Exchange Company; that the said company was expressly authorized by law to hold them; that the stock of said last-named corporation is held or controlled by the railroad company, which company is in terms authorized by the act of 1869 to hold it; that the stock so held is personal property, and that the railroad company does not hold the title to said real estate, or to any portion of it either in its own name, or by or through a trustee. With the facts upon the record undisputed, we cannot evade the responsibility of this case by throwing it upon a jury. With the facts admitted, it is the duty of this court to pass upon their legal effect, and the verdict of a jury could not aid us. Moreover, if we submit this question to a jury, we would have no rule whatever. Different juries, in different counties, might find conflicting verdicts, in which case we would have the strange result that in one county the transaction would be held to be legal, while in an adjoining county it would be held to be illegal. We were informed upon the argument, and have no doubt of its truth, that a vast amount of real estate in this commonwealth is held by corporations similar to the Northwestern Mining &amp; Exchange Company, and chartered by the state for the purpose, inter alia, of holding the title to such property; that the stock of said companies is largely held by railroad corporations, in pursuance of the act of 1869, and that the said real estate is in whole or in part controlled by the latter class of corporations, by means of their stock. If in all such cases the question whether the holding of such stock is a “ device ” on the part of the railroad companies to evade the act of 1855 must be submitted to a jury, the consequences might be very serious and destructive of vested rights. To say the least, it would introduce an element of uncertainty into the titles to a large amount of property, which it would be difficult for a purchaser to protect himself against. The possibility of such results admonishes as to move with caution, and to hesitate ere we finally adopt a principle which may lead to such confusion.</p>

      <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>If there is anything that is clear in this case, it is that the defendant railroad company has no title, legal or equitable, to this land. Its whole title thereto, in fee-simple, passed bjr the conveyance to the Northwestern Mining &amp; Exchange Company. Attention is again called to the act of 1855; and, at the risk of being prolix, I repeat it:</p>
    <blockquote id="b633-3" data-blocks='[["BL_633.4",633,[186,665,1163,245]]]'>“ No corporation.....shall.....hereafter acquire and hold any real estate within this commonwealth, directly in the corporate name, or by or through any trustee, or other device whatsoever, unless specially authorized to hold such property by the laws of this commonwealth.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b633-5" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[182,919,1167,1067]]]'>It will be observed that the prohibition of the act is of a threefold character, viz.: (a) Holding real estate in its corporate name; (5) by means of a trustee; and (c) by any device whatever. It must be conceded, indeed it is not denied, that there is no violation of the first two prohibitions. It is equally clear to my mind there is no violation of the third, for the reason that the railroad company has, as before stated, no title to the real estate of any kind. If it has no title, how can it hold title by a “device?” The only answer that has or can be made to this is that the company controls said real estate. If we concede this proposition, where, in the act of 1855, is there to be found a prohibition of a railroad company controlling the use of real estate ? The act strikes only at the holding of the title; and, as it is a highly penal statute,' — penal to the extent of practically confiscating all real estate held in violation thereof, — we are not at liberty to extend it beyond its terms. The legislature may have had good reasons to prohibit railroad companies from holding the title to large bodies of mining lands. They may not have had the same reasons to move them to prohibit all control over them. At any rate, they have not done so, which is sufficient for our purpose.</p>

It must be manifest that, before there can be an escheat of these lands under the act of 1855, it must appear that the defendant railroad company holds the title thereto in its corporate name, or by or through a trustee, or by some device by means of which said company not only controls the lands, but enjoys the beneficial ownership thereof. In other words, it must have either the legal or the equitable title, or it has no title whatever. If it <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>has no title, there can be no escheat of the lands as real estate.

    <blockquote id="b634-6" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[245,517,1171,401]]]'>“ That the shares held by shareholders in all incorporated land and building associations^ and mining and manufacturing companies, shall be taken to be personal property, conferring a right to receive dividends of the profits and proceeds of the real estate held by such companies, but not to create any title in the shareholder in or to such real estate, which shall be subject only to the liens of and be fully conveyed by the corporation holding the title and owning the same. ”</blockquote>
    <p id="b634-7" data-blocks='[["BL_634.5",634,[242,925,1172,400]]]'>This section of the act of 1855 is a distinct declaration by the law-making power that shares of stock held in a mining company are personal property, and create or give no title to the holder of such shares in or to any of the real estate held by such company. How, then, is it possible to escheat it as real estate, belonging to or held for the company owning the shares ? The law having fixed its character, I do not see how the parties can change it, even by a “ device.”</p>

    <p id="b635-3" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[202,620,1165,1115]]]'>In the absence of any evidence that the defendant company had accepted the provisions of the above article, it is urged that it cannot claim the benefit of the act referred to. It is doubtless true that, before a railroad company can enjoy the benefit of new legislation enlarging its powers or increasing its facilities, it must formally accept all of the provisions of the seventeenth article of the constitution relating to railroads and canals. This question, however, is not raised. The act of 1881 is in the way of the commonwealth. No one doubts that the act of 1855, imposing the penalty of escheat, could at any time have been repealed by the legislature. The repeal of the act would have been an answer to this proceeding. The commonwealth would have nothing to rest it upon. The act of 1881 does not in terms repeal the act of 1855, but it removes the penalty. This information was not filed until several years after the passage of the act of 1881; nor had any inquisition been taken against the real estate in controversy, until after it had been conveyed to the Northwestern Mining &amp; Exchange Company. The case comes, therefore, precisely within the terms of the act of 1881, and, were we in doubt as to our former position, we might well affirm the judgment upon this ground alone.</p>
