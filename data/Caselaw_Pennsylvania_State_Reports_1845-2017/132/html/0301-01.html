When the agreement was executed, but five patterns of the patented sheets were in use, and a schedule was made of them in the agreement at the different prices at which they were to be supplied: “And for prints made from any new or additional blocks, plates or designs, at such rates as may be from time to time mutually agreed upon between the said Loag and the said Smith, and approved by Robert M.

A number of meetings were held and various changes in the old contract were suggested, but no satisfactory arrangement was reached. The negotiations continued until finally on April 23, 1884, Smith received a communication from Loag and Tudor, notifying him that further supplies would cease, and that his business had been transferred to other parties. Shortly after, Smith sent an order to Loag for some supplies, but defendant refused to furnish them. Then this suit was brought.</p>

We are wholly unable to see how he could claim more. The contract fixed the price of the five existing patterns, and then provided: “ And for prints made from any new or additional blocks, plates, or designs, at such rates as may be from time to time mutually agreed upon between the said Loag and the said Smith, and approved by Robert M. Tudor, the said patentee.” The agreement further provided that it might be extended for another period of five years, etc. In point of fact it was not extended, and no price was agreed upon for the new plates. No controversy arose as to the old patterns. The price was never increased. It is very evident there was no binding agreement as to anything but the first five patterns, and as to them there is no breach of contract alleged, although the pleadings are not given, and it is not easy to find out what the case is about <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>from the paper-books.
