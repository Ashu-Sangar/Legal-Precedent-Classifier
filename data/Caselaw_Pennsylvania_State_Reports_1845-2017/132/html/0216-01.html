When both the parties purchased, the lots were unimproved and lay below the grade of the street, which was then paved and sewered. In the summer of 1887, the plaintiff built several dwellings upon the front of his property. In the fall of the same year the defendant sold the rear end of his lot, and his grantee built upon it, filling up some feet behind the buildings erected. Before the buildings were erected upon these ■ lots, the water falling upon the surface would pass off by a natural drainage, the direction of which was disputed in the testimony. Whether the surface water upon defendant’s lot could be drained by the sewer, was also disputed. In the fall and winter of 1887-8, the water falling upon the defendant’s property accumulated and flowed therefrom upon the property of the plaintiff and into his cellars. Hence this suit.</p>
