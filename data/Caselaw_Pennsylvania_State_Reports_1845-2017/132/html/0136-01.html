Neither party at that time contemplated the contingency which arose, viz., the inability of the defendant to get the notes discounted. It is, however, quite certain that Selser &amp; Bro. did their part under the agreement, which was to give the notes. It was plainly the defendant’s duty to have them discounted. This he failed to have done. He was therefore the party in default. Had he kept his agreement in its true spirit, he would himself have advanced the money. If the duty to pay, as between Selser &amp; Bro. and the defendant, rested upon either of them, it rested upon the defendant. Selser &amp; Bro. of course had to protect the paper, as it was held by strangers to the original agreement. In this view of the <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>understanding between the parties, the letter of June 12,1884, may be easily understood. Hence the contention on the part of the defendant that Selser &amp; Bro. were to furnish all of the capital in this transaction, without any liability on the part of the defendant for any part of it, is not well founded. The reverse of the proposition would be more reasonable.</p>

The defendant was unwilling or unable to keep his part of the agreement (the latter the master believes), and thus unloaded upon his partners, endeavoring to make some amends, however, by placing in the hands of Selser &amp; Bro. 500 shares of stock, then worth less than $5 a share, according to the testimony of Harrison Snyder and exhibit 0, showing sales of stock on June 9, 1884, 100 shares, for $4.75 a share.</p>

It would be unjust and inequitable to allow the defendant to escape on any such grounds now, after he has, by filing an answer, invited the plaintiff to a contest upon the merits. It is too late now for the defendant to urge that an adequate remedy at law existed: Sunbury etc. E. Co. v. Cooper, <a href="/pa/33/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="33 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="988447" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0278-01">33 Pa. 278</a>.

If the adventure had been closed and an account between the partners had been stated, ascertaining the amount due from the defendant to the plaintiff, then an action at law might afford a full and adequate remedy; but such is not the case. Here, there is on hand not only the 1,000 shares of stock, joint property unsold, but also the 500 shares held as collateral; neither of which can be legally sold by either party without the agreement of the other; and we have seen that the defendant withheld his assent by neglecting to come to a settlement when requested. It requires the aid of a court of equity to enable the plaintiff to have this stock disposed of and the true indebtedness of the defendant ascertained; which can be done only by the court decreeing a sale of the stock and thereupon to require the account between the plaintiff and defendant to be stated.</p>

How is the plaintiff to settle up his account as assignee, until this transaction is closed, and how can he or Selser &amp; Bro. close it under this arrangement, without the aid of a court of equity, the defendant refusing to <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>pay his share of the loss, or to agree to a sale whereby the amount of his liability to the plaintiff can be ascertained ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b168-6" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[266,471,1181,1056]]]'>The master at first entertained some doubt whether the plaintiff could sustain a bill filed in his own name; but the defendant made no point of it before the master, and upon reflection, the master believes that such an objection would not be well taken. Such an objection to a suit at law would probably be good, but not in equity. The plaintiff, in his argument, based his right to maintain this action in this form, among others upon the doctrine that a trustee may at any time apply to the court having jurisdiction of his accounts, for its assistance and protection in the administration of the trust, and that a trustee is entitled to the aid of a court of equity where a doubt or difficulty has arisen in the administration of the trust. In support of this doctrine, which is undoubted, he cites: Rogers’s Est., 16 W. N. 228; Hill on Trustees, 543 ; Adams on Equffiy, 59 ; Bispham’s Equity, § 147; Ashhurst v. Iron Co., <a href="/pa/35/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="35 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="990475" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0030-01">35 Pa. 30</a>. The doctrine seems broad enough to cover this case. It is stated in Adams on Equity, 59, thus: “ If in any case there is a bona fide doubt as to the course which under the circumstances a trustee should pursue, he may obtain directions by a suit in equity at the cost of the estate. And a cautious trustee will generally do so whenever a reasonable doubt exists.”. ....</p>

      <em>We </em>are asked to dismiss this bill for want of jurisdiction. It is true the want of jurisdiction may be taken advantage of at any stage of the proceedings. But this is so only in clear cases, when the want of jurisdiction is patent. It is not so here. The most that can be claimed is that the jurisdiction is doubtful. Under such circumstances the defendant should have demurred. This was not done. The defendant conceded the jurisdiction, so far as it may be implied from his acquiescence in the reference to a master. After such reference, involving heavy costs, the case should be very clear to justify us in setting the proceedings aside for want of jurisdiction. We have sometimes done so of our own motion, but they were all instances where the want of jurisdiction was so palpable that we felt constrained to take such course. Regarding this as analogous to a bill to foreclose, it is at least doubtful whether <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>a demurrer could have been sustained. So far as the merits of the case are concerned, they have been so well discussed, not only by the able and learned president of the court below, but also by the learned master, that we need not add anything to what they have so well said.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[469,622,903,93]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>
