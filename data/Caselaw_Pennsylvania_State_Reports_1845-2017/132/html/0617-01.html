The first floor was occupied as a sales room. An entry and hallway at one side of and entirely separated from the sales room led to a stairway which was the only means by which the workmen employed upon the upper floors could reach their places of work. The cellar of the building was used in part as an engine room, steam being applied both in heating the building and in running the machinery employed in it. The engineer in charge of the steam engine was always the first person to enter the building in the morning, and the last to leave it at night. He was required to be in attendance as early as six o’clock in the morning, in order to have heat and steam power provided by the time the operatives were to be in their places. His means of getting into the cellar was a trap-door in the <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>floor of tbe hallway above mentioned. It was situated about sixteen feet from the street door and directly in front of the stairway. The opening in the floor was 22 by 24 inches, and the trap-door covering it was opened and shut upon hinges. There were no devices upon it to keep it closed, when not in use, and it was not surrounded by any railing or guard. The hallway was lighted by a transom over the street door. As to the amount of light thus admitted to the hall, the evidence was conflicting. No one but the engineer was allowed to use the trap-door, and his orders were to keep it constantly closed, except while actually passing through it.</p>

He subsequently opened the trap-door and passed through the opening twice, the last time at twenty minutes before seven. His testimony was that he then closed the door after him. Other employees had arrived in the building by that time. ^</p>

He knew of the existence and location of the trap-door, was acquainted with the use made of it, and ran along the hall without looking where he was going. The trap-door was open, but he did not observe this, and fell into the opening and was injured.</p>

Under those circumstances, I leave to you to say whether a trap-door like that ought to have a guard rail around it at all. Was it or was it not negligence on the part of these defendants to leave that hole without a railing around it; a hole which was not a hatchway, a hole which had a trap-door on it; a hole which, according to all the testimony of the case, was intended to be kept closed and only opened when in use by the engineer going up or down ?

The facts respecting the amount of light in the hallway were controverted, and in such circumstances the question of negligence is always for the jury: Penna. R. Co. v. Ogier, <a href="/pa/35/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="35 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="990490" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0060-01">35 Pa. 60</a>; Oakland Ry. Co. v.

The rule as to stopping, looking and listening, has never been applied to a person entering a hallway; and the fact that the plaintiff did not do this does not show him to be guilty of contributory negligence per se. The trap-door was usually closed, and he had <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>a right to assume that it was so then. Nor is his running negligence per se ; many people run before starting up stairs. The question of contributory negligence was for the jury, there being controverted facts and inferences to be drawn therefrom: Penna. R. Co. v. McTighe, <a href="/pa/46/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="46 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="420673" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0316-01">46 Pa. 316</a>; Oakland Ry. Co. v.

The plaintiff assumed only such risks as were patent or brought home to him: Johnson v.

There was no evidence that he knew of the absence of any device to keep the trap closed, or knew that it was without protection when open.</p>

    <p id="b648-7" data-blocks='[["BL_648.6",648,[273,1022,1175,758]]]'>Where the negligence of the defendant is the ground upon which a recovery in damages is sought, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, and he must show the negligence of which he complains. There is a well-recognized exception to this rule in the case of common carriers. After the carrier has entered upon the performance of his contract to cany safely, if an injurious accident happens to or affects any of the means or appliances of carriage, whereby the plaintiff sustains injury, he is required to show only the happening of the accident, and the injury. The burden is then on the carrier to show that the accident was not the consequence of its own fault, or that of its employees, but was due to causes over which it had no control. With this exception, however, the rule is uniform that the burden of proving the facts on which the right to recover rests is on the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b648-8" data-blocks='[["BL_648.7",648,[270,1787,1173,604]],["BL_649.1",649,[180,370,1164,862]]]'>In this case, the plaintiff charged in his statement that, “through and by the negligence of the defendants,” he was thrown down, and caused to fall into or through, a trap-door on the premises of the defendants, and was thereby cut, bruised, wounded, etc. The proofs showed that the defendants were printers, engravers, and stationers at No. 927 Arch street, in the city of Philadelphia. In the cellar was the engine that furnished power to move the presses and machinery. On the first floor was a sales room. The upper stories were used for work rooms, and contained the presses and other machinery. The store was entered directly from the street. Access to the rest of the building was through a hall or passageway not commu<a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>nicating with the store. From this hall the engineer descended to the cellar through the trap-door, which was cut for that purpose, and the compositors and other employees ascended to the stories above by means of a staircase. The trap-door was used only by the engineer, who was under strict orders from his employers to close it behind him whenever he passed through it. He was the first to enter the building in the morning, and the last to leave it at night. The plaintiff knew the location and use of the door, and passed it several times each day for six months or more before the accident. On the morning of November 28, 1887, the plaintiff came to his work as usual, and, passing rapidly through the hall, fell into the opening at the trap-door. The engineer had passed into the building a few minutes before, and the evidence indicates that he was the only person who had done so prior to the plaintiff’s arrival. He says he shut the trap-door behind him; but this is impossible, if, as the plaintiff alleges, it was open when he reached it.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.4",649,[179,1239,1162,959]]]'>But the question to be considered is, what did the defendants do, or leave undone, in violation of their duty to the plaintiff? In what respect were they negligent? It cannot be said that they were negligent in permitting the plaintiff to pass through the hall without any knowledge of the existence of the trap-door, for he testifies that he knew all about its existence and use. There was no negligence in failing to instruct the engineer in his duty to keep the trap-door closed, for it appears in proof, and is not questioned, that such instructions were carefully given. There was no negligence in the manner of its construction. It was safely built, and when closed prevented the possibility of accident to those passing through the hall. There was no negligence in the fact of its existence, for it is conceded that it was a necessary means of access to the engine in the cellar, by which the machinery of the establishment was moved. By whose fault, then, was the accident made possible? Clearly, by that of a co-employee who neglected to close the trap-door behind him, notwithstanding the positive orders of his employers.</p>
    <p id="b649-6" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[181,2207,1160,195]],["BL_650.1",650,[259,373,1170,956]]]'>The learned judge of the court below seems to have entertained substantially the same view of the case, as appears by his answer to the defendants’ fourth point. The point asked an instruction that, “ if the plaintiff knew of the existence of <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>the trap-door in the floor of the hallway through which he had to go to reach his work in the building, and that this trap-door was opened each morning to permit the engineer to enter the cellar before other employees of the defendants reached the building in which plaintiff was working, then the plaintiff is assumed to have undertaken to run the risk of said trap-door being left open by the engineer, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.” The learned judge answered: “ This point I affirm. A man is not entitled to recover damages for the risk which he knows is before him, in his path. In the case of danger, it is his duty to look out for it, and avoid it.” This covered the whole case. The plaintiff knew of the existence and use of the trap-door. He knew that the engineer by whom it was used reached the building a very few minutes before him, and it was his duty to be on the lookout. He was not. Because he was not, he fell into the opening. But, leaving the subject of his own contributory negligence out of view, the negligence of which he must complain is that of a co-employee, which affords no ground for a recovery in this case.</p>
    <p id="b650-6" data-blocks='[["BL_650.4",650,[790,1336,587,43]]]'>Judgment is therefore reversed.</p>
