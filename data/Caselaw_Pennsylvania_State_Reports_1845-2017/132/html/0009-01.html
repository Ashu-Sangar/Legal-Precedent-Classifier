The evidence admitted for the plaintiff clearly established that the defendant had upon its public highway before and at the time of this accident, a dangerous open space, directly on the line of the road, exposing a traveler who approached the bridge at night from the north to the risk of injury. To diverge but a few inches to the left would expose him to a perpendicular fall of twelve feet upon the rocks below. That an increase in the height of the abutment, or the placing of a guard-rail over it, would have prevented such a fall, is manifest.

The plaintiff does not pretend to say that he walked carefully, or used due care to avoid injury. Instead of walking on the bridge, he walked aside and into the unguarded ditch which he knew was there, and that without a light and without feeling his way, or in any manner trying to avoid the danger, as was done by Fischer.

Upon the question of the defendant’s negligence, the facts are remarkably similar to those in Monongahela City v.

To say nothing of the obscurity and absurdity of the plaintiff’s offers, they were irrelevant because there was an utter lack of proof that the injury to the plaintiff occurred on the road complained of, and for the further reason that accidents to other persons at other corners of the bridge, without any evidence as to the proximate cause of their mishaps, could not tend to prove that the plaintiff’s injury was caused by the defendant’s negligence.</p>

It was claimed by him that the abutment of the bridge, over which he fell and sustained the injury complained of, was within the lines of a public highwajr which the township defendant was bound to maintain in a condition reasonably safe for those who had occasion to use it and the bridge which formed part of the highway; that at the northeast corner of the bridge, the point where he fell over, the top of the abutment was about on the same level as the floor of the bridge and the approach thereto, and extended several feet beyond the side of the bridge, thus making the approach to the abutment several feet wider than the bridge; that tile portion of the abutment and approach thereto, extending beyond the side of the bridge, was negligently left open, without any guard-rail <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>or other mode of warning travelers of the danger; that, when about to cross the bridge, on a dark night, he was misled, and for want of a guard-rail, or other suitable barrier, he fell over the projecting portion of the abutment, and perpendicularly down, a distance of about twelve feet, upon the rocky bed of the stream, and was thus severely injured, without any negligence on his part.</p>

It should therefore have been submitted to the jury with proper instructions as to the duty of the township authorities, as well as plaintiff himself. In actions on the case for negligence, such as is alleged in this ease, if the plaintiff’s evidence tends to make out a prima facie case, it is error to enter a judgment of nonsuit.

The case referred to was a very close one, on the controlling question whether the evidence warranted its submission to the jury or not, and depended largely on its own peculiar facts, none of which were disputed. From the report of the case, it appears that the planked culvert, adjacent to the place where the accident occurred, and the approaches thereto, “were well constructed and reasonably safe.” The latter were about fourteen feet wide at the edge of the planks, and widened as they receded from the culvert. “ The sides of those approaches sloped down from the roadway to the ground at either side. Three of these side slopes were but slightly elevated. The fourth, on the <em>river side </em>of the roadway and east of the culvert, was between three and four feet at the highest point, next the culvert wall, and gradually diminished as it reached towards the level ground. This construction was required there because a water-way existed along that side of the road, which had to be carried into the culvert <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>within the lines of the highway, and for which provision was made by an opening in the culvert wall.” In that case, also, the plaintiff’s own account of how he came to go over the embankment shows that it happened, not in his effort to keep on the traveled roadway, but in endeavoring to cross the same in search of an adjacent footpath. He proceeded, as he testified, “ by the right-hand slope of the western approach to the culvert, about twenty steps, and thence diagonally across the culvert from the right-hand side to the left-hand side, intending to leave the wagon road, and take the footpath by Stewart’s fence.” Instead of finding the path he was in search of, he “ got over the embankment or steep grade.” That wsa the plaintiff’s own account of the manner in which he was injured.</p>
    <p id="AR4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[260,1050,1170,898]]]'>In the case at bar, the unguarded precipice, instead of being a gently sloping embankment of three or four feet, such as are not uncommon on country highways, was an actual pitfall, nearly perpendicular, and about twelve feet high; and the injured party, instead of. intentionally crossing the highway diagonally in search of a diverging footpath, was endeavoring to follow the beaten highway, and had every reason to believe he was doing so, until he suddenly went over the unguarded precipice, down on to the rocky bed of the stream below. The facts of the two cases, as indicated by the evidence, are quite different. In the case referred to, the plaintiff’s own account of his injury shows that he could and would have traveled the highway in safety, if he had not attempted to cross it diagonally, on a dark night, in search of a diverging footpath. This alone was enough to preclude him from recovering damages from the city. In the case before us, there appears to be nothing on which to base a judgment of nonsuit, or binding instructions to find for defendant.</p>
