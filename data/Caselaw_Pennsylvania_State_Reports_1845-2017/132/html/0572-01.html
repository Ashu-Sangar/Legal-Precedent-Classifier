They were illiterate workmen, kept no regular books, but depended altogether upon the assistance of friends to keep their accounts. For the grading, they relied upon the surveyor’s estimates. They rendered bills for their work every two weeks. Upon these bills they received payments on account, the defendant company retaining a sufficient sum to indemnify them against an attachment of $400, and other contingencies.
