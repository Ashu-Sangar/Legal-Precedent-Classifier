The auditor reported as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[216,459,1164,706]]]'>The guiding points of the present case are these: The testator by his original testamentary act made his son, who was then living, the beneficiary of his entire estate, securing to his mother the enjoyment of part of the yield for her life, giving him the rest and bestowing upon him absolutely the principal, to be at his disposal after he had attained his majority and his mother had died. These provisions as to the son were modified by the codicil. How far they were modified is the question here; but that, they were modified in some particulars remains beyond dispute. The son was not to have the absolute disposal of the principal of the estate in any event; be was not to receive the income at his majority, and he was not to have the absolute disposal of the income even after such time as was appointed for his receiving of it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[218,1172,1163,901]]]'>If the contention of the son is sustained by the auditor, several of these important facts must be left out of view, and the general result of the codicil will be to secure to the son a life interest. But this result could only be attained by our overthrowing what must be regarded as an express trust. We cannot lose sight of the directions indicating this. The testator has provided, among other things, for his son’s living to have children, and, also, for his son’s living having no children. In the former contingency, the son is to enjoy the income with the children; in the latter contingency, he is to enjoy the income himself. Obviously it was not necessary for the testator to provide thus for the latter contingency at all, if he did not mean to affect the enjoyment of the income. The exclusive enjoyment of the yield of the estate is secured to the son only in the event of his being childless. This consideration should be sufficient to determine the point, independently of the language of the clause relating to the enjoyment after children are born.</p>

But if the entire estate is given to him for his life, it is disregarded, and there is an annulment of the direction that it is given him for the benefit of his children and not otherwise, and that he shall receive and enjoy with them the interest or <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>income during his life. The verbal criticism is apposite, that the use of the copulative “ with ” indicates contemporaneity of, and not succession in, enjoyment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[243,502,1168,398]]]'>The son being a trustee is certainly not a trustee to support remainders, for his office expires at his death, till when the particular estate stands. Nor is he a trustee to exclude any one or more of his children; for participation, not exclusion, is commanded. The provision is beneficent in that it secures to him and to all of his offspring, no matter when born, the enjoyment of the estate; and it seems conclusive against the contention that he was to withhold everything from them.</p>

This is the fourth suit in which a question has been raised as to the meaning of that will, of sufficient importance to call for earnest argument, patient bearing, and judicial opinion. Tlie first question which was mooted, was whether the testator’s widow took a life-estate or a fee under the will. The Supreme Court decided that she took a life-estate only: See Roberjot v. Mazurié, 14 S. &amp; R. 42, where the will is printed at length. Of this testament, Mr. Justice Duncan said: “ No other man’s will can guide us in the construction of this man’s will, .... and we are sensible of the kindness of counsel in relieving us from the fatigue of hearing numerous cases on the ill-expressed wills of other men.” To which we may add, that, as no other will can be cited as a precedent in construing this will, so we feel assured that it is not likely to be used as a precedent for construing, nor, we hope, for drawing, any other will.</p>

Smith, and in consequence of a disagreement about the management of the share, one third, of the estate bequeathed to the son, an agreement was entered into on March 20, 1838, by which his share was vested in trustees, subject to the disposition made of it by the will of the testator.

Mazurié, the son, filed a bill in equity in the Court of Common Pleas No. 1, for the purpose of having his rights under the will determined, claiming that he was entitled to a fee, and asking for a cessation of the trust. The result of that proceeding was a decree that he was entitled to a life-estate only: See Mazurié v. Peona. Annuity Co., <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Phila.%20208" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="11 Phila. 208">11 Phila. 208</a>. That decree was affirmed on apxjeal, the Supreme Court saying: “ The estate which James Victor Mazurié took under his father’s will, both of the real and personal estate, was limited to him for life, and in trust for his children..... The limitation is not to him and his heirs, but to his children after his death, by equal division. His own interest was in the interest and income only during life.” [Unreported.]</p>

Six of the children make no claim, but three do.

    <p class="summary" id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[186,546,1166,1319]]]'>Taking the will itself, we may easily see that many of the words and phrases in it have no bearing upon the question now before us, and that we have to consider merely a line or two of it, in determining the rights of the son of the testator and his children. The clause, “ But that he [the son] will receive and enjoy with his childrens the interest or incomes of said estate during his life, ” contains all that bears upon the present controversy. By that clause he will receive all of the income. His children are not entitled to any of it during his life. When it is received, he will enjoy it with his children, and he, as the head of the family, will regulate the manner of the enjoyment. A devise of a plantation to “ be equally divided amongst my son Robert’s children, he and them enjoying the benefits of it whilst he lives,” was held to give a life-estate in the premises to the son, and that the division among the children was to be made at his death: Haskins v. Tate, <a href="/pa/25/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="25 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="975856" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0249-01">25 Pa. 249</a>. As an authority upon the mode and order of the time of enjoying a devise to a father and his children, this seems to be in point. “ It is unreasonable to suppose that the testator was intending that his son's children should claim and divide with their father in his lifetime,” said Chief Justice Lowrie. A life-estate owned hy one person in his own right, a part of the income of which is to be received by another for his own use, is a new kind of estate. Ownership carries with it the right to the income, as the right to the income carries with it the ownership.</p>
