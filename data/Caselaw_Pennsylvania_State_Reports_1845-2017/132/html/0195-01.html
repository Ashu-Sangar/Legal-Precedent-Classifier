At this time there were debts due by the old firm, in which all the parties were interested, and therefore the tripartite contract was executed by Fries, Ennis and Thompson. It sets forth that “ it is the intention of the parties that all debts owing by the old firm shall be paid; that the new firm shall not be responsible for said debts, but shall be protected therefrom; and to protect the said new firm from loss by reason of said debts, Frank B. Thompson has deposited with the new firm $12,551.81, to be applied and disposed of as hereinafter provided.”</p>

This makes it a trust fund, and those who hold it, trustees, for the objects of the trust.

They have made no objection to the distribution made by the auditor.

In this connection it is proper to observe that he remained in business with Ennis nearly two years, without any <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>allegation of fraud, and during that time was in active management of the business. And when he and his partner quarreled, and he filed his bill for a receiver, there was no charge of fraud. It was not until September, 1887, that he alleged conspiracy, and then his father, as receiver, had control of all the assets of the partnership.
