Defendant was employed by Otto, on a weekly salary, with no commissions or profits from any lager beer or porter thus delivered by him for his employer. The defendant has no license whatever for the sale of intoxicating liquors, and all his acts were done in the course of his employment by George W.

It is conceded that there was no criminal intent in this case, and the rule of law that in misdemeanors all who participate in the criminal act are principals, should not be so harshly applied as to render this driver liable to heavy fine and imprisonment for acts done by him in the course of his employment under a bottler, who, as he knew, had a license. If guilty, he is so through construction of law, a construction such as renders a good law oppressive and odious ; but, if his employer’s license authorized such sales and deliveries in Montgomery county, as were made in this case, he cannot be guilty; his guilt cannot be higher than his employer’s. Otto’s license made it lawful for him to sell his product outside of the limits of Philadelphia: Pollard’s Petition, <a href="/pa/127/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="127 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="565764" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0507-01">127 Pa. 507</a>; and the right of sale necessarily includes the right to deliver by wagon.</p>

Such a construction of the law as would require deliveries outside the county to be made by railroads and express companies, at greater cost to the people, should not be en-grafted on this highly penal statute, which does not so provide in express terms. When the ale and beer were set apart by the defendant’s employer for the purchaser who ordered it, and were placed upon the wagon, the sale was complete, and they became the purchaser’s property. For any further purpose of <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>delivery the driver was the purchaser’s agent. He was not instructed to demand payment, and whenever he carried the money to his employer he did so simply for the purchaser’s convenience. The sales were complete in Philadelphia: Commonwealth v. Fleming, <a href="/pa/130/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="130 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="568968" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0138-01">130 Pa. 138</a>. Every intendment of fact and law should be made in favor of the defendant. What was innocently done, for the convenience of the purchaser, should not be converted into a crime by a technical inference applicable to a civil contract. And even if Otto be technically guilty, it does not follow that the defendant, who might well suppose his employer had authority to make the sales in that way, is criminally liable: 1 Bennett’s Lead. Crim. Cases, 157, editor’s note.</p>
    <p id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[252,1045,1185,915]]]'>3. The sentence was erroneous. At most the defendant could not be sentenced more severely than his employer would be, unless he himself had a specific intent to violate the law. The sentence was the minimum imposed by the first provision of § 15, act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 113, for sales made without license. As the defendant’s employer was a licensed bottler, the sentence should have been under the next provision of that section, imposing punishment upon “any person having license ” who shall violate “ any of the provisions of the license laws.” As the defendant was the employee of a licensed dealer, he had a license within the words and intent of the law. Was he convicted of a violation of the license laws ; if not, then he committed no offence. A licensed vender who sells on Sunday, a day upon which his license does not authorize him to sell, cannot be convicted thereof under an indictment charging a sale without a license: Commonwealth v. Naylor, <a href="/pa/34/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="34 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="417971" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0086-01">34 Pa. 86</a>.

    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[178,833,1163,707]]]'>2. It is idle to say that the employer, Otto, had a license in Montgomery county, within the meaning of the second paragraph of § 15, act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 113. This court has uniformly held that a sale beyond the bounds of the county in which the license was granted, is a selling without license. How then can any other sentence be imposed than that provided for in the case of unlicensed sales? Commonwealth v. Naylor, <a href="/pa/34/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="34 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="417971" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0086-01">34 Pa. 86</a>, is not analogous. That case arose prior to the act of February 26, 1855, P. L. 53, prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor on Sunday. Naylor could not be convicted of selling without license, because his license covered Sundays as well as other days, and it did not authorize sales on Sundays simply because the Sunday law of April 22, 1794, 3 Sm. L. 177, was not repealed.</p>

To this indictment he pleaded non volo contendere. This, although not technically a plea of guilty, is so in substance, and justifies the court in imposing sentence: Buck v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/107/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="107 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="8858286" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0486-01">107 Pa. 486</a>. We may therefore safely pass by the somewhat elaborate argument to show that the defendant was not guilty, with the single remark that it is not necessary to sustain a conviction for selling intoxicating liquors under the act of 1887 for the commonwealth to prove a criminal intent. It is enough to show the sale, when the defendant may, if he can, shield himself behind a license. If the sale is contrary to law, the intent has nothing to do with it. A contrary ruling would fritter away the act of 1887, and convictions under it would be rare.</p>

He was in the employ of one <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>George W. Otto, a licensed bottler having his place of business in the city of Philadelphia. The defendant was the driver of Otto’s wagon, and a portion of his route lay through Montgomery county. His duty was to deliver bottled ale and beer, ordered by Otto’s customers, to the persons who had ordered it. He was in the habit of taking orders in that county, which he returned to his employer in Philadelphia, who filled the orders ; the beer and ale were loaded upon defendant’s wagon, and he delivered the same in Montgomery county, collected the money, and returned it to his employer. The transaction for which the defendant was indicted was of this character. This was clearly a sale and delivery in Montgomery county. The license held by Mr. Otto authorized him to sell in Philadelphia. He had a right to sell to any person in the commonwealth, provided the sales were made at his place of business: Commonwealth v. Fleming, <a href="/pa/130/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="130 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="568968" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0138-01">130 Pa. 138</a>. But he had no right to peddle his beer through other counties not covered by his license, and make sales there. The defendant had no license, and is only protected where his employer would be protected. So far as sales in Montgomery county are concerned, Otto had no license; and his license issued in Philadelphia would have been no answer to this indictment, had it been found against him.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[259,1540,1168,858]]]'>The sentence was imposed under the first paragraph of § 15 of the act of 13th May, 1887, P. L. 113, which provides that “any person who shall hereafter be convicted of selling, or offering for sale, any vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixture thereof, without a license, shall be sentenced to pay á fine of not less than $500, nor more than $5,000, and undergo an imprisonment in the county jail of not less than three months, nor more than twelve months.” The court below imposed the minimum punishment fixed by the act. It was contended that the sentence should have been under the second paragraph of said section, which provides a lighter punishment where persons having a license are convicted of violating any of the provisions of the license laws. For the reasons already given, we think the sentence was proper. It follows the indictment strictly, and, as before observed, neither the defendant nor his employer was licensed to sell in Montgomery county.</p>
