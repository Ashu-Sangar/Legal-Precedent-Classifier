To repeal an existing law by implication, there must be such a positive repugnance between the new law and the old, that they cannot stand together or be consistently reconciled: Barber's Case, <a href="/pa/86/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="86 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1056633" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0392-01">86 Pa. 392</a>; Homer v.

It will be claimed that the plaintiff cannot maintain her action unless she show that the attachments were maliciously issued. But she is not to be treated as an attachment debtor, or as one standing in any relation whatever to the attachment plaintiff. The distinction is broad, radical and essential, in right as well as in procedure, between the abuse of legal process against a judgment debtor, or against a party debtor to the plaintiff, as where the laws allow the attachment as original process, and the abuse of such process against a third party who is not liable in any aspect to the plaintiff. In the former relation, the plaintiff has a right, as of course, to a legal process to recover his debt, and in the light of this right the law will not presume that he exercises the right abusively, or in legal parlance, maliciously; and before the debtor can recover for the abuse of process, he must show by affirmative evidence, not by presumption merely, that the process was carelessly and .maliciously issued. But when process is issued to seize and actually seizes the property of one standing in no relation of liability to the plaintiff, no case can be shown which exonerates the plaintiff in the process from liability for the damages actually done, whatever the motive of the wrongdoer. This doctrine is aptly illustrated in the case of Rogers v. Dutt, 13 Moore P. C. 209. The actual injury done is the real ground of the action, and the malice to support the action is more of a legal fiction than a legal necessity: Larzelere v. Haubert, <a href="/pa/109/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="109 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="542328" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0515-01">109 Pa. 515</a>.</p>

At common law stock could not be taken in execution, and under § 2, act of March 29, 1819, P. L. 217, it could only be done when it was held in the defendant’s own name.

The person in whose name the stock is held is simply a “ garnishee,” and it was not until the act of June 11, 1885, P. L. 107, that the plaintiff, under the act of April 22, 1863, P.

    <p id="b156-7" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[255,1500,1171,950]]]'>The defendant, Alfred M. Fuller, had a judgment for a large amount against his brother James Fuller.

Fuller, trustee. The said Belle C. Fuller was the wife of the defendant in the attachment execution. The writ was served upon the Algonquin Company as one of the garnishees, but was returned “ nihil habet ” as to the said Belle C. Fuller. The latter, however, appeared to the suit, and the trial resulted in a verdict and judgment in her favor. She then commenced this suit, a common-law action on the case, against the attaching creditor of her husband, to recover damages for the laying of the attachment. She alleges that the attachment was maliciously issued; that the attaching creditor knew the stock belonged to her, and not to her husband; that the effect of said attachment was to prevent the sale and transfer thereof, and that pending said attachment the stock had depreciated greatly in value.</p>

      <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>It may be that for a malicious abuse of legal process a party injured thereby may have redress by a common-law action. There is nothing in this case, however, to indicate a malicious abuse of legal process. It was not denied that this stock had originally been issued to James Fuller, and had been transferred by him to his wife. It is true it stood in her name as trustee. But it does not appear, at least the certificate did not show, for whom she was trustee. The addition of the word “ trustee ” to her name, under such circumstances, possesses little significance. Having acquired title through her husband, prima facie the stock belonged to him. The burden was upon her to show that it belonged to her. Under such circumstances, it was entirely proper for a judgment creditor of her husband to test her title. This he did by using the process given bj' act of assembly for that purpose. It is not an uncommon thing for debtors in failing circumstances to seek to shelter themselves behind their wives. It would add greatly to the immunity of such persons, if a legal investigation of the title of the wife could only be undertaken under the penalty of a suit for damages if unsuccessful.</p>

Upon a proper application to the court below, we have little doubt an order would have been made for its sale, the proceeds to await the result of the attachment. This is constantly done in the case of perishable property. And a motion to dissolve might not have been unsuccessful, if made upon proper proof that the stock was a part of her separate estate and bought with -her own money.</p>
