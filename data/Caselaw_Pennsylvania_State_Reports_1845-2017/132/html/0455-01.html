When a debtor claims ás against an execution the benefit of the exemption allowed by the act of April 9, 1849, P. L. 583, it is the duty of the sheriff to appraise and set apart to him property to the amount thereof, unless a waiver or some other specific act of the defendant, which clearly and without doubt deprives him of that right, is brought to the sheriff’s notice.</p>

A notice from the execution plaintiff, when informed by the sheriff of the claim for the exemption, that “the conduct of the defendant has been such as to forfeit his right,” is insufficient to affect the sheriff with knowledge that the execution defendant had joined with his wife in asserting ownership, on her part, of the goods levied upon.</p>

Rudder, the plaintiff, on May 23, 1888, issued thereon a writ of fieri facias, and on the same day the present defendant, as sheriff, levied upon certain chattels, under said writ, as the property of said Rudder. Soon after the levy, Rudder informed Mr. James Marshall, who had been his counsel in the action in which the judgment was recovered, that the goods levied on belonged to his, Rudder’s, wif§. Thereupon, Mr. Marshall wrote and sent to the sheriff a notice, dated May 26,1888, claiming the goods levied on, on behalf of Mrs. Rudder. In consequence of this notice, the sheriff, on May 31, 1888, obtained from the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 a rule for an interpleader, under § 9, act of April 10,1848, P. L. 450, and on June 4, 1888, the rule was made absolute. No narr or bond was filed on behalf of the claimant, and she took no action to maintain her claim. About June 9, 1888, the defendant in the execution, George W. Rudder, gave the sheriff verbal notice that he claimed the benefit of the exemption law, and on June 19, 1888, filed a formal written claim for the allowance of the exemption. On June 22, 1888, the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 ordered that the sheriff have leave to proceed with the execution. At this time the sheriff had not incurred any cost or expense in the way of advertising, and no day of sale had been fixed. The sheriff on July 16, 1888, notified Mr. A. W. Horton, the plaintiff’s attorney, that an appraisement would be made on July 19th, in connection with Rudder’s claim of exemption.

The exemption should be claimed before levy, if the debtor is present ; if he is not present at the levy, the claim should be made promptly thereafter, and so early as not to delay the plaintiff, or involve the incurring of additional expense: Stewart’s App., 20 W.

Had he chosen, he could have demanded indemnity before proceeding. His refusal to sell, without asking for indemnity, makes him liable : Hall v.

Certainly the sheriff should not bo charged with notice that the plaintiff had knowledge of facts connected with the wife’s claim, amounting to fraud, when no such notice was given him. But fraud is not to be presumed. It is not clearly apparent in this case. The claim for exemption was promptly made. The claim of property made by the wife’s attorney, a few days previously, may be considered as abandoned. The claim of exemption was allowed in a case almost similar to the present one : Allemong v. Passmore, 14 W. N. 124.

Rudder, the defendant therein, made a verbal demand upon Krumbhaar, the sheriff, for the exemption of $300; a more formal demand was made in writing on June 19th following. On July 16, 1888, A. W. Horton, Esq., the attorney for Williamson, the execution creditor, was notified by the sheriff that the appraisement and designation of the property under Rudder’s claim would be made on the 19th, to which Horton replied that he objected to the allowance of the exemption “because of the defendant’s laches in making his claim, and the consequent loss, expense, and delay to which the plaintiff was subjected; ” and also “ upon the ground that the conduct of the defendant lias been such as to forfeit his right to the benefit of the exemption laws.” The sheriff proceeded, however, with the appraisement, and set apart property to the defendant, under his claim, to the amount of $197.75. The writ with the appraisement, was returned in due form by the sheriff, and no further proceedings were had thereon. This suit is brought by Williamson, the plaintiff in the writ, to recover from Krumbhaar, the sheriff, the value of the goods which it is alleged were improperly set aside to the defendant in the execution.</p>

      <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>After the levy, on May 26, 1888, notice was given to the sheriff by Rudder’s wife that the goods levied upon were owned by her, and not by her husband, and on June 4th, following, a rule was entered for an interpleader; but, the wife failing to file-a bond in accordance with the order of the court, the inter-pleader fell, and the sheriff, on June 22d, was ordered to proceed with the execution. It is alleged that Mr. Marshall, the attorney who gave notice of Mrs. Rudder’s claim, was employed by Rudder to act in her behalf; and the appellant’s contention is, that Rudder was thereby precluded from making any claim of exemption. But it must be borne in mind that this is not a proceeding to set aside the appraisement; it is an action against the sheriff, and there is no evidence that he was aware of Rudder’s participation in the interpleader. If the case was being considered upon a motion to set aside the appraisement, this might have been a potential ground for so doing; but the sheriff cannot, in such a case as this, be affected by any fact of which he had no knowledge. It is true that Mr. Horton, in his letter of July 17th, had objected to the allowance of the exemption, upon the ground that the conduct of the defendant had been such as to forfeit his right, but the sheriff could not deny the defendant’s claim upon a general and indefinite charge of that kind. If there was any specific act of the defendant, known to tlie plaintiff or his attorney, which would forfeit the defendant’s right to exemption, and they desired to affect the sheriff with notice of it, it was their dutjr to state what it was. The sheriff’s duty was to set apart the property, unless a -waiver or some other specific act of the defendant was brought to his notice which clearly, and without doubt, deprived the defendant of that right.</p>

In that mode of procedure, the sheriff, having discharged his duty in good faith, is relieved from responsibility, and the parties litigant stand squarely upon their respective rights.

The writ, as we have said, issued May 23,1888. A verbal demand for the exemption was made about June 9th thereafter. The general rule is that the exemption should be allowed when it can be done without prejudice to the rights of creditors ; it must not be unnecessarily delayed, until costs have been incurred which might have been readily avoided: Cornman’s App., <a href="/pa/90/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="90 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1065655" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0257-01">90 Pa. 257</a>. In a number of cases, it has been held to be in time if made at a period so early as not to delay the sale, or to require new advertisements: Commonwealth v. Boyd, <a href="/pa/56/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="56 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1009161" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0402-01">56 Pa. 402</a>; Yost v. Hefner, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Pa.%2070" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="69 Pa. 70">69 Pa. 70</a>. In this case, no day of sale had yet been fixed, no advertisements posted, nor is it shown that any other expense had been incurred.</p>
