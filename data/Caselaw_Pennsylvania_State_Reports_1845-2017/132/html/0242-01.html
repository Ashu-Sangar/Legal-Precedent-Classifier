The plaintiff’s son should not have been permitted to tell his apprehensions to justify which no conduct on the part of Mrs. Hahn had been shown, thus opening the way for the jury to base the verdict on the foolish notion of a boy. So, there was nothing in the remark of Mrs. Hahn testified to by Plasterer to justify the court in allowing him to state that after this a horse of the plaintiff died suddenly, leaving the jury to infer that she poisoned it. Furthermore, this had all occurred prior to the adjudication in the desertion case. The fifth assignment should be sustained. It is hardly conceivable that Mr. Hahn, while testifying for himself in the desertion case, would have omitted so material a fact as a threat by his wife to poison him, if such a fact existed. The eighth assignment needs but the suggestion, that to require the facts to be made out to the entire satisfaction of the jury, is imposing a measure of proof not required in civil cases. For the purposes of this case, desertion for no more than one year was sufficient.

In the case cited in support of the first assignment, the declarations admitted in evidence were made on the night of the wife’s flight. The matter for trial, in the present case, was whether the plaintiff had been guilty of wilful desertion for a year prior to January 2, 1885, the date of his wife’s death. The inquiry, therefore, must necessarily go back of the date of the proceeding in the Quarter Sessions, and anything that showed the nature of the relations between the parties at any time within the year was admissible. Nay, the inquiry goes bank to the original leaving. The issue is not the precise matter determined by the Quarter Sessions, and its decree is not conclusive: Bauder’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="115 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="551711" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0480-01">115 Pa. 480</a>.</p>

What circumstance could better throw light upon the causes of the plaintiff’s separation ffiom his wife, than their son’s fear that she would execute her threat to poison both him and his father ?

The rejected offers, which are the basis of the fifth and sixth assign-<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>merits of error, were wholly immaterial. The charge must be taken as a whole. The complaint of desertion is in the nature of a criminal charge, and it was entirely right to say that it should be made out to the entire satisfaction of the jury. On nothing less than clear evidence that the husband’s conduct was within the statute, should the ancient right of curtesy be defeated. The degree of intolerable conduct which will justify a separation, is a matter of fact which no rule of law can define. Taking the charge as a whole, the jury could not have been misled as to it.</p>

It is not the law that the test of the evidence necessary to relieve the husband from the forfeiture of his curtesy, is its sufficiency to warrant a divorce upon his petition. The act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 644, recognizes that in such divorce cases, while the court might find sufficient cause to decree the divorce, this is not inconsistent with an allowance of support to the offending wife. Much more, the testimony in a case like this may be sufficient to relieve the husband of the charge of wilful and malicious desertion, and yet fall short of the measure required to entitle him to a divorce. But if the proposition of the defendant were sound, this court, in the very cases he cites in support of it, has gone far in sustaining decrees of divorce upon evidence of the same character as that now before the court. Thus, all the elements that justified the divorce in Jones v.

      <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>The second specification raises the question whether the decree in the desertion proceeding is a bar to any investigation of the cause of the separation. This record was inadvertently misdescribed in Bealor v. Hahn, <a href="/pa/117/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="117 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="555818" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0169-01">117 Pa. 169</a>, as “ between the same parties,” when in fact it was a record of a proceeding between the commonwealth and Jeremiah M. Hahn. The question then before the court was on the admissibility of this record as evidence, not upon its effect. It was not then suggested that it constituted an estoppel, or a bar, as to all matters occurring before the order for support was made. It is a general principle, and one of the elements of the doctrine of res judicata, that personal judgments conclude only the parties to them, and their privies: Bigelow on Estoppel, 46. No one can take advantage of a judgment or decree, who would not have been prejudiced by it had it been otherwise; estoppels must be mutual: Chandler’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=39%20Leg.%20Int.%20347" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="39 Leg. Int. 347">39 Leg. Int. 347</a>. If the proceeding had been dismissed on the ground that the husband had reasonable cause for abandoning his wife, would the record have been a bar to a suit by the wife for divorce on the ground of desertion? We think not. The proceeding is quasi criminal in its nature, and the commonwealth is a party to it. It may be instituted on the complaint of any person. If a stranger makes the complaint, the effect of the judgment is the same as if the wife made it. The person at whose instance the proceeding is commenced is not a party to the issue. “ Parties, in the larger legal sense, are all persons having a right to control the proceedings, to make defence, to adduce and cross-examine witnesses, and to appeal from the decision, if any appeal lies: ” 1 Greenl. Ev., § 535. In Petrie v. Nuttall, 11 Exch. 569, the plaintiff sued in trespass for breaking and entering his land. The defence was that the part referred to yas a public highway; and an indictment, verdict, and judgment against the plaintiff were pleaded by way of estoppels for obstructing the very same piece of land, as being the Queen’s highway. To this defence the plaintiff demurred, and his demurrer was sustained on the ground that the parties were not the same in the transaction. Aidjebsojñ, B., said that it was essential to an estoppel that it should be mutual, so that the same parties or privies might be bound and take advantage of it. The crown and subject were parties to the indictment, and therefore it was not between the two parties to the action <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>in which, it was pleaded as an estoppel. In Hutchinson v. M. &amp; M. Bank, <a href="/pa/41/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="41 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="480062" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0042-01">41 Pa. 42</a>, which was an action by the bank to recover money stolen from it, the effect of an acquittal of the defendant on an indictment for the larceny of the same money was considered, and Lowkxe, C. J., said: “ The private wrong was not merged in the public one, nor is, the public prosecution intended to supersede the private action. Their purposes are entirely different. The person wronged is not chargeable with the conduct of the prosecution, and therefore not affected by an acquittal.” In Bauder’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="115 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="551711" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0480-01">115 Pa. 480</a>, which was an action by the husband for a divorce on the ground that his wife had deserted him, it appeared that the husband left his wife in July, 1882; that she instituted proceedings against him for desertion, which were terminated on November 13, 1882, by an order upon him for her maintenance, and that this order was in full force at the time of the trial of the suit for divorce. It was contended that this order was a legal bar to the divorce prayed for. Evidence was admitted showing the disagreements of the parties, how they lived together, and how they separated. The learned judge of the court below, referring to the record of the desertion proceeding, in his charge to the jury said “We have received that record in evidence; and you will have it before you as one of the circumstances in the case, showing how these parties came to be separated, and you can also receive it as persuasive evidence of things as they stood at the time, but not conclusive.” And this court said: “ There is no error in the charge of the court, nor in the answers to the points.” It is true there was evidence from which a desertion subsequent to the order of November, 1882, might have been found by the jury, and this was referred to in the opinion affirming the decree; but we think the decision, fairly interpreted, supports the view that the record in the Quarter Sessions is persuasive, but not conclusive, evidence of a previous desertion by the husband. The second specification of error is not sustained.</p>

But five witnesses called by the plaintiff speak of the relations and conduct of the husband and wife before their separation. H. C. Gibble, a justice of the peace to whom Mrs. Hahn applied for a warrant against her husband for desertion, says it was Mrs. Halm’s nature to scold and be cross, and that she admitted to him that she had not treated her husband as she should have done. Charles Hahn, a son of the plaintiff, aged twenty-two years, says he heard his mother call his father “ a d-d liar,” and that on one occasion, while he and his father were at the breakfast table, she said: “ I might just as well poison you, and then you would both be out of the road; ” and that in consequence of this remark lie was afraid, and left home two weeks afterwards. He was not a witness in the desertion proceeding. Samuel Plasterer says that Mrs. Hahn once said to him: “ It is a wonder that Mr. Hahn don’t take the horses away. They might get poisoned; ” but it does not appear that he mentioned this to the plaintiff. Priscilla <em>Long </em>says that Mrs. Hahn was not very pleasant when her husband was present, and that she talked unkindly about him when he was absent; that from three to five years before their separation their children had diphtheria; that the witness’s brother and Mr. Hahn did most of the nursing of them; that Mrs. Hahn assisted “very little,” and seldom stayed in the sick room when her husband was there. On cross-examination, this witness testified that the children were very sick, and that her brother, Mr. and Mrs. Hahn, and the neighbors, assisted in taking care of them; that Mrs. Halm “ didn’t nurse them all the time. She couldn’t. She had to be relieved.” Abraham Schopp says Mrs. Hahn would talk roughly and unpleasantly to her husband, and that be would sometimes say unpleasant things to her, and that both were a little inclined to be quarrelsome. There is some evidence to the effect that they occupied different sleeping-rooms, and that they did not often take their meals together. But neither complained of these matters, and the evidence fails to show who was responsible for them. This <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>is the substance of the evidence on which the plaintiff, relies as his justification for abandoning his wife. It exhibits a state of domestic infelicity, but it does not present a case of cruel and barbarous treatment by the wife of the husband, which rendered his condition intolerable, and life burdensome: Gordon v. Gordon, <a href="/pa/48/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="48 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="422297" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0226-01">48 Pa. 226</a>; Jones v.

The single, so-called “ threat ” testified to bjr the son, did not alarm the husband; there was no act of violence to his person committed by the wife, and there was no evidence from which an attempt or intent to harm him or his estate could be fairly inferred.</p>

L. 430, successfully claim an estate as tenant by the curtesy in lands of which she died seised. Where an unexplained desertion appears, it is presumed to be wilful and malicious, and it lies on him to show reasonable and lawful cause for it. If he cannot justify his abandonment of her by evidence which would entitle him to a divorce, he cannot have the rights of a husband in her estate.

It was competent and proper for tbe defence to prove that tbe claim of a threat by Mrs. Halm to poison her liusband and son was an after-thought, and that it was not made on the trial of- tbe desertion case, although tbe plaintiff in this action was tlie defendant and a witness in it. We tbink, too, that tbe evidence offered to' contradict Plasterer should have been received. It related to the conduct of the plaintiff before tbe separation from his wife, and was therefore material to tbe issue. These specifications are sustained.</p>
