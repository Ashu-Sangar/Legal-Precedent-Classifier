No, sir; all verbal, nothing written; there never was a written agreement; I never saw any. Q. Everything that ever was done with Mr. Newlin on the subject, was done by Mr. Worrall in your absence?

You said there was no agreement in writing in regard to the personal property ? A. There never was any. Q. Do you swear there was no verbal agreement in regard to the personal property? A. I swear that there was a verbal agreement. Q. What was it? A. That the Mansion House personal property went with the real estate; I always understood it so. Q. I was asking you about the personal property on the farm. Was there any agreement about that? A. The verbal agreement was that Mr. Worrall was to see that it was disposed of judiciously. Q. Was there any verbal agreement between you and Mr. Worrall communicating to you what Mr. Newlin was willing to do ? A. No, I do not remember of any ; 1 know there was a good many plans discussed, but we never came to any agreement. Q. What did you ask for the personal property on the farm? A. I do not recollect any price being stated..... Q. Was there ever any talk about your selecting a man, Mr. Newlin selecting a man, and they selecting a third one, to assess the valuation, and you agreeing to abide by that valuation ? A. No, sir. Q. Was there any talk on that subject at all ? A. I wanted the personal property on the farm to be sold at auction. Q. What was to hinder its being sold ? A. I do not know; it was not done. Q. Why did not you do it; it was yours, and nobody had any lease on it ? A. The <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>matter had not got that far advanced; there were several other matters, a lease, that we could not agree on; I wanted Mr. Worrall to fix the lease for six years, and he would not give me an assurance for more than three years, and so we never got down to a disposition of the personal property on the farm, or in the Mansion House either, because the lease was more important. Q. The lease of what ? A. The Mansion House; I was afraid that prohibition would come along after a while and I wanted a long lease.....</p>

It was a short time after this agreement was signed; I do not know whether it was a week or ten days after the agreement was signed. Q. How did you learn that? A. Mr. Worrall told me so, and I found then I had been very badly tripped, and that was one reason why I was dissatisfied; I became disgusted with the whole thing, because he was acting for both parties and told me he expected to get as big a fee from Mr. Newlin as from me. I says, “Why did you ask me to sign that paper ?” He says, “Because the act of assembly will not allow me to take a fee from both clients without a paper, and I expect to get as big a fee from Mr. Newlin as from you.”</p>
