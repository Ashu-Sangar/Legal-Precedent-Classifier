The act declares that no such application shall be given in evidence, nor shall such application be considered a part of the contract between the parties. The written application drops out of the case; the contract is verbal, so far as its terms are not set forth in the policy. In Imperial F. Ins. Co. v.

The case is to be considered as if no such paper existed.” If the paper has no existence, we see no reason why Robbins, the agent who took the insurance, should not name the beneficiary as given to him by the insured. This is not giving in evidence indirectly the contents of the written application, but the giving of a fact which existed before there could be a written application. The name of the beneficiary must have been agreed upon before it was noted in the written application.</p>

In a suit upon a policy, the beneficiary was often defeated by the production of a written application which contained statements for which the insured was not responsible, or which would have been corrected in the lifetime of the insured, had his attention been called to them by attaching a copy of the application to his policy. The defendant company continued to receive the premiums from Mrs. Cruilcshank, and if the defence now interposed is sustained, the result is a hardship little short of fraud, for the company received her money knowing all the while that it would make no return therefor. The company failed to comply with the requirements <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>of the act of 1881, and now sets up its own failure as a defence to the policy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[209,491,1167,912]]]'>Perhaps we were too liberal to the defendant. The plaintiff offered in evidence the application which was produced by the defendant company. It contained the name of William Legg. This offer was made for the purpose of showing the beneficiary named in the application. The parties to the contract referred to this paper to supply an omission; without this supply, the contract was meaningless. If we had sustained this offer we fail to see how the defendant company could have had any just cause of complaint. The act of 1881, which was passed in the interests of the insured, never contemplated that such an improper use would be made of it. The admission of the application for the sole purpose of supplying the name of the beneficiary, is demanded, in order that justice may bo done to both parties; it does no violence to the purpose of the act of 1881. If the company is to escape liability upon its policies under the present plea here interposed, then the act of assembly becomes a snare to entrap the ignorant and enrich the insurance companies.</p>

It was proved, however, that he was designated in the application as the beneficiary. It was not disputed that Annie Cruikshank was dead; that the policy was in force at the time of her death; nor that the proper proofs of her death had been made to the company. The case below turned upon a mere technicality; upon the sufficiency of the proof that William Legg was the beneficiary.</p>

L. 20, which provides that policies “ shall contain, or have attached to said policies, correct copies of the application, as signed by the applicant, and the by-laws referred to; and, unless so attached and accompanying the policy, no such application, constitution, or bylaws shall- be received in evidence in any controversy between <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>the parties to or interested in the said policy; nor shall such application or by-laws be considered a part of the policy or contract between such parties.”</p>

Musser, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20Pa.%20884" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="120 Pa. 884">120 Pa. 884</a>, we said, referring to the act of 1881, “ It is a wise and beneficent act, founded upon sound reasons of public policy.

    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[214,1050,1171,1172]]]'>The act of 1881 was evidently intended to impose a duty upon insurance companies, and to protect the insured. It had often happened that upon the trial of a case an insurance company would offer a by-law, or the application of the insured, in evidence, for the purpose of impaling the plaintiff upon some technical point. The application, when made, is filed with the company, and when the assured receives his policy he often puts it away, and in time forgets what he had stated in his application. The act of 1881 was passed to compel the company to attach the application to the policy, and upon its failure to do so it cannot be received in evidence. It will be noticed that, in each of the cases cited, the application was offered by the insurance company. This is the first instance, to <em>mj </em>knowledge, where a company has been heard to object to the admission of the application in evidence, when such offer came from the insured. To sustain such an objection on the part of tbe company, is to allow tbe latter to take advantage of its own neglect in not complying with tbe act of 1881. We therefore'think the court below erred in excluding this application. This appeal, however, is by the company, and, as the point was ruled in its favor, we would not have noticed it, but for its relation to the ruling of the court below to the offer of evidence contained in the second assignment.</p>

This testimony was not strictly regular, but the defendant company, having objected to and excluded the best evidence, cannot now be heard to complain that secondary evidence was received. Upon the whole, we think a correct result was reached, though not by the most direct path.</p>
