The two legacies of $100 and $200 respectively to the two sons, although payable when the mortgage should be paid, were not ordered to be paid out of its proceeds; and the mere fact of the postponement does not imply, the auditing judge thinks, that they were to come out of that fund.</p>

The note was signed by mark and was not witnessed.</p>

Morton was produced and swore that the decedent made her mark to the note in his presence, and that although he was called to witness it and could write, he did not sign his name as a witness. The man was evidently on terms of great intimacy with the preceding witness. He admitted that she held a policy of insurance on his life, in her own favor, whose amount he did not know, but the premiums on which Mrs. Lee herself paid. He also admitted that he was not indebted to her. Against this evidence, two witnesses declared that on the day of decedent’s death, the claimant came to the house, and, standing by the bed of his mother, said: “ Poor mother is gone, but thank God she owes nobody anything.” Mrs. Lee was then called to contradict these witnesses and she swore that John was not present wdiile those witnesses were in the house. She was in her turn contradicted by a third witness who testified that John <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>was present. John himself admitted the fact of his presence, but said that to the best of his knowledge and belief he did not say that his mother owed nothing. The memory of the claimant was not as unclouded as it might have been, on another point connected with the day of death. He knew that the body of his mother was carried down stairs that afternoon, but was uncertain whether he had’ or had not helped to carry it. He was, however, to use his own words, “ partly of the opinion ” that the undertaker and himself had borne it between them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-6" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[237,805,1173,1052]]]'>The co-executor declared that he and John McMahon had conversations in their capacity as executors, relative to the debts of decedent, among which was mentioned her debt of $150 to her daughter, Mrs. Lee, but that the claimant never alluded to the circumstance that he held a note against his mother. The witness also declared that the decedent had told him that she owed about $45 to John for groceries bought at his store, but that she never spoke of the note. Lee, the husband of the first named witness, went at one time to the office of the counsel for some of the children, and informed counsel that Morton, the alleged witness to the note, had been promised by John McMahon a push-cart and some money if he would testify to the execution of the note, and that John had mentioned the fact of this promise to Mrs. Lee. At the audit, Lee took the witness stand and admitted that he had made the statements in question to counsel, but that they were absolutely false. He assigned no motive for having made them, and described them as “ prevarications ” which were not made under oath. Unfortunately for the interest of students in casuistry, the witness was not prevailed upon to give his definition of what constitutes a “ lie.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[236,1875,1168,499]],["BL_203.1",203,[215,360,1159,399]]]'>It would not'be safe to allow a claim of this sort, upon this evidence. A promissory note signed by the mark of a person who could not read or write, and which might have been filled up as easily for thousands as hundreds of dollars, should at least be distinctly proved. The single witness to its execution did not subscribe his name, although he admitted he could write and had been summoned solely as a witness to the paper. The only proof of any consideration for the instrument was given by the daughter, who said she saw the payee give money two or three times to his mother, and who also said that the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>latter told her that she had settled with John and thanked God for it. But the witness was so flatly contradicted on other points, that even this evidence was comparatively worthless. Her own husband’s statement threw grave doubts upon her story, and although he unquestionably lied, it is impossible for the auditing judge to determine whether he lied in his statement to counsel, or in his subsequent retraction of the statement, when on the witness stand.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[213,770,1161,856]]]'>The note in suit was presented by the accountant, who, as executor, had control of the decedent’s papers. He offered it as an antagonist of the estate which he represented. Yet he did not show that this note had never left his own possession, nor that he did not find it among the decedent’s effects. In the latter case, of course the presumption would be, that the note had been paid. He was legally entitled to the note as executor, and he was therefore doubly bound to show that he had it by another and hostile title. At least he should have informed his co-executor of its existence; but the proof was that although the two men had conversations with each other in respect to the debts of the estate, he never mentioned this note. If anything else is needed to throw a doubt upon the honesty of his demand, it is found in the oaths of three witnesses, two of whom were apparently disinterested, that he had declared at the side of his mother’s corpse, that the decedent had died owing nothing. The claim is rejected.</p>
