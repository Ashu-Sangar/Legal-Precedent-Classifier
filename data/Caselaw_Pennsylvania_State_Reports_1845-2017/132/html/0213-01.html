On the contrary, the testimony was: 1. That there was an indebtedness of $900, for which the Butchers had a judgment. 2. That there was a sheriff’s sale, at which the plaintiff in execution bought and paid the purchase money. 3. That there was a rental of the premises by the purchaser to defendant’s son, -who paid rent. 4. That plaintiff, who occupied the premises, under the lease to his son, was dispossessed under a landlord and tenant proceeding. 5. That some years afterward the plaintiff paid the Butchers the amount of his indebtedness to them, as appeared by a statement of account in which he was given credit for the amount realized from the sale to O’Rourke. Upon these facts two nonsuits had been granted.</p>
