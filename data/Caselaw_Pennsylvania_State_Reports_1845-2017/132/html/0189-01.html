The defendant, however, testified that the transaction was one in which the loan was to be negotiated upon a note with a mortgage as collateral security. There was evidence given in behalf of the plaintiff that the ordinary commission for the negotiation of a loan upon a <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>mortgage, as he claims was the nature of this transaction, is one per cent. In fact, all the real-estate brokers examined as witnesses, with one exception, testified that one per cent is the usual rate of commission in such transactions; but the note-brokers called by the defendants testified that the ordinary rate of commission charged in a transaction based upon a note with a mortgage as collateral, is one quarter of one per cent. Mr. DeHavcu, a real-estate broker, was the exception to the other real-estate brokers examined, and he testified that the usuaL rate charged in a transaction, where a loan upon a mortgage on ground rents was negotiated, is one quarter of one per cent. The question as to the proper amount of commission the plaintiff was entitled to charge in this transaction, is therefore for your determination.</p>
