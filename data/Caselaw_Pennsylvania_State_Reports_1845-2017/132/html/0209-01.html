    <p class="summary" id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[276,739,1168,501]]]'>The action in this case is assumpsit, founded on a contract for the erection of the new or iron bridge over the Schuylkill river at Market street. The amount claimed to be due is $3,100, with interest from April 20, 1888. To this action an affidavit of defence was filed on behalf of the defendant, but, under protest and on denial of a legal requirement to file an affidavit of defence in an action of assumpsit brought against a municipal corporation, and only filed for greater caution, as stated on the argument, after notice that defendant failing to do so judgment would be taken.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.6",234,[276,1248,1170,1113]]]'>By the act of April 21, 1858, P. L. 387, municipal corporations were expressly exempted from the obligation which was imposed on other defendants, in certain cases, to file affidavits of defence. It is now contended, that in this respect the law has been changed by the act of May 25,1887, P. L. 271, which in the third section provides as follows : “ The statement shall be filed by the plaintiff or his attorney, and in the action of assumpsit, shall be replied to by affidavit.” In the fifth section it is provided, “ that in actions of assumpsit, judgment may be moved for the want of an affidavit of defence, or for want of a sufficient affidavit, .... in accordance with the present practice in actions of debt and assumpsit.” And in § 8 there is the further statement, that as to the actions recited in the section, it applies to procedure only, and the legal rights of the parties are not in any way to be affected thereby. It is clear that there is no express repeal of the act of April 21, 1858. If, therefore, it is no longer in force, such repeal is to be taken by implication from the general statement in the act of 1887, that actions of assumpsit shall be replied to by affidavit, and the further statements in the fifth and sixth sections, that for want of an affidavit, or of a sufficient affidavit, judgment may be granted.</p>

So far from this being the case, we think, in the absence of an express repeal, the policy of the law as established in 1858 and continued in unbroken practice down to the passage of the act of 1887, and as the defendant contends, to the present time, ought to be maintained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[237,723,1161,400]]]'>The act of 1858 was doubtless founded on the hardship of imposing on the agents of a municipality a duty, which was, in many cases, impossible, and often most difficult of performance. The want of personal knowledge, the difficulty in obtaining information from subordinates or higher agents of the local government, was in itself a sufficient reason for exempting the municipality from an obligation imposed on the individual suitor, under the affidavit of defence law.</p>

Whatever knowledge may be possessed must be that of an agent or representative of the municipality, and that often divided among two or more persons, no one of whom could make oath to all the existing facts necessary to make out a defence, and, in many instances, agents would be reluctant or unwilling to state actual knowledge, which would or might involve them in individual liability to the municipality.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a>

We think it does not. The fifth section declares, that the plaintiff may move for judgment for the whole or for a part of his claim, in accordance with the present practice in actions of debt and assumpsit. The practice in existence when the act of 1887 was passed did not allow judgments to be taken against municipalities for want of an affidavit of defence. Such was the legal right of municipal corporations when the act of 1887 went into operation, which in its eighth section declares, that the legal rights of the party are not in any way to be affected thereby.</p>

To take from a municipal corporation the right which it then possessed, and to place it on the same footing with an individual suitor is to affect, and to affect injuriously, the right of such a defendant.</p>
