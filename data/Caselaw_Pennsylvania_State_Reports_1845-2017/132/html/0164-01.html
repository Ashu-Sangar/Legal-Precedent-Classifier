Testator bequeathed to the guardian of his daughter Ida and his son Samuel, two sums of $1,000 “ to be expended by the said guardian, in her discretion, in the education” of his said daughter and son. He appointed his wife as their guardian.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b190-7" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[245,974,1171,499]]]'>But we do not think either position tenable. The primary intention of testator, no doubt, was to provide a fund for the education of his children, to be expended for that purpose by their mother, their guardian, at her discretion. If he had died in their minority, there can be no doubt she would have been entitled to receive the legacies, either in her own right, absolutely, or as guardian for her minor children. She and they were the only parties interested, the remaining children having no interest therein. And as to this we do not think there can be any doubt.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b190-8" data-blocks='[["BL_190.6",190,[244,1482,1167,388]]]'>The case is the same, now that testator survived the minority of his children. The legacy is not direct to the children, but to their guardian, and is payable either to her or to them individually. But all difficulty upon this point is removed by the agreement of the widow, that the legacies be awarded immediately to her children. They are the only parties in interest, and we cannot conceive that the other residuary legatees are at all concerned.</p>
