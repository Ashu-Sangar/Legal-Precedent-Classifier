Witnesses are not instructed as to that, and probably do not know it, and their opinion is more valuable when it is directed to the question of what they think of the soundness of mind of the person, than when they express an opinion as to whether she had mind enough to make a will. Now, it is alleged by the plaintiffs that Catharine Newhard, owing to disease and old age had lost the mental faculties necessary to make a will. It is alleged that she at one time had a perfect mind and good sense,'but that owing to disease and growing age slio lost her mind in part. It has been testified, and is no doubt true, that about 1872 she had a severe attack of typhoid fever, and that in J uly, 1881, she fell down outside of the house and was unconscious, and that she was sick from that time on for some time, and possibly had other attacks of sickness while she was at Newhard’s; and also that she was sick while at Yundt’s, both before and after the will was made.

It is assumed by the plaintiffs, that as there is no evidence from which you could find that these charges were true, that they were unfounded; and it is said that Catharine, on various occasions after she had made these accusations, admitted that they were not true and asked for forgiveness. From this it is argued that you can find that her mind was impaired, that she took a wrong view of things and had delusions. It is also alleged, that she . became irritable towards <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>the last when she was at Newhard’s, and was unreasonable; that she spoke a great deal to herself, both at night, in bed, and during the day time, saying various things and among others that her money was being stolen; that she had in her sounder years been of cleanly habits, and she afterwards became filthy, and she could not control the discharges from her bowels on various occasions, and was careless in that regard and behaved peculiarly; that on one or more occasions she left her room undressed and came down stairs and thought she was dressed; and in various ways it is claimed that it has been shown that her mind had given way and that she had not the mind neóessary to make a will; that she could not form an idea of her possessions and of the natural recipients of her bounty, and could not do other things which, according to the rules of law, are necessary to enable one to make a will.

It appears he paid her the interest every year, about the latter part of March; it fell due about the first of April, and I suppose, from what has been said in this case by Nathan Eberhart and others, that there is no question but that he dealt honestly with her and that she knew that. [It has been testified that on one occasion after Nathan Eberhart had paid her interest that she found fault with him, alleged something wrong about the interest, I believe, at least said he was a rascal or a rogue, and it is claimed by the plaintiffs that this was a mistake and it was not true, and this, among other circumstances, is relied upon to show that she had lost her mind in part.] 3</p>

She was at Yundt’s from May, 1882, until June, 1887, when she died, nearly five years. Many witnesses have been called who have testified as to her <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>condition there. Some persons told us that they had had opportunities of observing much of her at that place, and Mrs. Yundt and Henry M. Yundt, of course, observed much of her and probably saw nearly all she did, or heard a good deal of what she said in her waking hours. Mrs. Yundt has given us a description of Catharine’s condition, and Mrs. Yundt, Sr., it seems, knew a good deal about her for a number of years, and she has told us what she knows. And Mrs. Troxell, the sister-in-law of Mr. Yundt, and certain young men, who lived in the family of Mr. Yundt as servants, have told us a good deal about what they observed of her. Then there are a number of persons, who saw her occasionally, some of them often, and they have all told us that she was old and feeble; as a consequence of that, her eye-siglit was dim, and they have detailed a number of circumstances, showing, in the estimation of the defendant, that she had the ordinary sense and judgment and memory which people have, especially of her years, who are still of sound mind, and have all expressed opinions that she was of sound mind in 1884, and even all the way down to the time of her death.....</p>

That is, a full and intelligent understanding that she was about disposing of her property by her last will; that she knew what property she had; that she understood what she intended to do with it, how to dispose of it by her will and to what persons, and had a knowledge of the persons she intended should have it; that she was able to choose and decide with understanding and reason as to whether she would dispose of it in one way or the other; practically, whether she would give it to Henry M. Yundt or whether she would give it to her brothers and sisters and relatives, or some of them. Had she mind, memory and understanding to that degree ?

There is, according to my mind, a contradiction between the witnesses Avho testified for the plaintiffs as to Catharine Newhard’s condition while she was at Newhard’s up to May, 1882, and those who testified for the defendant as to her mental condition afterwards. [Speaking in a general way, it is probable that you might conclude that, from what the plaintiffs had shown of her condition at Newhard’s, she was not of sound mind and had not sufficient mind to make a will;] 3 and it is probable that you would say from the defendant’s testimony of her condition while at Yundt’s, that she was perfectly capable to make a will, and that there is hardly a question of her mental capacity. Now this contradiction exists. Whether it is owing to the fact that certain witnesses who know better do not want to tell the truth, either from prejudice or self interest, on the one side or the other, or whether owing to prejudice and sympathy they have suffered their testimony to be warped so that they do not tell the truth; how this is, it is not for me to say, and I do not know, but it strikes me that this contradiction exists.</p>

There is such a thing undoubtedly, as a person being of unsound mind, and even insane, and afterwards becoming restored. It might be that a person of 1881 and 1882 had been of unsound mind, even a raving maniac if you please, and in 1884, he or she might have been perfectly sane and able to make a contract and make a will. Was it the case with Catharine Newhard? Did she improve so that you could reasonably and justly decide and infer that she was of weak mind in 1881 and 1882, and in 1884 her condition was improved and she was sane and had mind sufficient to make a will ?

You are to consider him the same as any other witness, as to whether in your estimation he tells the truth, whether he is willing to say precisely what he remembers and believes, or whether he is an adherent of one side or the other; and also as to whether you believe that he knows what he testifies about. Is Dr. Thomas T. Martin, in your estimation, a skilful and experienced physician; is he a truthful man; is he fair and disinterested in his testimony? I see no reason why you should not assent to all that; I see no reasop, why you should suspect his knowledge or his recollection as to whether he testifies to things positively, or that he is prejudiced one way or the other. But it is not for the court to decide whether a witness is to be credited or not, or what weight is to be attached to his testimony. But is it not true, gentlemen of the jury, that if his testimoiry is reliable that then we have the fact that Catharine Newhard, about 1881 or before, had an attack of softening of the brain ? Then is it not true, as the doctor says,'that softening of the brain is incurable and the longer it progresses the worse it grows ; and is it not true that she died of that in 1887 ? He so testifies. If that is so, and if it is true, as Dr. Martin testified and as Dr. Herbst who knew nothing of this old lady but who gave his opinion as physician and an expert, testified, that softening of the brain affects the mind, reason and probably the judgment and the memory, then what weight are you to attach to the testimony of Dr. Thomas T. Martin? Would that then show that in 1884, when she made the will, more than two years after she went to Yundt’s, that she was better than she had been while at hi ewhard’s ? Would it tend to lead you to believe that the witnesses who testified to her condition in 1884 and while she was at Yundt’s, perhaps were mistaken or did not tell the truth; or, on the other hand, would you disbelieve the witnesses who testified to her weak condition mentally while she was at Newhard’s ? Was this woman afflicted with softening of the brain ? Did it commence about 1881, at the time she had the apoplectic stroke, so called ? Dr. Martin said that that was so, and that it continued down to the time of her death; that it was an incurable disease and grew worse. Is that so, in your estimation ? If it is, then it is probably true that generally speaking the descrip<a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>fcion of her mental condition, her weak mental condition at Newhard’s, was also true, as the witnesses testified to. And then it might be the fact that her condition, in point of mental capacity, was not quite as good, not quite as strong, as some witnesses say it was after she was at Yundt’s in 1884, and on down to her death. Some witnesses, while the old lady was at Newhard’s and while she was at Yundt’s, observed her from day to day and no douht almost every day. For instance, Mrs. Newhard; possibly the girl, the adopted daughter, who was in the house the last few years she was there; Mrs. Yundt, while she was at Yundt’s; and possibly some other witnesses, and of them of course it cannot be said that they had no chance of observing her. The attending physician who attended her on so many occasions, as he has stated, from 1881 down to 1887, was also, to a great extent, conversant with her condition. He saw her on many occasions. His mission was to attend to her physical health; but, I suppose, it is true, that while a doctor is diagnosing the disease of a patient with a view of affording him relief and assistance in a physical way, that he'also observes the state of mind of the patient, at least to some extent; he naturally talks with his patient, listens to his statements of his ailments and complaints, and that experience it seems Dr. Martin had, and he expresses the opinion that she was of unsound mind. That opinion, of course, jrou are to regard according to the same rule as the opinion of any other witness who is not a physician; that is, you are to give it much or little weight in proportion to the opportunities, many or few, that he had of seeing and knowing this person, and then the soundness or unsoundness of his judgment in forming an opinion. But I repeat, that if the testimony of Dr. Martin is fully credited by you, in my opinion it has a strong influence upon this case, and furnishes one method, possibly, of deciding which statements relative to the mental condition of this old lady are to be given most credit.] 4</p>

When a person makes his or her will, that will take effect only on the death of the maker or testator; and any time after the will has been signed a person who makes a will can recall it and tear it into pieces, throw it into the lire, and can make another will, and the last will govern. He has entire control of the will and entire control of the property he disposes of by the will. He can give to one person to-day and if he changes his mind next week he can give to another, and no one can say nay. So, [Catharine Newhard, so far as she by her will gave all her property to Henry M. Yundt, had the power to change the provision. But it seems she did more than that; it seems as to the bulk of her estate she gave it up to Henry M. Yundt at the time she made the will, or before. The bond which Henry made recited that she delivered up to him his note for $1,540; that she had assigned to him the note of Nathan Eberhart for $2,000, and that assignment made it his property. So, at least $8,500 of her property was given to him before and on that occasion. The object evidently was that she would be maintained by Henry as long as she lived.</p>

Would Catharine Newhard, at the time you first knew of her and when she was undoubtedly of sound mind, say in 1869, or 1870, have made an arrangement of this kind?] 5 It may be that she would not have done so, and she might still do so in 1884. She may have grown more liberal or she may have been satisfied with Henry Yundt’s personal obligation, and then the transaction would bear nothing conspicuous about it.

Maxwell, <a href="/pa/81/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="81 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="1044108" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0139-01">81 Pa. 139</a>. There are no misstatements of the evidence, as there were in that case, nor were deductions and theories drawn unsupported by the evidence, and which should have been left to the jury; nor were there any such expressions of opinion upon the facts as would amount to error, under the authority of Ditmars v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/47/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="47 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="485594" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0335-01">47 Pa. 335</a>, where it was held that it is often proper for the court to express an opinion upon the facts, provided care is taken not to infringe the province of the jury. In referring to the testimony, and to the names of the witnesses by whom it is given, much latitude must necessarily be allowed in <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>a charge, and where there is nothing in it that is unfair, or misleading, or that withdraws the facts from the jury, we cannot reverse. We are not prepared to say that either of these defects appears in this charge. If it can be said to lean somewhat towards the plaintiffs, it may be due to the strength of their case.</p>

The witness, Eli Diehl, had testified to sufficient facts to render him competent to give his opinion of his testator’s testamentary capacity. The value of his testimony was another matter, and of that the jury were the proper judges.</p>
