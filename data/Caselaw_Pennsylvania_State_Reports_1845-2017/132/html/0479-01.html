In one of these, written in November, 1876, it was said: “The outlook for business in 1877, is very gloomy. We have never known a more difficult time for investment of trust funds in our care. Philadelphia 6’s sold yesterday at 115, and this, with its enormous debt. Taxes must of necessity be increased. After a careful survey of the situation, my directors have decided that the securities which will shrink the least and are the safest and best to buy are United States 5-20’s of 1868, and, failing that, of 1867, which are not payable until 1887 or 1888 ; and, although at the option of the government until then, we think the 6’s due in 1881 will be paid first.

The views of capitalists on this subject appear from a letter written by Mr. Smyth to his French client, January 24, 1879, in which it was said: “The taking of the United States 4 per cent loan is without precedent; and now the new syndicate, Rothschilds, Seligman, <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>Morgan, Morton &amp; Co., are to take the rest and place it in Europe, and thus the treasury can pay off in this year the 67’s, 68’s, and 10-40’s.

Common prudence and common skill are all that is demanded; and if these are exercised, a loss arising must be borne by the estate which the testator, who is supposed to have contemplated such risks, has thought proper to confide to his care. The difficulty of procuring investments proper for trust funds, as our daily experience in this court has taught us, has been very great for a long period of years, and when this investment was made, there seemed to be nothing so well suited for the purposes of the estate, jdelding as it did the largest income for the tenant for life, affording, as supposed, perfect security to those ultimately entitled to the principal, and at the same time being in a shape which permitted conversion for distribution, the moment the life estate terminated.

Yerba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei. The acts of assembly provide for the investment of trust funds in government, state or municipal loans; and, as no inquiry is required with regard to the security thus accredited, an application, which would have been granted as of course, would have been purely a matter of form, productive only of expense to the estate. That the authority would have been granted by the court, is shown by the fact <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>that two years later, after the investment of February, 1877, had been paid off, leave was granted to invest in the 5 per cent government loan. This was on July 19, 1879, and the investment of July 27th of that year, was in pursuance of it. The application thus made was not because of any provision in the will of the testatrix, but simply because of the reasons set forth in the petition; numerous others of the same character having been presented and allowed with regard to other estates where there was no will suggesting or requiring the approval of the court.

Under these circumstances, therefore, after much anxious investigation and reflection, your petitioners are of the opinion that the best possible mode of investing trust moneys, or a considerable portion thereof, at the present, is by purchasing the 5 and 6 per cent loans of 1881, provided the purchase can be so arranged as to apportion the income justly.</p>
