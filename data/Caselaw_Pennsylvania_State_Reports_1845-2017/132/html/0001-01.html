Bricker took a seat in a passenger car of defendant's train from Reading to Pottsville, by the way of Port Clinton. At Port Clinton he left that train to take the defendant’s train thence to Tamaqua, the latter train consisting of an engine and tender, a baggage car, a combined mail and express car, and two or more passenger cars, in the order named. He had been suffering with cholera morbus, before leaving Reading, and while en route from that place to Port Clinton. At Port Clinton, just before the starting of the train for Tamaqua, he went to the side door of the mail and express car, the second car of the train, and had a conversation with Mr. Decker, the railway postal clerk; he then went into the mail car, and, having seated himself, Mr. Decker -gave him some medicine. He was apparently in pain. He was given a second dose, and two or three minutes afterward a collision occurred, in which he received injuries resulting in his death.</p>

The mail compartment was in the forward part of the combined car, and the rear part of that car was so obstructed by express matter that it was not possible to pass to the passenger cars in the rear, without alighting on the platform from the forward part of the combined car. No conductor or train hand directed Mr. Bricker to leave the combined car.. No notice on behalf of the railroad company was posted, but there was posted in the mail compartment a notice in large type issued by the Post-office Department, in the following words :</p>

      <em>seager on </em>its train from Port Clinton to Tamaqaa. He entered a car which he knew was not provided for the transportation of passengers. He was on the train without the knowledge or consent of the company, .and in a place where its employees in the discharge of their ordinary duties would not discover him. It was a place devoted exclusively to the railway mail service, and in charge of one of its employees. He was confronted by an order of the superintendent of that service, forbidding him to remain there. He was not there for any purpose which related to a duty of the company in the transportation of its passengers or their baggage.</p>
    <p id="b28-6" data-blocks='[["BL_28.4",28,[285,960,1177,1063]]]'>Upon these undisputed facts appearing in the plaintiff's evidence, no contract for safe carriage existed between the company and the deceased. A passenger, in the legal sense of the word, is “ one who travels in some public conveyance, by virtue of a contract, express or implied, with the carrier, as the payment of fare or that which is accepted as an equivalent therefor: ” Penna. R. Co. v. Price, <a href="/pa/96/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="96 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="494624" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0256-01">96 Pa. 256</a>. In Wharton on Negligence, § 354, the undertaking of the carrier is thus defined : “ A carrier, in undertaking to carry passengers safely, undertakes to carry them safely if they place themselves under his direction in particular places prescribed for the purpose; and he will not be held liable for damages accruing to an interloper, who, unnoticed by him, hides in the crevices of a locomotive, or in the hold of a ship. In Patterson’s Ry. Acc. Law, § 214, it is stated, “ that the existence of the relation of carrier and passenger is dependent upon the making of a contract of carriage. From this it follows that railways are not liable to persons who have not been accepted as passengers, and the intention of tire person to pay his fare and his good faith are immaterial, where there has been no contract, express or implied, on the part of the railway.”</p>
    <p id="b28-7" data-blocks='[["BL_28.5",28,[283,2030,1173,401]]]'>These quotations from standard text-books correctly state the law on the subject to which they refer. As Bricker was not a passenger, and was on the train without the consent, express or implied, of the company, it owed him no duty, and the nonsuit was rightly ordered. In this view of the case, it is unnecessary to consider whether, if he had been accepted as a passenger, he was guilty of negligence which contributed to the injury he received, and which caused his death.</p>
