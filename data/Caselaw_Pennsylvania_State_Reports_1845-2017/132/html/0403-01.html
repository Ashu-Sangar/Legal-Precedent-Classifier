We have carefully considered the position taken by the plaintiffs’ counsel at the re-argument, that we may require the defendant corporation to produce the required writings, even though a natural person in a like case could not be called upon for their production. We are not able to agree with the reasoning. We think the rules of evidence and the rules of law for the production of writings, are essentially the same whether the defendant is a natural or an artificial person. But since the amendment to the plaintiffs’ statement filed September 13, 1886, we think they are entitled to have produced such papers and writings described in their petition as will <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>show, or tend to show, unjust discrimination by the defendant against the plaintiffs prior to the passage of the act of Juno 4, 1883, P.

It seems clear that, prior to the passage of this act, the defendant at most would only be liable to the plaintiffs for so much money, with interest thereon, as had been obtained in such manner that the law would stamp it as money had and received for the use and benefit of the plaintiffs. In ordering the production of writings which may aid the plaintiffs in proving their claim for money had and received for their use by the defendant, prior to the act of June 4, 1883, supra, it cannot be said that we are aiding in the enforcement of the penalty under said act.</p>
