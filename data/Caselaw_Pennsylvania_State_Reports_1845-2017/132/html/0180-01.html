In both of those cases this measure seems to have been accepted, without question, as the proper rule; at least, it escaped objection. We are also obliged to say that it seems to have ancient precedent in its favor. Indeed all the proceedings in this case have a musty flavor, and can only be sustained by reverting to the statutes and decisions of a time when the creditor, who could not collect his debt, was given the cruel alternative satisfaction of being allowed to imprison a,t will the person of his debtor. The law gave the body to soothe the avarice the debtor had not money to appease. Such a ghastly principle is the marrow of this plaintiff’s case. However, as we have no power to make, but only to declare the law, we are reluctantly obliged to decide that since the inspectors allowed the debtor to escape, and thus deprived the plaintiff of his “pound of flesh,” they must pay him the full amount of his debt.

There being no statutory responsibility upon the inspectors for an escape, they can in any event be held responsible only for a breach of duty which the law by implication places upon them.
