It is undoubtedly the fact that a change of grade was contemplated by ordinance approved July 3,1885; and it was in anticipation of that change of grade that this contract was made. Now, if the grade had never been changed, Mrs. Clements could not compel Mr. Ellis to raise her house <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>up, but as Mr. Ellis went on under the contract, and did commence to raise the house, he and his sureties are responsible, under the contract, for all damages done in case any were done.

Has he complied with his contract to put the building in good condition ? Has he indemnified her against damage ? In other words, has he given her property back to her without damage ? All these are matters for you. [I say to you that the-important part of this case, to which I now come, is that which relates to the sum claimed, of $150 per week. I do not say to you for what period of time or what space of time that was to be paid. It is something which the contract itself does not mention. Counsel themselves have not alluded to it. I have read the contract with considerable care, for the purpose of seeing whether there was anything in it to fix the time when the payment of the $150 stopped. If you take the contract itself for a guide, it would never stop. He agrees to pay her the further sum of $150 per week for each and every week after the expiration of thirty days from the date of the delivery of the property to him. When did it stop ? It nowhere appears upon that contract when it is to stop. This furnishes, therefore, what we call in law a latent or hidden ambiguity. It is not a matter which I can decide for you. It is a matter for you to decide. What was the intention of the parties in this respect? Was he to pay her $150 a week permanently and forever ? That would not be reasonable. Then, when was it to stop? Was it to stop from the time, as the plaintiff says, when they gave possession to her? Well, that might not be reasonable either..

In other words, I do not think —though it is a question for you to say, and I will leave it to <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>you to say^ — I do not think that the company was bound to go to her at any particular time and say, “ There is your house, Mrs. Clements, and that stops our $150 a week; ” but I do think that the reasonable meaning of the parties was, or that the construction of this agreement is, that $150 a week was to be paid during such time, after thirty days, as Ellis kept her out. Now, how long was that?..... I think it would be well then for you to inquire, as an important element in this case, when it was that this house was raised and finished to a proper state to permit her to resume possession of the property, and to allow her for such time as she was kept out by the act of Mr. Ellis, or his agents or workmen.....</p>

How long she was kept out by reason of this contract being uncompleted, is a question for you.

It would be an affectation of learning to cite all the cases in which this subject has been considered in this state and elsewhere. The result of them is, that, like a will, each one of them depends upon the language and circumstances surrounding it: Moore v. Colt, <a href="/pa/127/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="127 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="565726" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0289-01">127 Pa. 289</a>. A careful examination of all the reported cases in Pennsylvania, as well as those elsewhere decided, will show that the governing principle is, “ that where the parties liquidated their damages for a failure to perform by the plain words of their contract, equity will not relieve by turning it into a penalty: ” Westerman v.

Williams, <a href="/pa/48/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="48 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="422223" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0450-01">48 Pa. 450</a>; Mathews v.

The intention of the parties has much to do with it. Yet even that will be controlled where equity demands it. A sum expressly stipulated as liquidated damages will be relieved from if it is obviously to secure a sum capable of being compensated by interest. It is difficult <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>to lay down a general rule applicable to such cases, for the reason that each case as it arises is to be determined by its own peculiar facts, more than by a rule of general application. The nearest approach to a rule upon this subject is to be found in Streeper v. Williams, <a href="/pa/48/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="48 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="422223" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0450-01">supra,</a> where it was said by Mr. Justice Agstev : “ Upon the whole, the only general observation we can make is, that in each case we must look at the language of the contract, the intention of the parties as gathered from all its provisions, the subject of the contract, and its surroundings, the ease or difficulty of measuring the breach in damages, and the sum stipulated, and from the whole gather the view which good conscience and equity ought to take of the case.” And I will supplement these well-considered remarks by saying that where the damages are unconscionable, and grossly disproportioned to the injury sustained, equity will generally relieve therefrom by treating the sum as a penalty, for the reason that the parties to the contract probably regarded it as such when the contract was made.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[187,1294,1176,1065]]]'>It remains to apply these principles to the facts of this case. In the contract between the plaintiffs and Ellis, by which the latter agreed to raise the house No. 2503 Hamilton street, the damages for the delay are not designated either as a penalty or as liquidated damages, but the said Ellis is to pay $150 per' week “ for each and every week after the expiration of thirty days from the date of the delivery of the property to the party of the first part,” (Ellis.) The work was not completed within the thirty days. The evidence is not clear as to the exact extent of the delay, but the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for $4,400. The learned judge below was requested by the defendants’ second point to instruct the jury as follows: “ The weekly amounts named in the contract in case of delay in the completion of the work, upon Avhich the plaintiffs rely for a verdict, are to be considered as a penalty, and not liquidated damages. The jury, therefore, cannot in any event allow any larger sum as damages for delay than that sum which will repay for actual losses proved by the plaintiffs due to such delaju” The learned judge refused this point, and instructed the jury that the sum named Avas to be treated as liquidated damages. The jury allowed $150 per week for the delay.</p>

It would be an insult to the intelligence of the parties to suppose they ever contemplated such a result when they entered into the contract. The damages for the delay were easily ascertainable. They could be fixed approximately by the rental value of the property. When it is difficult or impossible to ascertain the damages by any fixed rule, for the breach of a contract, there is a reason why the parties should liquidate them in advance, and why the courts should hold them to such liquidation. But when the damages can be assessed almost as easily and as accurately as in the case of a bond for the payment of money, and they are fixed by the contract itself at an unconscionable sum, it is the plain duty of a court exercising equity powers to relieve against such injustice, and treat the sum named as a penalty merely. This does the plaintiffs no injustice. Upon another trial they will be entitled to recover for any loss they can show they have sustained. But it is not likely they will recover §1,000 in excess of the full value of their house.</p>
    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[245,1439,1170,404]]]'>This disposes of the controlling point in the case. As it must go back for re-trial, however, it is proper to say that the change of grade referred to in the twelfth assignment possesses little significance. The contract was to raise the house to the grade of the city, as provided by the ordinance approved July 3, 1885, and the contract would have been fulfilled by conforming to that grade, notwithstanding a subsequent change of the grade by the city.</p>
