    <p class="summary" id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[192,490,1166,452]]]'>The allegation of the bank is, that at the time the note was discounted, there was an agreement between the bank and Mr. Sieger, that Sieger should not only be liable upon the note according to its terms, that is, conditionally liable, but that he should be absolutely bound, and that he alone should be looked to for payment. The bank’s position is that what they have proved in this regard dispenses with the necessity of notice when the note fell due, and that Sieger was liable without any notice of dishonor, and without notice of protest.</p>

N o notice is necessary, because he himself promised to pay absolutely, which implies that he promises to pay without notice.</p>

The allegation is, that Mr. Stabler, the cashier of the bank, told Mr. Sieger at the bank, and that Mr. Keck and Mr. Roeder, other officers of the bank, were present, that the note would be discounted, on condition that he, <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>Sieger, would assume to pay the note when it came due, if it was not paid before by Stettler or Snyder; that if he would assume to pay it without further trouble, then the bank would discount it for him; and that he agreed to it; that he said that this was all right. Mr. Stahler further says that he told Sieger that the board thought that neither of the other parties would pay the note when it came due, and that they did not want to be bothered with it; and unless he would make that promise, it would not be discounted, but under those conditions they would discount it, and that then Sieger said that he would do that. The testimony of Mr. Keck and Mr. Roeder on this point is substantially to the same effect; not perhaps in the same words, but the defendant alleges that it is to the same effect, and it seems to be.]6</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b334-6" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[261,1111,1173,347]]]'>On this point, as I recollect the testimony, and it is not written out, and I do not pretend to remember all that was said by the witnesses, but according to my recollection Mr. Sieger denies that there was such a conversation. As I recollect, he was asked whether, after the meeting of the board respecting this note, he had been at the bank, and he said he was not, and that he sent the note over by one of his sons.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[257,1467,1174,911]]]'>Under this testimony, bearing- ujdou this point, as to whether there was that promise, has the bank proved that Sieger agreed to pay the note absolutely at the time it fell due, without regard to Stettler or Snyder, provided the bank would discount it, unless Stettler or Snyder would voluntary pay it before it fell due ? Is that proved ? I say to you, that a contract of that kind, set up by the holder of a note, must be distinctly proved before the holder can have the benefit of it, and hold an indorser liable absolutely. It must be distinctly proved. There ought to be no doubt in the mind of the jury that the witnesses tell the truth, and that what they say occurred amounted to an agreement and understanding between the holder and the indorser, that when the note falls due the indorser will be absolutely bound; that he will pay it without regard to the maker, and that he is not to have notice of protest, as his obligation on the note would purport. If that is not distinctly proved, then there would be no absolute liability; but if it is distinctly proved, then the indorser .is liable absolutely.</p>

Then he was not liable to pay the note to the bank, unless the note was protested and he had notice thereof. The note was made payable at the Allentown N. Bank. In order to hold Mr. Sieger, it was necessary that payment should have been demanded of the maker, and demand at the Allentown Bank was sufficient, and if it was not met, that then the indorser, Mr. Sieger, should have notice of such failure to pay the note at the time it fell due, which was on January 21, 1885.....</p>
